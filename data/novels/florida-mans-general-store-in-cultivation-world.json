      "content": "﻿Chapter 1 – Florida Man Gets Isekaied, Pollutes New World\n\"50,000 years already. Time really flies.\"\nTampa, Florida, the iconic city of an ancient civilization had become a decayed town. High-rise buildings turned into rubbles. Beautiful white sands in the past were replaced with contaminated white ash. Rusty cars with melted tires no longer had an owner and were covered in radiated snow. The thick white clouds in the sky were not rain clouds but ash, blocking the sunlight and the warmth of nature. The temperature was so cold that the green sea was frozen solid.\nDespite the harsh nature of the nuclear winter, a lone elderly Caucasian man stood there, gazing at the beach and reminiscing about the past glory of mankind.\nLeo was 6'3 and toned. However, his pale withered skin, messy white full beard, and long gray hair had never touched water for the past 50,000 years. Even his ragged and dusty makeshift clothes were over 1,000 years old.\nHe was the last survivor on Earth, but he was no longer a human. Leo was a 50,000-year-old immortal mutant.\nLeo walked toward the frozen sea. He lightly stomped it and caused a huge crack. Then, he picked up a shard of contaminated ice and put it in his mouth. It tasted like burnt plastic, but Leo nonchalantly chewed and swallowed it.\nDING\n<You are immune to radiation.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan cannot be increased any further.>\n<Your current lifespan: 2,147,483,647 years, 11 months, 23 days, 23 hours, and 59 minutes.>\nLeo bitterly smiled at the floating blue screen in front of him, projected from the clear golden ring that he had picked up from an alien spaceship when he was a human. He deeply sighed.\n\"What's the point of having an infinite lifespan in this decayed world? It's not like I'm going to sit here for zillion years and wait for the Sun to swallow Earth.\"\nThe system was a curse to Leo. He could not die as long as his lifespan was higher than one. Every time he committed suicide, his body automatically regenerated and self-resurrected.\nSCREECH!\nA disfigured giant spider broke the layers of the frozen ocean and pounced on Leo. The latter glanced at the spider and raised his left arm, letting it bite him.\nThe spider gnawed Leo's forearm while the latter dully stared at it. A few seconds later, the mutated giant spider screeched and let go of Leo.\nThe monster's mouth foamed and collapsed on the ground, dead.\nLeo patted his arm. His wounds were instantly healed, and no scar was left on his skin. Unfortunately, his withered skin could not be smoothened.\n\"Haiz. So boring,\"\nLeo continued gazing at the desolated frozen sea and complained.\nKWAAAAAAA!\nAnother monster emerged. This time, a 50-meter-tall green Godzilla broke out of the sea and charged toward Leo. It raised his large foot and stomped him.\nLeo dully stared at the incoming monster. He calmly jabbed with a light punch.\nLeo's fist and Godzilla's foot collided!\nBOOM\nThe punch created a massive hole in the monster's foot and punctured through its knee and body. Leo briefly glanced at the sky through the hole in the monster's body and looked away.\nThe Godzilla fell back to the sea. It stopped moving, dead.\n\"Goodbye, big guy. I will never eat you again. I'm leaving this world for good!\"\nAfter getting rid of the Godzilla, Leo shifted his attention to the system menu in front of him. He touched the floating blue screen and swiped it. He pressed a tab in the menu.\n[Lifespan Shop]\nAn online shopping menu popped up next to the original screen. Leo shifted his attention to the new window and changed the sorting menu in the top right corner.\n[Sorting]: [Price from the Highest to Lowest]\nThe menu was refreshed and the items on the shopping screen showed an image of a green planet. It came with a description.\n[Transmigration to Random Planet]\n[Price: 2,147,483,647 Years of Lifespan]\nLeo bitterly smiled. The item required all of his lifespans to purchase, yet he put the item in the cart anyway.\n\"With this, I can finally go somewhere else. Goodbye, world.\"\nHe confirmed the purchase and paid the price.\nDING\n<You have purchased the transmigration ticket to a random planet.>\n<Your current lifespan: 11 months, 23 days, 23 hours, and 57 minutes.>\n<The transmigration will begin in one minute. Please be prepared.>\nLeo bitterly smiled as he still have something left in the tank. A year was enough for him to regain his lifespan back.\nHe stomped the frozen sea again. Then, he picked up as many ice shards and started eating.\nDING\n<You are immune to radiation.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\nWithin a minute, Leo managed to eat three mouthfuls of ice shards. However, the freebie time ran out. His body slowly dissipated into dust.\n.\n.\n*CHIRP*\nLeo slowly opened his eyes, awakening from his deep slumber because of the nostalgic chirping noises of wild birds. He was greeted by the ray of sunlight and the greenish scent of wild grasses.\n\"Sunlight… birds?\"\nHe jolted and sat up. Then, he looked around.\nUpon discovering that he was no longer on the nuclear winter planet, Leo shed tears of joy. He prostrated and kissed the ground. Then, he stood up and embraced the nearest pine tree.\n\"LIFE! THERE IS LIFE!\"\nHe hadn't realized yet that everything he touched blackened, and he was naked. Leo ran around in the unknown woods, chasing after birds, insects, rabbits, and wild rats. Then, he accidentally stepped on a rattlesnake.\nSHAAA!\nIt bit his ankle! Leo sensed the pricking pain from his left ankle. He looked down and found the angry rattlesnake, whose fangs failed to cut into his skin.\n\"Oh, silly you. You shouldn't have done that. My blood, skin, and flesh are kinda… toxic. No one survived after biting me.\"\nIt was too late for the snake. Its color suddenly darkened, and it swelled. The long smooth body instantly became disfigured.\nBOOM\nIt exploded, scattering black flesh and blood everywhere. On the other hand, Leo crouched and scratched his ankle as the venom irritated his skin.\nThe scattered meat swelled and grew bigger. The grasses and soil that got contact with the snake's blood and flesh also turned black. As if the polluted soil and grasses were contagious, the surrounding plants darkened.\nFortunately, the spread stopped after a minute. Some of the grasses turned blue and contained the spread to a limited area.\nLeo was relieved. His heart skipped a beat for a moment when the contaminated blood of the snake killed the surrounding plants.\n'That was close. I should be more careful.'\nLeo picked up the meat and uprooted the contaminated plants. He put them in his mouth and slowly ate them raw.\nDING\n<You are immune to radiation.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased...>\nLeo ate everything that had the potential to spread the contamination. Tree branches, roots, black meat, dead leaves, and worms in the soil were no exception.\n.\n.\nAn hour later, Leo finished his first meal. All contaminated plants and mutated snake's flesh were gone, except the black soil.\nHe rechecked his current status.\n<Your current lifespan: 49 years, 11 months, 23 days, 21 hours, and 48 minutes.>\nLeo was relieved. His lifespan rebounded a bit, and it was enough to purchase some daily necessities.\nHe opened the shop menu and checked the online grocery store.\n[T-Shirt] – One Year of Lifespan\n[Jeans] – One Year of Lifespan\n[Sneakers] – Two Years of Lifespan\n[Brief Boxer] – One Year of Lifespan\n[A Pair of Socks] – One Year of Lifespan\nLeo bitterly smiled. The modern good that he could easily get 50,000 years ago cost him six years of lifespan. His total balance dropped to 43 after he pressed the checkout button.\nWHOOSH\nA cardboard box manifested out of nothingness. Leo opened it and found the items that he had ordered earlier. He put them on to maintain his decencies. As for the used cardboard box, it vanished after the items inside had been taken.\nAfter getting his clothes, Leo thought of the days he spent trying to collect the zillion lifespan for this transmigration. He shed a tear of joy.\n\"No more frugal life. I can just use my lifespan to buy the things I need! But there is a problem…\"\nLeo was aware of his weaknesses. He couldn't gain lifespan by consuming regular food – Only contaminated food could increase his lifespan.\nHe looked at the dark soil. He pondered for a while if he should start contaminating this world to increase his lifespan or if he should spend the remaining years like an ordinary human.\nAfter thinking for a few minutes, Leo threw the second idea outside the window. He had second thought.\n\"I don't even know what kind of place this is. I'll find a water source first, and I'll build a shelter next.\"\nLeo skipped and danced in the forest, enjoying the song of nature. Because of his good mood, he kicked the ground and jumped 1,000 meters high. Then, he looked around while he was in mid-air, scouting the geography of this world.\nWhile he was in the sky, he noticed two landmarks. To the west, there was a large town. The high city walls and fortified moats indicated that the wilderness might be full of danger, or their neighbors might be hostile.\nTo the north, a massive river flowed from west to east. From a rough estimation, Leo believed that the river was at least five kilometers wide, larger than the Yellow River of China. Noticeably, a glowing rainbow bridge connected the north and south bank together. Leo spotted over a thousand people crossing the magical bridge by using flying ships.\n\"Wow, people!\"\nRealizing that he was no longer alone, Leo firmly believed in his life choice. He stopped looking around. Then, he searched for a small river or a small lake. It wasn't hard to find them. Leo found a stream east of his location.\nBOOM\nLeo fell to the ground and landed on his feet, causing a small crater. He stood up and rubbed his knees for a moment, resting his bones and kneecaps.\nHe then traveled east, heading to his next destination.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 2 : Florida Man Digs Catholes in Archaeological Sites\nAurora Light followed Leo's footsteps. As he journeyed toward the small stream to the east, the green grasses that he had stepped on blackened. Then, the black grasses spread, changing half of the grasses to black while the rest turned blue.\nLeo finally reached the stream. The water was so clear that he could see small fishes and rocks underneath. As he hadn't drunk any natural water for 50,000 years, Leo reached out to scoop the water.\nBefore Leo touched the surface of the water, he pulled his hand back. Then, he smacked his forehead.\n\"No, I can't touch it directly, or everything downstream will die.\"\nLeo opened the online shopping menu. He purchased a hazmat suit, gloves, and boots, spending three precious years of his lifespan. He wore the protection gear and bought a gallon-sized plastic bottle from the shop, costing him additional two years of his life. Then, he started collecting the freshwater. While he was at it, he checked the cost of mineral water in the shop.\n[1-Litre Water] : One Year of Lifespan\nIt was not worth it. It was too expensive. Unlike the previous world, where mineral water no longer existed, this world had plenty of water resources. Therefore, Leo didn't need to waste his lifespan on consumable items anymore.\nAfter scooping water with the gloves and drinking until his belly was round, Leo let out a long sigh of satisfaction. 50,000 years of struggling made freshwater so delicious, more delicious than refined beers!\nWith a full stomach, Leo recollected his thoughts.\n\"What's next? Right, survival! What are the basic necessities? Food, water, meds, shelter, and clothes, of course. Food, water, and clothes are no longer an issue. Meds aren't needed since my entire body is immune to cancer and sickness. Okay, I need shelter and modern tools.\"\nInstead of going to the wild to make tools from wood or stone, Leo browsed the shopping menu, looking for survival tools.\n.\nAn hour later, Leo finished shopping. He looked at a green modern cabin tent, a gas stove, a gas tank, a set of stainless steel pots, cooking utensils, and a camping chair. He gazed at his new home and his lifespan menu.\n<Your current lifespan: 4 years, 11 months, 23 days, 19 hours, and 15 minutes.>\n45 years of his life were gone just like that, but it was worth it.\n\"I'm tired of farming lifespan. I hate eating polluted sand and mud.\"\nLeo took off his gloves and pulled some green grasses near his campsite. As soon as his skin touched the grasses, they turned black. Without hesitation, Leo put the grasses in his mouth and chewed it.\nIt tasted like spicy cardboard, but he endured with it. Although Leo felt like he devolved into a cow or an herbivore, he enthusiastically chewed the food and continued to uproot the nearby weeds.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\nThe reward was worth the effort. Every strand of grasses gave Leo one year of lifespan.\nWhile Leo was stocking black grasses, he uprooted a strange weed. Its root looked like humanoid ginseng, but it wiggled.\nThe infant-like root opened its eyes and stared at Leo. It opened its mouth and screamed.\nRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\nLeo's ears were numb. In anger, he spat at the infant-like root.\n\"Taste the radiation spit, punk!\"\nAs soon as the spit hit the mandrake, it stopped crying. Its brown roots and skin turned black, and its belly swelled.\nPOP\nThe mandrake's belly erupted. Then, a thousand long thin roots gushed out as if they were newborn earthworms bursting out of someone's stomach. They lengthened by a meter before they stopped growing.\nJust like that, Leo secured a strange mutated mandrake that grew roots from its stomach.\nLeo inspected the new food. He flipped it around and waited for it to come to life. However, it didn't self-resurrect like the other zombies and mutated animals on Earth.\n\"Oh, well. Food is food.\"\nCHOMP\nIndiscriminately, Leo plucked a long root and put it in his mouth. As soon as he chewed it, juicy black liquid splattered in his mouth.\nIt tasted like a margarita cocktail!\nLeo widened his eyes. For the first time after a long while, he discovered a new delicacy. He sat there, eating the whole mandrake.\n.\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by...>\n.\n30 minutes later, Leo was full and drunk. For the first time in his life, he enjoyed a beverage meal.\nLeo looked at the mandrake in his hands. A round orb-like seed was left after the meal.\n\"You damn pearl. My teeth are sore because of you!\"\nAs Leo couldn't eat or chew that thing, he tossed it to a basket next to his tent like he was shooting a basketball to a hoop.\nCLANK\nSCORED!\nLeo giggled, enjoying a little thing in life. He walked toward the basket, wondering if he should use it as a trash bin or a stockpile for random seeds.\nGROWL\nAs Leo ate too much, his stomach rumbled. At that moment, Leo remembered that he hadn't set up an outhouse yet.\nIn the apocalyptic world, Leo never had an issue since there were plenty of toilets in abandoned houses and buildings. But here, there was no such thing.\nLeo smacked his forehead and opened the shopping menu. He purchased a shovel, costing him two years of lifespan. Then, he searched for a barren and secluded place for a toilet.\nAfter walking 100 meters away from his campsite, he found a 5-meter-tall boulder.\n\"Ah, landmark! I can use this place.\"\nLeo started scouting the surrounding area, making sure that no animal was using this rock as its home. After walking around the boulder, he spotted no creature.\nAlthough there was no living being around the area, Leo noticed something strange on the rock : One side was flat.\nOn the flat part of the boulder, there were strange Chinese characters that Leo couldn't read.I think you should take a look at\n\"Wut da hail are dees moon runes?\" Leo muttered in Uncle Roger's accent.\nLeo admired the unknown writing for several minutes. Although the boulder gave off a mysterious vibe, he disregarded it as it was irrelevant to his life.\nLeo looked at the ground in front of the boulder. No grasses or plants grew around here. Moreover, he saw traces of footsteps as if several people used to come here and had a dance party.\nCurious, Leo tested the ground with a shovel, wondering if the soil was soft enough to dig.\nSOEK\nLeo forgot how strong he was. After one soft push, his shovel pierced through the rocky and hard ground.\n\"Oh, nice! Well, since this is the only place without plants and grasses, I can use this place as my designated pooping street!\"\nLeo started working. He kept shoveling for hours until nightfall.\n.\nThe sky was dark when Leo finished his job. He ended up digging 50 six-foot-deep rectangular holes and 200 small holes. The big burial holes were for his feces and the junk from the online shopping system. As for the small holes, they were for number two emergencies.\nLeo's glowing red pupils saw through the darkness. He admired the holes around the boulder and remembered that he had an inedible pearl in his trash bin. He walked back to the camp and picked it up. Then, he tossed it into one of the small holes.\n\"Lucky you. I don't know if you're a seed or a real pearl, but wait for tomorrow morning, 'kay?\"\nLeo laughed at the pearl. He looked forward to blessing it with his stool tomorrow.\nGROWL\nAfter working so hard, his stomach growled again. He sighed and rechecked his lifespan.\n<Your current lifespan: 112 years, 11 months, 23 days, 10 hours, and 16 minutes.>\n\"Huh?\"\nHe just noticed - The mandrake earlier granted him 100 years of lifespan instead of five or six years like other mutated creatures in his old world.\n\"Wow. Are there more of those?\"\nLeo was inspired. He started searching for more mandrakes or similar plants by pulling the weeds in the area.\nLike a madman, Leo didn't sleep. He spent the night clearing green, blue, and black plants and grasses around his campsite and boulder area.\nWhen the sun was up, Leo admired the piles of green weeds and two wiggling mandrakes that he had found. As he wore gloves and the hazmat suit, they hadn't been mutated yet.\nHe took off his helmet and spat the green grasses and the mandrakes. The weed turned black instantly while the mandrakes screamed. Their stomach burst out ten thousand long roots before they died.\n\"Hehehe. That's a lot of breakfast!\"\nLeo gathered the mutated plants and sat at his campsite. He enjoyed the chubby roots and the blue light around him. While eating, he wondered what the blue thing was.\n\"This world is nice. It automatically contains the radiation around me.\"\nLeo spent the entire day at his camp. Because of the excitement, he forgot to take a dump. As a result, he failed to notice that the abandoned pearl earlier had sprouted a black leaf.\n.\n.\nMagpie City, the Capital City of Magpie Province was located at the center of the Eastern Continent. It was a territory of the Phoenix Empire, backed by the Life Sword Sect and other major martial art organizations.\nAt the east gate of Magpie City, a young man walked toward the checkpoint and showed the two armored guards a wooden plank token.\nThe guards didn't bother checking the token. They patted the 5'4-tall teenager's head, \"Hey, little Gao. Are you going out to train again?\"\nGao Yan was 16 years old this year. He wore the white robe uniform of the Life Sword Sect. However, the mark on his collar showed that he was still an outer disciple. His long black hair, round eyes, and high nose were common among the citizens, but the pimples on his face stood out from others. He carried a wooden sword and a short iron broadsword for protection.\n\"Yeah, I'll be going to the sword boulder again. Maybe if I'm lucky, I might find a few games.\"\n\"What happened yesterday, by the way? We didn't see you around.\"\n\"My seniors asked me to do their chores. I was bullied! Just because I'm stuck at the muscle tempering stage, these guys are using me as their servants!\"\nGao Yan narrated how his outer disciple colleagues bullied him because of his low cultivation aptitude. Moreover, he was on the verge of being expelled from the sect as his outer sect ranking was at the bottom.\nThe guard pitied him, \"Don't give up, junior. Bullying is bound to happen if you're at the bottom of the food chain. Once you've advanced to the Qi Condensation Stage, everything will be better.\"\n\"I know. That's why I'm training hard.\"\n\"Good luck, then. Come back before nightfall. At night, wolves and tigers usually roam in the woods. Even if you're a muscle-tempering stage cultivator, they can still kill you.\"\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\nGao Yan bid farewell to the town guards and leaped 50 meters high. He landed on a tree branch and jumped again, traveling east.\nLooking at the jumping teenager, the guards sighed. One of them lamented.\n\"It's a pity that he has no aptitude. Otherwise, he would have been an inner disciple already.\"\n\"Yeah. He's already 16, but he's stuck as an outer disciple. If he fails to reach the Qi Condensation Realm before he's 18, he will be kicked out.\"\n\"To be honest, the Life Sword Sect is more lenient. If it were other sects, he would have been sent home long ago.\"\n\"True.\"\nBoth men felt bad for the good boy. They wished heaven would bless Gao Yan with a fortuitous encounter or something similar.\n.\nThree hours later, Gao Yan found the mysterious boulder, aka his usual training spot. Gao Yan stood on top of a tall pine tree. He looked around if anybody was nearby.\nAs usual, nobody was there.\nGao Yan inwardly laughed at himself.\n\"I don't have enough spirit stones to buy the journal of sword saint. I can only read it from the source.\"\nThis boulder was known as the sword saint's journal. In ancient times, a legendary figure wrote how a swordsman should practice and train every day on this boulder. However, as it was over 1,000 years old, many cultivators had long discovered it and published the texts. Thus, every sect already possessed several copies of the records from various boulders, and many sword masters added annotations in the books for their disciples, making them more attractive than reading them from the source.\nNobody came here to train around the boulder anymore.\nBut everything changed that day.\nGao Yan looked at the ground and found several large and small holes in front of the boulder. His jaw dropped.\n\"Who the hell desecrate the Sword Saint?!\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 3 – Florida Man Imposing as Sage Scams Teenager\nInfuriated, Gao Yan started searching for the culprit. He checked the footprints on the ground, but the first things that attracted him were blue grasses.\n\"Huh? S-S-Spirit Grasses?!\"\nGao Yan rushed to the nearest blue grasses at the edge of the plain. He then looked left and right and plucked them, put them in his robes, and laughed.\n\"I can exchange these for spirit stones! No, I can actually eat them raw and absorb their Qi. If I accumulate enough Qi, I can break through from the Muscle Tempering Realm to the Qi Condensation Realm! Then, I won't be kicked out anymore!\"\nOverjoyed by the discovery, Gao Yan ran around and plucked more blue grasses. He got so many that his robes were bulky. An hour later, Gao Yan could no longer move as the grass in his clothes would fall off. He sat down to rearrange his treasure trove.\nGao Yan took off his robes and pants. He tied them into makeshift bags and put the grass in them. After the packages were wrapped up, he put them next to the boulder and headed east, where the stream was located. He wanted to wash his hands and take a short bath to refresh himself.\nA few minutes later, Gao Yan found the stream as he had expected. However, one noticeable campsite stood out like a sore thumb.\nIn front of the tent, Gao Yan spotted a weird person in a yellowish bulky suit. He wore rubber-like gloves and boots, hiding his appearance. Next to the weird man, black grasses and disfigured plants piled into a small mountain. Moreover, Gao Yan saw strange aurora light coming from the black plants.\n\"W-Who are you?!\" Gao Yan reached for his iron sword, but he couldn't find his weapon. He forgot that he had left them next to his clothes and blue grass.\nThe man in bulky yellow cloth turned around, showing his face behind the layer of transparent mask. He was an elderly man with long white hair and a white full beard. Gao Yan estimated that he was in his 70s or 80s.\nThe elder paused and sized up Gao Yan. He then noticed that Gao Yan only wore thong underwear.\nGao Yan noticed the elder's gaze. He covered his nipples in embarrassment. Afraid that the elder would mistake him for a weirdo, he shouted in panic.\n\"T-This is a misunderstanding! I'm not a pervert!\"\n\"…\"\nThe elder muttered something, but his muffled voice was incomprehensible. Gao Yan couldn't hear what he talked about.\nVRRRRRR\nSuddenly, Gao Yan heard a high-pitched sound. It was not the sound of birds or creatures but a strange ringing sound wave. Then, it followed with a bell sound.\nDING\nGao Yan covered his ears with his hands by reflex. His eyes felt so hot that he thought they were burning. In pain, he knelt and screamed.\n\"AAAAHHH!!\"\nThe pain lasted for a moment. When Gao Yan came to his senses, he found a series of floating words in front of him.\n.\nName: Gao Yan\nAge: 16\nRemaining Lifespan: 72 Years, 4 Months, 5 Days, 2 Hours, and 21 Minutes.\n.\n\"W-What is this?!\"\nGao Yan never heard of the word \"Lifespan\" before. He could guess that it was related to his life, but he couldn't grasp its true meaning. Looking for an answer, he turned to the elder.\nThen, Gao Yan saw more floating words in front of the elder. The yellow-suited old man was busy poking at the empty air in front of him.\n\"Ah, ah, testing, one two three…\"\nThe elder's voice was louder and clearer. Gao Yan could finally understand him.\nThe mysterious man slowly took off his helmet, revealing his face. As soon as the yellow helmet came off, Gao Yan widened his eyes and knelt. He tremblingly cupped his fist in fear.\nSuppressive air and colorful aurora light emanated from the elder's body. Moreover, the pressure was similar to the sect master of the Life Sword Sect.\nHe was an expert!\nIf a muscle-tempering realm cultivator was considered a 1st stage cultivator, this elder's strength was at least the 6th-stage or higher!\n\"J-Junior has eyes but failed to see Mount Tai! P-Please forgive this junior for disrespecting you!\" Shouted Gao Yan.\nThe elder dully stared at him. He frowned and scratched his head for a moment.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n.\n.\nLeo was confused.\nThis streaking teenager suddenly jumped out of a bush and showed up in front of his camp. Leo simply turned around and looked at him, but this guy had been yelling in incomprehensible language. He could tell that it was similar to the Chinese language, but some words sounded like Korean or Vietnamese.\nBecause of the language barrier, Leo opened his shopping menu and searched for a translation service or function. Unfortunately, the universal-translation function for all languages cost several million years of lifespan, which Leo couldn't afford.\nLeo sorted the shop again. He filtered the item list, hoping to find an affordable replacement for the feature. Then, he found something affordable.\n[Shop Feature]: 100 Years of Lifespan\n.\nShop Feature\nUpon unlocking this feature, you can set up a shop domain. Anybody that enters your shop domain can view their remaining lifespan, and they can use them to trade with your items.\nThis feature comes with an auto-speech-translation option, allowing you and your customers to converse and bargain as long as both parties are within the shop domain.\nThis feature is upgradeable.\n.\nLeo purchased it right away even though he had no intention of opening any shop. It had been a long time since he last chatted with a human, so he invested his lifespan in the new feature.\nDING\n<You have unlocked the Shop Feature.>\n<Will you set up your shop domain now?>\n\"Yes, please.\"\nDING\nA new window appeared in front of Leo. It showed a bird-eye view of his campsite, but lines of 3D grit showed the elevation and size of his place. A green 1000x1000 grit dome appeared on the menu.\n<Please choose the location of your shop.>\nLeo was reminded of a simulation game in the past. He slid the dome left and right, and the 1000x1000 grit in the menu moved according to his finger.\n'A shop has to be on flat land. Well, nothing around here is flat.'\nTesting the feature, Leo hovered the dome over a portion of the forest, away from the stream. However, the dome remained green, allowing Leo to place it there.\n'Interesting. How about here?'\nLeo moved it over his tent. It was buildable here. However, it could not cover the stream. As Leo couldn't assign the area over the stream, he moved it back slightly to the west. Then, he pressed confirm.\nDINGI think you should take a look at\n<Shop Domain has been created. The Auto-Translation Function is enabled in your domain.>\nThe 1,000,000 square meters, aka one square kilometer area that Leo picked turned green for a moment in the menu, but nothing changed in the real world.\nLeo coughed and tested his voice.\n\"Ah, ah, testing, one two three…\"\nUpon confirming that he could still speak an understandable human language, Leo turned to the young man in thong underwear. Then, he was taken aback.\nHe saw the floating lifespan status of Gao Yan.\n'Whoa. This is interesting.'\nAs the hazmat suit veil blurred his vision, Leo unzipped the helmet to get a clearer look. But when he took off his helmet, Gao Yan knelt.\n\"J-Junior has eyes but failed to see Mount Tai! P-Please forgive this junior for disrespecting you!\"\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo frowned. He accepted the fact that he was a 50,000-year-old mutated Florida man, but this young man was a weirdo. Kneeling was unnecessary.\n\"What are you talking about?\" Asked Leo.\n.\n.\nGao Yan sweated profusely. He feared for his life as the elder's tone seemed unfriendly to him.\nHis instinct switched to survivor mode. Gao Yan apologized and lowered his head.\n\"I-I-If I offended you, please forgive me!\"\n\"Eh, stop apologizing. It's not like you step on my foot.\"\nThe elder snorted and picked his ears. Then, he stared at the thong underwear.\n\"By the way, how long are you going to stay half-naked? Where are your clothes?\"\n\"I-I'M SO SORRY, SENIOR! I'LL GET MY CLOTHES RIGHT NOW!\"\nGao Yan kicked the ground and ran for his life. A few minutes later, he returned and knelt in front of the elder. He wore his uniform this time, but his clothes were covered in blue grasses and dirt.\n\"I'm back, senior!\"\nThe elder remained silent. Gao Yan slowly looked up to see the elder's face and found the floating texts about his lifespan floating in front of him.\nAfter a minute of awkward silence, the elder uttered, \"Since you're here, do you want to buy my weed?\"\n\"W-Weed, senior?\"\n\"I want to test out my shop domain, I mean, the lifespan trading system. See the black weeds behind me?\"\nThe elder pointed at the mountain of black grasses and strange roots. Gao Yan looked at them and gulped. Although he wasn't sure if they were valuable, they emitted a strong aura similar to the old man.\n\"I don't have any spirit stone on me, senior.\"\nAs Gao Yan was poor, he reluctantly declined the offer. He also regretted that he wasn't born rich as the other disciples in the sect.\n\"I don't need stones. I want your lifespan.\"\n\"Eh?!\" Gao Yan was stunned.\n\"Do you see the floating lifespan in front of you?\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior.\"\n\"How about it? I have a thousand weeds over here. I'll sell them for cheap! One of them for one year of your lifespan!\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan rechecked his lifespan. Seeing that he had 72 years to live, he decided to give it away to the elder. After all, he could have wasted it anyway.\n'What's the point of having a long lifespan if the elder suddenly decides to kill me? I should play along and get out of here alive.'\nAfter resolving himself, Gao Yan agreed, \"Yes, senior. Please allow me to buy one of your herbs. I'll pay with my lifespan!\"\n\"Just one?!\" The elder's expression darkened in dissatisfaction.\n\"O-One is enough, please.\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nThe elder pressed something invisible in front of him. Suddenly, Gao Yan heard a soothing female voice.\n<You have purchased a bundle of unidentified grasses for one year of lifespan.>\n\"Huh?\"\nA bundle of withered black grasses floated toward Gao Yan. The latter grabbed them but almost tossed them away.\nIt was burning hot!\nSuddenly, Gao Yan recalled the class of herbology. One of the instructors used to show an image of legendary grasses that could only be found in mystic realms. He wondered if they were the mystic grasses in the textbooks.\nGao Yan mustered his courage to ask the old man.\n\"S-Senior. What are these grasses?\"\nThe elder smirked, \"My snacks. What else?\"\n\"…\"\nHalf of Gao Yan's mind screamed that he was scammed. However, the other half scolded him that he just had a fortuitous encounter, and he should thank the senior.\nGao Yan listened to his second instinct. He prostrated on the ground.\n\"Thank you for your kindness, senior! This junior will treasure it!\"\n\"Meh, just take it and go home. Make sure to leave it in freezing water to dilute it. If you eat it raw, you'll swell and die.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan bit his lower lips. He remembered the advice and collected the black grasses and blue grasses. He deeply bowed and left the campsite.\n.\n.\nAfter Gao Yan had left, Leo's expression turned dark as he glared at the system menu.\n\"I lost 100 years just to get the communication perk. Talk about an investment. Tsk!\"\nLeo grumbled to himself for several minutes. Suddenly, he felt like he had forgotten something important. He muttered.\n\"Err, those radioactive grasses won't kill the boy, right? Does leaving it in cold water help?\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 4 : Florida Man Defecates in Archeological Site, Covers His Stool with Ancient Mural\nGao Yan endured the burning pain and carried the bundle of black grasses in his clothes. He also brought some of the blue grasses back.\nUpon arrival at the city gate, the two guards were surprised to see Gao Yan back so early.\n\"You're fast. Did you run into a wild beast?\" Asked one of the guards.\n\"N-No. I ran into a strong senior. I-I need to go back to the dorm quick!\"\n\"I see. Go then.\"\nThe guards let him in. Gao Yan sprinted through the street and ignored the wandering pedestrians. Following the west road, Gao Yan reached the entrance of the Life Sword Sect's outer disciple school. He carried the grasses and entered the gate.\nNo one bothered with Gao Yan. He rushed to the pagoda north of the school. When he arrived, he saw the large signboard.\nContribution Pavilion (Outer Disciples)\n\"It has been a while.\"\nThis place was the only source of outer disciples' income. They could accept missions from the sect and complete them in exchange for contribution points. Then, they could exchange the points for cultivation resources. However, it also served as an exchange center : A disciple could exchange herbs or treasure for spirit stones or contribution points there.\nUpon entering the building, Gao Yan found a long counter where outer disciples could exchange items, accept the sect's missions, or report the completion of the tasks. Several large bulletin boards were filled with request papers, waiting for the disciples to take them.\nGao Yan ignored the mission board and rushed to a counter. He approached the sect's deacon behind the desk and reported his findings.\n\"Senior, I'm here to exchange some spirit grasses for the sect's contribution points and spirit stones.\"\nThe deacon was a middle-aged woman. He looked up, \"Your ID token?\"\nGao Yan rarely came here, so the deacon didn't know him. He clumsily pulled out a wooden plank token from his pocket and dropped some of the blue grasses on the floor.\n\"H-Here.\"\nGao Yan put the token on the counter and picked up the grasses. Then, he put them on the bronze tray on the left side of the table.\nThe deacon raised her eyebrows when she noticed the aura of the grasses. She nodded in approval.\n\"Spirit Grass confirmed. But junior, you're not from the alchemy or the botany department. Where did you get these from?\"\nGao Yan remembered that he hadn't collected all the blue grasses from the eastern forest. He was afraid that the sect might send someone to collect them all and steal his money-making method. Thus, he lied.\n\"I ran into a master in the east forest, senior. He sold me the spirit grass.\"\n\"Which senior? Do you know his name or Daoist Title?\"\n\"I... forgot to ask him. His aura was as bright as the sect master. I was too afraid to ask.\"\n\"...\"\nThe deacon gave Gao Yan a meaningful look. She secretly took notes and started calculating the exchange rate.\n\"26 high-quality spirit grass, 17 medium quality, and 9 low quality. That comes to 69.5 points in contribution. Do you want to exchange them for spirit stones or technique books?\"\n\"Convert points to spirit stones, please!\"\n\"Alright. Two points per spirit stone. How many do you need?\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"34!\"\nThe deacon put 34 spirit stones on another tray on the table. Gao Yan picked them up in glee and strolled out of the building.\n.\n.\nAfter Gao Yan had left, the deacon searched for a book on the shelves behind her. A few minutes later, she found a dusty book. She flipped it to check the title on the book cover.\nOuter Disciple : Gao Yan\nThe deacon flipped the pages. However, there were only two notes about his contribution to the sect. Overall, his total contribution points in the previous year were only five.\nShe put the book on the table and filled in today's contribution detail. She listed the name of the contributed items, the amount, and the sources of the items in the paper.\n'Gifts from an unknown senior? We should check this disciple's background. He might have found a new source of wild spirit grass. But if he robbed them from someone, he'll be kicked out of the sect.'\nShe added a comment in the book : \"Gao Yan needed a background check as his spirit grasses came from a dubious source. He claimed he had received from an unknown cultivator.\"\nAfter finishing the notes, the deacon closed the book and put it on the audit shelf so that the internal affairs officers could audit the detail of the contributors and their achievements.\n.\n.I think you should take a look at\nLeo was never this happy. He enjoyed eating the mutated mandrakes, and these living roots didn't have an annoying pearl inside.\nGROWL\nBecause Leo ate too much, he had a stomach ache. He clicked his tongue and walked toward the temporary toilet around the boulder. Leo took off his hazmat suit and clothes. Then, he squatted above one of the small holes behind the rock.\nCoincidentally, it was the hole in which Leo had dumped a mandrake seed in.\nSeveral minutes later after the deed, Leo cleaned up the mess. He covered the hole with a shovel. He let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"50,000 years of mutation and I'm still vulnerable to diarrhea. Those mutated bacteria in my intestines need some work.\"\nLeo patted his belly and put on his clothes and hazmat suit. Then, he glanced at the soil that he had covered just now.\nIt turned black as usual. Moreover, colorful aurora leaked out from the soil, emitting the stench of burning iron.\nLeo covered his nose and grabbed the shovel. He used the extra soil from the other hole to create another layer of dirt to block the smell. He stomped it a few times to make sure that the soil was hardened enough.\nUnfortunately, the odor kept coming out. Leo grumbled in frustration and looked around for anything useful. A moment later, he gazed at the large boulder.\n\"Meh, you will do.\"\nWith both arms, Leo hugged the boulders and lifted them off the ground. He took several steps toward the covered hole and put the boulder on top of it.\nRUMBLE\nThe ground trembled after it landed. Leo patted his hands, getting rid of the dust on his gloves.\n\"I should dig deeper. Two meters ain't enough.\"\nLeo grabbed his trusty shovel and started digging a larger and deeper hole. Once again, he failed to notice the movements of the mandrake pearl underground.\n.\nA day later, Leo admired his new work - A 20-meter-deep crater in front of the boulder.\n\"Did I overdo it?\" Leo doubted himself, but he believed that it was reasonable.\nHe jumped down to the bottom of the hole and looked around. He patted the sloping wall a few times. As soon as he touched a certain part of the wall, his face distorted in disgust.\nIt was wet. Underground water seemed to flow around here.\n\"This won't do. If I take a dump here, it will contaminate the underground water! I need a clean outhouse system, or I'll ruin this world because of my radiation.\"\nLeo opened his shopping menu. He searched for the keyword \"Toilet\", and many toilet seats showed up. A few minutes later, Leo smacked his forehead.\n\"I should have done that earlier! I could have bought a septic tank from the shop and been done with it! A plastic one will do. Once it's filled, I can just punt it to space to avoid the contamination!\"\nHe opened the shopping menu and spent 50 years of lifespan for the 1,100-gallon septic tank. He then covered a portion of the crater to fit the tank. Then, he fiddled with the pipelines and the shopping menu, installing the tank properly.\nHalf a day later, Leo looked at the tank system in satisfaction. There was no drainage for the water to flow out, so the radiation wouldn't spread anywhere. Everything should have been perfect with this setup if no external influence interfered with the tools.\nWIGGLE\nA dozen black roots appeared out of nowhere from the side of the wall, coiling around the septic tank. One of them pierced through the tank and got inside.\nLeo could have uprooted the roots right away. However, he stood there, watching how the roots rapidly grow at a visible rate.\nHe recognized the scent of these roots very well. It had the sweet scent of a margarita cocktail - the juicy delicious mandrakes.\n\"What the duck?! Are these... one of the mandrakes?\"\nCRACKLE\nThe roots stopped moving. They sank their roots into the tank and stayed there.\nLeo raised his brow, amused, \"What are you doing here? Do you want my organic fertilizer?\"\nOne of the roots wiggled as if it understood Leo's intention.\n\"...\"\nLeo was speechless. He wondered if he was hallucinating. Still, he allowed the roots to stay there since they would automatically drain the scum and water from the toilet. Leo jumped out of the hole and buried the septic tank, leaving only the only pipe to go in.\nAfter the septic tank system was completed, Leo installed a modern toilet seat on top of it. However, he left the toilet seat in the open for now.\nWhen Leo finished his task, he gazed at the boulder. It cracked and turned green. However, the soil under the boulder leaked out blue smoke. Blue branches and leaves emerged out of the cracks in the rock and continued to grow.\n\"Welp! I'll be calling you the ROCK tree. Just stay there and don't contaminate the surrounding trees, okay? I don't wanna turn this world into a nuclear wasteland 2.0.\"\nOne of the branches wiggled, acknowledging Leo's command. The latter scratched his head and pursed his lips, wondering if it really understood his words.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 5 – Scammed Victim Benefits from Florida Man's Fake Medicine\nAfter the stone and the septic tank incident, Leo returned to his tent. He rested for the day.\nThe next day, Leo woke up late. He realized an important issue at hand - Aside from eating and sleeping, Leo had nothing to do!\nHe was bored!\nAs Leo sought something to kill time, he explored the new shop domain system to see what he could do with it. The menu showed a bird-eye view of his campsite and the shop domain as usual.\nAt the top right corner, there was a hammer icon. Leo pressed on it.\n[Buildings]\n\"Oh?\"\nHe checked the detail of what it was for. Upon tabbing it, the screen window changed from the 3D bird-eye view to the top-down view. The screen displayed the usual 1000x1000 grits of his shop domain, but half of the field was red. Only the cleared land was highlighted in green.\nAt the side menu, only one thumbnail picture of a modern one-story building showed up. Leo read its description.\n.\n[Humble Store] – 500 Years of Lifespan\nThis building is popular among small grocery stores. It has limited room for shelves and walking space, but it's enough for a start-up business. Require 10x10 grits.\n.\nLeo's eyes were bloodshot. He stared at the cost of this building.\n\"Five hundred freaking years?! Are you kidding?!\"\nLeo looked at his current lifespan. After eating all the mutated mandrakes and a shopping spree, he had only 300 years in stock. It wasn't enough to test the unknown feature.\nAlthough Leo used to farm 2,000 years of lifespan easily from eating mutated creatures, he couldn't do the same in this world. He was afraid that he might destroy the ecology and turned this planet into another nuclear fallout wasteland.\nStill, without the radiation, Leo had no other way of increasing his lifespan.\nWithout a choice, Leo took off his hazmat suit. He strolled in the forest barefoot. As Leo had predicted, the grass, flowers, and plants got polluted by the radiation from his body. The ones that directly touched Leo turned black while the surrounding plants changed color to blue.\nLeo squatted and plucked black grass. He also searched for more mandrakes to eat.\n\"Woe is me. I guess pulling grass is now the only activity for me to kill time…\"\nLeo was depressed. He sulked and continued corrupting and pulling weeds in the forest.\nWhile he was pulling black grasses, he thought of Gao Yan. He wondered if the boy would still be alive.\nLeo snickered, \"As long as you don't grow four arms or extra legs, you'll be fine, boy.\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan stared at the large cauldron that he had borrowed from the alchemy department. He kept throwing ice cubes into it to cool the water, but the temperature kept rising. The cauldron also shone in green light, basking Gao Yan every time he came near.\nAs Leo had instructed, Gao Yan cooled the black grass. It had been three days since he had started, and he began to feel nauseous.\nFeeling sick, Gao Yan walked back into his dorm building. He looked at his colleagues.\n\"Can anybody help me cool that cauldron? I need to sleep. I have a headache.\"\nGao Yan's friends laughed at him, \"Why should we?\"\nAnother one teased him, \"One spirit stone, and I'll do it for you.\"\nThe third guy agreed, \"Yeah, nothing is free in this world. No pay, no gain!\"\nGao Yan scoffed and flickered a spirit stone at the trio. He yelled at them.\n\"I don't care who! Just don't let the water boil! Put some ice into the water every time the water bubbles. I'm going to rest now.\"\n\"…\"\nThe group picked up the spirit stone and looked at each other in astonishment. They gazed at how Gao Yan climbed onto his bed and fell asleep.\n\"He must be really sick.\"\n\"Yeah. The old Gao never spent a single dime. Whenever he had a spirit stone, he always used it to boost his non-existing inner energy. He never spent it on something trivial.\"\n\"I saw him doing chores for himself while the others simply hired random servants to do theirs. Who in the right mind spent all day washing clothes for others to get some food instead of cultivating? So, yeah. This guy is sick, alright.\"\nThe trio felt bad for Gao Yan, but they accepted the commission. They exited the dorm and visited the rumored cauldron. But when they saw the green smoke, they were stunned.\n\"Huh? Hey, bro. Do you think what I'm thinking?\"\n\"How should I know? But, yeah. I guess so.\"\n\"S-Spiritual Qi? Not just regular Qi but the high-graded one?! What the hell is he cooking?\"\nThey peeked into the cauldron and found a bundle of black grasses at the bottom of the pot. A few seconds later, their eyes and nose were so hot that they looked away from the cauldron.\n\"Ow! The smoke!\"\n\"M-My eyes!\"\n\"It burns! No, my nose is burning!\"\nThey screamed and started causing a commotion. Several outer disciples came out of their barracks, houses, and dorms to see them.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nThe trio pointed at the 5-foot-tall pot. The others also peeked into it and got the same reactions.\n\"AAAAHHH!! MY EYES!!\"\n\"IT BURNS!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!\"\nTheir loud noise caused a commotion. Soon, a deacon appeared and yelled at the disciples.\n\"What's going on here?! Who is boiling something in the public courtyard? Hmm?\"\nThe deacon noticed the strange light from the pot. He instantly recognized it and exclaimed in shock.\n\"Spiritual Qi?! HOW?!\"\nHe rushed to the pot and looked inside. Then, he found the source.\n\"Who the hell is boiling the precious immortal grass?!\"I think you should take a look at\nThe deacon sent his Qi into the pot to bring it out. However, the light around the grasses repelled the deacon's Qi, preventing him from touching it.\n\"Ah!\"\nThe deacon's Qi returned to the owner, and he coughed a mouthful of blood because of the backlash. He widened his eyes in astonishment.\n\"A-A high-graded immortal grass? Not just a sprout?!\" He looked at the disciples in the area and yelled, \"Who did this?! Who brought the grasses here?!\"\nThe friends of Gao Yan struggled as if they got hit by tear gas. They pointed at their dorm barrack, \"Gao Yan, sir. He said he was sick. He's resting inside.\"\n\"Get him out! Make him stop this madness!\"\nEverybody jolted in fear. They rushed into Gao Yan's barrack to bring him out.\nAs soon as they entered the barrack, they saw the sleeping man. However, his body glowed in green light.\n\"Eh?\"\n\"A breakthrough?!\"\nWhenever cultivators advanced from the muscle tempering stage to the Qi condensation stage, their bodies always glowed a color, depending on their aptitude and talent - A cultivator with high impurity always emitted black smoke. On the other hand, a cultivator with a good foundation usually emitted a bright colorful aura during the breakthrough.\nGreen aura indicated that Gao Yan's had a high aptitude for Wood Qi. His talent in sword arts might be lacking, but the botany and alchemy schools would be crazy over this disciple. If he could enroll in an alchemy-related sect, he would surely become one of the prominent figures in the future.\nThe disciples stood there, watching the green aura of Gao Yan. On the other hand, Gao Yan sweated profusely as the temperature in his body rose.\n\"S-Should we wake him up?\"\n\"And destroy his cultivation base and opportunity? Hell no. I don't wanna offend the alchemists.\"\n\"That's right. Anybody that disturbs an alchemist's breakthrough will face the wrath of all alchemists on the continent! They worship cultivators with Wood Qi since these people can refine spiritual herbs and plants! If we mess with Gao Yan now and they find out about us, no alchemist will sell us pill!\"\n\"This is a shocker. Gao Yan is talentless in swordsmanship. Who would have thought that his true talent belongs in another field?\"\nEven bullies were afraid of the alchemists and Gao Yan. They watched him in silence.\nAs people gathered in front of Gao Yan's room, it caused a commotion. More disciples gathered around to spectate the green light. Then, they started pushing the people in the front.\n\"Hey! Don't push!\"\n\"Get out! Gao Yan has green aura! If we touch him, his breakthrough will fail!\"\n\"OUT! OUT!\"\nThe outer disciples in the room pushed the crowd outside. The people took the gesture and reluctantly left.\nOn the other hand, the deacon pushed through the crowd and got into the room to see the commotion. Then, he saw Gao Yan and his aura.\n\"G-Green aura breakthrough?! He is compatible with wood Qi?!\"\nThe deacon was astonished. He inspected Gao Yan for a moment to check his condition without touching him.\nThe overall condition of Gao Yan was not good. He had absorbed too much wood Qi, causing his blood vessels to swell. At this rate, all meridians in his body would explode.\n\"Disciples, go inform an elder from the pavilion quick. Tell them that I need a Qi Stabilization pill and a meridian nourishment pill. I'll help him suppress the rampaging Wood Qi.\"\nThe disciples gulped and scrambled out of the dorm. A dozen of them ran toward nearby deacons and contribution building at the center, hoping to find an elder.\nMeanwhile, the deacon in the room sat in front of Gao Yan. He gathered his Qi in his fingertip and was about to absorb excess Qi to relieve the disciple's pain.\nSuddenly, Gao Yan snapped open his eyes. He sat up and vomited green liquid on the floor. The fluid corroded the ground and released the greenish odor of wild plants.\nCOUGH\nGao Yan coughed and clenched his stomach. He had severe stomach pain and a high fever. However, he sensed something strange inside him.\nHe looked at the deacon in front of him, \"S-Sir, I don't feel so good.\"\nAs Gao Yan had completed his breakthrough, he was no longer in danger. The deacon grabbed the disciple's wrist and checked his pulse.\nHe sensed thick wood Qi in Gao Yan's swollen blood vessels. Fortunately, the boy's physique was sturdy as he had been training hard for years.\nThe deacon wryly smiled and gave him a piece of good news, \"You've just advanced to the Qi Condensation Stage. Obviously, you need a few days of rest to stabilize your cultivation.\"\n\"Huh?\" Gao Yan was confused, \"I did what?\"\n\"You're now a second-stage cultivator, you fool!\"\n\"EEEHHH!?\"\nGao Yan couldn't believe his ears. He pinched his cheek and looked at his stomach.\nAs the deacon had said – He advanced to the Qi Condensation Stage. Gao Yan sensed his inner energy in his blood circulation system. However, they had no place to go, so they flowed aimlessly.\nAlthough the condition looked troublesome, Gao Yan was overjoyed. He wouldn't be expelled from the sect anymore!\nThe deacon noticed Gao Yan's happy expression. He smacked the guy's back, \"Stop boiling immortal grass for now. Wait here. I'll go get you some Qi Stabilization pill, a painkiller, and a Wood Qi cultivation method from the treasure pavilion.\"\n\"Eh? Alchemy?\"\n\"Your primary element is wood. You need that method since the regular ones are no longer suitable for you.\"\nGao Yan was over the moon. He didn't know how to respond to the deacon's kindness and his new power.\nThe deacon stood up and canceled his Qi. He glanced at the wet floor.\n\"Don't worry about the vomit. I'll ask someone else to clean it.\"\n\"…\"\n.\nAfter the decon had left, Gao Yan was alone in the room.\nBecause of excitement, Gao Yan forgot about the headache, stomach pain, and fever. He sat there, contemplating how this had happened.\nThe face of the mysterious elder in the Sword Saint Boulder Forest appeared in his mind.\n\"Is this because of the grass? T-This is the effect of immortal grass?! I only tried to cool them for almost two days, but I…\"\nGao Yan was moved to tears. One year of lifespan for this opportunity was worth it!\nHe made up his mind. Once he could stabilize his cultivation, he would revisit the elder to thank him.\nLater that day, a deacon came and asked Gao Yan to follow him. He brought Gao Yan the alchemy department, where alchemists from the other sects resided. As for the black grasses in the cauldron, they were transferred along with Gao Yan to his new home.\nGao Yan's status changed forever.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 06 – Florida Man Scammed While Attempting to Scam Local Cultivator\nOne day had passed since Gao Yan had advanced to the second stage.\nGao Yan no longer shared a room with other outer disciples. The internal affair elder assigned him a new resident in the Alchemy Department, where only alchemist elders could stay. Although he was still an outer disciple, the treatment toward him was drastically improved as he could potentially become an alchemist in the future.\nAs soon as the alchemist elder discovered Gao Yan's wood Qi, he immediately took him in as a core disciple. When the words spread, Gao Yan became famous throughout the outer disciple division.\nAlchemists were important to the Life Sword Sect. They were the only group of cultivators who could refine spirit grass and other plants into useful medicinal pills. In short, these specialists were always in demand, and their status was higher than regular swordsmen and cultivators.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan's dorm became the gathering point of outer disciples. As Gao Yan couldn't bring out the black grasses with him, they still sat at the bottom of the cauldron in front of his barrack.\nA dozen disciples sat around the cauldron, filling the water with ice cubes and trying to cultivate the green gas by inhaling them. They believed that the gas could awaken their hidden potential. Many deacons watched them from afar, maintaining order.\n.\nContribution Pavilion\nA group of outer disciples worked part-time here, carrying books from the audit shelves toward the internal management department building behind the pavilion in exchange for contribution points.\nIn the building with a high roof, scholar-like middle-aged elders in white robes sat behind small tables, surrounding the empty hall of the building in the horseshoe formation. Next to them, books from the contribution pavilion were stacked up into towers. However, they were unfazed while they read the records of inner disciples and outer disciples. Some of them added comments in the books while most of them used their wooden stamps to validate the deed.\nAt the corner of the room, the scholar elder waved his finger, sending his Qi to pick up the book from the top of the stack. He put it on the table and glanced at the name.\nGao Yan – Outer Disciple\n\"Ah, Gao Yan. Is he the rumored Wood Qi boy? Talk about the story of a diamond in a rough. I heard he had been mistreated for years before his breakthrough. Let's see what our future alchemist did when he was still in the mud.\"\nHe flipped the cover page and another page. As soon as he noticed that Gao Yan only had two records in his name, the elder frowned.\n\"A lazy one. Well, at least, he tried. How old is he? 16? There's even a record that he has no aptitude in cultivation. Hahaha! The evaluation elder needs to be reevaluated instead!\"\nThe scholar giggled and was about to pick a stamp to clear this book. However, as he was a disciplined worker, he put the wooden stamp down and read the recent deed of Gao Yan.\n\"69.5 Points at once from spirit grass? Interesting?\"\nHe continued to read the comments of the inspecting deacon.\n[Gao Yan claimed he received spirit grass from a rogue cultivator in the Sword Saint Boulder Forest. Need someone to validate this testimony.]\n\"Ho? Does that mean he had a fortuitous encounter, and he got Wood Qi after that? Indeed, we need to check that person's background. If he's not an unorthodox cultivator, we can invite him to join our sect as a guest elder or a permanent elder.\"\nThe scholar deeply exhaled and wrote a few words under the record to give comments. Then, he picked up a handheld bronze bell. He rang it to get the others' attention.\nDING\nWhen everybody in the room looked at him, he uttered in a clear voice.\n\"Urgent request here. Send this record to the disciplinary hall and let them investigate this disciple and the mysterious cultivator behind him. The detail is in the book.\"\nRinging the bell was a tradition there. Whenever an elder needed something investigated, they always rang the bells on their tables.\nIt only took 10 seconds before an inner disciple rushed into the building. The young man received the book from the scholar and strode out of the building, heading to another place.\n.\nThe 20-story pagoda of the Life Sword Sect was a restricted area of the disciplinary department, and only authorized inner disciples or core disciples could enter. It was located at the center of the sect, next to the 100-story pagoda of the grand elders and the sect master.\nThe record of Gao Yan arrived at the basket in front of the building. The inner disciple put in there and left.\nWHOOSH\nThe book floated to the top floor of the 20-story pagoda. On the rooftop, an elderly man with a curvy black mustache stood still, controlling the 100 hovering swords in front of him and practicing his skills.\nThe disciplinary elder Han Meng was 6 feet tall and muscular. His body-builder-like muscles couldn't be contained in regular Daoist robes, so he only wore a white tank top and pants.\nHan Meng was one of many elders in charge of internal investigation and punishment. Whenever someone put a letter or a book in the basket in front of the pagoda, he and his colleagues always took up the task of investigating the issues.\nHan Meng grabbed the floating book and opened it. He read through everything that Gao Yan did and focused on the comments of the deacon and the audit elder.\n\"A disciple awakens Wood Qi after meeting with a mysterious cultivator in a forest? Mysterious source of spirit grass? Obviously, the cases are connected. But since an outsider is involved, I doubt any inner disciples can complete the task safely. I should take a look at this man myself.\"\nHan Meng jumped off the rooftop of the pagoda and flew toward the east, heading toward the famous Sword Saint Boulder to inspect the area.\n.\n.\nWARRA WARRA WARRA\nWhile pulling weeds, a dire wolf jumped out of a bush and bit Leo's nape.\nLeo ignored the animal and collected black grasses in a large bamboo basket, which he had purchased from the online shopping menu. He looked at the basket. The grasses were filled to the brim, but there was no mandrake. Moreover, he finished cleaning all grass in the square kilometer domain.\nLeo sighed and sulked. He was tired of black grasses.\n\"This is gonna be a grind. How many days do I have to eat grasses? I'm going to devolve into a cow at this rate… Moo.\"\nHe turned his attention to the dead wolf. As usual, it slowly mutated and swelled. Seeing the dead dog, Leo grinned.\nAfter standing up, Leo turned around and carried the basket back to his campsite. As for the dire wolf, it was already on the ground, having a stroke and foaming its mouth. Its arms, legs, and body swelled as the evolved cells of Leo's body mutated the beast. It soon turned black and died.\nA few minutes later, Leo returned with a plastic bin. He tied the bulky leg of the swollen dire wolf to the nearby black tree, hanging it upside down. Then, he cut open its stomach with a skinning knife and removed the internal organs, then tossed everything inedible to the bin. After that, he put the container underneath the carcass and cut the wolf's throat, draining its blood.\n\"I hate to say this, but I get to eat dog meat at last! I ain't a Chinese, but I'm gonna feast on you, stupid doggy!\"I think you should take a look at\nLeo hummed and rotated the skinning knife in a good mood. When Leo was about to peel the wolf's skin, the corner of his eyes noticed something in the sky. He looked up and stared at it.\n\"Is that a bird? Is that a plane? No… it's a flying dude?\"\n.\n.\nInitially, Han Meng believed that the mysterious cultivator was just a rogue cultivator that accidentally or purposely gave spirit grasses to Gao Yan. Thus, he flew toward the Sword Saint Boulder, intending to fight or interrogate the unknown cultivator.\nAs soon as Han Meng arrived, he saw traces of digging and tampering around the boulder. Moreover, the grey rock was now green, and the surrounding plants and trees had blue leaves.\nHan Meng deeply frowned. He recognized the plants and trees. They should have been regular plants, but they evolved into spirit trees. Moreover, some of the plants were new species that could have driven botanists or alchemists crazy.\nThat was not all. The blue plants grew in small groups. Upon further inspection, they surrounded black plants in the middle, and they leaked powerful miasma into the air.\n\"Immortal plants?\"\nHan Meng rubbed his eyes. He thought that he hallucinated.\nWhile Han Meng was looking around from the sky, the corner of his eyes spotted movements. He noticed a strange campsite with a weird tent and a pile of black grasses near the stream.\nWhen Han Meng turned his attention toward the camp, he noticed a white-haired elderly man in strange bulky yellow clothes. The elder also looked up, and their eyes met.\nHan Meng suddenly sensed a chill running down his spine. He saw the rainbow aura and the colorful aurora around him.\nHe recognized this type of aura well. The master of the Life Sword Sect also had this presence.\n\"S-Sixth stage cultivator, the soul formation stage?!\"\nAfraid of offending the mysterious elder, Han Meng descended. He landed in front of the white-haired old man and cupped his fist.\n\"I'm sorry for the sudden visit, senior. My name is Han Meng, and my Daoist name is Flying Swordsman. I've received a report from my sect that one of our disciples has received your guidance. Could I know your name and where you're from, senior?\"\nAlthough Han Meng slightly bowed, he kept looking at Leo's face. He gulped and cursed at himself.\n'Dammit. I spoke too fast! I should have only extended my greetings and not questioned him. I was rude!'\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo blankly stared at Han Meng. He raised his eyebrows.\n'Well, damn. I read about them when the internet was still up, but these guys do exist, eh? What were the terms? Farmer? No, cultural-something? That's not it. Cultivation… cultivator! Yes, cultivator! Those superpower Daoists and their 9th-grade syndrome cringe are their main attraction!'\nLeo had enlightenment. Although he wasn't an expert in the cultivation world genre, he knew how to act like one.\nWithout thinking much, Leo enabled the shop domain feature.\nDING\nSuddenly, the lifespan status of Han Meng appeared.\n.\nName: Han Meng\nAge: 54\nRemaining Lifespan: 726 Years, 1 Month, 24 Days, 10 Hours, and 49 Minutes.\n.\nHan Meng and Leo widened their eyes in astonishment for a different reason.\nLeo was shocked that a local cultivator had 726 years to live. On the other hand, Han Meng was flabbergasted to see his own lifespan status floating in front of him.\n\"S-Senior, what is this?!\" Han Meng asked.\nLeo snapped back to his senses and coughed, \"You see, junior. I'm a wandering vendor from another continent. I'm wondering if you're interested in my weed.\"\nLeo turned around and pointed at the mountain of black grasses that he had been collecting.\nHan Meng gulped. His eyes were so round that they almost came out from the eye sockets.\nAs Han Meng didn't reply, Leo pitched the sale.\n\"I'm selling them for cheap. One blade of weed for 10 years of your lifespan. How about it? Wanna smoke?\"\nLeo jacked the price because of his greed. As Gao Yan only purchased one, Leo expected Han Meng to buy only one grass as well.\nHowever, Leo underestimated the standard and the common sense of this world.\n\"Ten years of my lifespan for one blade of grass?! ARE YOU SURE?\"\n\"Err, yes.\"\nLeo inwardly questioned Han Meng in his mind. He wondered why the muscle man exclaimed so loud.\n\"I'd like to exchange 500 years of my lifespan for 50 of those, please!\"\n\"Huh?\"",

      "content": "ραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm ﻿Chapter 7 – Florida Man Builds General Store in Forest to Sell Grass\nHan Meng was ecstatic when Leo offered to sell him immortal grasses for only 10 years of lifespan per blade.\nIn this world, immortal grasses usually took 100 years to grow one centimeter. Moreover, it required seven types of elemental water and a highly-dense Qi area to grow. In addition, this type of grass couldn't be found anywhere except in the mystic realms in other dimensions.\nAlthough they were super rare, the grasses were the key ingredient of top elixirs and many types of legendary cultivation pills. Han Meng's mentor once taught him that one piece of immortal grass could be made into elixir pills, which could extend one's lifespan for a hundred years and improve one's inner energy equal to one thousand years' worth of cultivation.\nYet, Leo offered to sell a completed grass for only 10 years of lifespan!\nEven a six-year-old child could do the math. Without hesitation, Han Meng asked for 50 blades of grass right away.\nLeo's expression went blank for a moment. A second later, he widely grinned, thinking that Han Meng was so stupid.\n\"Of course. I'll deduct 500 years from your lifespan. Thank you for your patronage, kind customer.\"\n\"N-No. I should be the one to thank you! Actually, if it won't offend you, can I purchase some more?\"\nHan Meng regretted that he only asked for 50 blades of grass when he could afford more. As top alchemists usually took 50 to 100 years at most for refining difficult pills, Han Meng believed he could get 10 more, leaving a bit over a hundred years of lifespan for himself.\nMeanwhile, Leo had second thoughts. As Han Meng acted like a drug-addicted junkie. He wondered if Han Meng mistook it for marihuana or something similar.\n'Wut da hail is dis greedy junkie?'\nAgain, Leo's expression looked like disgusted Uncle Roger.\n**From this point, it is recommended to read Leo's dialogues in Uncle Roger's voice or accent**\n'Is he so desperate to the point he wants to hoard my weeds? No, no. I might be a scammer, but I'm a RIGHTEOUS scammer! If you die from over-smoking, who will come back to buy my grasses and give me more lifespan? No, son. You will enjoy my weeds, and you will come back here in one piece.'\nAlthough he was glad that he managed to scam a random customer, he didn't want Han Meng to die and ruin his shop's reputation. After all, scamming local cultivators was more profitable than eating grasses.\nLeo made up his mind. He tried to convince Han Meng not to smoke too much.\n\"As much as I want to sell you more, smoking too much weed will send you to Jesus. You should not smoke 50 weeds at once. Instead, treasure it and take it one at a time for safety… like how you take vitamin D through your butt. Your PP will turn into a soggy noodle, and your wife will complain to me that you can't do your homework. Haiya.\"\nHan Meng's expression was blank. He couldn't understand the jargon and weird accent. Thus, he mistook Leo for a foreigner and didn't think much of the weird choice of words.\n\"Err, I don't understand what you're talking about. Could you repeat that?\"\nLeo scratched his head. He stopped messing around and got to the point.\n\"You have to think of your health. What are you going to do if you get sick because of overdosing?\"\n\"!!!\"\nHan Meng came back to his senses. He then smacked his forehead and thought to himself.\n'He's right! Cultivators usually develop resistance to pills if they eat too many. If we eat the same pills over and over again, our dantian will develop impure Qi, and they will clog our meridians – The pill poisoning! Why didn't I think of this? How embarrassing!'\nAfter thinking this far, Han Meng deeply bowed, \"Thank you for reprimanding this junior! I was overwhelmed by greed, and I overlooked common sense! I will never forget your kindness!\"\nLeo didn't understand what Han Meng was talking about, but he was glad that he managed to convince a drug junkie not to smoke too many weeds. Leo picked up 50 black blades of grass and tossed them over.\nThe grasses automatically floated and hovered in front of Han Meng. The elder gleefully accepted them and put everything in his spatial ring. Then, he watched his lifespan in the status menu decrease.\nHan Meng glanced at Leo. He cupped his fist and tried to ask for his identity again.\n\"Again, could I have your name? If it is inconvenient, you can tell me your Daoist name.\"\n\"…\"\nThis time, Leo had no clue idea what Han Meng referred to.\nDaoist Name?\nAlias?\nLeo paused to think. His humor sense kicked in, and he came up with a meme nickname that was related to his origin.\n\"Call me Florida Man!\"\n\"F-Florida?\"\nHan Meng was stunned. He didn't understand what [Florida] meant.\nIn this world, Daoist Names represented a Daoist's achievements. Whenever a cultivator completed his golden core, they always received a title or a Daoist name from their senior, mentor, or parents. The titles always reflected the person's specialties and every cultivator took pride in the name.\nFor example, a swordsman could have [Swift Sword], [Quick Slash], [Invisible Blade], or [Library of Flying Swords] as his Daoist name. An alchemist could also potentially earn [Thousand Cauldrons], [Fiery Alchemist], or [Never Botch] as his title, but no one could obtain anything related to other fields that they weren't specialized in. Moreover, one person could possess one title in their entire life.\nAs a result, Han Meng pondered what [Florida] referred to. He wondered what kind of power or achievements Leo had accomplished to get it.\n'It must be something grand since I haven't heard of it before. I should go back and check the library what [Florida] means. Oh, I wonder if father knows what Florida means.'\nHan Meng bowed, bidding farewell, \"Very well, Benefactor Florida Man. I'll go back to my sect and inform you that you have greatly helped us today. If you need anything, please visit our Life Sword Sect. We will do our best to accommodate you.\"I think you should take a look at\nAfter saying so, Han Meng tossed a medallion to Leo. The latter caught it with one hand.\nLeo looked at the gold medallion and smiled, thinking that he had scored something valuable, \"Ah, go on.\"\nHan Meng leaped into the sky and disappeared into the clouds.\n.\nLeo watched the cultivator fly. He pouted, envious of Han Meng.\n\"I wish I could fly too. Oh, well. Nothing beats lifespan! How many years do I have now, my damn shopping system?\"\nDING\n<Your current lifespan: 787 Years, 11 months, 19 days, 8 hours, and 45 minutes.>\nBecause of the big sale, Leo had enough lifespan to purchase a house even though it was a store. Without hesitation, Leo spent 500 years of lifespan right away.\nDING\nA building menu appeared, showing the top-down view and the grits. The 10x10 blocks moved left and right according to Leo's fingertip as he could command the building to move anywhere on the map.\nAs Leo hadn't cleared the forest around the campsite yet, he moved his sleeping tent and other belongings to another area. Then, he placed the new building on top of the former campsite.\nThe ground was slightly elevated and flattened. Then, a large wooden cabin manifested on top of the flat floor.\nThe one-story cabin looked like something from the Wild West Era as it seemed old and dry. There were no display glasses like the modern grocery stores or general stores - Two small windows and a wooden door replaced them.\nLooking from the front of the store, Leo couldn't tell if it was a store or a cabin. Fortunately, the blank signboard on the roof was large enough to hint to passersby that it was a shop.\nDING\n<Please name your shop.>\n\"Oh? I didn't expect a service from you.\"\nLeo was surprised. He rubbed the ring on his left hand and named his store.\nThere was no need for thinking. He had dreamt of using this name for 50,000 years.\n\"We Sell Weeds!\"\nAlthough Leo had the urge to name it \"Chernobyl General Store\", he felt bad for the victims. Thus, he just used a respectable name instead of a meme to avoid offending the spirits of the incident's victims.\nThe store's name was automatically painted on the signboard. It looked a lot better with color even though it was glowing green.\nLeo walked around the store. As the map had shown, it covered a span of 100 square meters. Leo took a few minutes to walk around the building.\nHowever, Leo felt like it lacked something.\n\"There is no fence. Will it be okay? I hope there's no thief around here.\"\nLeo suddenly had an inspiration. He browsed the online shopping system and searched for certain hardware. After all, he couldn't call himself a \"Florida Man\" without big hammers!\nBut HAMMERS in Leo's dictionary referred to GUNS!\nDING\nThe shopping menu showed a series of arsenal from the modern world. Leo rubbed his hands and drooled.\n\"My precious…\"\nLeo fixated his gaze on the AR-15 in the catalog. He missed his old toys in the modern world.\nUnfortunately, the price was excessive. The system demanded 5,000 years of lifespan per a standard AR-15 without any mod. Leo shed the tear of a heartbroken man.\n\"5,000 years of lifespan?! System, you greedy motherducker! %$@#\"\n.\nAfter moaning and whining for an hour, Leo was sober. He silently entered his new house and gazed at the blank interior.\nHe finally came up with a solution.\n\"Fine. I can't just eat grass all day. I'll just convert whatever I have around me into stupid toxic weeds or something. I also need to chop down trees around here. I might get lucky if I find fruit seeds or something I can grow into mutated plants.\"\nLeo stopped sulking and inspected the store thoroughly. At the back of the house, there was another door to the storeroom or backroom. He checked the storage area on the back and discovered that he could use it as a bedroom as well.\nThe room's size was the same as a studio condominium – About 25-30 square-meter.\nHe started working. Leo purchased a storage bed from the online shopping system for himself. Then, he browsed the shop and looked for shelves for his ware.\nSince Leo had purchased a general store from the system, it wouldn't hurt to make it a real store!",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 8 – Florida Man Feeds Dire Wolf to His Cat\nHalf a day after Han Meng's visit, Leo finished decorating his store. It was modeled after a butcher shop.\nA display refrigerator and freezer chests were arranged on the west side of the store. This area was for the butchered beef, pork, chicken, and random meat. But for now, these freezers were left empty as he hadn't completely butchered the dire wolf yet.\nAs for the east area, Leo put fruit display refrigerators there and stored black weed in them. He arranged the grass like vegetables, making it easy to pick up.\nThe center area and the north zone were still empty. Leo couldn't place anything on the south area either as it was connected to the entrance and windows.\nFor now, the store's furniture was completed. However, Leo felt like this place lacked variety.\nLeo looked around and inspected the cabinet freezers.\nThere was one major problem. This place had no electricity, so the freezers didn't work.\nLeo scratched his head. He lightly touched the freezer glass and frowned.\nIt was hot. As the black grass kept emitting radioactive air, the surrounding temperature kept rising.\n\"What am I going to do with you? This is a waste of lifespan!\"\nLeo felt like he was scammed. He had the urge to throw away the freezer to the trash dump at the boulder. Thus, he lightly slapped the side of a refrigerator.\nDING\n<Would you like to upgrade the equipment?>\nLeo paused for a minute. He stared at the fridge and the system window. He had never seen this type of upgrade before.\nCurious, Leo pressed the confirm button.\n<Upgrading this refrigerator costs 100 years of lifespan.>\nLeo frowned. The system gave him prompt messages, but it didn't show what the upgrade could do. He rechecked his balance, wondering if he could afford it.\n<Your current lifespan: 237 Years, 11 months, 18 days, 20 hours, and 16 minutes.>\nAfter spending so much on furniture and refrigerators, Leo had 200 years in stock. Leo looked around and counted the fridges.\nThree glass-door fridges, two meat displays, and five slide-door chests – Ten in total!\n\"Do I need 1,000 years of lifespan to upgrade everything?\"\nLeo clicked his tongue. As he had nothing to lose, he agreed to spend 100 years on the upgrade.\nDING\n<The Supermarket Showcase Refrigerator has been upgraded to Level 2.>\nThe refrigerator glittered. The outward appearance didn't change. However, Leo instantly noticed the upgrade.\nThe electric wire no longer existed, yet the LED light was turned on. Moreover, cool air came out, rapidly decreasing the grass temperature.\n\"… Wow.\"\nLeo was in awe. The fridge no longer required electricity.\nInspired, Leo touched the second fridge.\nDING\n<Would you like to upgrade the equipment?>\n\"YES!\"\nDING\n<The Supermarket Showcase Refrigerator has been upgraded to Level 2.>\nJust like that, 200 years of Leo's lifespan was gone. He gazed at the two upgraded showcase fridges and nodded in approval.\nSince Leo only had two working fridges, he got busy again. Leo rearranged the black grass and put the rest outside the store. For now, he would eat the leftover food to get his lifespan back.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Han Meng returned to the sect and rushed into the tallest pagoda. He got to the top floor and strode into a large hall, where a bald man had been meditating inside alone.\nHan Meng brought out the black grasses and put them on the floor. He cupped his fist and reported.\n\"Father! Look what I've found. I've brought you 50 blades of immortal grasses!\"\nThe bald elder opened his eyes and gazed at his son. He wore a long coat and white robes – The uniform of the sect's grand elder. He had no facial hair or eyebrow, and his wrinkled skin seemed coarse and thick.\nWhen the grand elder saw the black grasses, he was stunned. He kept looking back and forth between Han Meng and the pile of grasses for a minute.\n\"THAT'S A LOT OF IMMORTAL GRASSES!\"\n\"Yes, father. With these, we can refine so many elixirs. We can increase our lifespan by at least 5,000 years or so!\"\nThe grand elder deeply nodded. He stood up and picked one of the grass blades. Then, he sniffed at it.\nIts odor was the same as burnt iron. They were legit immortal grasses of high quality.\n\"Contact Wu Buyi! Commission him to make an elixir first. If he's busy, ask him to put everything aside and complete this first!\"I think you should take a look at\n\"Yes, father! Hahaha, you are going live for a long time.\"\n\"Of course, I will! Anyway…\" The grand elder tossed the black grass to the pile. He gazed at his son, \"Where did you get these? I reckon the next secret realm's opening is a month away. Nobody should have gotten their hands on these.\"\n\"Oh, right. I forgot to report. Great news, father. An expert drops by, and he agrees to sell us his herbs. He seems to be a rogue cultivator that practices the art of life force. He asked me for my lifespan when he offered to sell me these.\"\nThe grand elder narrowed his eyes, worrying that his son might have been scammed.\n\"How many years did he ask?\"\n\"Only 10 years per blade of grass, father! Isn't that cheap?!\"\nThe grand elder's expression brightened. He let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"We're blessed. He seems to have goodwill toward our sect. Had it been me, I would have asked for 500 years for each grass.\"\n\"I think so too! Anyway, let's hurry and make you an elixir. We can't afford to let you run out of lifespan and die before your next breakthrough.\"\n\"Indeed. Let's visit Wu Buyi together.\"\nThe two men strolled toward the alchemy department, paying their pill maker a visit.\n.\n.\nAfter eating 40 blades of black grasses, Leo rechecked his lifespan.\n<Your current lifespan: 77 Years, 11 months, 18 days, 19 hours, and 45 minutes.>\nLeo was annoyed. He gazed at the stockpile in the freezer and counted them. From a rough estimation, Leo expected about six thousand blades of grass.\n\"I ain't gonna y'all! I ain't a COW… mooo.\"\nLeo thought of the dire wolf. Then, he remembered that he hadn't skinned it yet.\n\"Right. I drained the blood and removed the guts, but I haven't skinned or butchered it. I can make it into a BBQ!\"\nLeo went out of the store and inspected the hanging carcass in the woods. The blood had been drained, and the waste filled a plastic bin to the brim.\nSeeing the wet junk, Leo thought of the unknown roots in the septic tank. He wondered if that mutated plant could use them as fertilizer. He carried the bin to the boulder.\nUpon getting back to the boulder, Leo discovered that it was covered in green vines, which bloomed black flowers. The odor of burning iron and the aurora around it indicated that the vines and flowers were contaminated.\nLeo put the bin next to the boulder. He lightly poked the vine, wondering if the roots and the vines were from the same body.\n\"Ay, yo. Do you happen to eat blood and wolf's guts? I have some in the bin. Are you interested?\"\nWIGGLE\nOne of the vines extended and slithered toward Leo. It bloomed a black flower and dibbed the tip of the vine into the bin.\nThe green vine slowly changed color from green to brown as wolf blood entered its body.\nWIGGLE\nOne of the flowers grew larger, transforming into a large mouth of a black chomper plant. The mouth smiled and licked its lips. Then, it extended its long tongue, scooping the wolf's intestines into its mouth.\n\"…\"\nLeo quietly gazed at the plant monster. He used to witness monster mutations and evolution processes. However, he had never seen a mutated plant.\n\"Oh, boy. What the hell did I create?\"\nLeo laughed at the black chomper. He lightly patted its head.\nThe chomper plant grinned. Then, it let out a weird sound.\n\"Meow.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression changed. He had a funny feeling about this chomper.\n\"Are you a cat or a man-eating plant? Make up your mind!\"\n\"Meow.\"\n\"… A cat, I see. Okay, your name is [Cat], okay?\"\nWithin seconds, \"Cat\" finished everything in the bin. It licked its lips and then almost licked Leo's face. Fortunately, it pulled back its tongue as it sensed something dread from his skin.\n\"Good choice. Had you licked me, you would have died.\"\n\"HISS!!\"\nThe chomper shrunk back in fear. Leo laughed at it and carried the empty bin back.\nSeeing that Leo went back to his cabin, the chomper rested its large head on the boulder. Then, it revealed a mischievous grin.\n\"Meow!\"\nMore vines and roots spread toward the forest. Nearby trees slowly turned blue and emitted dense fog.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 9 : Florida Man Experiments with Steak, Attracts Vegan Neighbors\nSkinning is an art.\nButchering is an art.\nBut butchering and skinning a mutated animal is another story.\nLeo took off his hazmat suit as he couldn't stand the sweat and the heat. He wiped his sweat with his forearm and gazed at the skinless carcass of the mutated wolf.\nThe muscles were disfigured and black. Many parts were inflamed. A portion of bones was deformed, and smelly puss fluid leaked out from the ribs. No matter how Leo looked at it, the meat was inedible.\nLeo sighed and slowly cut the wolf into four sections. He tossed the rotten parts in a trash bin, leaving only useful meats. However, when Leo's hands touched the bones, they turned black and deformed once again.\nThe black bones turned into soft transparent jelly.\nLeo glanced at the pile of transformed jelly. Although he had done this with the monsters in the nuclear wasteland, their jelly bones gave off the pleasant odor of fried chicken. However, the wolf's jelly smelled like SurstrÃ¶mming.\n\"I wish I had some bread. Oh, well. Taste testing time. I'll buy some sandwich bread from the shop later if it works.\"\nLeo picked up a jelly rib cage and took a bite. His teeth crushed the jelly, and the fishy smell hit his nose. He closed his eyes, enduring the taste and scent of strong fish.\nAfter swallowing the jelly rib, Leo cleaned his palate by licking his teeth. It was not bad. It just lacked something.\n\"Ah, right. If I treat the grasses like spinach, can it get better?\"\nLeo rushed back to his store and brought a handful of black grasses. He coiled the leaves around the jelly bone as if it was a piece of sushi and put it in his mouth.\nThe strong taste of burnt iron blended with the salty fish's odor. Although both were bad, they gave birth to the ultimate salty and fishy sushi.\n\"DAMN SALTY!!\"\nLeo almost spat out his food. However, he had several ideas about what to do with them.\n\"Fine by me! Since you're salty, I'll grind both of you into powder and use you as salt... wait a minute. Speaking of salt...\"\nLeo stared at the mutated wolf's carcass. He thought of salt brine steaks, and his imagination ran wild. Although he wasn't a cook when he was a human, he had some experience in cooking mutated monsters.\n\"Brine steaks! How about salting the meat with modern salt from the shop? I can also use these salty grasses and jelly to replace salt, so I'll cook steaks with these and compare the taste! HAHAHA! This looks fun! Oh, wait. This salty thing should go well with SAKE! Oh, yes! I have a side dish for alcohol! HAHAHAHA!\"\nA wild grin appeared on Leo's face. He wiped the drool on his face and extracted jelly bones and meat.\n.\n.\nLife Sword Sect was well-known as an orthodox sect, which specialized in sword arts and flying swords. They had nothing to do with alchemy and botany. However, that didn't stop the sect from employing master alchemists from alchemy schools.\nOutside the west wall was a large farmland that belonged to the Life Sword Sect's alchemy division. This farmland grew spirit rice, which could be refined into grain pills. A courtyard and 20 one-story houses in the middle of the farmland were the workshops of a master alchemist and his assistants. Gao Yan also resided there with his new mentor.\nHan Meng and the grand elder, Han Hao, brought the black grasses and visited the alchemist elder in the courtyard. They showed them a blade of black-grass to see his reaction.\nWu Buyi had been working for Life Sword Sect as an alchemist elder for 150 years. He was a nascent soul stage cultivator, the same as the grand elder and Han Meng. He was also bald, but his goatee differentiated him from Han Hao. As for the rest of the features, they looked closely the same as if they were twins.\nBetraying Han Meng and Han Hao's expectations, the alchemist master didn't flinch. His hands reached out and picked up the leaf to check it up close.\n\"This is a thousand-year-old immortal grass. You have it too, I see.\"\nThe grand elder Han Hao looked surprised. Also, they heard the keywords.\nSomeone had it, too?\nHan Hao coughed and got to business.\n\"How about it, Wei Buyi? How many elixir pills can you make with this? Can you make about... five pills?\"\n\"FIVE?!\" Wei Buyi, the alchemist master scoffed. \"You must be joking! With this, I can make at least 20 if I have the other ingredients! Of course, the success rate will be very high because it's a high-quality ingredient. If I'm trying to make 30 pills, I'm sure at least 20 will come out perfectly! As for the rest, even if they are failed pills, they will still be edible! Put those in an auction, and many crazy bastards will sell their souls to get one!\"\nNoticing Wei Buyi's confidence, Han Meng and Han Hao laughed.\nOne pill could increase their lifespan by 100 years and improve their internal Qi by 1,000 years' worth of cultivation! However, Wei Buyi guaranteed 20 pills.\nMoreover, they still hid 49 blades of grass with the same quality. If they could force Wei Buyi to turn everything into pills, they would get about 1,000 elixirs!\n500 years of lifespan was well-spent. In elation, Han Meng could no longer suppress his facial muscle. He widely grinned as he was over the moon. Han Hao was the same. His expression was the same as Powerball Lottery winners.\nThey were rich!\nSeeing the obnoxious smiles of the father-and-son duo, Wei Buyi clicked his tongue. He could tell that both of them had more than one leaf.\n\"Tell me honestly. How many immortal grasses do you have?\"I think you should take a look at\n\"What are you talking about?\" Han Hao giggled.\nWu Buyi then dropped a bomb.\n\"Gao Yan has a whole bundle of immortal grasses, and I've promised to make pills for him. If he has a whole bundle, I know you have more. Also, we've been friends for 100 years, Han Hao! I can tell when you're hiding something from me. You always had that stupid smile whenever you boasted about your fortuitous encounters or newly acquired treasures!\"\nHan Meng looked at his father. The latter's smile was frozen.\nHan Hao's expression darkened for a moment before he decided to be honest.\n\"You're right. We have 50 grasses, including that one. All of them are the same quality.\"\n\"I KNEW IT!\"\nWei Buyi sneered. He stood and walked closer to Han Hao. Then, the former stared into the grand elder's eyes.\n\"You know me well, Han Hao. I'm not someone who steals resources or snitches my friends. Just tell me honestly. Where did you get those from? Was it from the same mysterious rogue cultivator in the forest? If you don't tell me, I'll freaking pack up and leave this sect!\"\nHan Meng deeply sighed. He confessed, \"From a rogue cultivator in a forest, yes. I went to investigate Gao Yan's case and found the person. He sold me 50 of these for 500 years of my lifespan.\"\n\"Ah, a similar story as Gao Yan's, I see.\" Wei Buyi was not surprised, but he figured out something important, \"Wait a second. If he can leech your lifespan, is he from an unorthodox sect? Is he an evil cultivator? Did he curse you?\"\n\"N-No. That's impossible! His aura is the same as the sect master! He has a bright rainbow aura, and light follows him everywhere!\"\nHan Hao and Wu Buyi were curious. They wanted to see this person.\nWu Buyi gazed at the grasses. He imposed a condition.\n\"I want half of the completed pills from these grasses. You provide me the immortal grasses, and I'll procure the rest.\"\n\"Half?!\" Han Hao frowned, \"Look, Buyi. We've brought you the key ingredients. Our share should be higher.\"\n\"You punks scammed a righteous rogue cultivator! If you two risked your life to get these, I would have asked only one-tenth of the share! But since you took advantage of someone else's kindness, I'll take half!\"\n\"Oh, come on! What about Gao Yan?\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"He's my core disciple, so all pills will belong to him!\"\n\"That's not fair, Buyi!\"\n\"No excuses, dammit! And you, Han Meng! You should have taken only one or two leaves from that person. I'm sure he tested your character and you FAILED, YOU GREEDY PUNK!\"\nHan Meng lowered his eyes. He felt guilty. As Wu Buyi had said - If the mysterious Florida Man tested him, he already failed.\n\"I-I'm sorry, senior. I was greedy.\"\n\"Haiz. You two are hopeless now. Anyway, since we've gotten the immortal grasses with us, I'll refine everything. Now, the next question.\"\nWu Buyi glared at Han Meng. He was still angry.\n\"What's this mysterious expert's name and origins?\"\nAs Han Meng was in front of two seniors, he obediently told everything.\n\"I-I don't know his name, but his Daoist name is Florida Man. By the way, I've been wanting to ask everyone. What is Florida?\"\n\"...\"\nHan Hao and Wu Buyi looked at each other. They had no idea what FLORIDA meant.\n\"What's Florida?\" Han Hao asked Wu Buyi.\n\"You don't know? Hell, if you don't know, how would I know?\" Wu Buyi yelled.\n\"But you're an alchemist. You know more about herbs, plants, and random vocabulary! All my life, I only trained in sword fighting! You're smarter than me!\"\n\"Haiya. You people are useless.\"\nWu Buyi gave up on the two. He walked back to his chair and sat down. Then, he declared his intention.\n\"Tomorrow, I'm going to pay that cultivator a visit. I'm older than you, so I can ask him from the source what FLORIDA means. Also, if he owns immortal grasses, I'm sure he has other top-rated plants and herbs.\"\nHan Hao smiled, \"I'll go with you. I want to see him too.\"\n\"No, if you go, he will definitely be offended because your son took advantage of him. I'm an alchemist. He can't afford to play tricks with me.\"\nWu Buyi was determined to use his identity as an alchemist to intimidate the mysterious cultivator for information. Also, he believed that this FLORIDA MAN had other herbs than the immortal grasses.",

Five more steak-cut were also placed on the same iron bars, letting off a nice smell from the black charcoal below.\nNo BBQ party was without a good cold beer. Leo sacrificed 20 years of his lifespan to purchase a gallon of beer and an ice machine. He made a bucket's worth of ice cubes and cooled the beer jar while he was busy with the grill.\nLeo checked the shopping menu for some fresh vegetables and seasoning ingredients. However, the price tag intimidated him.\n[Lettuce (1pc)] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Spinach (1pc)] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Cabbage (1pc)] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Carrot (1pc)] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Bell Pepper (1pc)] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nAside from alcohol, food-related items cost a lot. Beef and pork were worse as the shop demanded 5,000 years of lifespan per pound. Even a package of processed sandwich bread cost 2,500 years.\n\"It was three zeros less when I was on Earth! What the hell, shopping system?!\"\nLeo wanted to cry but he had no tears. He pursed his lips in frustration. In the end, he chose to purchase some seasoning sauces from the shop instead. He got salt, sugar, pepper powder, and BBQ sauce.\nAWOOO!\nAWOOO!\nWhile Leo was cooking, wolf howls echoed in the forest. Leo ignored them and minded his business. He put the medium-rare dog steak on a plate and sniffed at it.\nIt smelled like a roasted lamb. Although wolves rarely stored fat in their meat, it was juicy enough. Leo cut the steak with a knife. Then, he tested it without sauce.\nSurprisingly, it tasted like salmon with a roast lamb odor.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\nLeo widened his eyes. He only ate a mouthful of dog meat, but his lifespan increased by a year. He looked at the remaining food and estimated that each steak could grant him about 10-15 years of lifespan.\n\"Hot damn! I can get used to this!\"\nNothing beat good food. Leo added salt and pepper to the steak and gently cut it to fit a small bite. Then, he slowly enjoyed the rare taste.\nGRRRRR\nWhile Leo stood in front of his BBQ stove and chew his food, seven dire wolves walked out of the woods and surrounded him. They bore their fangs, snarling.\nLeo turned around while he carried the plate of steak. He widely grinned.\n\"How nice! More food just comes to me by itself. But this can be troublesome. I can't just mutate the rest of y'all, or you will rot before I can eat you.\"\nLeo's refrigerators were full, so he had no place to store more carcasses. Moreover, mutated carcasses rot at a faster rate than regular beef or pork due to the radiation. Leo also had about 40 pounds worth of wolf meat and 20 pounds of jelly bones to work with.\nSince it was impossible to eat all seven new wolves and the previous carcass, Leo operated the shopping menu, searching for a large cage for big animals.\nHe was not disappointed. A large cage for dogs cost only two years of lifespan. Leo picked up black grasses and shoved them in his mouth, replenishing his lifespan. Then, he bought two cages to test things out.\nGROWL\nOne of the wolves sprinted toward Leo and opened its jaws, aiming to snap Leo's neck in half.\nLeo tilted his head and dodged the mouth. He leisurely put on gloves and boots so that he wouldn't touch them. As soon as the first wolf attacked, two wolves came for his legs.\n\"Oh, tactical teamwork?\"\nLeo put down the plate and kicked one of the wolves. The right foot hit its head, which exploded on impact! Brain and flesh scattered everywhere, causing the six wolves to flinch.\nHe kicked the ground and instantly seized the necks of two nearby wolves.\nThe wolves resisted, baring their fangs at Leo. However, the old man patiently dragged the two doggies to the purchased cages. He tossed the two in one of the cages and locked it.\nWARRA\nUnfortunately, one of them caught Leo's left ankle. The others shifted the target to half-eaten meat on the plate.\n\"Ah, shit. My damn reflex. I'm getting old.\"\nLeo sighed and looked at the wolf that bit his ankle. Its fangs were sharp and the jaws were powerful. However, they failed to go through the combination of rubber and Leo's tough skin. He grabbed the back of its neck and lifted it up before its saliva or tongue touch his skin.\nSIZZLE\nThe fangs slowly rotted. Leo giggled and gently pulled its fang before the corrosion reached its gum. Then, he tossed it into the second cage.\nWhen Leo turned around, the three remaining wolves backed away. They got the half-eaten steak from the plate in their mouths, and they started chewing it, mocking Leo.\nLeo shook his head, \"Bad dogs. Oh, well. I have three more mutated dogs to butcher. Oh, I forgot. Make it four. I accidentally killed one.\"\nBy the time Leo finished his sentences, the three wolves collapsed. They foamed their mouths, but they hadn't been mutated yet.\nLeo walked toward them and checked their conditions. He found the half-eaten steak, which they had vomited.I think you should take a look at\nThey reminded him of the early days of the nuclear fallout period. At that time, Leo and many humans evolved into mutants as their cancer cells stopped trying to kill the hosts. They became immune to radiation and general ailments. However, they struggled with food issues as no livestock survived the ordeal.\nMutants soon hunted each other for food while Leo only ate rotten plants and poisonous mushrooms to live. He saw how a mutant died due to food poisoning after they ate fellow mutants or mutated animals.\nIt happened again. These wolves tried to eat a first-stage mutated animal, and they suffered the same fate as the others.\n\"Y'all are stupid. None of y'all mutated seven times as I did. You will probably die in a day or two because of minor radiation poisoning. I'll probably butcher you first before the cancer cells ruin the good non-mutated meat.\"\nLeo snorted and bought three more cages and tossed the sick wolves in there. Then, he checked the carnage that they had caused.\nThe steak on the grill was slightly burnt. The dish was broken, and the first piece of seasoned steak was already a mush due to the wolves.\nLeo calmly flipped the remaining steaks on the grill. They were slightly charred on one side, but they were still edible.\nLeo rested the steak and tidied the place. He put the doggy cages at the front of the store, waiting to be butchered. As for the headless one, Leo hung it upside down next to the store to drain the blood. After the chore, Leo returned to the BBQ grill and resumed cooking.\n.\n20 minutes later, Leo's belly was so round, and he couldn't eat anymore. He tossed the leftover steak to the trash bin, which would be given to \"Cat\" along with wolf's innards, inedible rotten meat, and blood.\nHe went to the stream and scooped a bucket of water to clean the dish. While he was at it, he rechecked his current lifespan.\n<Your current lifespan: 128 Years, 11 months, 18 days, 17 hours, and 49 minutes.>\nLeo profited a bit from one meal. However, he was dissatisfied.\n'At this rate, it will take ages. I can only get 50-70 years per meal. It will take a long time to upgrade every fridge in the house.'\nLeo deeply sighed and wished that someone would visit him to purchase the grasses again.\n.\n.\nWu Buyi floated in the sky, gazing at the dark blue forest east of the city.\nIn the Sword Saint Boulder Forest, blue trees, spirit grasses, and countless blue plants replaced the greenery. One-third of the forest glowed in blue light.\nIf the forest was only blue, Wu Buyi would have been overjoyed. However, at the place where the Sword Saint Boulder was located, a sinister aura of a monster stood out like a sore thumb. A thick fog covered its appearance, but the green aurora in the sky didn't hide its presence.\n'Green aura belongs to sentient spirit plants or wood-type monsters. I've seen countless tree monsters and man-eating trents, but I have never seen a plant monster that produces fog. Is that the work of the rumored rogue cultivator?'\nWu Buyi got closer to the fog. As he got closer, he sensed the aura of a newly mutated sentient plant. The alchemist let out a long sigh of relief.\n'Just a second-stage monster plant. It's harmless to me. A team of outer disciples can take care of that. I'll leave it to the outer disciple division.'\nBelieving in his strength and experience, Wu Buyi flew over the fog area. When he was above the Sword Saint Boulder, he gazed down, checking what the monster was.\nThen, Wu Buyi saw the large black chomper plant on the vines around the rock. It also looked up, smiling at him.\n\"Meow!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi paused and rubbed his eyes. He slightly shook his head to get rid of potential hallucinations. Then, he checked the monster again.\n\"Meow!\"\nIt was real. Wu Buyi wasn't dreaming.\n\"What the hell are you?!\"\n\"Meow!\"\nAlthough the chomper meowed like a cat, it opened its mouth like a newborn bird, asking its parent to feed it.\nWu Buyi's expression turned dark. He had the urge to uproot this monster plant and bring it back to the sect to study. However, he was afraid of offending the mysterious cultivator here.\n\"I'll come back and deal with you later. This place doesn't welcome a monster like you!\"\n\"Meow?\"\nThe chomper plant tilted its head, unable to understand the alchemist.\nThe old alchemist snorted and looked east. Then, he found a wooden cabin near the stream.\n\"That must be the one.\"\nWu Buyi ignored the chomper and flew toward Leo's shop.\n.\n\"Meow?\"\nMeanwhile, the chomper was crestfallen, disappointed that Wu Buyi didn't feed him.\n\"Meow...\"\nHe was hungry. Even though he had just eaten a lot, he wanted more.\nSuddenly, the wind picked up and blew from west to east, carrying the scent of the BBQ and wolf blood.\nChomper drooled. Its vines and roots wiggled, extending and following the scent toward the source. It dragged its body from the septic tank and the boulder, crawling toward Leo's cabin.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 11 : Local Cultivator Suspects Florida Man as Scammer, Gets Scammed\nAfter getting more meat sources, Leo got to work. He calmly butchered the headless wolf first and extracted its non-mutated meat. He also spent 100 years of his lifespan upgrading one of the freezer chests to store the food.\nCutting and skinning a wolf wasn't difficult since Leo didn't need to be careful about the quality. After all, he didn't run a butcher shop. The meat was for his rare non-contaminated food. Thus, Leo finished extracting the bones from the useful meat in minutes.\nFor the sake of the experiment, Leo tried holding the regular bones in with his bare hand.\nSIZZLE\nSure enough, it slowly turned green first. A few minutes later, it turned into black jelly.\nLeo shrugged and collected the jelly into one of the bins in front of his store. Since he hated salty food, he planned to convert these into fish sauce or feed it to \"Cat\" later.\nAfter he finished with the headless wolf, he turned his attention to the three dying wolves.\n\"Alright. Your turn.\"\nLeo approached the wolves. He opened one of the cages and dragged one of them over.\nAs Leo finished hanging the wolf upside down, an elderly bald man with a goatee descended and landed 10 meters behind him. Leo sensed the stranger and turned around.\n\"Hello, sir.\"\n\"... What's up?\" Leo calmly responded.\n\"My Daoist name is Green Thumbs, and I'm an alchemist from Life Sword Sect. I've been living here for decades, and I happen to notice that you've recently moved here. I wonder if I could know your name.\"\n'Daoist name again?'\nLeo wondered if the previous customer recommended his new friend to his shop. He smiled at a potential customer.\n'Alright, Mr. Green Finger. Since you've come here, you can't leave without spending your precious lifespan in my store. Let's see if he will buy my black weed, too.'\nLeo coughed and introduced himself, \"My Daoist name is Florida Man! Welcome! I assume you heard about me from your friend.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nThe elderly man stood there, looking at the wolves in the cages. He frowned and stared at the dying wolf that Leo had hung. Then, he glanced at the BBQ stove nearby.\nLeo followed the eyes of the old man and glanced at his BBQ equipment. He smiled, \"Are you interested in my cooking tools?\"\n\"Cooking tool?\"\n\"Yes. I use this to grill steak.\"\nThe bald elder frowned, \"You still cook despite your cultivation base?\"\nCultivation Base?\nLeo had never heard of the terms. He was curious if it was related to the visiting superhuman Daoists in this world. Still, for the sake of maintaining his face and reputation, he chose not to ask for a translation.\n\"What's the point of abstaining from food if you can live a thousand years? For starters, every person's time is limited. You should enjoy every little thing in life.\"\nAs Leo said, he activated the shopping domain and displayed the elder's lifespan status.\n.\nName: Wu Buyi\nAge: 108\nRemaining Lifespan: 852 Years, 4 Months, 20 Days, 1 Hour, and 15 Minutes.\n.\n\"Oh, wow.\"\nLeo was impressed. The previous guy had 700ish years to live, but this one rocked 850 years. Moreover, he was already 108 years old.\nHe giggled and walked back to his store. He then brought out a bundle of black grasses to show Wu Buyi.\n\"So, are you here to buy my weed, too? Is it so good that you need some for yourself?\"\n.\n.\n= A few minutes earlier, Wu Buyi's POV =\nAfter Wu Buyi left the chomper plant alone, he flew east and found a wooden cabin of Leo. He secretly lurked on top of a pine tree, observing the old man with long white hair and a white full beard.\nLeo was busy chopping a headless dire wolf's carcass with his cleaver. From Wu Buyi's perspective, his action looked the same as commoners.\n'Butchering? What's for? Cultivators like us can easily survive without food or water. If we really need one, we just use the grain pills instead. We can also digest Qi in the environment and obtain the necessary nutrition. Food only gives us impurities and fiber. It's going to annoy the hell out of you if you enter seclusion and need to go to a toilet or remove the impurity.'\nWu Buyi reprimanded Leo in his mind. He suspected that the latter was a fake cultivator, so he tried to measure Leo's strength.\nWu Buyi circulated his Qi into his eyes, gazing through the bright aurora and colorful aura of Leo. Then, he narrowed his eyes as he noticed something irregular.\nA sixth stage cultivator, aka the Soul Formation Stage cultivator, had a distinct colorful aura and presence. As they completed a complex array of their soul and physique, every movement of theirs always burst with vigor and force. A slight touch from them could instantly kill a commoner if they weren't careful, and no cultivators below the 3rd stage could withstand their natural pressure up close.\nHowever, from Gao Yan's story, Leo seemed to be a kind senior with the same aura as their sect master, who was also a soul formation cultivator. With that information, Wu Buyi found a loophole in Gao Yan's testimony.I think you should take a look at\nNo disciple in the sect could meet their sect master and have a proper conversation because of the master's natural pressuring aura. If Leo was really a sixth-stage cultivator, how did Gao Yan return unharmed after he conversed with him?\nMeanwhile, Leo, who was butchering a wolf, indeed had the same colorful aura as the sect master. However, he lacked the terrifying pressure of a sixth-stage cultivator.\nSomething was not right. Wu Buyi intended to investigate further by making contact with him. He came down from the tree and stood not far away from Leo.\nIt took a few seconds for Leo to turn around. Again, Wu Buyi found it strange.\nHad it been other experts, they would have drawn their weapons and attacked without an introduction. Leo's reflex and reaction speed were too slow.\n'Is he just slow, or is he that confident in his strength? I don't know anymore.'\nWu Buyi initiated the conversation first to probe for more information, \"Hello, sir.\"\nLeo turned around and smiled at him, \"What's up?\"\n\"My Daoist name is Green Thumbs, and I'm an alchemist from Life Sword Sect. I've been living here for decades, I happen to notice that you've recently moved here. I wonder if I could know your name.\"\n\"My Daoist name is Florida Man! Welcome! I assume you heard about me from your friend.\"\n\"... Indeed.\"\nWu Buyi slightly raised his eyebrows. He planned to ask about the meaning of \"Florida\" later. For now, he planned to unmask this suspicious old man.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm But then, Wu Buyi noticed strange tools in front of the cabin. One of them was a metallic cylinder with leg stands. As for the rest, they looked like containers, made from unknown bright materials.\n\"Are you interested in my cooking tools?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Cooking tool?\" Wu Buyi inwardly sneered. He mocked Leo for relying on cooking.\n\"Yes. I use this to grill steak.\"\nTesting Leo's character, Wu Buyi asked him, \"You still cook despite your cultivation base?\"\n\"What's the point of abstaining from food if you can live a thousand years? For starters, every person's time is limited. You should enjoy every little thing in life.\"\nLifespan?\nAt that moment, Wu Buyi almost smacked his forehead. He remembered that Han Meng and Gao Yan said that the Florida Man had one unique ability.\nLifespan stealing?\nLife force cultivator?\nAn unorthodox cultivator?\nWu Buyi leaned toward the last guess as Leo acted strange. Unfortunately, something appeared in front of Wu Buyi before he could jump to a conclusion.\nDING\nA wall of text manifested in front of Wu Buyi, revealing his own lifespan.\nWu Buyi widened his eyes in astonishment. He ignored the value of his remaining years and tried to touch the texts. However, his hands went through the menu as if they were holograms.\nHe didn't notice that Leo went back into his cabin and fetched an armful of black grasses to show him.\n\"So, are you here to buy my weed, too? Is it so good that you need some for yourself?\"\nWu Buyi stopped paying attention to his lifespan status and gazed at Leo. Then, he found a bunch of high-quality immortal grasses in his arms.\n\"T-This...\"\nA lot of things didn't make sense. Wu Buyi was confused.\nAs Wu Buyi had too many questions in his mind, he decided to be direct and ask Leo about his doubts.\n\"Seriously, sir. Who are you?\"\n\"As I said, I'm Florida Man.\"\nUnable to suppress his curiosity, Wu Buyi asked for a translation.\n\"What does FLORIDA mean, then?\"\nLeo grinned. He made a hush gesture and teased Wu Buyi, \"A faraway place that you can't possibly reach in your lifetime. Instead of wasting two billion years to get there, I suggest you be satisfied with what you have in this world.\"\n\"!!!\"\nWu Buyi picked up a few keywords. His brain calculated and deduced Leo's origin with the information.\nA faraway place?\nTwo billion years to get there?\nThis world?\nWu Buyi's breaths became ragged and short. He came up with a wild theory.\n'Is he from a cultivator from a higher realm?!'",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 12 – Florida Man Worshiped for Being Righteous Scammer\n'No mistaking it! He's a cultivator from a higher realm! But…'\nSeveral questions remained unanswered. Wu Buyi couldn't tell if Leo had further ulterior motives other than stealing cultivators' lifespan.\nNothing beat information from the source. Wu Buyi directly asked him.\n\"Which sect or cult are you from, Daoist Florida Man.\"\nLeo paused. As he had no background, he couldn't say that he came from an organization. Still, for the sake of rapport, Leo decided to be honest.\n\"I'm alone, mister. I'm not from a sect or religion.\"\n\"So, you must be a rogue cultivator,\" Wu Buyi made progress. He probed further. \"Are you cultivating life force? Is that why you need my lifespan?\"\nLeo was annoyed as this customer asked too much. Still, he wore a friendly mask and came up with an excuse.\n\"I'm just a wandering weed merchant. I always carry these and exchange them for lifespan. Also…\"\nLeo put the black grass on the table. Then, he picked up the jelly bone of the wolves from the trash bin. However, he accidentally touched the blood and innards of the headless wolf. Unnoticed, everything in the bin rapidly mutated.\nUnaware of the mutation in the trash bin, Leo leisurely showed the piece of jelly bone, \"I can also extract these things from monsters. Want some?\"\nWhen Leo picked the black jelly bones out, Wu Buyi was surprised by their aura and smell. He walked closer to get a better look, \"Can I see it?\"\nLeo was kind. He let Wu Buyi examine it.\nAs soon as Wu Buyi sniffed it, he instantly identified the thing.\n'Fenrir's bone marrow essence? Where did he get this from?! This is the key ingredient of supreme bone nourishing pills that can even help a patient regenerate their lost limbs!'\nFire in Wu Buyi's eyes was ignited. He rushed to the trash bin and noticed the pool of black blood, black innards, and similar bones in there. He almost vomited blood.\n'Fenrir's fresh blood, intestines, heart, and even liver?! Such precious ingredients are piling into this container? Why?! Doesn't this guy know what they can be used for? The heart can be made into dantian enhancement pills to expand one's Qi volume. Fenrir Intestine and Liver are the main ingredients of earth-grade antidotes, and they can even cure rotten flesh! Even the blood can be consumed raw to replenish one's lost blood and Qi. Oh, dear lord. What a waste!'\nThe alchemist's eyes were bloodshot. He coughed several times, suppressing his spiking blood pressure, excitement, and frustration.\nWu Buyi's voice cracked, \"Don't you know the value of these precious ingredients, fellow Daoist?\"\nLeo shrugged as he didn't think much of it. At the end of the day, these organs would turn into fertilizer for CAT.\n\"They're just cat food for me.\"\nOnce again, Wu Buyi coughed several times because of the heartache. Still, unlike Han Meng or Gao Yan, he suppressed his greed and maintained his clear mind.\n\"Is this a joke, fellow Daoist Florida Man?! Are you testing me just like you did to my junior?\"\nHearing that Wu Buyi know the previous customer, Leo brightly smiled. He thought to himself.\n'Indeed, words of mouth and viral are the best marketing method! I guess I need to calm this male Karen first and get on his good side. Then, I can scam him for more lifespan!'\nLeo stroked his beard and snickered, \"That was not a joke, mister. They have no value to me. But if you really need those things in my trash can, I'll sell everything to you.\"\n\"R-Really?!\" Wu Buyi's heart almost skipped a beat. He wondered how much Leo would demand such precious ingredients.\n\"Of course. However…\"\nLeo hesitated. As the innards, blood, heart, liver, and bones gave him no lifespan, he had nothing to compare its value. Thus, he couldn't think of a proper price tag.\nSince Leo couldn't come up with the right price, he pushed the task to Wu Buyi. He tested the alchemist for real.\n\"I'll let you name the price, mister. But bear in mind, I only need your lifespan. I don't need your money.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi gulped and gazed at the content in the bin, calculating how many rare pills he could get from these ingredients. He also wondered what expressions his alchemist colleagues would have when they see those precious medicines.\nFame\nGlory\nReputation\nThinking of the rewards he could potentially earn, Wu Buyi's blood pressure was over 200. His face reddened, and he sensed a throbbing pain in his neck and throat.\nEven though Wu Buyi was overwhelmed by greed and ambition, he was sober enough to think of the consequences of this deal. Since Leo allowed him to set a price tag, Wu Buyi didn't dare to take advantage of this opportunity.\n'This is clearly a test for me. Alright. Let's think this through. He came from a higher realm. His aura is the same as the sect master, but he has no natural Qi pressure of a soul formation stage. Well, since he's from a higher plane, his cultivation method might be so unique and mysterious to the point that I can't see through his abilities. As for these resources, they might have come from the higher realm as well. But there's one thing I'm curious about. I clearly saw him butchering the wolf and dumping the innards into this bin. Why did they turn into the mythical beast Fenrir's innards? Could it be…? Oh, right. He must have noticed my arrival, so he must have swapped the regular innards with the Fenrir's one to test me! Dammit. I'm so dumb!'\nAfter a long train of thought, Wu Buyi made a decision.\n\"Two hundred years!\" The alchemist declared.\n\"Two hundred?\"I think you should take a look at\nOn the other hand, Leo was surprised. He thought that he would get at best 10 years or so from the trash. He raised one of his eyebrows in amusement.\nSeeing Leo's complex expression, Wu Buyi broke a sweat. He thought that his offer was too low.\n\"Scrap that. Three hundred!\"\n\"Huh? Three hundred?\"\nAgain, Leo was stunned. His widened eyes were round, and he tilted his head to the side, giving Wu Buyi a meaningful look.\nNoticing the change of expression, Wu Buyi sweated profusely.\n'Was that not enough? Hold on a second. How could three hundred years be enough! The Fenrir Wolves are immortal beasts. Only a team of soul-transformation-stage experts can hunt one of them at a time. Of course, considering the expedition resources, 300 years of lifespan is an insult!'\nWu Buyi looked at his remaining lifespan in the floating menu. His breaths were ragged and short as he made the most important decision in his life.\n'Screw it. What's the point of living 800 years?! If I'm at wit's end, I can just borrow one of the immortal grasses from Gao Yan or Han Hao to extend my lifespan! I must give it my all!'\nFinally, Wu Buyi made his final offer.\n\"800 years! I'll give you all I have!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo blinked several times and rechecked Wu Buyi's lifespan again.\n'He has 852 years to live, but he's throwing 800 years for the trash? Is he retarded?'\nAlthough Leo needed lifespan to upgrade his store and improve his life quality, his mortal integrity stopped him from stripping this man of his precious lifespan. He purposely counteroffered to make it less painful.\nLeo shook his head, \"I'm not going to take advantage of you. I'll only take 500 years.\"\n\"EH?!\"\nWu Buyi's knees suddenly lost all strength. He fell on his butt and looked at Leo, wondering if he passed Leo's test.\nLeo continued, \"Look at me. Someone like me can't possibly open a shop in the middle of a city. If I do, people will die because of radiation poisoning. I also can't afford to let you run out of lifespan. I still need you to spread the word about my store, you know. Well, since you've shown me your sincerity, I can't let you leave empty-handed. Take the weed with you.\"\nAfter saying that, Leo shoved the armful of grasses to Wu Buyi and quickly finished the deal, taking 500 years from Wu Buyi's pool.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi gazed at the bundle of black grasses. Counting them with his eyes, there were more than what Gao Yan and Han Hao had. A few pills made from one leaf were enough to recover his life force!\nThe alchemist was moved to tears.\n'Not only do you bestow me precious ingredients, but you also give me a way to restore my lifespan. Lord Florida Man, you are indeed a righteous cultivator! Someone as kind as you can't possibly be from an evil sect! I was stupid. I should have believed in Gao Yan and Han Meng from the beginning!'\nWu Buyi slowly lowered his head and kowtowed.\n\"I swear with my dao oath. I, Wu Buyi, will never forget this kindness! I will cross mountains, jump into River Styx, or slay any immortal beast for you to return this favor!!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's eyes turned into small dots. He blankly stared at Wu Buyi as if he gazed at a weirdo.\n'What the hell did he smoke before he come here?'\nAwkward, Leo scratched his head and looked around. Then, he noticed that he had a lot of empty land that could be turned into farmland.\n'Right. I can't rely on black grasses as the only merchandise. I should try something else, such as vegetables and fruits. How about growing them here? I'll sell both conventional veggies and mutated ones. Maybe these freaks will like it.'\nLeo coughed and came up with an idea.\n\"Actually, I have a favor to ask. I need to buy something from the city. I wonder if I can commission you.\"\nWu Buyi looked up. His pupils sparkled as if he was an anime character, \"Of course! You can count on me! I'll run an errand for you!\"\n\"Err,\" Leo was taken aback by Wu Buyi's change of attitude. Still, he made his request, \"I need some local fruits and vegetables. Oh, do they sell their seeds? I wish to grow some crops here.\"\n\"Crops?\"\nWu Buyi widely grinned. As an alchemist, he was well-versed in herbs and plants.\n'Ah, is he planning to make a spirit farm here? Come to think of it, the forest has turned blue. He must be trying to convert this useless forest into spirit farmland. If I can persuade him to stay here, the Life Sword Sect can get another source of spirit herbs!'\nWu Buyi rubbed his hands like a crooked merchant, \"Of course, sir. I'll go get the best quality seeds for you!\"\n\"About the payment,\" Leo smiled and was about to exchange his lifespan for gold bars. However, Wu Buyi interrupted him.\n\"No need, sir! I'll take care of everything!\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 13 – Florida Man Claims He Deciphers Cat Language\nWu Buyi collected the grasses and trash bin into his spatial ring. Then, he flew away.\nAfter the alchemist had left, Leo giggled as he managed to get 500 years richer. He rushed to the cabin and upgrade five slide-door refrigerator chests. He transferred the regular wolf meat into one of them and stored the mutated one in another.\nThe meat storage issue was resolved. Most freezers were now functional, and Leo could start displaying his goodies in the display fridges.\nLeo couldn't stop smiling. He danced his way out of the store and returned to the butcher site. However, when Leo got outside, he saw something disturbing.\nA walking chomper plant was eating one of the wolves.\n\"Cat\" was here.\nAs soon as Cat noticed Leo's presence, it turned around to greet him.\n\"Meow!\"\nLeo frowned at it since it was eating his food, \"Yo, you silly cat. That's my food though.\"\n\"HISS!\"\n\"…\"\nThe chomper hissed as it protested. It continued chewing the wolf, savoring the taste of fresh blood.\nLeo gazed at the plant and measured its size with his eyes. Its head was about one meter tall and the length was about the same. It barely managed to eat the dire wolf whole, and it struggled to chew the hard bones as its teeth were still too soft.\nSeeing how it struggled, Leo offered it a deal.\n\"Look. I know you're hungry, but you're not supposed to steal unprocessed food. If you let me process it for you, I'll give you the blood and the soft innards, okay?\"\n\"Meow?\"\nUnable to understand Cat, Leo tried to use the shop domain function if it could translate the meowing language.\nDING\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 700 Years\n.\nThe system displayed Cat's lifespan, and Leo almost coughed blood, envious of the monster.\n\"What the hell?! How is your lifespan so long?! Oh, wait. He's a plant, of course.\"\nLeo suddenly had a sick idea. He wondered if he could extract Cat's lifespan, so he tried to steal it.\nDING\n<Shop Domain requires the customer's consent before you can extract the customer's lifespan.>\n\"Tsk.\"\nHe failed. Unless Cat allowed Leo to take his lifespan, he couldn't steal it.\nThus, Leo tried to scam it.\n\"Hey, kitty cat. Look here.\"\nLeo walked toward one of the wolf cages. He dragged the dog out and grabbed it with his bare hand, causing the dire wolf to swell. It stopped moving, and its soul was Isekaied to the afterworld.\nWhile Cat was busy with the regular wolf, Leo hung the wolf upside down and slit its throat, draining its blood. He also cut its stomach and harvested the internal organs.\nLooking at the black heart of the wolf, Leo pursed his lips, wondering why Wu Buyi overreacted because of these unusable parts.\n'Come to think of it, what was his job again? He introduced himself as… what? Chemist? No, this is a Wuxia world. Chemists don't exist. What was the term again?'\nA long time passed since Leo last read a novel or watched movies. He tried hard to recall the word. Leo had a feeling that he almost got it, but it got stuck at the back of his head.\nUnable to recall the word, Leo deeply sighed. He allocated the intestines to a new bucket, but he kept the fresh heart and liver in another container. Then, he showed Cat the container with the intestines.\n\"Kitty, those are too hard to chew. How about something softer? Oh, it won't be free, of course. I'll need to take some of your lifespans in exchange.\"\n\"Meow?\"\nCat stopped trying to chew a whole wolf. It sniffed and crawled toward the bucket of blood and innards. As soon as one of its roots touched the content, it spat the wolf out and chowed the intestines instead.\nLeo shook his head. He walked toward the half-eaten wolf and spat on it.\nA few seconds later, the corpse mutated and turned black. Although disgusting, Leo chopped it into smaller pieces for Cat to eat.\nCat finished the bucket of blood and intestine in seconds. It turned around to the half-eaten wolf and discovered the pleasant smell of salty and fishy meat.\n\"MEOW!\"\nIt hummed and shoved the cut pieces into its mouth. Like a glutton cat, it meowed while it chewed the precious food.\nNot having anything else to do, Leo observed the man-eating plant. He wondered if this guy was worth raising as a lifespan farm.\nDING\nWhile staring at Cat, the creature's status changed.\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 2,300 Years\n.\n\"What in the hell?\"\nCat's lifespan sharply increased. Leo widened his eyes in astonishment.\n*BURP*\nCat let out some gas and smiled in satisfaction. It then turned to the hanging carcass of another mutated wolf and licked its lips. Then, it crawled toward it, hoping to get more meat.\nHowever, Leo stood in front of it. He crossed his arms.\n\"Kitty, you haven't paid me for the meal. You need to pay up.\"\n\"Meow?\" It tilted its head. It touched its lips with a big purple leaf.\n\"What do you mean by paying? Of course, your lifespan. You need to transfer some of your lifespans to me in exchange for the food. If you don't give me lifespan, I can't keep feeding you.\"\n\"Meow, meow? Meow!\"\nThe chomper suddenly smiled. Then, Leo received a message.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 2,300 years!>\n\"OH… HOLD ON A SECOND!! That's too much!\"\nInstead of being overjoyed, Leo instantly noticed the problem - Cat just gave him all of its lifespans!\nThe plant rapidly withered. Cat looked exhausted, and its movement speed was as slow as a sloth.\n\"Meow…\"\nNot allowing Cat to die, Leo grabbed the heart and liver in another bucket. He fed the liver to the plant. He also squeezed the heart like a lemon to give the chomper some more blood.\nDING\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 200 Years\n.\nCat's roots, leaves, and vines regained their luster. It swallowed the liver and blood as if it had never eaten anything for days.\nThe plant let out a long sigh of relief. It wearily purred and nudged its head against Leo's stomach.\n\"You dumb cat. I want your lifespan, but you don't have to give me everything! Well, since you already gave me a lot, I'll keep feeding you. You don't have to give me anything anymore.\"\n\"Meow?\"I think you should take a look at\n\"Yes, I'm adopting you. You're my cat now.\"\n\"Meow!\" Cat licked Leo's face.\nAt that moment, Leo realized something horrible. Once again, Cat innocently made a huge mistake.\nLeo's skin was radioactive and poisonous. Touching him meant instant death or rapid mutation!\n'Did it just touch me? Oh, crap! NOOO!! It's going to mutate and die, dammit!''\nLeo held in his head in panic and despair.\nIf Cat ran out of lifespan, Leo could simply replenish it by feeding it the mutated wolf's blood, meat, or organs. However, he was helpless when it came to mutation.\nLeo shut his eyes in regret, not wanting to witness the torturous moment of his first pet in 50,000 years.\nA minute later, Leo sensed a nudge at the back of his head. A soft head of a plant bonked him.\n\"Meow!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Meow, Meow!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo turned around in shock. Then, he found the chomper plant, which looked the same as he remembered him.\n'He is unaffected?'\nLeo's trembling hand reached for Cat's head. He gently touched it and slowly stroked it. Surprisingly, the chomper purred.\n\"…\"\nNo mutation occurred. The chomper plant remained the same.\n\"You, you're not affected by my radiation?\"\n\"Meow?\"\n\"What is radiation? Dammit, it's poisonous air. If you touch me, the radiation poisoning will change your DNA structure and disable your healing abilities! Some of your cells will riot and try to French-Revolution you from the inside. In short, all nutrition you have in your blood cells will nourish cancer cells and mutated DNA, turning you into a disfigured monster!\"\n\"Meow, meow?\"\n\"HOW DID I KNOW?! Listen here, you little shit. You're looking at the lottery winner from the Fallout world. My DNA structure got reconstructed seven freaking times. I freaking died and came back to life seven times, okay? Let's not make you repeat the torture I went through.\"\n\"Meow, meow-meow?\"\nThe chomper plant licked Leo's face and nudged its head against his. The latter stopped talking and facepalmed.\n\"You're right. I'm an idiot. You're immune to my radiation now because you evolved… DAMMIT, how did I understand your freaking language even though every word sounds the same?!\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nLeo covered his face and squatted. He felt like he was about to become crazy. Since the plant was immune to his touch, he patted Cat and deeply sighed.\n\"Oh, well. Whatever. Do you still need to eat more?\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nAfter the hectic incident, Leo dug the soil next to his store and allowed Cat to plant its roots there. The chomper happily enjoyed the nutrition in the mutated soil that Leo often stepped on.\nIn the end, Leo mutated another wolf and donated the innards to the plant, but he kept the heart and liver for emergencies. Its lifespan increased to 1,500 years. As for two mutated wolves' meat, Leo chopped them into small cuts and chilled them in the freezer chest. He also upgraded the three remaining freezers to make them active.\nWith over 2100 years of lifespan in his account balance, Leo started planning to upgrade his shop further. He touched one of the supermarket refrigerators to check if he could upgrade it again.\nDING\n<Unable to upgrade. Require Humble General Store Level 3.>\n<Please upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 3.>\n\"…\"\nThis was the first time Leo heard about this condition. Confused and interested, Leo lightly touched the wall of his store, wondering if he could upgrade it.\nDING\n<Will you upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 2?>\n<Upgrading requires 1,000 years of lifespan.>\nLeo stared at the messages for several minutes due to the utter shock. Then, he yelled.\n\"Damn expensive! It's just level freaking two! What about level 3? How much does it cost?\"\nNo answer came from the system. Once again, it left him in the dark.\nLeo was not an idiot. If the level two upgrade required 1,000 years of lifespan, the level 3 upgrade might cost him 2,000 to 3,000 years, depending on the system's cheapskate algorithm.\nLeo postponed the store upgrade for now as it wasn't necessary at the moment. He walked out of the building and looked at the three healthy wolves in the cages. He widely grinned.\n\"Stay there obediently, and I'll butcher you tomorrow.\"\nThe wolves barked at Leo as if they understood his intention. They tried to break the cage, but they ended up hurting themselves.\nLeo ignored the wolves and proceeded to the area behind his store. It was an empty plot with a few tall pine trees and bushes. However, because Leo used to walk around here with bare feet to uproot the grasses, the soil was dark. Some parts emitted green smoke as if some chemical substances had been buried there.\nAlthough Leo could manually plow this area and turn it into a radioactive vegetable garden, he had another idea of what he could do to this place. He started counting his steps.\n\"3…4…5… Ah, crap. These stupid trees are on the way. I want another 10 x 10 blocks as a backyard farm.\"\nLeo hugged the pine trees that stood in the way of his future farm plot.\nCREAK\nLike the Hulk, Leo uprooted the massive tree by pulling it off the ground. Then, he tossed it to the side and patted his hands as if it was an easy task.\nCat witnessed everything from start to finish. It shivered in fear, imagining itself being uprooted by Leo.\n\"Meow!\"\nLike a scardy cat, it came out of the ground and climbed the store. Then, it sat on the rooftop, warily staring at Leo.\nAfter bringing down an entire pine tree, Leo moved to another one, using his bare hands without any protection. The blue tree turned black and was pulled out from the ground one after another.\nWhen Leo finished his job, he got seven mature pine logs lining up in his backyard.\n\"If this is a resource-gathering game, I might need to chop these logs into lumber. But since they are mutated, are the leaves and nuts edible?\"\nLeo proceeded to collect black pine leaves and nuts. He wondered if he could sell these things to Wu Buyi or his friends again.\n'Come to think of it, I might need to interrogate that last guy. What the hell is he going to use the innards for? Chemistry? No, what was it again?'\nLeo scratched his head. While he was in deep thought, he saw a mosquito fly by. Because of his reflex, he clapped it without looking.\n'Clap? Hand claps? Clapping hands… Full Metal Alchemist? AH! ALCHEMIST!'\nFinally, Leo remembered Wu Buyi's occupation. He smacked his forehead.\n'Right! Alchemists! Those Chinese martial arts novels are crazy about those alchemists. They can turn every little thing into pills and medicines… wait. Pills and meds? Drugs?'\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He began to grasp why Han Meng and Wu Buyi were crazy about the black grasses.\n'Alchemy, is it? Wait, isn't there something similar in the system shop?'\nLeo opened the shopping menu and switched the tap to [Shop Domain System], where he had purchased the cabin from. He rechecked the list of buildable structures.\nOne of them was an alchemist workshop.\n\"Hohoh?\"\n.\nBasic Alchemist Workshop\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 2\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10",

But seriously, even if I have the workshop, I have no clue about pill-making and alchemy. Also, I need to clear the backyard.\"\nAlthough the workshop was expensive and the pill-making method was unknown, Leo was motivated. He resumed clearing the bushes and trees, making room for the new building.\nAs Leo was done with the large trees, he turned his attention to the smaller bushes, starting with the dry and thorny ones. With bare hands, he grabbed the thorny vines of a hard bush and pulled them out.\nHISS\nA snake suddenly jumped out of the bush and bit the back of his hand. However, its fangs failed to penetrate his skin. Still, it spat poisonous substance at Leo.\nDespite being bitten, Leo leisurely grabbed its tail and tossed it toward an empty area. A few seconds later, the snake swelled like a balloon and died from the mutation.\nBefore Leo could process the snake for meat, a certain cat scooped the dead snake with its vines and put it in its mouth. The chomper plant happily ate anything that contained blood.\nLeo scratched the back of his hand, swiping the liquid away as it made his hand itchy. He resumed pulling bush vines, enjoying his little adventure in his backyard.\nWhen the sunset, Leo stopped working. He looked at the vines, which were hardened and blackened because of his radiation. Because of boredom, Leo grabbed the longest vine and cracked it like a whip. It caused a crisp sound as the tail hit the ground.\n\"Oh, yeah. Leo Belmont is gonna hunt you Dracula down.\"\nFantasizing himself as the main character from the Castlevania Series, Leo randomly swung the vine whip around.\nCRACK!\nRUMBLE\nThe whip accidentally hit a pine tree 30 meters away, cutting it in half. The tree fell and caused a loud noise in the woods.\n\"...\"\nBecause of the loud noise and the broken tree, Leo flinched. He stopped fooling around and coiled the thorny vines. Then, he silently hung it on the back of the store, keeping it as a toy.\nUnfortunately, his free time was cut short. From the corner of his eyes, Leo discovered a flying man in white robes approaching at a high speed.\n\"Ah, crap. Here we go again.\"\nThe visitor was none other than Wu Buyi. This bald man slowly descended and landed in front of the store.\nLeo stopped what he was doing and walked to the front of the store. Then, he noticed that Wu Buyi had brought 30 baskets of fruits, vegetables, and herbs.\nWu Buyi looked up. Despite being in the dark, his eyes beamed in green light as if they were a spotlight, brightening the area in front of the store. As soon as he saw Leo, Wu Buyi cupped his fist.\n\"Oh, hello, Sir Florida Man. I wasn't planning to disturb you. I'm here to deliver the fruits and veggies that you requested me.\"\n\"My request?\"\nLeo paused for a moment and remembered that he asked him to buy some fruits and vegetable seeds from the city.\n\"Oh, right. The veggies. Thank you very much. How much are they?\"\nWu Buyi quickly waved his hands, \"You don't need to pay, sir. You've already given me plenty. This is not even half of what I owe you. Oh, this is all that I can find within half a day. I'll visit the neighboring towns to gather more for you.\"\n\"...\"\nLeo didn't hate free food. He nodded and let Wu Buyi do whatever he wanted.\nLooking at Wu Buyi, Leo remembered the alchemist subject and the wolf's blood. He asked the old man directly.\n\"By the way, mister. What do you need the wolf's blood for? Is it for a... cultivation pill?\"\nWu Buyi dryly laughed in embarrassment, \"Truth to be told, yes, sir. For me, Fenrir's blood and innards are extremely rare ingredients. We couldn't find them anywhere on the mainland no matter how hard we tried. Only the soul-transformation-stage cultivators can risk their lives to get them from a mystic realm. With the blood and innards, the Life Sword Sect will thrive, and even I will benefit from them.\"\n'Fenrir's blood?'\nLeo raised his eyebrows in amusement. Then, he asked further to make sure.\n\"What about the grasses?\"\nWu Buyi confessed, \"Ah, those? The immortal grasses are the key ingredient to the legendary immortal pills that can extend our lifespan. Wait, I thought you knew about them.\"\nLeo snorted and waved his hand, \"Ah, I just wanted to make sure if your culture is the same as mine. Don't worry about it.\"\nWu Buyi laughed, \"Of course. You must be surprised since you've come from a faraway place. Culture shock is a thing. Anyway, is there anything else I can help you?\"\n\"...\"\nLeo had another doubt. He glanced at the three dire wolves in the cages.\n'So, the radioactive weeds are immortal grasses? The mutated wolves are called Fenrir? What the hell?'\nProbing for more information, Leo pointed at the dire wolves in the cages. He asked Wu Buyi, \"What about them? Are they Fenrir, too?\"\nWu Buyi looked at the caged wolves and burst into laughter, \"Of course not, sir. They're just regular animals. They're not even a spirit beast.\"\n\"...\"\nLeo had the urge to mutate them in front of Wu Buyi, but he chose to keep it a secret. He mimicked the alchemist and cupped his fist.\n\"Thank you mister for the fruits and vegetables. You've really saved me.\"\n\"That was nothing,\" Wu Buyi laughed. \"Anyway, I'll be going. I'll revisit you again after the trip.\"\n\"Sure...\"\nWu Buyi took off and left. He disappeared into the night.\n.\n.I think you should take a look at\nWhile flying in the dark sky, Wu Buyi laughed in a good mood. After leaving the store for a minute, he looked back to check the conditions of the forest.\nThe fog got thicker, and it concentrated around Leo's cabin. As for the area around the Sword Saint Boulder, no fog was present. At night, blue pine trees glowed in the dark, bringing color to the plain forest.\nWu Buyi widely grinned.\n'The trees start to evolve. Sir Florida Man must have been using an artifact or his ability to convert everything around him into a spirit farm. If my theory is correct, a new spirit herb farm will appear in the forest. If better, he might convert those fruits and vegetables into something new. Also, judging from his demeanor and style, his specialties should be in the botany field. Hehehe, if he's really a botanist, I should invite him to the annual alchemist gathering at the end of the year. I wonder how the other alchemists from Death Sword Sect and Pacifist Sword Sect will react if they know that we have a botanist from the higher realm here.'\nWu Buyi started humming and returned to the Life Sword Sect.\n10 minutes later, he got back to his residence and found Gao Yan sitting in the herb garden alone, staring at a sprout of a herb.\nCurious, Wu Buyi landed behind Gao Yan. Then, he uttered.\n\"Is that herb that interesting?\"\n\"Ah, master!\" Gao Yan jolted and stood up, \"Disciple is studying the spirit coriander. I read from the encyclopedia, and the book said that it had a pleasant smell. I just want to try sniffing on it. And then, I notice that a new sprout is growing at night.\"\nWu Buyi nodded in approval. He taught Gao Yan a lesson that wasn't in a book.\n\"Coriander herbs are usually used in cooking. But for that spirit coriander, we commonly use it as an optional ingredient to suppress foul odor because of its pleasant scent and its neutral Qi nature. When we put them in a cauldron to refine pills, it automatically harmonizes the rampaging fire Qi and wood Qi in the ingredients. Many rookie alchemists rely on them to increase their refining success chance because of their traits.\"\nGao Yan was enlightened. He smiled for a moment before his expression looked gloomy. He seemed depressed.\n\"But disciple can only use wood Qi. I can't use fire Qi like the other alchemist disciples. I don't know if I belong here.\"\nAfter coming here, regular outer disciples respected him. However, the other alchemists ignored Gao Yan, and they refused to share their knowledge, making him depressed.\nNoticing Gao Yan's inferiority complex, Wu Buyi smacked the back of the disciple's head\n\"You fool. Your constitution has a high aptitude in wood Qi, but that doesn't mean you can't cultivate fire Qi in the future. When reaches the golden core stage, you can cultivate a secondary elemental Qi. By then, you can use both fire Qi and Wood Qi, and that is when your advantage shines! Your dantian will condense something called \"Wood Essence\" and it can be used to refine precious herbs that Fire Qi specialists can't do! They will naturally kowtow and beg you to help them refine their herbs in the future! Don't look down on yourself!\"\nOnce again, Gao Yan was enlightened and motivated. He bowed to his master.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"This disciple will keep that in mind! I'll work hard!\"\n\"Hahaha! Maintain that motivation, and you'll quickly learn so many things. Come. Let's go have some tea. I'll teach you more about herbs.\"\nThe master and disciple duo continued to chat as they walked back to their residence to rest.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo checked the 30 baskets of vegetables and fruits. 25 of them contained only cabbages and potatoes. Four were filled with bananas, and the other one was full of corianders.\nInterested in the new goodies, Leo carefully picked up one of the cabbages with his bare hand. The green veggies instantly turned purple and emitted red smoke.\nLeo sniffed at it, wondering what a mutated cabbage tasted like. Strangely, its odor was the same as regular cabbages.\nHe peeled its skin and chewed it. It was soft and sweet like freshly boiled vegetables. Also, it had the aroma of Earth and freshly cut grasses.\n\"This is awesome! I can use this to replace sandwich bread.\"\nLeo finished the cabbages and waited for feedback from the system.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by five years.>\nIt was worth the wait. Although eating the entire cabbage made him full, he got something out of it.\nLeo put on his gloves and carried the cabbage baskets to his store. He put them in the fridges, filling the rest of the slide-door chests to the brim. Afterward, he returned to check the other goodies outside.\nThe potatoes were a no-brainer. Leo carried the baskets to the middle of the store and left them there as he couldn't preserve them in a freezer. Bananas were also the same as they came in green. Leo had to wait a few days before it could turn yellow and become edible.\nAfter Leo put the banana and potato baskets in the store, his attention turned to the coriander. He brought them into his store and arranged everything in one of the supermarket display fridges. After all, these delicate herbs required a chilling and humid temperature to preserve.\nWhen Leo finished tidying everything, he picked up a stalk of coriander to get a closer look. Strangely, everything in this batch produced strange blue air, and it was warmer than usual.\n\"Huh? Aren't they the regular ones?\"\nCurious, Leo plucked a leaf and put it in his mouth to taste it. As Leo had expected, it had a strong scent of green herb that hit his nose. However, it had an extra flavor.\nThere was a faint lingering taste of coffee beans at the tip of his tongue.\nAlthough the herb didn't reward him anything, Leo raised his eyebrows in surprise. He had forgotten how the coffee tasted like after the nuclear apocalypse, but he got to savor the bitter aroma once again.\nMoving to tears, Leo looked at the remaining coriander. He held his hands in prayer.\n\"Bless Jesus for giving me coffee coriander! I'll grow them well!\"\nLeo bit his lower lips and mustered his courage. He picked another coriander stalk with his bare hand, converting it into a mutated plant. The stalk and leaves instantly blackened, and its strong aroma exuded throughout the store. The stalk's temperature rose, and it produced white smoke.\nThe scent smelled exactly like hot black coffee!\nWithout hesitation, Leo rushed into the storage room and brought out a cup of water. He put the mutated coriander in the cup for an experiment.\nAs Leo had predicted, the water turned black. It was also heated up because of the mutated herb's natural hot temperature. Without hesitation, Leo slurped the black water.\nThe rich aroma of black coffee made his pupils dilate. He almost dropped the cut and the hot water as his theory was correct.\nLeo got himself a coffee, a mutated coffee!\n\"HALLELUJAH!!\"\nLeo was never this happy. His voice was so loud that birds in the vicinity woke up and flew away from their nests.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 15 : Uncle R. Enraged as Florida Man Cooks Fried Rice Using Raw Pine Nuts and Leaves\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\nWith just one cup of coffee, Leo's lifespan increased by a year.\nTen minutes later, Leo finished his first coffee after coming to this world. After today's experience, Leo could give a piece of advice to everybody.\n\"Never drink coffee at night, ever.\"\nLeo was wide awake. His eyes were bloodshot, and he had the urge to continue working all night. Fortunately, he was sober enough to restrain his workaholic nature.\nAlthough having mutated corianders were awesome, Leo couldn't convert all of them at once due to storage limitations. The supermarket fridges could lower the food's temperature, but they could not suppress the mutated coriander's burning hot traits.\nLeo still held the coriander stalk that he had used to make a cup of coffee. It still produced hot air and white smoke. He could also sense its high temperature from his skin. Judging from the feeling, Leo estimated that the herb was about 60-70 degrees Celsius.\n'How the hell do I store this thing? If I put it in a fridge, the fridge will be broken. But if I leave it alone, it might catch fire. But if I directly eat this, I will waste the free coffee generator... Ah, damn. I'm stupid. I can just drop this thing in a pot of water or something.'\nLeo held the coriander stalk in his mouth while he operated the system shop. He purchased a set of glass pots and a table. Then, he arranged the table next to the south window and put the pots on it. After filling the pot with drinking water, he dropped the herb into the container.\nThe water bubbled as if it was instantly boiled. The water blackened and emitted a rich coffee aroma.\nLeo brightly smiled and covered the pot with a glass lid. He then admired the 4-liter pot, which was filled with coriander coffee.\n\"Coffee machine, done! Next, time to upgrade the store and put that workshop on.\"\nLeo put his palm on the wall.\nDING\n<Will you upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 2?>\n<Upgrading requires 1,000 years of lifespan.>\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was time for some upgrading as the store had no source of light or electricity. Leo couldn't stand working in the dark house alone at night.\nAs soon as Leo confirmed the upgrade, the ceiling became taller. The poorly placed windows transformed into displaying windows, and fluorescence light bulbs appeared. They automatically turned on, illuminating the interior in the dark night.\nEEEEEEEEEEE\nThe buzzing hum of fluorescence lights was so loud that it annoyed Leo. However, the store was brighter than before.\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 2.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nLeo flinched for a moment as he felt like he had heard that quote from somewhere else long ago, but he couldn't remember. He ignored the voice and inspected the changes in his store.\nAside from the display windows, the wooden floor and the walls seemed sturdier. No wind leaked into the building anymore. However, as no ventilation existed, the air in the store was stale.\nWithout circulating wind and air conditioner, Leo was dissatisfied. He opened the front door, back door, and a side window to let the airflow. Then, he walked out of the house.\nThe moonless sky provided no source of extra light. Everything outside was pitch black. Fortunately, the purple fluorescence light illuminated a small area around the building.\nZAG-ZAG-ZAG\nThe chomper plant on the rooftop seemed to be active at night. It crawled down from the roof and disappeared into the forest.\nThe weather outside got colder at a rapid rate. Leo pursed his lips as he found the chilling weather nice and refreshing. He had been living in the dry freezing world for 50,000 years, so a humid and chilly night was like a warm breeze to him.\nAs Leo couldn't sleep, he strolled to the backyard to resume his work.\nFor the entire night, Leo manually cleared the field for his workshop.\n.\nWhen one indulged in an activity, that person's concentration would be heightened. However, that person usually forgot about time. Leo was the same. He got absorbed in the field that he didn't notice the sunrise. By the time he finished arranging logs, it was already 8 AM.\nThe backyard was cleared. Leo opened the shop domain menu and purchased the alchemy workshop.\n.\nBasic Alchemist Workshop\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 2\nPrice : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 10 x 10\n.\nThe requirement was fulfilled. The icon of this building brightened, and Leo had enough lifespan to purchase it.\n\"Let's see what you can do.\"\nLeo did not think much. He purchased it right away to explore the alchemy secrets. After he pressed the confirm button, the same top-down view and grits appeared in his menu, allowing Leo to choose the location of the shop.\nHe moved the 10x10 blocks to the back of the general store. He aligned it for a moment before he pushed the alchemy workshop further back by five blocks, giving spaces between the store and the workshop for a road or a pathway. Then, he pressed enter.\nRUMBLE\nA new one-story wooden building appeared. At a glance, it looked like another cabin. However, a quarter of the building was an open-air patio with a huge black cauldron at the center.\nLeo inspected the new building and looked inside the black cauldron. There was nothing in there but the smooth surface of the black pot. While checking the new goodies, Leo accidentally touched the pot with his bare hands.\nDING\nA new system window floated above the cauldron. It displayed a menu, and a few buttons were highlighted.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 1\n[Upgrade] : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nLeo was amused. He ignored the upgrade button for now as he couldn't afford it. Thus, he pressed the [Research New Ingredient] button to see what it could do.\n<Please put an ingredient into the cauldron to research.>I think you should take a look at\n\"...\"\nThe system didn't tell him what kind of ingredient it needed. Still, Leo had enough clue to start. He walked to the fallen pine tree and picked up mutated leaves and a raw pine nut. Then, he put the nut in first.\nHe received a feedback message right away.\n<Will you research this unidentified nut?>\n\"Yes, please.\"\nAs soon as Leo confirmed the research, the pine nut in the cauldron vanished. Then, a progress bar appeared, hovering over the cauldron. Under it was a timer, counting down the completion time. It only took 10 seconds to complete the research on the first item.\n<Research completed!>\n<You have discovered Iron Pine Nut!>\n<A new pill recipe has been added to the encyclopedia.>\nAfter the message, another system window appeared, displaying the brief detail of the item.\n.\n[Iron Pine Nut]\nThese nuts can only be found in a densely Iron Pine Forest in one of the mystic realms. It is commonly used as the main ingredient for Iron Grain Pills.\n[Pill Recipe : Iron Grain Pill]\nOne - Iron Pine Nut\nOne : Any Starch\nFire Qi\n*Optional* - Any Iron Element Catalyst\n.\nUpon noticing the pill recipe in the detail window, Leo started enjoying this. However, there was one troublesome issue.\n\"What the hell is [Iron Element Catalyst]?\"\nLeo scratched his head in confusion as he had no one to consult. Then, he looked at the pine leaves in his hand. Without thinking much, he tossed it into the cauldron and pressed the [Research New Ingredient] button.\nAgain, it only took 10 seconds to complete the automatic research. The result was shown.\n.\n[Iron Pine Leaf]\nIron Pine Leaves are one of the rare iron-based catalysts, which can be found in an area with the thick iron element Qi. Mixing 100 leaves with any iron-based pill ingredient increases the completion success rate and the pill quality.\n[Traits]\nIncreases the Iron Grain Pill's pill-making success rate by 50%. Increases the quality by one major tier.\n.\n\"What a coincidence. Hehehe.\"\nLeo rubbed his hands. He learned a lot by just reading the information from the system window. He closed it and wore his trusty rubber gloves. Then, he entered the store through the back door.\nA minute later, Leo came out with a basket of raw potatoes. He put it next to the cauldron and went to the black pine trees to collect black pine leaves. When Leo returned, he carried an armful of nuts and several branches of pine trees, full of black leaves.\nThe ingredients were ready. Leo operated the cauldron menu and pressed the other button that he hadn't tried yet.\n[Pill Making]\nDING\n<Please choose a recipe.>\nThe window prompted him to choose a pill recipe from the list. However, it only showed one item as Leo only found one recipe so far.\nLeo didn't care. After all, he only had the ingredients to make one type of pill anyway. He chose the recipe, and the cauldron menu displayed the images of the required ingredients.\nNot even looking at the images, Leo tossed a black pine nut, pine leaves, and a raw potato into the cauldron. The images of iron pine nuts, random starch, and leaves turned grey. However, the fire icon was still bright.\nDING\n<Please inject Fire Qi into the cauldron.>\n\"Fire Qi? Wut da hail is Fire Qi? I only know fried rice!\"\nThe system hit him in the blind spot. Leo was confused and helpless as he had no idea what Fire Qi was. As he had no idea, he tried something silly.\nLeo went back to the storefront, where the BBQ set was. He lighted a piece of coal on fire and carried it with tongs. After coming back with a lump of burning coal, he threw it into the pot.\nDING\n<Detecting irrelevant material. The material will be removed from the cauldron.>\nThe burning coal was ejected from the pot. It was sent flying and landed on top of Leo's head. Fortunately, the fire couldn't burn his hair or his skin.\nLeo was annoyed. He took off his gloves and grabbed the burning coal with his hands. He spat at it and doused the fire instantly without burning his palms. Then, Leo complained.\n\"What the hell is Fire Qi? Argh...\"\nIn frustration, Leo tossed the lump of coal to the fireplace under the cauldron.\nDING\nSuddenly, the cauldron lit up. The fire icon dimmed, and the system prompted him, requesting his permission.\n<Ingredient substitution detected.>\n<Will you use Fire Essence, Water Essence, Earth Essence, Wood Essence, and Metal Essence instead of Fire Qi?>\n<Note: If you use higher-graded ingredients as substitutions, the success chance will increase, and the quality will improve.>\n<Note: If you use additional Qi or Essence of other elements, you might get different pills than the pills from the recipe.>\n\"Essence? Wut?\"\nLeo frowned and looked at the half-burnt coal, which had been spat on. It emitted a foul burning iron scent, which was the same as the black grasses.\n\"My spit is Essence? Wut da hail?\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 16 : Florida Man Addicted to Nutting in Forest\n= Life Sword Sect, Alchemy Department =\nIn the morning, Gao Yan woke up early and read a basic alchemy guidebook that he had received from Wu Buyi. He was interested in the applications of Wood Qi and Fire Qi.\nHe skimmed through the trivial parts until his eyes caught on to the topics that he was interested in.\n'Ah, found it! Here... Alchemy is not about burning everything in a pot into charcoal. It's about the choice of elemental Qi and ingredients. An alchemist has to pay extra attention to the element circles because each element gives a different result. For example, fire Qi promotes earth, weakens wood, and dominates metal, but insults water. Okay, this much I know. But what is \"Insult\" anyway?'\nGao Yan continued to read further. Then, he started to get confused as the relationship table sounded bizarre.\n'Wood Qi promotes fire, weakens water, and dominates... earth? Insult metal? Huh? Metal Qi creates... water?! Weaken earth, dominate wood, and insult fire? What?!'\nThe disciple scratched his head as he had no idea what \"Insult\" in alchemy term meant. He flipped the pages to the glossary section in the book. Then, he found the translation of the word.\nInsult in the alchemy term translated to \"Harm\". For example, fire evaporates water. Water destabilizes earth. Earth rots wood. Wood dulls metal, and metal conducts fire (heat).\nGao Yan flipped back to the section that he had left off earlier. He started taking notes as every element had a different effect on another element. Although he didn't understand the hidden meaning of the description and the relationship table, Gao Yan felt like he broadened his horizon.\n'Alchemy is profound. So, there are things that Wood Qi and Fire Qi can do best, but they can't refine everything in the world. I wonder if I have to rely on other alchemists if I have to refine water pills in the future.'\nGao Yan continued reading. At the end of that chapter, there was an annotation, made by Wu Buyi. The latter wrote it for Gao Yan.\n[An alchemist only needs two types of secondary elemental Qi to refine every element. In common practice, average alchemists cultivate fire Qi, wood Qi, and metal Qi, so they can refine almost every type of high-graded pill and some superior pills. Master alchemists usually spend centuries cultivating the third and even the fourth secondary element Qi to be well-versed in every field.]\n[An alchemist can choose to become a specialist by relying on only two or three elements, or they can become the jack-of-all-grade by spending centuries in cultivation. It's about personal career choice in the end. But if you ask me which is better, I'll pick the jack-of-all-trade route. You might waste a few hundred years getting stuck at the nascent soul stage and trying to acquire one more element Qi. But trust me, the investment will be worth the blood, tear, and sweat. Not only will you thrive as a top-tier alchemist, but as a cultivator, you will also be invincible!]\n[Also, legends said that an alchemist with all five elemental essences can turn simple grain pills into elixir. Even my mentor hasn't achieved that state. You should strive for that. Set your goal high, and you will never be a failure even if you fail to achieve that goal.]\nGao Yan was grateful for the notes. His motivation skyrocketed once more.\n\"Alright. Time to cultivate and reinforce my wood Qi! I must condense my dantian and reach the foundation establishment stage within a year! Before I'm 25, I must reach the golden core stage!\"\nHe closed his book and put it back in his clothes. Then, he returned to his room and sat on his bed.\nInside a water pot on a desk next to his bed was a blade of immortal grasses, which Wu Buyi had brought from the outer disciple courtyard to Gao Yan's room. Although there was only one blade of immortal grass, it still filled the room with wood Qi.\nGao Yan closed his eyes and meditated, deeply inhaling the warm vapor in the air. His body grew warmer as his blood reacted to the nutritious energy.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo was clueless about what essence or Qi could do to the pills. He stared at the system messages and rested his hands on his hips in frustration.\n'Meh, what's the point of overthinking something I don't know. I'll just YOLO this thing and see how it turns out. There is nothing to lose anyway.'\nLeo shrugged and let the alchemy workshop do the work. He pressed the confirm button.\nDING\nThe black cauldron turned white, and a metallic lid appeared out of nowhere. It covered the pot, and a timer appeared.\n<Refining pills. Please wait...>\n<Time remaining: 59 Minutes, 58 Seconds.>\n\"...\"\nLeo's expression turned dark. He thought that the pills would come out instantly.\n\"One hour to make stupid drugs!? Seriously? I ain't going to sit around and wait!\"\nHad any alchemist heard Leo's remark, they would have fumed with rage as one hour of pill-refining was considered a lot faster than average. A newbie alchemist always fumbled for six hours to make simple non-elemental grain pills for the first time while experts still needed two to three hours to make elemental pills.\nThe workshop slowly counted down. Leo scoffed and carried the ingredients back to the store in disappointment. While he was at it, he cracked an iron pine nut and popped it in his mouth.\nThe nut was rock solid, but there was nothing in the world that Leo's teeth couldn't destroy. He crushed it and savored the iron-like flavor.\nIt tasted like human blood. However, Leo got something useful.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n\"One nut per year?\"\nLeo's eyes gleamed. He dropped the basket of potatoes and carried an empty container outside the store. He rushed to the fallen pine trees to collect more nuts.\nAn hour quickly went by. Leo stopped nutting (collecting nuts) and returned to the workshop to see the result.\nThe cauldron was black again, but the lid was gone. 30 colorful pills floated over the pot, waiting for Leo to collect them. They came in seven colors : Red, blue, green, yellow, black, purple, and white. Each round pill was an inch thick.\n\"Oh, neat. 30 balls at once?\"\nLeo purchased a large glass bowl for this occasion. He reached out to pick up the floating pills. But as soon as he touched one of them, the workshop system informed him of the result.\n<Workshop has refined 2 Inferior Fire Grain Pills, 1 Inferior Water Grain Pill, 3 Inferior Wood Grain Pills, 19 Lessor Metal Grain Pills, 1 Inferior Earth Grain Pill, 3 Inferior Poison Grain Pills, and 1 Inferior Elixir Grain Pill.>\n<Pill Encyclopedia has been updated.>\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nLeo frowned and glanced at the seven floating system windows around him. Each displayed the effects of the pills.\n.\nLesser Metal Grain PillI think you should take a look at\n- Satisfy the hunger for 48 hours.\n- Improve blood circulation and internal organ efficiency by 15% for 48 hours.\n- Increase lifespan by two years.\n- Increase Metal Qi by two years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Fire Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 24 hours.\n- Increase muscle strength by 10% for 24 hours.\n- Increase lifespan by one year.\n- Increase Fire Qi by one year's worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Water Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 24 hours.\n- Quench the thirst for 24 hours.\n- Increase lifespan by one year.\n- Increase Water Qi by one year's worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Wood Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 24 hours.\n- Strengthen the bone marrow and skeleton by 10% for 24 hours.\n- Increase lifespan by one year.\n- Increase Wood Qi by one year's worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Earth Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 24 hours.\n- Stabilize your dantian for 24 hours.\n- Increase lifespan by one year.\n- Increase Earth Qi by one year's worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Poison Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 24 hours.\n- Add poison to the blood circulation.\n- Decrease lifespan by one year.\n- Increase Poison Qi by one year's worth of cultivation.\n.\nInferior Elixir Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 10 days.\n- Increase metabolism and regenerative abilities for 10 days.\n- Increase lifespan by 10 years.\n- Increase all five elements Qi by 10 years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nLeo read through everything. He paused for a long time to digest the information.\nFirst off, this workshop was beyond broken. It changed a regular potato and a mutated nut into 30 pills, which could bless him with 57 years of lifespan!\nSecondly, the pills were mostly inferior in quality, judging from their prefix. Leo stared at the run-down workshop, wondering if the pill quality depending on the level of the building.\nAnd lastly, it involved cultivation that Leo had no clue about.\nSeeing so many perks of these nut pills, Leo had the urge to think of \"Deez Nuts\" jokes. He laughed to himself and quickly collected his loot.\n\"Should I test the taste?\"\nLeo licked his lips.",

The hard surface of the pill melted upon touching Leo's tongue, and the rich flavor of mint and pine nut hit his nose.\nLeo exhaled a fume of cold air and shivered in ecstasy. He just had a mental orgasm.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\n\"WOO!\"\nAlthough there was no report about Qi or related internal energy, Leo sensed the inflating cold air inside him. The sensation ran from his stomach to his blood vessels, then it flowed all over his body, sending a shiver down his spine.\nAs Leo didn't want to waste his lifespan buying more containers from the shopping system, he picked another pill and put it in his mouth.\nThis time, he ate the fire pill.\nWhen the burning hot pill touched his tongue, Leo smelled the nostalgic chili scent. The spicy taste and the heat instantly canceled the chilling air. After Leo chewed the pill, sticky juice came out and flooded his mouth with pine nuts and a sweet potato aroma.\nIt was delicious!\nLeo swallowed everything, ignoring the conflicted temperature. He reached out to grab another fire grain pill. However, a nauseous sensation kicked in. His stomach rejected additional food, and he was on the verge of vomiting.\nHe was full.\n\"Holy cow, moo. I guess it is \"Grain Pill\" for a reason.\"\nLeo forgot how long his stomach was this bloated. He rubbed his round belly in astonishment and frustration. At this rate, he wouldn't be able to eat anything to recover his lifespan.\nStill, Leo had many things to do to kill time as many projects piled up. He sorted the pills into different containers and inserted a new batch of ingredients into the workshop cauldron. Then, he let it auto-refine the meds.\n.\nHalf a day later, Leo sat on the floor of his store, gazing at the dozen stainless steel pots that contained grain pills. 12 batches of pill-refining gave birth to 360 grain pills of six elements and a few unique elixir pills.\nLeo was annoyed. A thousand years of lifespan was right before his eyes, but he couldn't eat any pill because of his bloated stomach.\n'I can't eat any food now. How am I going to get my lifespan back?'\nLeo glanced at the display windows of his store. He pondered for 10 minutes, questioning himself how he could swindle lifespan from other local cultivators.\nThere was no other choice. He had to officially open the general store and invite more customers.\nPutting his idea to work, Leo spent more of his lifespan, purchasing transparent Tupperware from the system shop. He transferred the pills into the containers and lined them behind the display glass windows as premium goods. Then, he turned his attention to the corianders, potatoes, cabbages, and bananas.\nAs potatoes and mutated corianders could be used in alchemy, Leo decided not to sell them for the time being. He transferred them to the workshop building.\nThe interior of the alchemy workshop was the same as any blank cabin. Leo got plenty of room to store ingredients and his merchandise, so he carried the baskets of corianders and potatoes there, using the structure as his storehouse.\nAfter sorting out the non-merchandise, Leo turned his attention to the cabbages and bananas. He hesitated at first, but he picked one of each and touched them with his naked finger.\nThe cabbages turned purple as usual. However, the bananas instantly turned yellow as if they were old enough to be consumed.\nCurious, Leo tried to peel the banana even though he couldn't eat it at the moment. But as soon as he tried to peel it, he sensed something odd.\nThe skin was rough and harder than usual. Leo exerted the same force as when he uprooted the pine tree. After a portion of the banana was peeled, gold light shone from inside the fruit.\nIt was a gold banana. Moreover, its strong banana scent contained a tinge of earthy smell similar to brown dirt or dried land.\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He suddenly recalled something.\n\"Come to think of it, after I started refining grain pills, I haven't researched any of the mutated fruits or veggies here. I also haven't tried the black grasses yet.\"\nHe smacked his forehead. He picked a sample of each mutated ingredient and waited for the cauldron to finish refining the next batch of pills.\nSeveral minutes later, the auto-refining workshop completed the task. Leo collected the pills and switched to the research mode right away. Then, he put an entire stalk of black grasses into the pot.\nDING\nThe result came out.\n.\n[Immortal Grass]\nImmortal grasses are commonly populated in an area with dense seven elemental Qi. It is one of the key ingredients to making longevity pills and the infamous pill of youth.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Longevity Pill]\nOne Blade of Immortal Grass\nOne Liter of Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nOne Black Heart of 9th-Grade Demon Beast\n*Optional* One of any Fire Element Catalyst\n*Optional* One of any Water Element Catalyst\n*Optional* One of any Earth Element Catalyst\n*Optional* One of any Metal Element Catalyst\n*Optional* One of any Wood Element Catalyst\nAny Elemental Essence\n[Alchemy Recipe – Pill of Youth]\nOne Hundred Blades of Immortal Grass\nOne Drop of Virgin Sage's BloodI think you should take a look at\nOne Drop of Unicorn's Tear\nOne Liter of Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nFive Elemental Essence\n.\nLeo blankly stared at the detail. He was astonished by the names of the required ingredients in the recipes. Sometimes, Leo wondered who came up with the recipes and the combinations.\n'Forget longevity pills. This thing sounds too complex and difficult. I'll stick with the iron grain pill for now. Oh, right. What about the cabbage and banana?'\nLeo put the purple cabbage into the pot next. Then, he received another weird result.\n.\n[Cabbage of Extreme Yin]\nThis poisonous cabbage can only be found in a demonic realm as it is one of demon's staple food. No cultivator should consume this as it is full of Poison Qi and yin miasma. However, it can be used in alchemy to make potent poison.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Demonic Poison Potion]\nOne Cabbage of Extreme Yin\nOne Liter of Yin Fluid\nOne of any Poison Element Catalyst\nPoison Qi\n.\nLeo raised his eyebrows. The last time he ate it, it was delicious. He wondered how it was poisonous.\n\"You? Poisonous? You must be joking. Oh, well. I'll add the poison label to the merchandise. Next.\"\nIt was the gold banana's turn, and Leo wasn't disappointed this time.\n.\n[Golden Sand Banana]\nThis fruit is exclusive to the Golden Sand Mystic Realm as no realm can produce Earth Element Essence as thick as this place. Golden Sand Bananas are known to be the top-tier Earth Element Catalyst in alchemy, and every alchemist expert will kill to get their hands on one of them.\n[Traits]\nIncreases any Earth-Type Cultivation Pill's success rate by 100%. Increases the quality by three major tiers. Increase the number of final products by 50%.\n.\n\"Oh, boy. This will sell!\"\nLeo was overjoyed. He planned to set a high price for the mutated bananas. Still, he needed to keep some of them to himself as he might need them in the future.\nPutting his new project to work, Leo started converting cabbages and bananas.\nWhen the sun sank to the west horizon, Leo finished transporting a basket worth of golden sand bananas and purple cabbages to the alchemy workshop's storehouse. As for the rest, Leo arranged them in supermarket refrigerators and wrote a price tag on them.\nLeo looked forward to Wu Buyi's return. He couldn't wait to spread the information about his shop.\n\"Please hurry and come back. I need more lifespan…\"\nWhile Leo prayed, the chomper plant returned home. It scratched the front door with its branches.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"MEOW!\"\nLike a hungry cat returning home after a day of adventure, it yowled. Its roots slipped into the store and coiled its roots around his leg. As for Cat's head, it got stuck outside.\n\"MEOW!\"\n\"Ah, dammit! I know, I know. You're hungry, right?\"\nIn frustration, Leo picked up a few regular cabbages and threw them toward Cat. The latter opened its mouth and caught everything.\nUnfortunately, after swallowing them, Cat wanted more. It extended its roots and grabbed the goodies in the display fridges and the freezer chest. It grabbed both regular and poisonous cabbages.\n\"Hey! That's inedible!\"\nBefore Leo could react, Cat picked up one of the poison cabbages. It put the purple cabbages in its mouth and ate them.\nIt was too late for Leo to do anything. He deeply sighed and facepalmed, unable to come up with a word to scold this reckless plant.\n\"I can't save you this time, kitty.\"\n\"Meow?\"\nBetraying Leo's expectation, the chomper tilted its head in confusion. It picked its sharp teeth with a thorn on its branch and returned to its home at the side of the store, satisfied.\n\"…\"\nLeo watched how Cat swaggered away after the quick meal. He followed it and noticed that it fell asleep and snored.\nHe deeply frowned. Then, he glanced at its black leaves and vines.\nThinking for a moment, Leo cut a piece of its root and brought it to the alchemy cauldron. He put it in and pressed the research button.\nDING\nThe result came out, which explained everything about why Cat managed to resist the poisonous cabbages.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 18 – Florida Man Cooks Chemical Weapon Using Dog's Blood\nThe next day morning, Leo sat in front of the glutton plant, staring at it. The chomper was, as usual, lazing around like a tree. It didn't even notice that Leo had cut its root by an inch.\n\"Seriously, you…\"\nLeo was perplexed about how this plant was related to demons. He was aware that it became like this because of his radiation, but he couldn't figure out how it connected to the demon race.\n.\n[Root of Infant Demon Dryad]\nThis root can be extracted from an infant demon dryad, a rare mythical specimen from a demonic realm. It can be used to substitute both wood and poison element catalysts due to its poisonous nature.\n[Traits]\nIncrease any poison element pill success rate by 25%.\n.\n\"A dryad, you? Aren't you supposed to be sexy tree girls or half-naked elves with vines around your body?\"\nLeo stared at the round chomper's head. His fantasies were ruined.\n\"Meow?\"\nCat drowsily woke up as it noticed Leo's gaze. It licked his face like a happy puppy.\nLeo couldn't help but pat this guy like a good dog. He went back to the store and brought in a dozen of mutated cabbages for breakfast. Then, he returned to his pill-refining duty.\nLast night, Leo got a good sleep, but his stomach was still full. As he couldn't increase his lifespan, he busied himself making more pills.\nWhile inserting a potato and a mutated nut into the pot, Leo's mind wandered. He spoke out his thoughts, \"Where can I get one of those Yin Fluid? If a man is Yang, is a woman Yin? Does Yin Fluid mean a woman's water... or pee?\"\nLeo repeatedly shook his head as he was disappointed in his silly mind. He activated the workshop to automatically make grain pills again. Then, he approached the pile of logs and pondered what to do with them.\n\"The wood is too hard for modern saws. Even if I use a chainsaw, it will end up breaking the tool instead. But that stupid mutated whip managed to break this tree. What if I use my super strength?\"\nTesting the toughness of the iron pine wood, Leo karate-chopped one of them.\nSWUA\nAs if Leo's hand broke the log in half. His skin emitted yellow smoke because of his radiation.\n\"…\"\nLeo stared at his hand for a moment as he couldn't explain how light came out from his skin even though he had been living with it for years. He pursed his lips and shrugged, \"I guess I still have it. Alright, time to remove the barks… with bare hands, it is.\"\n.\nLeo finally encountered an issue. After measuring the log's elasticity and toughness with his raw strength, Leo concluded that the mutated pine log was too durable for modern tools to process.\nAfter three hours, Leo finished cutting all branches, separating leaves, collecting nuts, and debarking the first log. Even though he managed to remove the hard skin, his fingers were sore. Still, Leo got to admire the beauty of a skinless log.\nDespite the bark being black, the interior skin was glistening white, but the hardness was as tough as steel plates. As for the inner skin, it was as white as a sheet, but it was a lot softer than the bark.\nCurious, Leo brought a piece of iron pine bark to the workshop. He collected the completed batch of pills and put the piece of bark in there. Then, he pressed research.\nDING\n.\n[Bark of Iron Pine Tree]\nExtracted from an Iron Pine Tree. Can be used as a metal element catalyst or smelt into Iron Pine Ingot.\n[Traits]\nIncrease metal element pill success rate by 10%.\n.\nFor the first time, Leo found an item that could be used in another field other than alchemy. Seeing the ingot option, he wondered if he could create a blacksmith workshop in his store domain too.\nLeo was not disappointed. There was a blacksmith workshop building on the list.\n.\nBasic Blacksmith Workshop\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 3\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\n\"Am I in an RTS game or a base-building game world?\"\nLeo was amused. It seemed that the general store system wanted him to craft his merchandise himself. Still, he couldn't afford it as he didn't have enough lifespan to invest in another building.\nFor the moment, Leo had no customers, and he couldn't eat food. Thus, he could only busy himself tidying his backyard and sorting available resources at hand. Having nothing else to do, Leo peeled other iron pine logs and organized the barks next to the alchemy workshop.\n.\nAnother day went by. The stomach condition issue was resolved as the grain pills' effects subsided.\nLeo immediately rushed to the wolf cages to check on the livestock. The animals no longer made a noise. As Leo didn't feed it anything but water, they ran out of energy, and they were starving.\nHe had no intention to spare them as they were the only source of protein and lifespan. Leo mutated all of them and extracted their meat. As for the bones, blood, skin, and innards, Leo kept some for his alchemy while he donated a portion of them to Cat, replenishing its lifespan.\nIt was noon when Leo finished. He began cooking the old mutated meat in the freezers while he kept the fresh ones in the chest refrigerator.\nAfter the meal, Leo let out a long sigh. A proper steak was a thousand times better than grain pill candies. Those meds weren't compatible with his lifestyle, and he swore not to eat them again.\nLeo washed the dish and the BBQ set with the river water. When he was putting plates and grills on a table to dry them, he heard the whizzing sound of wind coming from above.\nWhen Leo looked up, he noticed a team of five white-robed young men, standing on top of iron pine trees. They stared at him as if Leo was a celebrity.\nSeeing new people, Leo was excited. He wondered if he would get new customers that day.\n\"Come down if you want to talk, boys,\" Leo smiled at them.\nThe cultivators gulped and looked at each other. However, they leaped away from Leo, heading west to Magpie City.I think you should take a look at\nLeo clicked his tongue and shook his head. Since those kids avoided him, he returned to work at the alchemy workshop. He researched the wolf's goodies.\n.\n[Fenrir Skin]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir's skin. Can be tanned into hides and crafted into Fenrir Leather Armor.\n.\n[Fenrir Bone Marrow's Essence]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir's spinal cord. It is one of the key ingredients of the legendary pill – Bone Reconstruction Pill.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Bone Reconstruction Pill]\nOne Drop of Fenrir Bone Marrow's Essence\nA liter of Fenrir Blood\nA liter of Holy Water\nThree of Fire, Earth, and Water Element Catalysts\nFire, Earth, and Water Essence\n.\n[Fenrir Heart]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir. It is one of the key ingredients of the legendary pill – Werewolf Dantian Pill.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Werewolf Dantian Pill]\nOne Fenrir Heart\nA liter of Fenrir Blood\nOne of Poison Element Catalyst\nPoison Essence\n.\n[Fenrir Liver]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir. It is the universal catalyst of all antidotes and healing pills, which can also substitute all elemental catalysts.\n[Traits]\nSubstitute any type of catalyst for antidotes or healing pills. Increase the pill success rate to 100%. Increase the pill quality by three grades. Add a temporary purification perk to the completed pills.\n.\n[Fenrir Intestine]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir. Can be used as poison or earth catalyst in antidote or healing pills.\n[Traits]\nIncrease poison and earth pill success rate by 100%. Increase the pill quantity by 20%.\n.\n[Fenrir Blood]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir. Can be used as a substitution for Yin-type liquid ingredients in any recipe. Can be consumed raw to replenish one's blood and Qi, but it has severe side effects.\n[Traits]\nSubstitute any Yin-Type liquid materials. Raw consumption replenishes the loss of blood equal to the volume consumed.\n.\n[Fenrir Meat]\nExtracted from the mythical beast Fenrir of the demonic realm. Can be cooked for food if the consumer has high poison resistance or Poison Qi.\n.\nA lot of questions were answered there. Leo finally understood why Wu Buyi valued them highly. Although he realized that he undersold the innards a few days ago, Leo didn't regret it. After all, he got a bunch of veggies and other resources in exchange.\nMoreover, by completing the research, Leo had enough ingredients for another pill. He browsed the pill recipe while he gathered the necessary ingredients.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Demonic Poison Potion]\nOne Cabbage of Extreme Yin\nOne Liter of Yin Fluid\nOne of any Poison Element Catalyst\nPoison Qi\n.\nAlthough cooking a chemical weapon always resulted in trouble, Leo laughed and tried making it for fun. He threw in a mutated cabbage, a liter of mutated wolf's blood, the wolf's intestine, and a bit of spitting to the charcoals under the cauldron. Then, he pressed proceed to make the first poison.\nDING\nUnfortunately, the refine timer showed six hours instead of one.\n\"Six hours?! Seriously? What are you cooking? Ramen soup?!\"\nLeo almost kicked the cauldron. He grudgingly brought back the wolf ingredients and chilled them in the fridges. Then, he sat there, staring at the pot as he lost the motivation to work for the day.\n\"I'm gonna sit here. I'm gonna stare at you. And I'm…\"\nSuddenly, the weird sides of Leo took over his brain. He stood up and danced.\n\"Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you!\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 19 : Chemist Intrudes Florida Man's House, Kowtows for Forgiveness\nWhile Leo had a mental breakdown during the waiting, a group of white-robed cultivators returned to the Life Sword Sect. These outer disciples were Gao Yan's bullies, and they were all 19 years old. They gossiped.\n\"You saw that, right?\"\n\"Yeah, the rumor is real. Gao Yan got immortal grasses from him!\"\n\"There are plenty of spirit grasses around here. Should we go collect them?\"\n\"And get ourselves killed? I'm sure he's growing them. If we steal those, we'll offend him!\"\n\"But Gao Yan got the immortal grasses from him...\"\n\"Remember the rules of survival number one : Run whenever you see a stranger with a superior cultivation base. It's not worth risking our lives for the unknown!\"\n\"But Gao Yan...\"\n\"That guy has an exceptional physique. That elder must have noticed that and decided to help. What about us? We are all Qi condensation stage, but we can only cultivate non-elemental Qi! If we go talk to him, instead of getting anything, he would have killed us!\"\n\"...\"\nEverybody was dejected. Still, for the sake of contribution points, they rushed to the contribution pavilion to report their findings.\nThe next mystic realm opening was about three weeks away. They had to get ready to compete for the spot within the sect, and they needed contribution points to earn the right to compete.\n.\n.\n= Alchemy Department =\nIn this department, there was a custom : Every Monday at 8 AM, a trainee was always randomly chosen by a lottery drawing, and the chosen trainee had to give a demonstration or share their knowledge, research, refining tricks, or insight.\nThere was also another unspoken rule - The chosen trainee must not present their knowledge half-heartedly. After all, after the presentation, every trainee was free to criticize, chastise, or debate the lecturer if the workshop class was poor and mundane. Therefore, if someone gave a weak or bad lecture, he would be humiliated on the spot.\nGao Yan joined the little gathering of 20 trainees. As he was still a disciple who couldn't concoct a pill, his name wasn't put in the lottery, so he could come here every week to listen to free lectures.\nThe lecturer today was a 22-year-old alchemist intern, who was also an outer disciple of the Sixth Element Sect. He had been working for Life Sword Sect as a guest alchemist for six months. He had short black hair. His face was full of pimples. His fingernails were black, and his skin was riddled with black spots as he had been exposed to various types of poison substances.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"Fellow alchemists, my name is Jin Yong. As my friends know, I'm from the Sixth Element Sect, which is well-versed in poison element. I'll be demonstrating how to extract venom from poisonous plants and choose the right catalyst ingredients for poison element pills.\"\nGao Yan's pupils dilated as he was interested in the unknown element. In the books, they only described five elements : Earth, Fire, Water, Wood, and Metal. None of them mentioned poison elements.\n\"Before I start, I must correct the misconception. Yes, poison is harmful. But when it is correctly utilized, it can become medicine. To prove my point, I'll show you how to make an anti-infection dressing gel with this bone-rotting sap.\"\n\"...\"\nNobody uttered a word as they focused on how Jin Yong refined the purple sap in a small cauldron on the table.\nThe lecture lasted four hours.\n.\n.\nLater that day, at 10 PM, Jin Yong left Magpie City and took a stroll in the eastern forest to change his mood.\nDuring the morning, the lecture was a success. Only a few seniors debated with him, but nobody managed to humiliate him in front of the crowd. He managed to get some praise from a senior guest alchemist, who came to see the lecture.\nBecause of the happy mood, Jin Yong enjoyed the scenery and let his imagination run wild during the stroll. As his brain came up with various impossible scenarios, he suddenly remembered one of the trending rumors around the sect.\nIn the east forest, a mysterious senior lurked there. He was also the reason Gao Yan awakened Wood Qi and became Wu Buyi's disciple.\nCurious, Jin Yong leaped over the tall trees and ventured deeper into the forest.\nA few minutes later, Jin Yong finally saw a dense fog at a distance. Unperturbed and confident in his foundation establishment stage's strength, Jin Yong entered the fog area.\nAfter entering the fog, Jin Yong couldn't see anything beyond five meters in front of him. Still, he kept placing himself on top of pine trees. When he landed on a tree in the fog, he noticed something odd - The tree bark and leaves were all shining in blue.\nJin Yong silently collected a few nuts and put them in his clothes. He would compare them to the encyclopedia book in his dorm later. For now, he continued traveling further, searching for the source of the anomaly.\nAfter 10 minutes, Jin Yong saw two sources of bright light. One came from the windows of a large cabin while the other one came from the building behind it, but it was dimmer. Jin Yong approached the brightest area first to get a closer look.I think you should take a look at\nThe orange light of the building was so bright that it amazed Jin Yong. He had never seen any tool or lamp that illuminated this far. Curious about the source of light, he got down from the tree and stood in front of the building with glass windows.\nJin Yong looked at the weird long bulbs of light inside the cabin at first. Then, his eyes lowered and noticed a dozen transparent containers lining the table.\nThe round pills of various colors interested him.\n\"Pills? What pills are these? I've never seen them before.\"\nJin Yong was frustrated. He wanted to sniff them to check what kind of pills they were, but no scent came out from the glass windows. He turned to the door, wondering if he should knock on it to call the owner.\nHesitated, Jin Yong took a few steps back to look at the building's signboard, which was brightly illuminated by peculiar purple light.\n[We Sell Weed]\nJin Yong was astonished. If this was a store, the store owner might have a mental issue. Still, it gave him hope. Since this was a store, Jin Yong tried to open the door.\nCREAK\nIt was unlocked. Jin Yong entered the store and looked inside.\nThe interior was bright as if it was daytime. Many weird glass containers emitted chilling air. All of them also had a light bulb built-in, illuminating the content inside.\nThe alchemist trainee was stunned. He didn't know what he should check first. Still, his legs brought him toward the tallest object in the room : The Supermarket Showcase Refrigerator. Then, he noticed the vegetables on the showcase.\nThere were countless black grasses, blue coriander, mutated cabbages, and gold bananas lining in order. Every item emitted thick elemental Qi.\n\"I-Immortal grasses?! Yin Cabbage and Sand Banana?! I-Is this an immortal herb pavilion?!\"\nJin Yong gulped. He turned to the other fridges to see the other items.\nThe glass-door refrigerators were also filled with cabbages and black grasses. However, the slide-door chests had something else.\nThere were meat cuts, buckets of blood, and packages of innards in there.\nJin Yong turned to the meat display fridges. He also noticed beautiful cuts of red meat, but they looked the same as meat in the city's market.\n\"Commoner's food is here too. What is this place?\"\nJin Yong looked around, but he couldn't see any other item. Then, his nose caught a pleasant aroma. He followed the scent and found a transparent pot, containing black water and a blue coriander at the south corner of the cabin.\nFor an unknown reason, Jin Yong had the urge to drink the water. He approached the pot and was about to open the lid.\nCREAK\nSuddenly, someone entered the store through the backdoor. Jin Yong immediately turned around and found the store owner. He was an elder with long white hair and a silky-smooth white beard. In his hands, he carried a glass pot full of purple liquid while wearing strange gloves.\nLeo stared at Jin Yong, \"Is there something I can do for you, mister?\"\nJin Yong was surprised for a moment before his eyes were attracted by the purple liquid in the glass pot. His nose caught on the familiar scent of a poisonous substance, telling him that the content was poisonous.\n'Poison liquid? I haven't seen that before? What kind of poison is that?'\nHe turned his attention to the elder. Then, he noticed the colorful aurora around him. Just like the others, Jin Yong was nervous. He gulped.\n'A soul formation cultivator, the sixth stage! He's as strong as the sect master! The rumor is true!!'\nAs an inferior 3rd stage cultivator, Jin Yong didn't dare to offend the senior. He quickly knelt and cupped his fist.\n\"Please forgive this junior for trespassing senior's abode!\"\n\"...\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo scratched his head and frowned at Jin Yong. He thought to himself.\n'Why do these guys always overreact when they see me? What did I ever do to them?'",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 20 – Florida Man Gets Rich Selling Trash\nJust a few minutes ago, Leo was busy scooping purple substances into the glass pot. He heard the footsteps and the creaking sound of the store's door, so he rushed to the cabin to check.\nLeo was not disappointed. A wild customer appeared even though he was on the ugly side.\nTrying to be friendly, Leo initiated the conversation.\n\"Is there something I can do for you, mister?\"\nThe pimple man instantly knelt and cupped his fist, \"Please forgive this junior for trespassing senior's abode!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo pursed his lips. Once again, his customer made the situation awkward. But since he showed respect, Leo didn't mind doing business with the guy.\nHe activated the shop domain and revealed his customer's status.\n.\nName: Jin Yong\nAge: 22\nRemaining Lifespan: 167 Years, 5 Months, 24 Days, 1 Hour, and 42 Minutes.\n.\nCompared to Han Meng or Wu Buyi, this guy didn't have much lifespan, but he was somewhat better than Gao Yan. Still, Leo needed to get something out of this man.\n\"You have a Daoist nickname?\" Leo asked as he didn't want to reveal his ability or secret that he knew the guy's name.\nJin Yong dryly laughed and confessed, \"I'm still the first rank of the foundation establishment stage. I still have a long way to go until the golden core stage and get my Daoist Name, senior.\"\nLeo raised his brow. He heard something related to the culture of this cultivation world. He probed further.\n\"What are you doing here, mister?\"\n\"Senior, I heard about your rumor, and I come here to pay respect. I have no intention of doing anything disrespectful!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo smiled and repeatedly nodded. He was glad to hear it as the viral marketing method started to show some results. In a good mood, Leo put the poison water pot down on the pill table next to the display windows.\nBefore Leo could say anything, Jin Yong looked up and gazed at the purple liquid in the pot.\n\"S-Senior. I heard you are selling precious herbs. C-Can I buy some?\"\nNothing made Leo happy more than getting an enthusiastic customer, \"Stand up, mister. Is there something you need?\"\n\"Y-Yes,\" Jin Yong stood up. He glanced at the showcase fridge's immortal grass at first. However, his instinct drove his eyes toward the purple liquid on the pill table.\nLeo followed Jin Yong's gaze and noticed that his customer was interested in the finished products. He smiled and opened the plastic Tupperware, showing him the grain pills.\n\"Are you interested in grain pills?\"\nJin Yong widened his eyes as he recognized the aura of Fire Qi, Metal Qi, and other elements. Moreover, one of them produced Poison Qi, which was beneficial to him.\nAlchemists always used low-graded ingredients to make grain pills. As a result, most food pills only filled their stomach, but they didn't give elemental Qi that they could cultivate. As for ingredients with elemental Qi, they usually saved them to make a more difficult pill.\nSecondly, the only places cultivators could accumulate elemental Qi were mystic realms, which opened once every three months. Therefore, every cultivation pill, herb, or artifact that produced elemental Qi was more precious than spirit stones or gold.\nSeeing so many grain pills with elemental Qi, Jin Yong was distracted. He pointed at the purple pills in the Tupperware as they contained necessary poison Qi that he needed.\n\"H-How much is this, senior?\"\nLeo gazed at the plastic box in his hand. As he concocted iron grain pills every hour, he got several purple pills as byproducts. Averagely, Leo got one inferior poison grain pill per batch. So far, he collected 25 poison element pills.\nAs these poisonous grain pills were useless to Leo, he was more than happy to sell them. He pointed at the floating lifespan status in front of Jin Yong, introducing the store system, \"See the text, mister?\"\n\"!!!\"\nFinally, Jin Yong noticed the status of his lifespan. His throat was dry, and his pupils dilated.\n\"I-Is this my lifespan?!\"\n\"Yes. Also, in my store, your lifespan is the currency. For example, I sell these for…\"\nLeo paused for a moment to think of the price tag. Then, he raised three fingers.\n\"Three years of lifespan per pill. How about it?\"\nAfter showing Jin Yong three fingers, Leo inwardly cursed himself as he thought it might be too expensive. His instinct told him that one year per pill was enough since these things decreased the consumer's lifespan. No matter how he looked at it, these poison grain pills were trash.\nJin Yong widened his eyes in shock. His voice cracked, and his heart raced. He couldn't believe what he heard.\nNot everybody could enter the mystic realm to cultivate elemental Qi there. Every season, all sects chose their most promising disciples and elders before they dispatched the teams to the mystic realms. In addition, the quota was limited due to the restriction of each mystic realm. An average alchemist trainee like Jin Yong might not be able to earn the right to join the expedition.\nGetting these pills were equivalent to obtaining the quota to join the event. Moreover, if Jin Yong could drastically improve his cultivation base by consuming these poison grain pills before the event, he might earn the quota for the expedition, killing two birds with one stone.\nIn short, three years of lifespan per pill was dirt cheap for such an opportunity!\n\"T-THREE YEARS PER PILL?! REALLY?!\"\nLeo deeply sighed. Judging from the reaction, he was convinced that it was overpriced. He silently sealed the plastic boxes and prepared to get scolded by an angry customer.\nBetraying Leo's expectation, Jin Yong said in a clear voice.\n\"I'll TAKE EVERY PILL, SENIOR!!\"\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo was taken aback. There were 25 purple pills in three plastic boxes, but this guy wanted all of them. The total price was 75 years of lifespan.\n\"Are you sure? That's 75 years, you know?\"I think you should take a look at\n\"Senior, 75 years is nothing if I have those pills!\" Jin Yong insisted.\nLeo started to feel bad. He revealed some of the hidden information about the pills.\n\"Do you know that poison grain pills decrease your lifespan upon consumption? If you eat all of them, you will lose 25 years of your lifespan on top of that. If we combine the total lifespan you lose, it's 100 years!\"\n\"Senior, are you joking? I'll gladly throw away 100 years of my lifespan for those pills! Please sell them to me. I really need it!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo stroked his beard and gave Jin Yong a meaningful look. Half of him felt bad for the ugly guy, but his capitalist side was screaming that he should take the deal.\nIn the end, the capitalist heart demon won. Leo brightly smiled and opened the plastic Tupperware, allowing Jin Yong to collect them. As he didn't want to spread the plastic technologies to this world, Leo decided not to give Jin Yong the Tupperware boxes.\n\"Go ahead, take them. I won't ask what you're gonna do with them, but… good luck.\"\n\"THANK YOU, SENIOR!\"\nJin Yong collected the purple pills and put them in his sleeve pockets in glee. Then, his lifespan status changed as 75 years were deducted from the pool.\nHowever, after collecting everything, Jin Yong was not done. He gazed at the purple fluid in the transparent pot. He hadn't given up the tempting liquid yet.\n\"Senior, if I may ask, could you tell me what that water is? It smells like snake poison sacs.\"\n\"Oh, this?\"\nLeo bitterly smiled. This was the newest product that he wasn't proud of. After all, it was as useless as the poison grain pills.\n.\nLesser Yin Poison Potion\n- Adds Yin Energy to Dantian.\n- Increase Poison Resistance.\n- Increase Poison Qi by two years' worth of cultivation per 10cc.\n- High Chance of Causing Gastritis.\n.\nWhat was the point of drinking something that could cause gastritis? Leo regretted spending six hours to make a liter of this poisonous water.\n\"This might be too much for you. It's incomplete, and it will harm your constitution. Do not be greedy.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nJin Yong was dejected. Still, he didn't give up, \"T-Then, can I have a small portion of it? J-Just a few drops are fine!\"\nLeo deeply sighed. Since the guy asked for it, he let Jin Yong learn a harsh lesson through the results.\n\"Alright. Let me get a container.\"\n\"No need senior. I have this!\"\nJin Yong brought out a little bamboo canteen, which could be used to store fresh water. He drank everything inside and passed it to Leo.\n\"Please store the liquid in here, senior.\"\n\"… Okay.\"\nLeo received the canteen. Measuring it with his eyes, Leo estimated that it could only hold about 500-600cc of the fluid. He scooped the liquid from the pot with a ladle and carefully poured it into the container to the brim.\nNot wasting a single drop, Leo sealed the canteen with its plug and passed it to Jin Yong.\n\"Consider it a promotion. You can have that for free.\"\n\"!!!\"\nJin Yong's hands trembled as he slowly retrieved the container. After putting it in his, Jin Yong kowtowed, \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS, SENIOR! I'LL BE SURE TO COME BACK AND REPAY YOU WHEN I'M SUCCESSFUL!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes as he had heard a similar line before. He waved his hand.\n\"Instead of that, how about you repay me now by spreading the word about my store. I'm selling pills and weed for cheap. Of course, I only accept lifespan.\"\nJin Yong's eyes gleamed. He slammed his head against the floor and caused a loud noise.\nLeo's face darkened. He was afraid that this ugly guy might destroy his house. Fortunately, the floor was intact, and there was no scratch mark.\n\"I'll tell everybody in the Sixth Element Sect, senior! I'll even invite the elders there!\"\n\"… Okay.\"\n\"Umm.\" Jin Yong slowly stood up and asked Leo.\n\"Could I know your name, senior?\"\nOnce again, Leo widely grinned. He puffed his chest with pride and bragged about his name.\n\"My Daoist name is Florida Man!\"\n.\n.\nAfter a brief chat, Jin Yong excused himself and left. Before he left, he glanced at the fridges with the black grasses and other goodies.\n'With the poison pills and the poison liquid in my hands, I should be able to jump from first rank of foundation establishment stage to fifth rank at least! With this progress, the main sect will have no choice but to recall me! Then, I might even secure a spot in the next mystic realm expedition!'\nJin Yong departed. His laughter echoed in the forest. Still, he swore that he would come back here to return this favor one day.\n'I'll be back, Senior Florida Man! I'll be your customer again!'",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 21 – Florida Man Baths in Wolf's Goo, Complains He Smells like Testicles\nAfter Jin Yong was gone, Leo thought of the obnoxious plant pet outside. He checked its lifespan.\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 700 Years\n.\nIt consumed some of the mutated cabbages, the mutated wolves' innards, and blood, increasing its lifespan by 1,000 years. However, Leo chose not to swindle it again for the moment.\nLeo brought the purple soup and put the pot in front of the chomper. He opened the lid.\n\"Hey, Cat. I heard you're immune to poison and radiation. You think you can drink this?\"\nCat drowsily woke up and sniffed. Then, it turned stiff for a moment.\n\"MEOW <3\"\nAs if Cat just found its favorite food, it sank a hundred small roots into the pot and absorbed the liquid. The pulsing vines and roots drew everything into its head, and it burped. The poison soup was gone in a flash.\nLeo nodded in satisfaction. Then, he checked its lifespan, wondering if it benefited the plant.\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,200 Years\n.\nIt was just half-pot, but it increased Cat's lifespan by 500, which was better than feeding it raw blood and cabbages. Also, the chomper seemed satisfied with the soup.\n\"About 1,000 years of lifespan per full pot? But I can only make about one more pot since I don't have enough wolf blood and intestines. That one-liter requirement is brutal.\"\nGiving a liter of blood to Cat directly could boost its lifespan by about 200-300 years at most. However, after combining with other ingredients, it granted more.\n\"Meow?\"\nAs if Cat understood Leo's words, it tilted its head, asking him why he couldn't make more.\n\"Don't meow me, silly plant. You ate a portion of the wolf's intestines and blood. I have enough yin fluid for only another batch.\"\n\"Meow…\"\nCat was crestfallen. It stuck out its tongue and collapsed on the ground, sulking.\nSeeing the plant's reaction, Leo snickered. He also had an idea, so he gave it a hint.\n\"Look, Cat. We need dire wolves to make you the purple soup. If you, by chance, can hunt or capture those wolves for me, I can make you more soup!\"\n\"MEOW!?\"\n\"Damn right, I'm not kidding.\"\n\"MEOW, MEOW-MEOW MEOW?!\"\nLeo nodded, \"If you hunt other creatures, will I make you something? Of course. As long as you bring them here alive, I'll find a way to make you the best fertilizer.\"\n\"MEOW, MEOW!!\"\nMotivated. The chomper plant uprooted itself and dashed into the dark forest.\nLooking at how the plant ran, Leo couldn't help but laugh as it looked like a running chimpanzee. He then cleaned the pot and started making the next batch of poison potion for the plant. Then, he called it a night.\n.\n.\nThe next day morning, Leo woke up to see the progress of the auto-refining workshop. As expected, it finished making one liter worth of Lesser Yin Poison Potion.\nHe scooped everything in the cauldron with a ladle, storing them in the usual pot. When it got difficult to scoop, Leo lifted the entire cauldron and poured every drop of content into the glass container.\nThe cauldron was about 800 pounds, judging from Leo's feelings. Still, he easily lifted it with one hand.\nAfter putting the cauldron back, Leo carried the soup pot back to the store and placed it in the corner, away from the fridges or other display windows.\nWhile Leo was doing chores, he heard the creaking noise of wooden roots and the loud noise of a large animal. Leo turned around and looked through the front windows, checking outside.\nHe saw Cat, dragging a living wolf by its legs toward the store. However, it was not a regular dire wolf. It was a monster, whose physique was 10 meters in length!\nIts fur was dark green, and it leaked green gas. Three emerald eyes of the monster emitted dense mist. In addition, it had two mouths on top of each other as if it was Osiris from Yu Gi Oh. The five tails also looked similar to tree branches. However, its four legs were broken and bent at a weird angle.\nThe chomper plant was also in bad shape. It had countless scratches on its head. Some of the vines were dangling, and the roots seemed shorter than usual. It panted and dropped the monster beast down in front of the store.\n\"Meow…\"\nCat let out a soft cry, reporting its finding.\nSeeing how miserable Cat was, Leo rushed to the store and brought the newly cooked poison soup to it. The plant noticed the soup and dipped its roots and vines into it, sucking everything in seconds.\nLeo patted Cat's head, \"You stupid cat. I told you to hunt animals, not to get hurt. What's the point of risking your life for something exotic if you can't eat it?\"\nThe chomper purred and focused on licking the dripping vines and roots. The small scratches were healed, and the major wounds on the vines and roots were closed. For now, it was safe.\nLeo stood up and walked toward the large beast that Cat caught. The monster wolf noticed Leo's presence and struggled to get up, but its broken legs had no strength to support its large physique. It collapsed on the ground.\nGRRR\nDespite being heavily injured, it snarled at Leo.I think you should take a look at\nLeo was expressionless. He nonchalantly walked toward the head of the monster wolf and reached out his hand to touch it.\nAt that moment, the wolf monster's two mouths snapped at Leo. One caught his hand while the second mouth got his head. Then, it applied pressure on its large jaws, trying to chew or crush Leo to death.\nCRACK\nThe sound of a broken large piece of bone was audible.\n\"MEOW!\"\nCat let out a desperate cry. It rushed to Leo to pry the jaws open with its vines. However, the wolf's two mouths didn't budge.\nWhile Cat tried to help Leo, the latter's left hand patted its head. Then, it heard his voice.\n\"You don't need to help me. You should be worrying about your future breakfast instead.\"\nAs Leo finished speaking, small white pieces of fangs fell to the ground.\nThe one with broken bones was not Leo. The wolf ended up breaking its fangs after trying to bite Leo.\n*WHIMPER*\nThe wolf monster widened its green eyes in shock and pain. It tried to spit Leo out, but Leo suddenly spat into its throat and pushed himself out.\nLeo massaged his right wrist which got bitten. Then, he scratched his head. Not even a scratch was left behind on his skin.\n\"Look, doggie. When you bite someone, you're supposed to aim for their neck, not the hardest bones or skull. Anyway, you have 10 seconds to live. Any last word?\"\nThe monster didn't say anything. It trembled for a moment before the shaking turned into spasms. Foam came out from its mouth, after which it turned purple. The belly swelled as if it was a balloon. Solid scum and urine were discharged from the bottom orifices.\n\"MEOW <3\"\nAlthough the black waste and urine were nasty and disgusting, Cat opened its mouth and feasted on them in glee.\nGazing at the behavior of his cat, Leo sensed a shiver down his spine. He thought of the times it licked his face with the same tongue, causing his stomach to retch.\nLeo covered his mouth and approached the dead monster beast. He inspected the large body and the weird physique, including the two-mouth feature.\n\"How am I going to drain your freaking blood, doggie? You're as big as a mutated rat in my world.\"\nSince meat couldn't butcher itself, Leo started working on it by cutting its swelling belly with a skinning knife first.\nCLANK\nThe modern knife broke when Leo exerted his force. Judging the feedback of the tool, Leo was certain that the thick was harder than steel.\nAs modern tools wouldn't work on the monster beast, Leo straightened his right index finger. He gazed at the fingernail, entrusting his job to it.\n\"Do me a favor, my nail. Cut through this thing for me.\"\nNo finger could speak or reply to its master's questions. Thus, Leo pressed his finger on the monster's stomach and pushed.\nPU\nThe nail sank into the skin as if it was a sharp knife cutting through a piece of raw steak. However, what came out wasn't blood but yellowish rotten pus, splashing on Leo as if it was a bursting zit landmine.\nLeo was covered in yellow slime-like goo!\n\"…\"\nLeo accidentally sniffed it, then his expression turned ugly. It smelled like a piece of skin from someone's testicles who hadn't taken a bath for months.\nIn disgust, Leo took off his clothes and ran toward the alchemy workshop, where he had stored several canteens of fresh water from the stream. He jumped into the cauldron. Then, he poured the water from the canteen, getting rid of the waste as soon as possible.\n.\n10 minutes later, Leo climbed out of the cauldron, filled with hot water and yellow goo. He threw the dirty clothes into the fire to dispose of them.\nBecause of frustration, Leo no longer had the mood to work. He gazed at his drenched body, which still had a few drops of yellow puss on him. Moreover, he still smelled like a dirty man's virgin balls during No-Nut-November Season.\n\"This will take days to clean it off. Next time, I won't touch any inflamed part! Dammit!\"\nWhile complaining, Leo glanced at his makeshift bathtub.\nThe boiling yellow liquid sent out a foul odor and black miasma. Moreover, Leo heard someone's shrilling wail from inside the fluid as if it was cursed.\nAttempting to remove the nasty liquid, Leo opened the workshop menu and pressed the research button, trying to trick the system to remove it.\nDING\nThe workshop accepted the item. Instantly, all liquid inside and the foul odor were gone like smoke.\nThe next moment, the workshop informed Leo of the result.\n.\n[Emerald Wolf's Tear]\nThis rare tear can be extracted from any 5th-grade or higher emerald wolf's body. Can be consumed directly to increase one's muscle strength and bone density. Diluting one drop in freshwater can transform it into Yin Fluid.\n[Traits]\nIncrease muscle strength and bone density by 10% per 10cc.\n.\nLeo blankly stared at the workshop's window message for ten minutes. Afterward, he screamed in anger.\n\"WOLF'S TEAR MY VIRGIN ASS! THIS IS DIRTY ZIT'S PUS, YOU #@&$!!\"\n.\nMeanwhile, Cat had the best day of its life. After it finished the waste of the wolf, it slurped the yellowish goo in glee.\n\"Meow <3\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 22 : Florida Man Cures Stray Cat's Blindness Using Homemade Parasites\nLeo ended up spending a few years of his lifespan purchasing bars of soap and a modern bathtub. After 30 minutes of scrubbing, Leo got out of the bathtub and poured the wastewater into the outhouse. Although he had some concerns if Cat could drink soap juice, he dumped the waste water there anyway.\nAfter refreshing himself, Leo returned to the front of the store to resume butchering the wolf. This time, aside from his right hand, he wore some protection : the hazmat suit.\nWhen Leo returned, he found the chomper licking the belly of the monster. Most of the yellow goo was gone. Noticeably, the purple skin of Cat glistened under the sunlight as if it had coated itself with premium lotions.\nLeo frowned as Cat ate most of the goo. He complained.\n\"Cat, that mayonnaise is the ingredient of your purple juice. If you drink them all, I can't make you those.\"\n\"Meow?!\"\nCat turned around and dropped its jaw. It covered its wide mouth with a few leaves, looking shocked.\nLeo brought out a metal bucket that he always used to draw water from the stream. He put it next to the wolf and began scooping the remaining yellow pus into it. As not much fluid was left, Leo managed to fill half of the bucket.\n\"Don't drink this anymore, okay?\"\n\"Meow...\"\nCat was dejected. Still, it seemed satisfied after the meal.\nLooking at the chomper plant up close, Leo noticed something strange. Previously, its head was attached to its soft vine, and the branches were about one inch thick.\nThe present chomper's vines and branches were twice thicker. In addition, it grew flower buds on its branches, producing white fog around itself. Fortunately, the flower buds gave off a lavender scent, so Leo had no issue with Cat.\n\"Go play somewhere else, Cat. Daddy is going to work.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nThe chomper moved its eight chubby roots, walking like a spider. It climbed the cabin and sat on the roof, enjoying the sunbath.\nAs no one was around to interrupt his work, Leo began dissecting and skinning the monster. He purchased additional buckets and large bins to store the innards, blood, bones, skin, and meat.\n.\nAt noon, Leo finally dissected everything. However, this time, he didn't directly feed the organs to his pet right away. He brought each sample to the cauldron pot to research them.\nThe first item was none other than the intestines. He pressed the confirmation.\nThe result instantly appeared, but the intestines were ejected from the cauldron.\nDING\n<You have already researched Fenrir Intestine.>\n\"...\"\nLeo deeply frowned. He was sure that the intestines were different than the mutated wolf, yet the workshop system claimed that they were the same.\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nHe tried the other ingredients. Unfortunately, the workshop rejected every item.\n<You have already researched Fenrir Blood.>\n<You have already researched Fenrir Liver.>\n<You have already researched Fenrir Meat.>\n<You have already researched Fenrir Skin.>\n<You have already researched Fenrir Heart.>\n\"OH, COME ON! IT'S NOT THE SAME!\"\nLeo had the urge to launch this cauldron to Mars, but he couldn't afford to waste his expensive workshop tools. He reached out for the emerald eyes of the wolf and tossed one of them inside.\nThis time, it vanished. The cauldron didn't spit it out.\nDING\n<Research completed!>\n<You have discovered the Eye of Fenrir!>\n<A new pill recipe has been added to the encyclopedia.>\n.\n[Eye of Fenrir]\nExtracted from an elder Fenrir. This is a universal catalyst for Wood, Metal, and Poison pills. It also contains thick poisonous miasma inside. Many demons love these as they usually implant them as their third or fourth eye to see through poison miasma. Can be used in alchemy to create a prosthetic eye.\n[Alchemy Recipe : Prosthetic Eye of Fenrir]\nOne Eye of Fenrir\nOne Wood Element Catalyst\nOne Metal Element Catalyst\nOne Poison Element Catalyst\n100cc of Yin Fluid\n100cc of Fenrir Blood\nPoison, Metal, and Wood Element Essence\n.\n\"Prosthetic Eye?\"\nLeo was interested in this object. He double-checked the ingredient list in the recipe and made a checklist.\n\"I have no problem with essence since it magically comes out from my spit. The eye, checked. The yin fluid, obtainable, so checked. Fenrir Blood, checked. Poison catalyst? I can use the intestines for that, so checked. Metal catalyst, I can use the nuts. As for the last one... Wood element catalyst... eh.\"\nLeo pursed his lips and fell into deep thought. He remembered that he had it, but he couldn't remember. Thus, he opened the encyclopedia menu of the workshop, searching if he had any item that could be used as a wood element catalyst.\nIt didn't take long for him to find one. There was one item that he had researched before.\n.\n[Root of Infant Demon Dryad]\nThis root can be extracted from an infant demon dryad, a rare mythical specimen from a demonic realm. It can be used to substitute both wood and poison element catalysts due to its poisonous nature.\n[Traits]\nIncrease any poison element pill success rate by 25%.\n.\nIt was the chomper's roots. Leo simply needed to cut a piece of it to use in this recipe. Wasting no time, Leo climbed up his store and went after Cat.\nAs Cat was photosynthesizing the sunlight, it was asleep. Its long chubby roots spread across the entire building.\nLeo didn't need much. He gently snapped the tip of the smallest root. It was one inch long, and it should not affect Cat much.\nThe chomper didn't react when Leo cut the tip of its root, but it yawned and returned to change its sleeping posture.\nAfter getting the necessary wood catalyst ingredient, Leo gathered all items and put them next to the workshop. He set the ingredients and chose the pill recipe. Then, he confirmed the system.\nDING\n<Refining Prosthetic Eye of Fenrir...>\nA timer appeared. However, the duration shocked Leo.\n23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 55 Seconds...\nLeo facepalmed. It took too long to make this item. He felt like he wasted the opportunity to make more grain pills to make money.I think you should take a look at\nDejected, Leo returned to his cabin to clear the room for new wolf meat. He spent the rest of the day cooking, doing chores, and cutting wolf meat into smaller pieces.\n.\n.\nThe next day, at noon, Leo sat on a chair behind his store, staring at the cauldron. It slowly counted down while the progress bar gradually moved from left to right.\nDING\n<Workshop has refined 28 Inferior Prosthetic Eyes of Fenrir and 2 Lesser Prosthetic Eyes of Fenrir.>\n\"...\"\nThe finished products floated over the cauldron, glittering in green light. All of them moved around as if they were alive, looking at the forest, cabin, workshop, and Leo in curiosity.\nLeo was speechless. He had expected only one eye as he had only one wolf's eye as the material. However, the workshop created 30!\nHe reached out to pick one of them. It wiggled and bounced on his palm while it stared into Leo's eyes.\n\"Wut da hail are yu?\"\n*BOUNCE*\n\"...\"\n.\nInferior Prosthetic Eye of Fenrir\nThis prosthetic eye is a manmade parasite. By implanting it on a person's face or replacing an eye, it will connect its nerves to the host's brain, sharing its vision with the host. The eye has the following traits.\n- Enable Night Vision.\n- Increase the host's resistance to poison, wood, and metal Qi deviation by 50%.\n- Enable the host to cultivate Wood Qi.\n- Increase visual range by 100 meters.\n.\nLesser Prosthetic Eye of Fenrir\nThis prosthetic eye is a manmade parasite. By implanting it on a person's face or replacing an eye, it will connect its nerves to the host's brain and transmit the signal, sharing its vision with the host. The eye has the following traits.\n- Enable Night Vision.\n- Increase the host's resistance to poison, wood, and metal Qi deviation by 60%.\n- Enable the host to cultivate Wood Qi and Metal Qi.\n- Increase visual range by 200 meters.\n.\nAfter Leo read through the description, he widened his eyes in astonishment.\nThey were technically parasites!\n\"Yikes. I guess I and Cat can't eat you.\"\n*SHIVER*\nThe bouncing eye on Leo's palm and the floating ones heard his words and shivered in fear. The small balls were wet as if they were crying.\nFeeling bad for these creatures, Leo lightly stroked it, \"Don't worry. I won't eat you or harm you. As a matter of fact, I have a good host for y'all.\n*BOUNCE*\nThe 30 eyeballs danced and jumped around. Although they couldn't make a noise, their innocent sparkling green pupils looked happy and excited.\nWhile Leo chatted with the eyeballs, the lazy chomper crawled down from the cabin's rooftop. It looked at what Leo had made.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"This ain't food or a treat.\"\n\"Meow...\"\nCat was sad. It faced the floating eyeballs and salivated, scaring the small green eyes again.\nLeo said nothing. He lightly attached the eyeball on his palm above Cat's thick lips, leaning toward the right. Coincidentally, the eye was the lesser-graded one.\n\"Meow?\" Cat was puzzled about what his master was doing to its face.\n\"Stay still, kitty. You don't have eyes, right? How about adding a pair?\"\n\"Meow??\"\nCat was confused. Still, it let Leo put the strange delicious-looking eyeball on its head.\nLeo adjusted its position. Then, he poked at Cat's skin.\n*WIGGLE*\nSmall tentacles came out from the back of the eyeball, penetrating into Cat's face. A few seconds later, it became one with the plant.\n\"MEOW?!\"\nThe chomper panicked. It tried to unplug the eyeball. But as it had no hands, it couldn't do anything about it.\nSeveral seconds later, Cat's skin generated an eyelid. It blinked for the first time and stopped moving.\n\"Meow...?\"\nIt tilted its head and rotated its eye around. That was the first time that Cat got to see the world.\nLeo waved his hand in front of Cat's eye. It blinked several times and gazed at Leo in curiosity.\n\"Meow, meow?\"\n\"Yes. This is I, Florida Man!\" Leo made a Jojo reference pose.\n\"Meow! Meow-Meow, Meow!\"\n\"And yes, I gave you an eye so that you can see everything around you instead of randomly moving around with your sixth sense.\"\n\"Meow? Meow-Meow?\"\n\"Oh, you can feel the parasite? Don't worry about it. It just wants to live, but it needs some of your energy. In exchange, it will boost your physicality, okay?\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"No. You can't eat the other parasites. As a matter of fact, I don't think you have enough eyes for your large head. I'm planning to put another one on you. Get ready.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nAfter getting confirmation from Cat, Leo carefully placed another lesser-graded eye on its face.\nWhen Leo was done, Cat's two eyes widened as the parasites and the host's vision became one.\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat was in a good mood as it could see the world in color instead of using its sixth sense. It bobbed its head up and down like a vibing cockatoo bird.\n\"You're welcome, kitty.\"\nAs it was so grateful to Leo, Cat hugged him and licked his face, applying the odor of the mutated monster's gaga and goo-goo to his skin. Moreover, the rotting poisonous saliva intensified the bad breath.\nLeo was expressionless when he got ambushed by the saliva and the foul odor. He inwardly cried.\n\"I should have worn the hazmat mask around you.\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 23 – Philanthropist \"Mr. Florida Man\" Donates Meth to Neighbor\nAfter experimenting with the eyeballs, Leo collected the remaining eyes in glass jars and put them behind the display windows.\nThe eyes stared at the view in curiosity and hopped up and downs non-stop. They didn't seem to get bored from looking at the same scenery for hours.\nAfter washing his face, Leo returned to the workshop as usual. Instead of continuing to make grain pills, Leo explored the pill recipes he had discovered so far, searching for other pills that he could make with his current ingredients.\nSome recipes required inaccessible materials, such as Holy Water, Unicorn's Tear, and Virgin Sage's Blood. Thus, Leo couldn't touch them for the time being.\nHowever, he had enough ingredients to make a new thing.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Werewolf Dantian Pill]\nOne Fenrir Heart\nA liter of Fenrir Blood\nOne Poison Element Catalyst\nPoison Essence\n.\n\"Neat! I'm bored of grain pills. Let me see what you can do.\"\nOnce again, Leo substituted the poison element catalyst with wolf intestines. Then, he added the blood and the heart. The poison essence was his spit, so there was no problem with that.\nDING\n<Will you refine Werewolf Dantian Pill?>\n\"Yes, please.\"\n<Refining Werewolf Dantian Pill…>\nOnce again, the timer showed how long the workshop needed to complete the pills.\n23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 57 Seconds!\nLeo almost fell to his knees and screamed in agony. He hated waiting.\n\"NOOOO!! Why are you taking so long to make some ancient METH?! Can't you make it instantly like video games?!\"\nThe workshop gave Leo no response. He fell on the ground, making the \"OTL\" pose, saddened by the harsh reality.\nAs Leo had nothing to do, he turned his attention to the non-alchemy materials, namely wolf meat.\n\"That's it. I'm gonna eat everything until I can't eat anymore.\"\n.\n.\nIt had been almost a week since Wu Buyi last visited Leo.\nWu Buyi had visited three cities during the past 4-5 days, and he bought a hundred large baskets of fruits and vegetables for Leo. He also had a dozen sacks of seeds for his favorite senior to grow crops.\nWu Buyi arrived at Leo's cabin before sunset. As soon as he arrived, the first thing in his vision was the large head of the chomper plant. It now resided on top of Leo's cabin, producing white mist and green gas around its body. In addition, it grew two eyes, which stared at him.\n\"Meow <3\"\nAs usual, Cat opened its mouth, begging the visitor for food.\nWu Buyi clicked his tongue in disgust for a moment. But when he noticed the Wood Qi and Poison Qi from the monster, he realized something.\nCat had evolved! Its strength was comparable to a golden core cultivator!\n'What did Daoist Florida Man do to that monster?! How come it is so strong now?!'\nAlthough unwilling, Wu Buyi showed respect to Leo by giving Cat some food. He ejected a dead monster's carcass toward the chomper.\nCat caught it and chewed the monster in glee. While eating, he bobbed his head up and down like a vibing cockatoo bird again.\nWu Buyi ignored the monster and arranged his gifts in front of the store. He ejected all items from his spatial ring and put them on the ground.\nWhile Wu Buyi arranged his items there, his eyes noticed the movements inside the store. The lights were turned on, illuminating the items and the pills on the display table. The eyeballs in glass jars also fixated on him, jumping up and down to get his attention.\n\"Huh?\"\nWu Buyi narrowed his eyes as he recognized some of the pills. They lacked the luster of well-made medicines, but their feature and color couldn't fool his eyes.\nThey were elemental grain pills!\nAs an alchemist, his heart ached. He would never make elemental grain pills as it was a waste of rare materials. If he had the same items, he would have made cultivation pills instead.\nStill, Wu Buyi was interested in the store. He put all his gifts down and entered the store, hoping to inspect the pills and the items inside.\nUpon getting inside, Wu Buyi found Leo, who was in the middle of eating cooked steaks behind a long counter.\n\"Oh, hi. I haven't seen you in days, mister,\" Leo waved his hand at the alchemist.\nWu Buyi politely cupped his fist and bowed.\n\"Daoist Florida Man, as promised, I've brought you more vegetables, fruits, and seeds for you to cultivate spirit herbs.\"\n\"Ah, nice!\" Leo stood up and looked outside the glass windows. When he saw a bunch of fruit and vegetable baskets, he widely smiled. \"Thank you so much for your trouble. Here, want some steak I made? Have you eaten anything?\"\nWu Buyi glanced at the steak. It was roughly cut, and it was slightly on the rare side. As he was trained not to eat any hard food, he chose to decline.I think you should take a look at\n\"My stomach has gotten used to grain pills. I'm afraid it can't handle solid food anymore.\"\n\"Oh, shame,\" Leo shrugged, but he seemed happy with Wu Buyi's answer. He shoved the last pieces of steak in his mouth and put on his rubber gloves.\nWu Buyi had no idea why Leo had to wear gloves inside his store. He watched the store owner walking toward the pill bottles on the display stand and pulling a red pill out. He brought it for Wu Buyi to see up close.\n\"By the way, I just made this during my free time. Do you think it can become popular among your disciples? I'm selling them for three years of lifespan per pill, by the way.\"\n\"Hmm? Three years per pill?\"\nWu Buyi raised his brow. His brain calculated at the same speed as a modern computer.\n'Three years per inferior elemental pills are still very cheap. Some disciples might find them useful since not everyone can enter the mystic realm to cultivate, but they are useless to nascent soul stage cultivators and stronger. Is he trying to get rid of these useless pills?'\nThe alchemist came up with a solution. He informed Leo.\n\"I'm sure everybody in Life Sword Sect will be eager to purchase these pills. I'll spread the news about your new items.\"\n\"Ah, thank you very much. Also, I see that you've brought a lot of fruits and veggies. How much are they?\"\nWu Buyi laughed, \"They are the tokens of gratitude from me. I hope that Life Sword Sect and Daoist Florida Man can be on good terms.\"\n\"Aw. You're a nice guy,\" Leo dryly laughed and stroked his beard. His eyes shifted, looking at the fridges in his store. Then, he said something that Wu Buyi had never expected.\n\"How about this? You have done a lot for me. I'll give you any item I have in my store in exchange for your veggies.\"\nWu Buyi was stunned. He didn't expect Leo to be this kind.\n\"C-Can I take anything?\"\nLeo happily nodded, \"Yup. But just one item, alright? Don't be greedy and take multiple items, or I'll be mad.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi gulped. He looked around the shop and checked the things in the fridges. Then, he finally noticed the weird cabbages in the showcase refrigerators.\n'Yin Cabbages?! This thing only exists in the demon realm! Even the sect master can't go too deep in that place. How did he get so many?!'\nWu Buyi brightly smiled and looked for other goodies. Then, he found countless stacks of fresh immortal grasses.\n\"…\"\nThe alchemist almost vomited blood. There were over 3,000 blades of grass in the showcase.\n'So many immortal grasses! Where did he get them?! Did he harvest them from the demon realm? That might be it! He must have a connection with the demon realm or he has gone deep into the realm! Wow.'\nWu Buyi smacked his chest, suppressing his desire and greed. He turned to the other refrigerators. Then, he discovered that there were items in the chest freezers.\n'Ah, the Fenrir's innards! But wait… why are there so many?! How many Fenrirs did he kill?!'\nFenrir meat, blood, and bones attracted him the most, especially the liver. As Fenrir Liver was a universal ingredient of antidotes, its value surpassed other parts.\nWu Buyi ignored the cabbages and immortal grass. He stared into the slide-door chest freezer, where Leo had stored the mutated liver. But when he was about to choose, the corner of his eyes noticed the movement on the display stand behind the glass windows.\nThe green eyes in the jars kept staring at him.\n\"…\"\nThese eyes were something that Wu Buyi had never seen before. He suppressed his greed and asked Leo.\n\"Daoist Florida Man, what are these… living eyeballs?\"\nLeo followed Wu Buyi's gaze and found the eyeballs. He snickered.\n\"Oh, those eyeballs? They are the Prosthetic Eyes of Fenrir. It's my first time making them, so the quality is a bit poor. If you attach it to your forehead, it will become your third eye. It gives a boost to your visual range also.\"\nWu Buyi gulped. His interest was piqued, and he discarded the thought of picking Fenrir's Liver.\nProsthetic organs were more valuable than antidote ingredients. After all, many cultivators always risked their lives for cultivation resources, and the majority of experts didn't have complete 32 organs - Some lost their arms, legs, or eyes during combat with wild monster beasts.\nThey could be resold in an auction for a high price! Even an inferior-grade organ could be sold for a million spirit stones!\n\"I'll take the eyeball, please.\"\n\"Cool!\" Leo giggled and picked an eyeball for him. The eyeball jumped up and down on Leo's glove in joy while it stared at the potential host.\nLeo looked at Wu Buyi's bald head. He wondered if the third eye would fit him, \"Want me to help you equip it?\"\nWu Buyi shook his head. He came up with an excuse, \"I'm planning to give this to my disciple. I don't need extra vision range, sir.\"\n\"Ah, shame,\" Leo was disappointed. He was looking forward to experimenting on a human.\nSince Wu Buyi already picked an item, Leo closed the jars and tried to upsell the items.\n\"Are you interested in other things? I can sell them to you. As usual, I only accept lifespan.\"\nWu Buyi broke a sweat. He already spent 500 years, so he didn't want to waste more. Thus, he excused himself.\n\"That would be for another occasion, sir. Oh, I have something else to do at my sect. Please excuse me.\"\n\"Ah, okay. Take care of yourself.\"\nWu Buyi let out a sigh of relief. He turned around and was about to leave. But suddenly, he remembered something very important.\nThe alchemist had another purpose here. Not only he came here to deliver fruits and vegetables, but he also ran an errand. He turned around to ask Leo.\n\"Daoist Florida Man, would you like to join our Life Sword Sect as a guest elder? The next mystic realm expedition will begin in two weeks. We are hoping that you can join us on this trip.\"\n\"… Mystic realm expedition?\"",

He understood that Wu Buyi wanted him to join his sect, but he had a major issue that he couldn't tell Wu Buyi - He needed to be in the shop domain. If he went outside, the auto-translation feature would have been disabled, and he wouldn't be able to communicate with the others.\n'How the duck will I communicate with them if I go too far from my store? Learning Chinese? As if I can speak Chinese. What will I say when I'm in front of the crowd?'\nLeo paused as his brain.exe malfunctioned and thought of a Chinese sentence. He didn't care if the spirits of the Chinese government might deduce his social credits afterward.\n'Zaoshang Hao Zhongguo, Xianzai Wo You Bingqilin! Wo Hen Xihuan Bingqilin! Yes, I'm Zhong Xina, and I love ice cream... God dammit, brain! WTF were you thinking?!'\nLeo closed his eyes, crossed his arms behind his back, and deeply frowned, suppressing his silly brain from wandering off the topic.\nSeeing his complex expression, Wu Buyi gulped, afraid that he might have jumped the gun and said something wrong.\n\"A-Are you busy, Daoist Florida Man? You don't have to join us if you don't want to.\"\nLeo slowly opened his eyes and shook his head. No matter what, he couldn't join other organizations if he would be forced to move out of his shop domain.\n\"Sorry. I have no intention of joining any organization at the moment.\"\nWu Buyi was slightly dejected that he failed to recruit Leo to Life Sword Sect. Still, he didn't give up persuading him. After all, the mystic realms were the only way to acquire rare ingredients or capture rare monster beasts. Edible animals, rare vegetables, and exotic fruit trees were abundant in there as long as the cultivators were skillful enough to collect them.\n\"What about the mystic realm, sir? Will you join us on this trip? We will reserve a seat for you. It's better than entering the mystic realm alone as a rogue cultivator since you might have to compete against the others for an available quota.\"\nLeo felt like they were talking in a different language. He wanted to know what the mystic realm was, but Wu Buyi insisted on inviting him.\nStill, for the sake of getting more customers to scam, Leo politely declined Wu Buyi.\n\"I'm truly sorry. I have another plan.\"\n\"... I see.\" Wu Buyi deeply sighed. He seemed sad.\nLeo changed the topic to cut the silence, \"By the way, could you explain what the mystic realms are? Explain to me like I'm six years old.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWu Buyi was surprised that Leo asked that question. He thought that Leo was already aware of the local culture and traditions.\n'Does he not know about the mystic realm's custom or the Jianghu Alliance's rules? Oh, right. He must be testing me. Since he came from a higher realm, he might not know about our customs. That must be the reason!'\nThe alchemist coughed. He explained.\n\"The mystic realms are worlds in another dimension, sir. The Jianghu Alliance is managing them, and the Life Sword Sect is in charge of a portal. Every three months, every portal to the other world automatically opens. However, the destinations are always random, so we don't know any other detail about them until we get in there.\"\nWu Buyi paused and brought out a bamboo scroll. He opened the scroll, revealing the rough drawing of a map. Leo examined the map and discovered that it depicted an island.\nThe alchemist continued, \"This is the map our sect drew in the last expedition. Our sect's portal connected to an island in the middle of an ocean, and it was full of danger. We ran into an army of a hundred thousand 3rd grade monster beasts. Oh, they are as strong as foundation establishment cultivators by the way. We managed to kill a thousand and scavenged some herbs from the island. Unfortunately, we only had seven days to finish our expedition, so we couldn't fully explore the place.\"\nLeo nodded. On the map, there were only five landmarks. The rest of the map was blank.\n\"The next expedition is expected to be a new place. This time, we're planning to send our strongest elders and the most talented disciples there to gain some real combat experience. Since you've helped a lot, I wish to give you a spot as a token of gratitude. I bet you will experience fortuitous encounters in there and find many treasures.\"\nLeo still couldn't understand why Wu Buyi wanted him along. However, from the tone and the information, Leo roughly guessed that the alchemist wanted him to tag along with his disciples and protected them.\n\"In short, you want me to babysit your disciples?\"\n\"No, no, no! Argh... Yes, you're right.\"\nWu Buyi sweated profusely. Leo hit the mark, and the former couldn't come up with an excuse. Although embarrassed, Wu Buyi confessed.\n\"I'm ashamed. In the previous expedition, four of the ten disciples died because we lacked life-saving treasures and healing medicines. I notice that you're good in botany, so I thought that you could provide us with some healing medicines and herbs.\"\nWu Buyi sighed and lamented to himself. He turned around, giving up convincing Leo.\nOn the other hand, Leo had his own thoughts.\n'I don't understand why they insist on going there and risk their lives. If I were them, I would have just sat back and scratched my belly button at home. What do they lack? Herbs? Pills? Oh, right. They're cultivators, so they lack cultivation resources? If I can solve that by selling them cultivation pills, will that help? Is that a win-win for me and the sect?'\nLeo suddenly had an inspiration. He grinned and coughed.\n\"Ahem. So, you lack cultivation resources, right?\"\nWu Buyi lowered his head, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"What do you usually get from the mystic realms?\"\n\"Erm... rare mineral, ancient relics, treasures, elemental herbs, and corpses of ancient experts.\"I think you should take a look at\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"If I have to name some, I have a few. You see, mystic realms are usually filled with elemental Qi that doesn't exist in the mainland, and our people need them to get stronger. Also, seniors like us usually collect some rare herbs and natural minerals since they can't be found on the mainland. For example, the immortal grass grew in some mystic realms...\"\nWu Buyi looked at the showcase refrigerators in the store and pointed at them, planning to give an example. However, he stopped mid-sentence when he noticed something unusual.\nAside from the yin cabbages and immortal grass, the bananas in there didn't look like a regular ones. Upon getting a closer look, he sensed an aura of Earth Element Qi from the bananas!\nThey were all rare fruits that only grew in a desert mystic realm!\n\"...\"\nWu Buyi was speechless. He looked at Leo, wanting an explanation of where he got those fruits from.\nLeo ignored Wu Buyi's funny expression. He changed the subject by pointing at the eyeballs in the jars, \"I get it. Say, mister. If you sell those, how much will you get in return?\"\n\"...\"\nWu Buyi gulped. There were 27 eyeballs in the jars, not including the one on his hand. Each could easily fetch a million spirit stones, which could be exchanged for rare treasures, artifacts, pills, and many more.\nOnce again, Wu Buyi told Leo the truth.\n\"If you sell one of these to an auction house, you might get about a million spirit stones.\"\nLeo heard something interesting. He probed for more information.\n\"How much is a million spirit stones? What can they buy?\"\n\"Hahaha. Sir, you must be joking. A million spirit stones are a lot even for me. With one million spirit stones, you can buy a small flying ship or a top-graded flying sword. If a first-rank foundation establishment stage cultivator absorbs all Qi from the spirit stones, he is guaranteed to advance to the nascent stage! That's two major stages, sir. This amount is life-changing.\"\nLeo stroked his beard and widely grinned. In secret, he compared the value in his mind.\n'So, a small flying ship is like a small car, and a top-graded flying sword is an expensive bike. If I compare it this way, it makes a lot of sense. Vehicles are always expensive since it saves time, and time is invaluable. Speaking of which, how much should I charge for the eyes...'\nLeo glanced at the baskets of vegetables and fruits. He remembered that he hadn't started plowing farmland yet. Moreover, he needed more lifespan to upgrade his shops and tools. Then, he questioned himself if upgrading was necessary.\n'To be honest, I can be self-sufficient and retire quietly without upgrading anything. I can slowly eat the mutated plants and veggies here. Then, I can live as long as I want to. But hey, what's the point of living in poverty for a billion years when I can upgrade my life quality with someone else's lifespan! I NEED TO FARM LIFESPAN AND SCAM MORE PEOPLE! CAPITALISM HO!'\nMotivated, Leo proposed his idea to Wu Buyi.\n\"Instead of letting me join your expedition whatsoever, how about you give me the list of what you found in the past expeditions?\"\nWu Buyi was confused about why Leo wanted the sensitive information. He was reluctant to disclose the intel as it affected their sect's security.\n\"Sir, could I ask why you need them for?\"\n\"For some calculations. Oh, if you aren't comfortable, it's fine. You don't have to be too detailed. I just need to know some general information that every people know.\"\n\"...\"\nAgain, Wu Buyi didn't want to expose the sect's secrets. He decided to tell Leo what everybody in the other sects and countries knew.\n\"We got some carcasses of monster beasts, elemental herbs, and some minerals to make weapons, sir.\"\n\"Are the carcasses as good as these things in the freezer?\" Leo tapped the freezer chests, wondering if they were better than mutated wolves.\nWu Buyi shook his head, \"No, sir. They're much inferior to this...\"\n\"Okay. What about those veggies over there,\" Leo pointed at the bananas in the showcase fridges.\nAgain, Wu Buyi bitterly laughed, \"We... can't compare ourselves to you, sir. Your precious herbs and materials are far superior to what we had.\"\n\"Good!\"\nLeo heard enough. He discovered an opportunity to do business.\n\"Instead of me working for your sect, how about you work for me instead? I need a PR and a coordinator to handle some trivial tasks.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWu Buyi was stunned for several seconds. He doubted himself if he heard it right.\nLeo pushed on, \"For example, I need someone to run errands and fetch me some regular vegetables and fruits from other cities once in a while. Also, I need someone to advertise my store that I'm willing to trade my rare materials that you can't usually find in the mystic realms. Of course, I only accept lifespan.\"\nLeo widely grinned while Wu Buyi dropped his jaw.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 25 : Florida Man's General Store Runs a Promotion : Price Increases by 500%!\nLeo explained his business scheme to Wu Buyi.\n\"You won't be doing it for free. I'll pay you commissions. For example, if an invited customer spends 100 years of lifespan in my store, I'll give you an item worth 10 years of lifespan as a commission reward! Easy, right?\"\nWu Buyi was flabbergasted. He had never heard of this business scheme before. Even though he had traded with countless merchants and fellow cultivators, he never heard of the [Sale Commission] system.\nExcited, Wu Buyi recited what he learned out loud, \"S-So, if I introduce you to a customer, and that person spends 500 years of lifespan here, I get 50 years of lifespan as points to exchange for the items in the store? Is that correct?!\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"I'M IN! COUNT ME IN!\"\nWu Buyi readily accepted. After all, there was nothing to lose. Moreover, he knew hundreds of alchemists and experts in the Jianghu Alliance, and Wu Buyi was confident that those undying old coots would spend most of their lifespan for Leo's precious herbs and fruits.\nThe alchemist salivated, imagining what he could obtain for free. However, he was sober enough to figure out a problem : There was no currency or medium to tally Wu Buyi's commission rewards.\nHaving some doubts, Wu Buyi asked Leo, \"But, fellow Daoist. How do we calculate my rewards? Do I have to claim it right away? Can we do something like my sect's contribution points so that I can trade my points with the reward material later?\"\nLeo had expected this. He checked the store system if he could bestow lifespan to others.\nThe answer was no : He could not give away his lifespan to other people directly.\nHowever, there was a convenient way. As Leo examined the system menu, he noticed a locked feature.\n[Unlock Store Employee Feature] : 100 Years of Lifespan\nIt cost 100 years to unlock, which Leo had no problem with that as he had eaten so many wolf steaks and grasses during the week.\nDING\nLeo unlocked it. Then, he tried to operate the system. He pressed on a new tab next to the store domain building menu.\n<Please appoint your worker.>\nA new window appeared. A resume template was shown on the screen. On the blank portrait, there was an [+] icon.\nLeo pressed on it. Then, the system asked.\n<Please choose the worker you wish to employ. The worker must be within your shop domain.>\n'Oh?'\nLeo immediately pressed the [+] icon. Then, a list of people in the domain appeared. As Wu Buyi was the only one here, there was only one name to choose.\nAfter adding Wu Buyi to the menu, his general information was shown. The interesting part was at the bottom of the screen.\n<Wage and Salary Settings>\n<Please choose the payment method for the employee.>\nThere were four options : Monthly wage, Annual Salary, Commission-Based, and Contract-Based. In addition, Leo could adjust the wage or the commission rate.\nHowever, one thing made Leo smile. He could pay Wu Buyi with lifespan instead of gold coins or other native currency. He immediately set the payment method to commission-based and set the fee to 10%.\nDING\n<Wu Buyi has been assigned as an employee.>\nOnly Leo could see the message. Wu Buyi was still oblivious to the changes.\nAfter confirming the method, Leo confirmed their deal.\n\"We'll settle with a 10% commission. Also, you should know about the price of my items.\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned the price tag, Wu Buyi immediately offered his advice.\n\"Sir, about the price of the items, can I offer my suggestion? You see, I believe you underprice them.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n.\n.\n= At night =\nWu Buyi returned to the sect with a blank expression. His mind still recalled the deal he made with Leo while he looked at the living eyeball in his hand. He couldn't stop smiling.\nHe could tell that it was a parasite, judging how it secretly eat dead skin on his palm for food. He also looked at a banana in his left hand, which he got from Leo as the advanced payment for the advertisement.\n\"Instead of risking our lives in mystic realms, we can get cheap pills and alchemy ingredients from his store. This idea is... amazing and innovative!\"\nWu Buyi was hyped. He rushed to his house to get a container for the golden sand banana and the eyeball. Then, he flew to a friend's abode - The pagoda of the grand elder Han Hao.I think you should take a look at\nAs soon as he entered Han Hao's room, he showed the grand elder the banana and the prosthetic eyeball.\n\"Han Hao. You see this?\" Wu Buyi pointed at the banana, \"Guess where I got it from?\"\nHan Hao slowly opened his eyes. He had been meditating and waiting for Wu Buyi's report regarding Leo for days. But instead of reporting, Wu Buyi seemed strangely excited.\n\"Is that an earth element fruit? Where did you get that from? The mystic realm hasn't opened yet.\" Han Hao frowned and gazed at the jumping eyeball in a bottle.\n\"From the usual place, Daoist Florida Man's store.\"\n\"We asked you to investigate the person, not to shop! What the hell, Buyi?\"\nWhen they chatted a few days ago, they agreed that Wu Buyi would visit the mysterious cultivator to investigate his motive. However, this guy flew around and visited so many cities during the days, which disappointed Han Hao.\nWu Buyi looked smug. He giggled, \"You know what? I'm going to work part-time for Daoist Florida Man's store now. I'll send all the available alchemists to visit his store and buy his rare herbs. Tell the others for me that I won't be going to the mystic realm this season.\"\n\"WHAT?! BUT WHY?!\" Han Hao was taken aback.\n\"Can't you tell what it is in the bottle, Han Hao?\"\n\"...\"\nHan Hao deeply sighed and stared at the living eyeball. Although he wasn't an alchemist, he could identify it.\n\"Prosthetic organ. Yeah, this is a valuable treasure. If you sell this, you'll be rich. So, why are you showing me this? I know you're rich. What's the point?\"\nWu Buyi paced around the room. He continued mumbling. At a glance, he seemed restless. In reality, he was drunk on dopamine and serotonin.\n\"We have a new project, Han Hao. Daoist Florida Man is planning to supply us with rare elemental fruits and herbs. Actually, if we have enough supply, we might no longer need to rely on the mystic realms anymore!\"\n\"Hah?\"\nHan Hao's expression turned ugly, confused. As Wu Buyi was too excited, he didn't properly explain what he saw or did.\nWu Buyi also realized that he forgot to report everything in detail, he started by patting the bottle of eyeball.\n\"Ahem! Sorry, I got too excited,\" Wu Buyi took several deep breaths. He continued, \"What if I tell you that Daoist Florida Man has about 20 eyeballs like this.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\nHan Hao counted his fingers. One of them was enough to fetch one million spirit stones. With 20, it could drive the Jianghu Alliance insane or even trigger a war!\n\"That's not all, friend,\" Wu Buyi continued, \"In his store, I saw thousands of immortal grasses, hundreds of yin cabbages, and hundreds of desert bananas! This doesn't include Fenrir's heart, liver, blood, and bones! Hell, he has so many ingredients that he made inferior grain pills using elemental herbs! My heart still aches whenever I think about it. Buy hey, one of those pills is still very useful for the disciples, especially the ones that have already awakened their elemental Qi. They don't need to risk their lives to cultivate elemental Qi in the mystic realms anymore. We can simply give the elemental pills to the promising disciples instead!\"\nWu Buyi talked so fast that he stuttered.\nMeanwhile, Han Hao managed to put the puzzle pieces together and understood the general idea. He instantly found the flaw of this scheme.\n\"What if that person suddenly runs out of rare herbs? What about the investment and prices of those pills? No sane man will supply everything for free. So, Buyi, what's the catch?\"\nWu Buyi puffed his chest and widely smirked. He laughed at Han Hao.\n\"You fool. Daoist Florida Man is someone from a higher realm. I saw his spatial ring. It doesn't look like something that we're wearing. There must be some herbs or treasures that he hasn't shown us yet. Also, he doesn't need spirit stones or gold coins! He only needs our lifespan!\"\n\"Lifespan? Oh, right.\" Han Hao narrowed his eyes. He had heard of this from his son, Han Meng.\nAt first, Han Hao believed that Han Meng was tricked. But after hearing Wu Buyi's testimony, his interest was piqued.\n\"How much does he need?\"\nWu Buyi walked toward a shelf and picked up a blank paper. He took a brush and started writing.\n.\nImmortal Grass : 50 Years per blade\nGolden Sand Banana : 50 Years per Piece\nYin Cabbage : 50 Years per Head\nElemental Grain Pill : 10 Years per pill\nProsthetic Eyeball of Fenrir : 500 Years per eye\n.\nWu Buyi grinned. He came up with this price to make Leo's store more profitable. Moreover, with these price tags, his income would increase as well. Even though it would cost more to buy Leo's stuff, the appropriate value would make the store more attractive to old experts.\n\"How about it? Cheap, right?\"\n\"...\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 26 : Florida Man's Overpriced Rotten Tea Becomes Popular Among Elders\nAfter Wu Buyi had left, Leo took notes of the suggested price and started labeling his items. He spent a few extra lifespans, purchasing label stickers from the shop system. He also bought a box of ball pens for writing.\nWhen Leo finished writing the notes, he pondered.\n'I doubt everybody can read modern numbers. It's still up to me to trade the lifespan anyway. I wish I had a bot or A.I. employee to run the store.'\nLeo shifted his attention to the hundred bamboo baskets outside the store. He widely smiled when he noticed the varieties of veggies and fruits. Aside from the old stuff, there were new goodies - Tomatoes, carrots, lettuces, onions, watermelons, oranges, and lychees. There was even a basket of tea leaves.\nIn addition, the two sacks of seeds reminded Leo that he hadn't cleared enough land to make a vegetable garden or farmland yet.\nSeeing so many fruits and veggies, Leo rubbed his hands. He was excited.\n'New research materials! Also, I haven't eaten those for ages! I need to try the regular ones before I start making the mutated ones.'\nLeo put on his hazmat suit. Then, he transferred the baskets and sacks of seeds to the storage house, aka the alchemy workshop building. He spent the entire night researching new materials and eating the samples.\n...\nDING\n<You have discovered Invigorated Tea Leaf.>\n<You have discovered Fiery Yang Tomato.>\n<You have discovered Unicorn Horn Carrot.>\n<You have discovered Weeping Onion.>\n<You have discovered Bloodmelon.>\n<You have discovered Tiger Killing Orange.>\n<You have discovered Lychee of Drowning.>\nDING\n<Refining Rejuvenate Tea!>\n.\n.\nBANG\nBANG\nAt 5 AM, someone knocked on the front door.\nLeo jolted up from his bed. As he went to bed at 3 AM, he was in a bad mood. Being half-asleep and wearing only a t-shirt and short pants, Leo opened the door without looking at the visitor first.\n\"Yeah, what!?\"\n\"MEOW!\"\nIn front of the cabin, Cat tried to squeeze in. However, its head was too big.\n\"You... you're a plant. You're supposed to act like plants even if you're carnivorous! Stop waking me up in the early morning!\"\n\"MEOW-MEOW!\"\n\"IT IS WEDNESDAY, MY DUDE!\"\n\"MEEEEEEOOOOOOW!!\"\nCat smacked the door frames, trying to get in no matter what.\nLeo frowned and rubbed his eyes. He gently pushed the giant chomper's head out of the way and walked out of the store to see why Cat panicked.\nBehind Cat, Wu Buyi and a dozen middle-aged cultivators in the same uniform stood there, gazing at Cat in curiosity. Everybody but one man stood behind the alchemist.\nHan Hao, the grand elder, also tagged along with the team. He glared at the monster plant and the shop owner, scanning their cultivation strength. Then, he noticed Leo's strange aura.\n'Oh? A soul formation rogue cultivator? So the rumor is true.'\nHan Hao continued to observe Leo.\nMeanwhile, Leo swiped the corners of his eyes and wiped his dirty fingers with the hem of his t-shirt. Then, he faced the visitors and inwardly complained.\n'I guess I haven't set the opening hours yet. Oh, well. I haven't visited a proper store for ages. I forgot about that. I'll tell that guy to mind the time after this.'\nAs it would be rude and stupid to push the rare customers away, Leo put on a business smile and greeted everybody first.\n\"Welcome, dear guests. Are you here for a visit, or are you here to purchase my ware?\"\nWu Buyi brightly smiled and cupped his fist, \"As promised, I've brought you some customers. Let me introduce them to you. The guy with a similar face as mine is Han... I mean, Daoist Bald Swordsman!\"\nHan Hao's Daoist title was Bald Swordsman. He got this title not because he was bald, but because he rarely carried a scabbard when he was young. Thus, his mentor gave him that title to remind him not to carry unsheathed swords everywhere. However, as Han Hao got older, he became bald. Afterward, the Daoist title became a curse to him.\nSecondly, the Daoist Title was similar to an alias or a business name that cultivators used to introduce themselves to strangers. Only elders could call their juniors or their friends by their real names.\nMeanwhile, Han Hao didn't care about the title anymore. He took a deep breath and cupped his fist, showing Leo some respect and giving him face.\n\"Junior Bald Swordsman greets Hermit Florida Man. I heard that you're selling rare herbs for lifespan, so I wish to purchase some. As for the people behind me, they are deacons and elders of the Life Sword Sect. They also wish to see your goods.\"\nNothing made Leo happier than good-mannered customers. He slowly dragged Cat aside and gestured for them to enter the store.\n\"Very well. Please come in. Oh, don't mind the mental plant. He's harmless. Look at him. Whenever he sees strangers, he gets rowdy...\"\nWhile Leo was speaking, Cat got angry because Leo forcefully pulled him away from the store entrance. It flailed its branches and roots around.\nWHACK\nThe long branches and roots hit the store's exterior walls and rooftop. However, it didn't budge.\nInstead, Cat cried in pain. It felt like it kicked an iron plate.\n\"MEOW!!\"\nWhile in pain, Cat crawled to the roof and jumped off from the back, running toward the alchemy workshop and getting to another roof.\nThe crowd watched how the monster plant nimbly moved to the back of the store. The elders and deacons behind Wu Buyi let out a long sigh of relief as they managed to avoid an unnecessary fight. They followed Leo into the store.\nUpon getting inside, they gawked at the showcase refrigerators.I think you should take a look at\n\"Immortal grass!\"\n\"THOSE BANANAS!?\"\n\"Y-Yin cabbages?\"\nWhile the deacons were amazed by the items, Han Hao was interested in the content in the freezer chests. He looked inside and found mutated wolf's organs. Without hesitation, he asked Leo.\n\"How much for all of these?\"\nLeo looked at the chests and shook his head, \"Those are not for sale.\"\n\"Oh... a pity.\"\nHan Hao deeply sighed. He turned his attention to the other freezer chests. However, most of them only stored wolf organs and meat.\nBut one of them had something else. In one of the chests, there were five clear glass bottles of silver liquid. Curious, Han Hao opened the chest and brought one chilling bottle out. Although the bottles were sealed, Han Hao instantly recognized the content due to the sparkling color and pieces of tea leaves inside.\n'Rejuvenate Tea?!'\n.\n.\nWhile Leo gazed at his customers, he inwardly grumbled, regretting that he didn't have enough time to make more pills or potions to sell. In addition, he didn't have enough refrigerators or showcases to display the new mutated fruits and vegetables. Most of the newly mutated fruits and veggies were still in the alchemy workshop.\nLeo deeply sighed and looked at Han Hao, who was checking the new potions that Leo had made last night.\n.\nAlchemy Recipe : Rejuvenate Tea\nThree Invigorated Tea Leaves\nOne Water Element Catalyst\nOne Liter of Freshwater\nWater and Earth Essence\n.\nInferior Rejuvenate Tea\n- Restore and repair bone marrow.\n- Decrease physical age by one year per liter.\n- Increase metabolism.\n: Very high chance to increase appetite.\n.\nThis tea had no effect on cultivation. However, it served as a cosmetic for cultivators. Moreover, it was easy to make as the alchemy cauldron only required 10 minutes to make one liter of tea.\nHowever, Leo had an issue. He wasn't confident that he was a good salesman. He looked at Wu Buyi, asking him to evaluate the price tag with his look.\nWu Buyi noticed Leo's gaze. He widely grinned and checked the freezer chest that Han Hao was gawking at. Then, he discovered the Rejuvenate Tea.\n\"Oh, my. What do we have here?\" Wu Buyi merrily laughed and glanced at Leo. The latter shifted his eyes, gesturing to Wu Buyi to pitch the sale.\n\"Ahem!\"\nWu Buyi coughed and took the hint. He smiled at Han Hao while he intentionally described the perks of this tea.\n\"Friend, do you know what the tea can do?\"\nHan Hao clicked his tongue, annoyed by Wu Buyi's smugness. Still, he played along, wondering what the alchemist was up to.\n\"What?\"\n\"This high-classed tea is Rejuvenate Tea, made from the elusive invigorating tea leaves that can only be found in jungle-based mystic realms. Usually, 7th-grade tree monsters protect these tea plants and hide them behind their unique illusion arrays. If you eat the leaves raw, you will be energized for weeks. But if you turn them into tea, it can decrease your bone age!\"\nHan Hao snorted as he was aware. On the other hand, the group of following deacons and elders were amazed.\n\"R-Really?\"\n\"Decreasing our bone age?\"\nRushing to the freezer chest, the men gazed at the glass bottles in admiration. Then, they asked Leo, \"H-How much are these, sir? We heard that you only accept lifespan. We wish to trade with you!\"\nLeo stroked his beard, but he glanced at Wu Buyi. Again, the salesman racked his brain and came up with a proper price on the spot.\nWu Buyi coughed and pretended to be the know-it-all guy.\n\"First off, we have to think about the average income of cultivators. Every golden core cultivator in the mainland usually works for a sect or an organization, and their annual income is 1,000 spirit stones. If we use this as a standard, 1,000 spirit stones equate to one year of lifespan. Now, let's look at the tea. As these tea leaves are difficult to come by and they taste like fine wine, they are naturally expensive. The Jianghu Alliance's best tavern usually charges 5,000 spirit stones per small cup. But for this one, they came in a bigger bottle. So, from my calculation, this bottle should be worth about 250,000 spirit stones at the minimum.\"\nWu Buyi widely grinned. He looked at Leo, asking for confirmation.\n\"My guess is 250 years of lifespan per bottle. Am I right?\"\nLeo maintained his pokerface, but his internal expression turned dark. He complained in his mind.\n'I imagined 50 years. Damn, it was too cheap again?!'\nLeo looked at Han Hao and his followers. He shook his head.\n\"I'm not that heartless. 200 years per bottle.\"\nWu Buyi coughed twice, gesturing to Leo that it was underpriced. However, Leo shook his head again.\n\"I have a dozen of these in the storeroom, and I'm selling them at a wholesale price so that you can go and resell them if you wish.\"\n\"...\"\nWu Buyi widened his eyes for a moment as he found the idea amazing. He thought to himself.\n'So, if Daoist Florida Man sells the items cheaper than the market price, he will naturally attract greedy merchants here to spend their spirit stones or lifespan for his goods. And when those merchants make a profit, they will come here again for more. This is ingenious!'\nThe alchemist inwardly gave Leo a thumbs up. Meanwhile, Leo had another idea.\n'How much do you think the production cost is? Only one year of lifespan, you dum-dum! I only invested a year of my lifespan to get a luxurious-looking glass bottle, but the material cost and process costs are free! Why should I sell them at a market price? I have more margin, so I'm gonna cut the damn price to make my rivals out of business!'",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 27 : Local Martial Artists Mistake Florida Man as Alien Scientist\nAfter declaring the item price, Leo activated the store system, allowing the people here to see their remaining lifespan. Wu Buyi also got to see his remaining time once again.\nOn the other hand, Han Hao was taken aback when he saw the timer.\n.\nName: Han Hao\nAge: 107\nRemaining Lifespan: 873 Years, 6 Months, 5 Days, 12 Hours, and 14 Minutes\n.\nAlthough Han Hao had a long life, he seemed unsatisfied. His physical appearance aged along with him, which made him worry about the future.\nHan Hao inwardly grumbled.\n'When I'm 300, I might become a Jiangshi at this rate. I guess I need a lot of this tea. But man, they're expensive. 200 years per bottle? How far can it really rejuvenate me?'\nLiving for a long time made Han Hao pessimistic. He doubted it was worth the investment. Instead of spending his limited currency, he turned his attention to other objects in the store. Then, Han Hao found the grain pills that Leo had made.\nHan Hao's expression turned dark. He wondered if Leo was ignorant or possessed abundant resources to the point that he could waste precious herbs for something insignificant. Still, they offered mild elemental Qi, which could be useful for beginners or muscle-tempering stage disciples. He believed that they might be popular among the outer disciples.\nCurious about Leo's background and skills, Han Hao asked, \"Senior, sir. I have something to ask. Are you well-versed in alchemy?\"\nLeo calmly stroked his beard, \"I might not be an expert in the field, but you know, I'm somewhat of an alchemist myself.\"\nWu Buyi giggled as it was impossible for rookie alchemists to make elemental pills even if they were inferior in quality. After all, they required the elemental essence of a specific type to make them.\nFor example, a fire-element pill required fire essence and fire catalyst materials, which only alchemists with fire Qi could concoct. Meanwhile, the merchandise by the windows contained all five element pills, which showed how strong his foundation truly was.\n'Only idiots will think that those inferior pills were made by rookies. If it were me, I would have only made fire and wood grain pills, but not all five elements. Those pills aren't just for sale, you fool. It's a warning message to you lots that you shouldn't try anything stupid here. He can use all five elements, so his combat prowess is naturally superior to you, who can only use one or two elements. Ha!'\nWhile Wu Buyi inwardly laughed at Han Hao, the corner of his eyes noticed a white grain pill, which was behind the window curtains. He raised his eyebrows, surprised that he didn't notice it during the last visit.\n'Hmm? Isn't that?!'\nUpon realizing what they were, Wu Buyi widened his eyes. Rushing to the showcase table, he collected the two bottles with a dozen white pills. He put them on the counter next to the meat showcase fridge.\nSeeing how flustered Wu Buyi was, Han Han, Leo, and the dozen deacons looked at the former. They were curious why the alchemist put the bottles of white grain pills over there.\nWu Buyi coughed. Then, he cupped his fist and bowed to Leo.\n\"Daoist Florida Man, please forgive me for being rude. Please do not sell these items here.\"\nLeo and Han Hao were surprised once again. They wondered what this alchemist was scheming. As Wu Buyi seemed suspicious, Han Hao frowned at him.\n\"Why? Are you planning to hoard those pills to yourself?\"\n\"NO! OF COURSE NOT! I-I just wish to ask Daoist Florida Man if I can study these treasures!\"\n\"Treasure?!\"\nSeeing how flustered Wu Buyi was, Han Hao's interest was piqued. He looked at the white grain pills for a moment and turned to Leo, who had been doing nothing but stroking his long white beard.\n\"Senior, sir. What are these?\"\n\"Ah, that?\" Leo remembered them as they always appeared together with poison grain pills. He deeply sighed, \"Those are something I accidentally made. They're elixir grain pills that contain only 10 years' worth of five-element Qi. Well, since they're called elixir, they also increase the consumer's lifespan by 10 years. There's a side effect though. Since it was made when I was making grain pills, it will stuff you for 10 days.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHan Hao was shocked not because of its effects but the small detail.\nFive Elements\nNormally, cultivation pills only provided one type of element Qi to consumers. Even grand master alchemists from all alchemy-related sects couldn't add more than two or three types of element Qi into one pill. However, this one contained five elements, which defied all logic.\nWu Buyi wryly smiled. He slapped his forehead several times, regretting that he didn't notice these pills earlier. Now, everybody knew about them, and he couldn't monopolize the pills anymore.\nThe alchemist sighed, \"This is why I call it TREASURE! You see, Han Hao, no one can make any five-elemental pill, even those thousand-year-old trios!\"\n\"WHAT?!\" Han Hao's jaw dropped. He turned to Leo, wondering if he was a master alchemist.\nLeo coughed, \"They're still inferior quality, though. I still have a lot to learn.\"\nWu Buyi repeatedly shook his head. He was convinced that Leo was a master alchemist. However, he was bad at pricing his products, \"Don't be humble, sir! These things belong in auction houses! We can't sell them here for small profits! They're even more valuable than those prosthetic eyeballs, sir!\"\n'Oh, really?' Leo was internally amused.I think you should take a look at\n\"To you, it might be nothing. But to us, they're the proof of a breakthrough! We, alchemists of this lower world, can learn a lot from them!\"\n\"Ah, breakthrough. Technological breakthrough. So, cultivators of this world never had this before. That's understandable,\" Leo muttered and nodded in agreement.\nNoticing Leo's demeanor and words, the crowd murmured, convinced that he came from a higher dimension.\nWu Buyi sweated profusely as he started to get nervous. He bowed 90 degrees, \"Also, you must have invested so much time and resources just to make these. We can't just dishonor you!\"\n\"...\"\nLeo had the urge to tell Wu Buyi that he could make one of those pills every hour by using free iron pine nuts in the backyard. However, he couldn't reveal his little secret.\nStill, learning that he could turn those nuts into money, Leo was elated. He also got inspired by the tips. Leo figured that he might need the local currency to trade in the future as he might need to purchase something in town. He couldn't afford to rely on Wu Buyi to bring in vegetables, fruits, and seeds all the time.\n\"Fine. You handle that. I also need some local pocket money. The commission fee is 10% as usual.\"\nHearing that Leo gave him permission, Wu Buyi was overjoyed. He laughed and deeply bowed twice, \"I'll make sure that they will fetch the highest price, sir! Oh, please tell me if you are making more pills. I wish to observe and learn from you.\"\nLeo clicked his tongue, \"No. I don't like being observed.\"\n\"Ah, what a shame.\"\nWu Buyi was disappointed. Still, he was glad that he got another good deal.\nMeanwhile, the deacons started choosing the items that wanted. 10 deacons took a blade of immortal grass. One of the swordsman elders was half-blind, so he decided on the expensive eyeball. As for another elder, he took two bananas.\nAfter picking the items and informing Leo of what they had chosen to buy, Leo deduced their lifespan. He got 1,100 years of lifespan from this trade. However, Wu Buyi got a 10% cut, so Leo only received 990 years in total.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi noticed that his lifespan increased by 110 years. He widely grinned, believing that this job was worth the effort. Han Hao also discovered that Wu Buyi got the boon of this trade as he could see his friend's status.\n\"You sly bastard,\" complained Han Hao.\nWu Buyi snickered, \"This is how you use your brain, brother.\"\nThe elders and deacons looked at Wu Buyi in envy. They secretly glanced at Leo, hoping that they could get the same treatment too.\nHan Hao also had a similar idea. As he was bolder and had a higher status than the people here, he daringly proposed, \"Senior, sir. I heard that you've accepted Wu Buyi as your servant. I wonder if we can help you, too.\"\nLeo widely grinned as he already had a plan in his mind. Since Wu Buyi showed them the example of a modern customer reference program scheme, Leo offered them the same deal.\n\"It's just a small agreement. How about this? If you introduce customers to me like how he did, I'll give you 10% of the sale as a commission. Of course, you'll receive the payment after the transaction in lifespan as currency.\"\nThe customer reference program was one of the tricks that modern companies loved as they seduced customers into becoming their temporary salesmen. Some of the customers then turned into part-timers, reeling in their relatives and friends to purchase the goods from the companies while many used them to get some discounts.\nLeo had no intention of allowing one person to monopolize the market. He wanted them to compete so that he could get more customers.\nWhen Wu Buyi heard that Leo would give them the same treatment, he panicked.\n\"S-Sir! I thought this deal is for me.\"\nLeo snorted, \"I'm not planning to let someone monopolize the market. Mister, if you wish to succeed, you must compete with others in the same field and become the best. Trickeries and dishonesty are bad for business.\"\nHan Hao burst into laughter as he loved Leo's attitude. On the other hand, Wu Buyi was dejected that he could no longer monopolize the perk.\n\"There you have it, you sly fox! The senior sees through you!\" Han Hao mocked his friend.\nWu Buyi snorted. He bickered, \"I doubt you know more top cultivators than I do! I'm going to the Jianghu Alliance now! Oh, Daoist Florida Man Sir, please excuse me. I'll go bring you more customers, now!\"\nWithout waiting for Leo's response, Wu Buyi rushed out of the store with the bottles of elixir pills in his arms. The crowd could only watch how the alchemist shamelessly brought the items out without paying.\nLeo deeply sighed. For the first time in this world, he experienced a semi-robbery case. Although he trusted that Wu Buyi would keep the promise, Leo still needed insurance. He turned to Han Hao.\n\"You said you are his friend, right?\"\nHan Hao nodded, \"Yes. We are like sworn brothers.\"\n\"Then, can you be the guarantor for that man? Just in case that idiot runs away with my elixirs.\"\nHan Hao dryly laughed. He was embarrassed because of Wu Buyi's shamelessness. Still, as an upright grand elder, Han Hao vouched for the alchemist. He pulled out a token from his pocket and gave it to Leo.\n\"This is my personal token. If you show this to anybody in the Magpie City or the Life Sword Sect, they will do everything you tell them to, even if you ask them that you wish to participate in the mystic realm expedition.\"\n\"Hoh?\"\n\"Also...\"\nHan Hao's expression changed. He never forgot his purpose here.\n\"Senior Sir, I wish to ask you honestly. I heard that you are planning to supply our sect with elemental pills so that we won't need to rely on the mystic realm expedition. Is that true?\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 28 : Florida Man Invests 1,000 Years in Simulation Game\nLeo widely grinned. He had no idea what Han Hao was talking about.\n'What supply? What sect? I just want to sell my things and earn more lifespans. Did Wu Buyi spread a silly rumor?'\nHe had enough of the misunderstandings and miscommunication, Leo directly asked Han Hao, \"What supply?\"\n\"Oh?\" Han Hao was surprised. He thought that Leo had a deal with Wu Buyi, \"Didn't you agree that you would supply us pills so that we wouldn't have to rely on the mystic realms?\"\n\"Oh, that?\" Leo remembered the deal. He stroked his smooth silky beard, \"You mean, I will make more pills like the ones on that table, and you will send your disciples to purchase my pills, using their lifespan. Is that what you mean?\"\nHan Hao raised his brow. Once again, Wu Buyi didn't clarify this agreement, so he didn't know about the detail. It seemed that Wu Buyi only agreed that he would send his disciples here to buy rare pills from Leo.\n\"Well, it's the same. We hope that you will prioritize the Life Sword Sect's disciples over other customers.\"\nLeo never hated customers. He readily accepted, \"No problem. I'll save the pills for your disciples.\"\n\"Thank you for your cooperation. Also, I will take this.\"\nHan Hao grabbed a bottle of rejuvenate tea. Leo quickly took 200 years of Han Hao's lifespan right away.\n\"One more thing,\" Han Hao coughed as he never forgot about his primary objective here. \"Would you like to join us on this season's mystic realm expedition?\"\nLeo sighed and shook his head. He had his reason not to participate in the event, \"I don't know if I should go. I don't think I have much to gain there.\"\n\"Are you sure? Nobody has captured any mystic realm yet. Someone of your status should be able to do it. Legends said that the person who managed to dominate a mystic realm would become a mystic realm overlord, and he would monopolize all the herbs, treasures, and artifacts in there.\"\nHan Hao was not convinced that Leo was not interested. He baited the white-haired old man with glory and profits. However, he could not read Leo's mind.\nMeanwhile, Leo inwardly grumbled.\n'It's not like I don't want to go. I want to go out and play, too. I want to go on a field trip and socialize with REAL PEOPLE for once! But how am I going to enjoy a trip if I don't understand a goddamn word that comes out of your mouth, mister!? I don't speak Chinese, dammit! If I go there, I'll BINGQILIN all day, and my image will be ruined!'\nBecause of the dilemma, Leo insisted that he could not go. Otherwise, he would embarrass himself.\n\"I'm sorry. I don't think it's a good idea to give someone else's ticket to me. If someone works hard to earn his spot, you should give it to him, not an outsider.\"\nHan Hao and the deacons' eyes glittered as they gazed at Leo in admiration. Everybody cupped their fists, \"Such consideration and honor are rare these days. We're ashamed that we're blinded by greed. We shall give the seat to the disciple that earns it.\"\nLeo was secretly relieved. For now, he avoided a troublesome scenario. He felt like he was an introvert, whose brothers never stopped inviting him to a nightclub.\nHan Hao and others bid farewell. They left through the front door and flew back to their sect.\nAfter everybody was sent off, Leo returned to his store. He closed the door and locked it.\n\"Finally, peace at last.\"\nSometimes, Leo was confused about his true desire. Half of him yearned for civilization and people, but the other half sought solitude. He wondered why.\nExhausted from the long night's work and the meeting, Leo collapsed on his bed and was fast asleep.\n.\n1 PM, Leo woke up, refreshed. He sat up and yawned. Then, he walked outside the storeroom, which he had chosen as his temporary bedroom.\nUpon walking to the store, Leo flinched as the massive shadow blocked the sunlight from the front windows. In front of the showcase glass windows, Cat sat there, staring into the store with its new menacing eyes. It used its thorns to scratch the windows.\n\"MEOW!\"\nIt was hungry.\n\"I know, I know! I also need to take a dump. Just give me a second.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nAfter grabbing a towel, Leo paused to think. He felt like their relationship sounded weird. However, he shrugged and moved on to the outhouse, doing his business.\nAfter dropping some chemical bombs in the outhouse near the sword sage boulder, Cat happily scooped the waste in the septic tank to its mouth in glee. It also ate the yin cabbages that Leo had thrown out.\nLeo got used to Cat's nasty appetite. He returned to the alchemy workshop and glanced at the piles of lumbers nearby.\n\"I should start working on these soon. But for now, IT'S UPGRADE TIME!\"\nLeo opened his lifespan status to see how much he could spend.\n<Your current lifespan: 2,043 Years, 11 months, 10 days, 23 hours.>\nBecause of the daily meat diet and the recent sales, Leo got a whooping two thousand years of lifespan to use. He snickered as he was proud of himself.\n\"Time for your upgrade, you damn pot! I'm tired of making inferior pills. I want something better!'\nLeo opened the workshop's system menu.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 1\n[Upgrade] : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nWithout hesitation, Leo pressed the upgrade button and paid 1,000 years of lifespan.I think you should take a look at\nDING\n<Upgrading Alchemy Workshop...>\n<Please choose one of the traits you wish to upgrade.>\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo had expected that the workshop would be automatically upgraded. However, it prompted him with options.\n[Add New Cauldron] (1/5)\n[Add Automaton Alchemist] (0/5)\n[Upgrade Cauldrons - Improve Product's Quality] (0/5)\n[Upgrade Fireplaces - Increase Product's Quantity] (0/5)\nSeeing the choices, Leo's expression turned ugly as he hated overly complicated systems and games. The first thing that came to his mind was the min-max strategy spreadsheets of simulation games in the ancient past.\n'So, there's a total of 19 potential upgrades, but this won't be that simple. Is there a level cap for the workshop? What if it's capped at level 10 and I can only upgrade 9 more times? Will I have to choose 9 out of 19 upgrades? If I upgrade everything, will I ruin the potential of this system building? Then, can I build another workshop? What's the highest quality that pills can have? Also, how much does the fireplace yield after the upgrade?'\nLeo had a hundred questions, but the system remained silent. He could only learn by experimenting.\n'To be honest, I want another cauldron to increase productivity, but my guts say that quality is king. I'll pick the quality first and see how it goes.'\nPlaying it safe, Leo picked the third option. Nothing could go wrong with a quality upgrade.\nDING\n<Alchemy Workshop has been upgraded to Level 2.>\nRUMBLE\nThe alchemy workshop's building changed. The old rotten wood walls were replaced with new planks, and the tiles on the ceiling gained red color. It didn't look like an abandoned house anymore.\nThe message didn't end there. The system message gave him an important hint.\n<Please note : The max level of Alchemy Workshop is 10. Please choose your upgrade options wisely.>\n'Bingo!'\nLeo clicked his tongue. His guess was on point, and he was glad that he picked the quality choice first.\nWith this information, he had an upgrade plan in his mind.\n'Max quality first. For efficiency build, I can put four extra points into quantity upgrade. But if I want to make it a factory for trivial pills, I can put one point to a new cauldron, two for automatons, and one for quantity. Then, I probably won't have to watch over that thing 24/7. Yeah, I should aim for the \"Factory Build\". Oh, right. Can I build more workshops? If I can, I can be creative with this. For example, I have crap tons of materials for grain pills. I can just spam low-quality pills and sell them for dirt cheap, so the quantity build might somewhat synergize with the automatons and multiple pots. Oh, there's the max efficient build for difficult pills, too. I can ignore everything else and put four extra points to quantity. For example...'\nBefore Leo realized it, he had fun strategizing for future upgrades. He fell into deep thought while he operated the shop domain system, wondering if he could purchase another workshop.\nDING\nThe icon of the workshop was there. It was locked. However, there was a clue to the unlock condition.\n<Required Humble General Store Level 3.>\n\"...\"\nAt that moment, Leo realized - This might be a grind.\nAs Leo had 1,000 years of lifespan in stock, he rechecked the upgrade option to see how much he needed for the next level.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 2\nProduction Quality Level - (1/5)\n[Upgrade] : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nThe price was still the same. Leo noticed a template. He was overjoyed.\n'1,000 per level? This will be easy!'\nLeo smirked and pressed the upgrade button again.\nBZZ\nThe system gave a weird buzz. Then, it gave him a piece of bad news.\n<Required Humble General Store Level 3.>\nThe refrigerator upgrades, the workshop upgrades, and the new workshop building all required store level 3. It started to get on Leo's nerves.\n\"Oh, god. It's the freaking mobile simulation game system! Am I building a war town or something? Who the hell came up with those unrealistic games?\"\nLeo facepalmed. It would take a long time before Leo could get his dreamt pill factory.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 29 : Florida Man Turns National Artifact into Chair\nDING\n<Will you upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 3?>\n<Upgrading requires 2,000 years of lifespan.>\nLeo was depressed. Once again, he didn't have enough lifespan to upgrade the store. Still, he had many ways to procure the currency.\nHe looked at Cat, who was chilling on the roof as usual. So far, he had been feeding it yin cabbages and his dung.\n.\nName: Cat\nAge: 0 Year\nLifespan: 3,743 Years\n.\nThis guy gained lifespan so fast. Sometimes, Leo wondered how it got so much lifespan even though he only fed it his poops and cabbages.\n\"Cat, come here!\"\n\"Meow?\"\nThe chomper looked at Leo. Unfortunately, it looked away and closed its eyes, taking a day nap like real cats.\n\"You... Hah.\"\nBeing ignored, Leo gave up on Cat. Part of him was guilty that he was about to resort to thievery on his own pet. Since he had nothing else to do, he tried creating a new batch of pills, testing the newly upgraded cauldron. He put in ingredients to make a quick item : Rejuvenate Tea.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe : Rejuvenate Tea]\nThree Invigorated Tea Leaves\nOne Water Element Catalyst\nOne Liter of Freshwater\nWater and Earth Essence\n.\nAll previous batches came out as inferior quality. This time, Leo hoped that it could be better.\nDING\n<Refining Rejuvenate Tear.>\n<9 Minutes, 59 Seconds Remaining...>\nLeo pursed his lips. He was a bit disappointed that the refining time didn't decrease after the upgrade.\nKilling his time, Leo entered the alchemy workshop building and picked up a glittering pill from a bowl, hidden behind the array of vegetable baskets.\n.\n[Inferior Fenrir Dantian Pill]\nIncrease Poison Resistance\nGrant Anti-Biotic Effects\nIncrease Poison and Metal Essence by 100 Years' Worth of Cultivation\nIncrease Lifespan by 100 Years.\nConsume More than One a Day Grants Laxative Effects\n.\nThis batch of pills came out from the 24-Hour wolf dantian pill recipe. They were the proper cultivation pills that Wu Buyi and Han Hao had been searching for. However, as it offered 100 years of lifespan per pill and it tasted like sweet chocolate, Leo chose not to sell them.\nLeo gazed at the bowl of black chocolate pills. He thought of Han Hao's gang and wondered if he should sell them.\n'This can probably fetch 500 years or so, but it's antibiotic! I can just keep it here as household meds and snacks!'\nAfter eating the pill and increasing his lifespan to 1,143, Leo tidied the workshop storeroom for 10 minutes. Then, he walked out to check the newly made tea.\nThe liquid came out of the cauldron and floated over the cauldron, waiting for Leo to collect them. Spending one year of lifespan, Leo bought a 1-liter glass bottle. He pointed at the floating water mass, and the liquid automatically filled the container.\nDING\n<Workshop has refined one liter of Lesser Rejuvenate Tea.>\n.\n[Lesser Rejuvenate Tea]\nRestore and repair bone marrow.\nDecrease physical age by two years per liter.\nIncrease metabolism.\nVery high chance to increase appetite.\n.\nNot much changed except the physical age reduction effect. Instead of one, it became two years.\nLeo shrugged and put in another batch of ingredients to make another set of tea. Then, he started chugging the tea. Although they were called \"TEA\", they tasted like cold root beer.\n\"HAH! That hits the spot!\"\nLeo burped. Drinking a cold beverage during the hot afternoon was the best. After getting a mouthful of delicious drinks, Leo got in the mood of working. He turned his attention to the pile of lumber, which he had ignored.\n'I should turn these into something. Also, I need farmland. I need to cut trees... no, pull some trees!'\nLeo grabbed a long lumber with his fingers and lifted it. His other hand also grabbed another one and brought them toward the front yard of the store.\nBOOM\nLeo put them down so that the visitors could see them. He wondered if anyone would buy them.\nAs Leo couldn't tell, he looked at the smallest lumber in the backyard and karate-chopped it on the top part, cutting a small portion of the steel-like lumber. Then, he brought it to the alchemy workshop and waited there until the next batch of tea was finished.\nDING\nThe second batch of tea was completed. Again, it came out as a lesser grade.\nLeo grinned and filled the bottle in his hands, which he had downed all the content earlier. The one-liter glass bottle was filled to the brim once more.\n\"Infinite root beer of youth, HOH!\"\nIn a good mood, Leo dumped the chunk of lumber into the cauldron and pressed the [Research] button.\n.I think you should take a look at\n[Iron Pine Wood]\nThis lumber is a precious ingredient for all artisans. It can be processed into fine furniture or refined into sacred wood.\n[Alchemy Recipe : Sacred Wood]\nOne Iron Pine Lumber\nWood and Metal Essence\n.\n\"What's sacred wood? Is that edible?\"\nFor the first time, Leo discovered a recipe that didn't require any catalyst. Curious, he decided to chop more lumber with his bare hands.\nAfter turning white lumber into arm-sized blocks of wood, Leo threw one of them into the pot and pressed the refine button. As usual, his spit was the element essence.\nDING\n<Refining Sacred Wood.>\n<Time Remaining: 9 Minutes 58 Seconds...>\nFortunately, it didn't take long to refine the material. Leo smiled and returned to the lumber site, continuing his work.\n10 minutes quickly passed by. Leo returned to see the result.\nDING\n<Alchemy Workshop has refined a Sacred Wood Block.>\nThe finished product slightly grew in mass. It was a one-cubic-meter cube-shaped wood as if it had been processed by a master carpenter.\n.\n[Sacred Wood Block]\nRefined from Iron Pine Lumber. It contains a thick amount of Wood and Metal Essence, suitable to be crafted into a weapon.\n.\nLeo scratched his head and frowned as he was dissatisfied with the product. It seemed precious, but it was useless for him. Still, it would serve as a nice showcase stand for large items.\nBecause this item was useless, Leo ceased the project and left the pile of lumber in the front yard. He resumed making Rejuvenate Tea as he needed something to drink.\nDuring his free time while waiting for the cauldron to finish refining tea, Leo began clearing new land, uprooting more iron pine trees, and cutting their branches to make more catalysts.\nLeo lost count of how much he drank rejuvenate tea. When the sun set, he finished uprooting 20 trees and peeled their bark. However, he hadn't cleared enough land to make a new farm yet.\nLooking at the uneven land, Leo could see some progress. Soon, he would get more room to build a new alchemy workshop and a new farm to grow crops.\n.\n.\nAfter Han Hao returned to the sect, he called Han Meng over to the grand elder building. The disciplinary elder entered the building to report right away.\nWhile sitting in his seat, Han Hao summarized the agreement to his son and gave him a new order.\n\"Tomorrow, you can start sending inner disciples to Daoist Florida Man's store. Make sure the disciples purchase his grain pills and other treasures. They will benefit a lot.\"\nHan Meng had visited Leo before. He knew the nature of the store. However, he wondered if it was a good idea.\n\"Father, what if one or two of them causes trouble in that store? There are countless treasures there, and a few spoiled brats might have the wrong idea, especially that guy from the Ouyang Family.\"\n\"Ouyang?\"\nHan Hao deeply sighed. He thought of the troublesome inner disciple, who was the youngest son of a prestigious clan's elder. Although he was talented, he had an attitude issue.\nThat person was immature, arrogant, impulsive, and overbearing. Only when he was in front of Han Hao and the elders, he pretended to show some respect.\nThinking of the disciple and his influence, Han Hao bitterly smiled. He gave up on him.\n\"Sometimes, the best way to teach a person is to let them make mistakes.\"\nHan Hao already predicted the future : Had Leo and the disciple met, the disciple would get himself into deep trouble.\nHan Meng snickered, \"That mistake is going to be very costly if he doesn't know his place.\"\n\"True. Well, if he dares to provoke a soul formation stage senior, he deserves it. He needs to understand his place and that not everybody in the world is below him. Sometimes, he will run into an unyielding individual and be reminded of the disparity between cultivation stages.\"\n\"Hahaha! You're right. If he lacks common sense, he doesn't deserve to become an immortal. But you know, father. The issue isn't Ouyang Ting but his relatives, his underlings, and his parents. Isn't Ouyang Long a representative of the Ouyang Clan in the Jianghu Alliance? He's also a soul formation stage cultivator. That guy is the real issue here.\"\nHan Hao thought of the arrogant and domineering man in the Jianghu Alliance. He groaned and closed his eyes, not wanting to think about it anymore.\n\"Let's just pray that Ouyang Ting won't step out of the boundary. Rather, let's not introduce him to the store. Send the outer disciples there first. As for the inner disciples, let them in the dark for now.\"\n\"Ah, that should work.\"\n.\nAlthough the two elders came up with a countermeasure to avoid complications and issues, it was too late for them to react.\nAt 8 PM, at the inner district of the sect, where only the most talented inner disciples could enter, a young Asian teenager with a long sideburn, paled skin, thick eyebrows, and straight long black hair sat at the lone table in the inner disciple's courtyard, drinking the most expensive rejuvenate tea that he got from the Jianghu Alliance's merchants.\nOuyang Ting was a 9th-rank foundation establishment stage cultivator. He was two major stages weaker than Han Meng and Han Hao. This year, he was only 17 years old, one year older than Gao Yan.\nIn short, Ouyang Ting was one of the top dogs among his peers. He had also been monopolizing the mystic realm expedition quota due to his status and relationship with the prestigious Ouyang Clan.\nOuyang Ting stared at the five groveling outer disciples, who had once seen Leo. Behind them, a deacon slightly bowed and cupped his fist, showing respect to the teen.\n\"Young Master Ouyang, I've confirmed their testimonies. They're speaking the truth. There is a rogue cultivator in the Sword Saint Forest, and he owns countless treasures, including rejuvenate tea that you like.\"\nOuyang Ting downed the tea in his cup and slammed it on the marble table. He stopped glaring at the outer disciples.\n\"You all can go.\"\n\"T-Thank you, Young Master Ouyang!\"\nThe group ran away from the courtyard as if their lives depended on it.\nAfter the group had left, Ouyang Ting turned his attention to the deacon, \"Tell me more about this rogue cultivator and his treasures.\"\n\"Yes. First of all, the rogue cultivator has over 20 prosthetic eyeballs, thousands of immortal grasses, Fenrir's organs, element pills, and...\"\nThe deacon continued listing the items that he had seen in the store. He also brought out a blade of immortal grass that he had purchased from Leo.\nOuyang Ting continued to listen, but the flame of greed in his eyes was ignited.\nHe asked the deacon.\n\"How strong is the shop owner?\"\n\"Soul Formation Stage, young master.\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nOuyang Ting clicked his tongue as the man in question was as strong as his father. He alone couldn't possibly steal items or provoke the senior there. However, he knew a few tricks, which could make stronger foes succumb to his family's influence.\n\"Call over the Hound Squad.\"",

After getting his coriander coffee and doing his morning routine, Leo resumed working on his farm project. He pulled more trees and debarked them, collecting the metal catalyst and nuts.\nAs Leo expanded the area, he came across more bushes, dead plants, and mutated grasses. As usual, Leo collected everything that he could mutate. He even got two more thorn whips to play.\nLooking at the thorn whips, Leo wondered if they could sell. Unfortunately, Wu Buyi was not here to give him advice. Since he couldn't come up with the right price, he brought it to the cauldron to try researching it. He tossed one of the thorn whips into the pot.\nDING\n.\n[Metal Thorn Whip]\nExtracted from a dead iron thorn bush. It can be refined into Firmament Thorn Whip.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Firmament Thorn Whip]\nOne Metal Thorn Whip\nOne Metal Element Catalyst\nOne Wood Element Catalyst\nMetal Essence\n.\nLeo was surprised that the workshop could refine a weapon. He collected the thorn vines and hid them in the workshop's storehouse for the time being.\n'Weapons are no good. It can fetch a lot of money or lifespan, but it's too dangerous. I played around with it, and it can easily destroy mutated trees. If it hits people, it's instant death.'\nDespite the mental note, Leo put all the ingredients in the pot and refined it anyway.\nDING\n<Refining Firmament Thorn Whip…>\n<Time Remaining: 59 Minutes, 59 Seconds…>\nIt didn't take long to completely refine a weapon, which surprised Leo.\n'Oh, this is nice. I have another one extra. I'll refine this one, too.'\nHe resumed working on clearing the land while he watched over the timer.\nTwo hours later, Leo finished refining two whips. He wielded the two weapons and played with them for a while. However, he encountered an issue.\n'Speaking of weapons, what's the point of having a weapon that can't even cut the trees in half when my bare hands can do so? If I need to fight, I can just punch my enemy in the face, no? Why the complications?'\nNot satisfied with the whip's firepower, he tossed it to the side, planning to get rid of them later.\n.\n.\n\"Meow?\"\nWhile Leo was busy with the alchemy workshop, Cat had been watching him from the store's rooftop. It noticed the pair of thorn whips.\n.\n[Low-Graded Firmament Thorn Whip]\nThis low-graded artifact is made from Metal Thorn Whip. Applying metal or wood element Qi into it can boost its destructive power, capable of breaking any nascent soul cultivator's protective barrier.\n.\nAlthough Cat couldn't see the item's status or detail, it sensed that the thorns were similar to its branches and vines.\n\"Meow-Meow?\"\nNoticing that Leo seemed uninterested in the whips, Cat secretly grabbed them and ran deeper into the forest. It giggled and tried to mimic Leo's action by cracking the whips.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nA hundred regular pine trees in front of Cat exploded upon impact, sending dust and small tree pieces everywhere in the air.\nCat widened its eyes and brightly smiled, having fun with them.\n\"Meow!\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\nIt destroyed more trees, causing several local beasts to panic.\nAs soon as Cat noticed movements, it salivated. With its chubby roots, it sprinted like a spider charging at its prey.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\"\nIt caught five rabbits and a weird-looking pheasant. As they were small, Cat ate them raw. After finishing its meal, it looked at the toys.\n\"Meow <3\"\nIt loved them so much. It started thinking, wondering if it could use its branches and vines like the whips.\nAs soon as Cat thought about using its arms like whips, the two whip artifacts resonated with Cat's wood Qi.\nThe whips merged with its branches.\n\"MEOW?!\"\nCat was shocked. However, it was also delighted. Cat cracked the newly merged arms around, getting used to the new sensation. It could feel the energy in the metal whips as if it was part of its branches.\n\"Meow <3\"\nIt coiled the whip around its small trunk, protecting the most delicate part of its body. Then, it uncoiled the trunk, trying to get used to the movements and commands.\nStarting to have fun, Cat returned to the shop's rooftop, leaving the carnage behind it. Without Leo noticing, it practiced moving the whips around without causing any damage to the store.\nHowever, while practicing, Cat noticed a group of incoming visitors, who were traveling toward Leo's store. There were 11 humans. 10 were 2nd-stage cultivators while the middle-aged man was a 4th-stage, aka the golden core stage.I think you should take a look at\nConfident in its abilities and the whips, Cat decided to approach them.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n.\n.\nAt noon, Leo took a short break after he finished making the second batch of grain pills of the day.\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"\n\"MONSTER!\"\nSomeone made a loud noise in front of the store. Leo stopped what he was doing and listened to the voices. He then heard the noises of people and Cat's meowing.\nIn the front yard, a sect's deacon and 10 outer disciples in white robes stood before the chomper plant, which was smiling at the crowd. The disciples pulled their weapons out, but the deacon stood in front of everybody, crossing his arms.\nMeanwhile, Cat was as naughty as usual. Upon seeing a weak crowd, it extorted them for a toll fee by opening its mouth, asking to be fed.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"S-Senior. What is it saying?\" Asked the disciple behind the deacon.\n\"I don't know. Ask the store owner.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow? Nom-Nom?\"\n\"I-It points at its mouth. Maybe, it wants us to feed it? Senior, should we feed it?\"\n\"I don't know. The last time I came here, Grand Elder Han gave it a precious carcass of a monster beast. I don't have a monster beast's corpse in my spatial ring.\"\n\"No-Nom, Meow?!\"\n\"S-Senior. It looks angry.\"\n\"… It probably asks us if we have any food for it. I don't think we can feed it.\"\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!?\"\n\"S-Senior. I think it's angry.\"\n\"… I think it wants to eat us now.\"\n\"NO-NOM?! NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"PREPARE TO FIGHT!\"\nLeo heard enough. He walked out of the shade and approached the visitors in front of the store.\nA deacon, who visited Leo yesterday, seemed to have escorted a group of 10 disciples here. They were gawking at Cat in the front yard. As for Cat, it widely smiled at the guests while it salivated.\nNo matter how Leo looked at Cat, it was about to attack the group to eat them.\n\"Cat,\" Leo lightly poked the back of its head. However, for Cat, it was a smack to the back of the head.\n\"Meow?!\"\nCat was stunned for a moment. However, when it realized that Leo hit it, Cat turned around and brightly smiled. Catching Leo off guard, it licked his face, spreading its bad breath and changing his scent.\nLeo stood there, giving Cat a blank look. He got used to it.\nAfter Cat had enough licking, Leo picked up a wet towel in a water bucket near the BBQ set and wiped his face. Then, he tossed the contaminated towel into the water bucket.\nSeeing the contaminated water, Cat rushed toward the water bucket and slurped the content. It even sucked the towel's juice in glee.\nLeo gently lifted the chomper plant and gently yeeted it toward the backyard, throwing the massive monster plant like it was a javelin.\n\"MYAAA!!\"\nEverybody could hear the plant's scream and a loud thud, which came from the back of the workshop.\nAfter getting rid of the troublemaker, Leo greeted the visitors.\n\"Hello.\"\nThe ten outer disciples of the Life Sword Sect gazed at Leo in astonishment. When the deacon coughed, everybody bowed 90 degrees toward Leo.\n\"GREETINGS, SENIOR!\"\n\"JUNIOR GREETS SENIOR!\"\nThe deacon embarrassingly coughed. He cupped his fist and stated his purpose, \"As promised, I've brought you more customers. Could you sell grain pills to these disciples?\"\nLeo brightly smiled. He opened the door and allowed them to go inside.\n.\nTen minutes later, the first group of disciples each purchased two grain pills of their choice. Most of them picked the metal element grain pills as they synergized with their sword techniques. Only a couple of weirdoes picked earth pills.\nAfter the transaction, Leo got a total of 180 years of lifespan as profit. The deacon got to live 20 years longer as he got his commission. Everybody bid farewell to Leo and left.\nAfter the first group had left, the next group of disciples and a deacon arrived. They didn't interact with Cat this time.\nThe deacon was also a follower of Han Hao that had visited the store yesterday. Like the previous guy, he brought the disciples under his care here.\n\"Senior Florida Man, I've guided these talented disciples here to purchase your pills. Could you sell them to us?\"\nLeo shrugged and repeated the process. The disciples entered the store and admired the rare herbs and fruits in the showcases. However, each disciple only bought two metal element pills.\nAfter the second group, the third, fourth, and fifth came in order. The deacons kept bringing a new team here.\nUnfortunately, only seven groups of disciples visited the store. Leo managed to sell 140 pills, earning him 1,260 years of lifespan!\nThe hectic hour was over. Leo got room to breathe and restock the grain pills.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo attended the guests and disciples, an inner disciple and 20 black-robed men watched them from afar. They stood on top of regular pine trees, observing Leo's actions.\nThey were Ouyang Ting and the Hound Squad of the Ouyang Clan.",

Although it was still daytime, the group camouflaged themselves under the shades and secretly observed Leo and the disciples.\n\"Soul Formation Cultivator,\" uttered the Hound Squad's leader.\nOuyang Ting looked at the captain of the assassin squad, \"How is it, Duan Mu? Do you think you can kill him?\"\nDuan Mu, the captain of the Hound Squad, was a nascent soul cultivator and an array master. He had completed seven assassination missions involving soul formation cultivators, and he wasn't afraid of a rogue cultivator with no background.\n\"Very easy job. That man's foundation is terrible. I can't even feel his aura or the usual presence of a soul formation cultivator. I think he must have forcefully advanced through the ranks when he was young. Anyway, there won't be any issue.\"\nHearing the captain's evaluation, Ouyang Ting almost laughed. He was confident that he could steal all the treasures in the store and kill the Florida Man.\n\"Let's wait until night. There are too many eyes around here. Once the sun goes down, you can start setting up the trap array,\" ordered the young master.\n\"I agree.\"\nThe group continued to lurk in the shadow.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo ate another dantian pill and rechecked his lifespan status. He believed he had enough to upgrade the store to level 3.\n<Remaining Lifespan: 2,503 Years, 11 Months, 9 Days 23 Hours.>\nThere were more than enough. Leo upgraded the store to level 3 right away. While standing behind the store, he touched the wooden wall at the back of the store, and the system prompted him.\nLeo didn't need to reread the message. He commanded it, \"Upgrade to level 3.\"\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 3.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nRUMBLE\nThe store transformed again. The walls looked newer and glossy as if they had been sanded and coated with wax. The rusty hinges and the door frames changed into new metal door frames, and the creaking sound was no more.\nLeo rushed inside the store to see the changes. Upon getting inside, he was shocked.\nThe store, which was supposed to be about 100 square meters, got slightly larger. The showcases and tables remained in the same position, but they stood in the middle of the store while the walls and windows were two meters away.\nConfused, Leo exited through the front door and opened the shop domain menu to see the grid map. However, the shop still occupied the 10x10 grids, remaining unchanged. But when Leo entered the store, it was larger than before.\n'Wow. The inside gets bigger, but the outside is still the same. What kind of sorcery is this?'\nLeo rushed to the bedroom, aka the storeroom of the humble store building. He wondered if it got bigger as well.\nSure enough, it was larger. Instead of being a rat hole that could barely fit one person, it had the same size as a studio room in an apartment.\nLooking at the new bedroom, Leo wondered if the store could feature a modern toilet. He left the bedroom and checked the other parts of the store.\nUnfortunately, no toilet was in sight. It was still a store, not a house for a living person. Disappointed, Leo deeply sighed.\n'Oh, boy. This feature is unreal. The store is obviously bigger, but no one can notice from the outside. Damn!'\nAfter the upgrade, there was more work to do. Leo relocated the showcases, fridges, and furniture in the store.\nAfter rearranging everything, Leo looked at the empty area at the center. He felt like it lacked something.\nThe store lacked aisle shelves.\nSince Leo had a surplus of lifespan at the moment, he opened the shopping menu to get some modern shelves to display more items so that he wouldn't have to place the pill containers on a flat table.\nDING\nBy spending only six years of lifespan, Leo got six supermarket aisle shelves. He placed them in the middle of the store so that it wouldn't look too empty. Then, he started arranging pill containers on them.\nLeo started investing. He purchased 100 Tupperware boxes to store his merchandise instead of putting all of them in a bowl. Fortunately, the 100 containers only cost him 10 years, so he didn't lose out much. Then, he started storing newly made pills in the boxes.\nLeo grinned as he gazed at the potential best-seller items in the store.\n.\n[Low-Grade Metal Grain Pill]\nSatisfy the hunger for 72 hours.\nImprove blood circulation and internal organ efficiency by 20% for 72 hours.\nIncrease lifespan by three years.\nIncrease Metal Qi by three years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nAfter upgrading the alchemy workshop's quality, the new batches of metal element pills came out as low-grade instead of the lesser or inferior-graded ones. As for the other elements, they were fixed at a lesser grade.\nLeo couldn't help it – The iron pine nuts were a metal-based ingredient, so it gave a better result when the pills came out as metal element items.\nThat was not all. As the pill's quality increased, the price had to be reasonable. Leo removed the previous price note on the pill containers and put a new label on them.\n[Low-Grade Metal Element Grain Pill – 15 Years of Lifespan per Pill]\nAll lesser-grade pills remained at the same price. However, only the low-graded ones required 15 years instead of 10.\nThe metal grain pills were not the only main attraction here – Another type of dangerous pills could be sold like hot cakes. However, Leo kept these pills away as they weren't suitable to be shown in public.\n.\n[Lesser Elixir Grain Pill]\nSatisfy the hunger for 48 hours.I think you should take a look at\nIncrease metabolism and regenerative abilities for 15 days.\nIncrease lifespan by 20 years.\nIncrease five elemental Qi by 20 years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nThe lifespan perk was no joke. Moreover, the amount of Qi was twice the inferior-graded ones.\nLeo looked at the white glossy pills and thought of Wu Buyi. He wondered how he would react to these elixir pills.\n'He's gonna have a heart attack. Anyway, I should store these in my bedroom. If the news spread, I'll get myself in trouble.'\nLeo carried the pill boxes with the elixir pills to the storeroom, hoping that nobody would notice their existence. After sorting the elixir pills out, Leo gathered the poison element pills to a separate corner of the shelf and put them in the same usual sealed Tupperware boxes.\nLooking at them reminded Leo of Jin Yong, aka the guy with pimples that purchased all his poison pills. Leo wondered if he was still alive.\n'I should reserve these for that poison freak. This shelf is reserved for poisonous substances and pills. Oh, speaking of categories, I should rearrange the shelves. I shouldn't put all six elements near each other.'\nLeo continued to run in and out, juggling between the alchemy workshop and the store, sorting and filling the containers with more grain pills until night.\n.\nAt 9 PM, Leo was mentally exhausted. He walked out of the store, planning to take a quick bath, take a leak, and hit the bed. As soon as Leo got out of the store, he stretched, taking a deep breath and enjoying the scent of the night air.\n*SNORE*\nCat, who was usually on the roof, snored like an old man. It seemed to be in deep sleep after all the workouts - chasing around the visiting disciples and deacons all day.\nLeo walked toward the earthen jar next to the store, where he had collected the fresh water from the stream river. However, it was empty as Cat drank them all. Moreover, there were signs of contamination as the earthen jar smelled like the chomper's bad breath.\n'Dammit, Cat. You could have gotten the water from the stream, not my freaking water reserve! Now, I have to walk to the river and get some water.'\nWhile complaining in his mind, Leo put on gloves and grabbed a water bucket. Then, he walked toward the stream.\nBut along the way, Leo saw a silhouette of a person behind a large mutated pine tree.\n'A bear?'\nBZZZ\nIn a forest, bugs and mosquitoes at night could be annoying. Although Leo's skin and bodily fluids were poisonous to all mammals, the insects flocked around him as if there were flies, attracted to the most delicious stool.\n'Ah, damn bugs! Be gone!'\nLeo lightly snorted. Unlucky mosquitoes that latched on his skin fell one after another. The fruit flies that hovered in front of Leo also died after being blown by Leo's breath.\nAfter standing still and waiting for the bugs to die out for a minute, Leo resumed his journey to the river.\n.\n.\nA member of the Hound Squad frowned when his eyes met Leo's. He was confident in his stealth abilities, and he didn't believe that Leo could see him in the darkest area of the forest.\nThe assassin slowly pulled out a knife, ready to attack Leo. However, he heard the voice transmission of his captain.\n\"The array is incomplete. Stand down.\"\nThe assassin moved back into the shadow and put away his weapon. When he was out of Leo's sight, he gulped and looked back at his young master, who was still observing the store from the top of a pine tree.\nOuyang Ting looked at the assassin and shook his head. The latter nodded and remained silent.\nMeanwhile, their target simply stood there and stared at the assassin for a few seconds. Then, he continued carrying the water bucket toward the stream.\n10 minutes later, Leo returned to the store with a bucket full of water. His face and his clothes were slightly wet, and he hung a white towel around his neck. Oddly, the old man still wore strange-looking gloves.\nThe assassin slightly peeked out of the shadow, observing Leo.\nSuddenly, Leo put down the bucket of water and took off his gloves. He muttered, \"Ah, seriously. I hate insects.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAll assassins were frozen, including Duan Mu and Ouyang Ting. Their hearts skipped a beat as they noticed that Leo's killing intent soared.\n'Does he know we're here?!'\nDuan Mu started to get nervous. Although he believed that Leo was a weak soul formation cultivator, he didn't let his guard down. He kept placing talismans around the store building while avoiding Leo's line of sight.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, one of the assassins did his role, placing additional talismans at the north side of the store. He also sealed the back door, preventing Leo from escaping through this route.\nAfter blockading the backdoor with a barrier talisman, the assassin took a break and looked at another building behind him. The alchemy workshop was still working, and the cauldron seemed to be brewing something.\nThe assassin caught the scent of an element pill. He drooled.\n'Boss won't blame me if I steal some pills, right?'\nThe assassin approached the cauldron. He grabbed the lid and tried to open it. However, it didn't budge.\n\"Huh?\"\nHe tried to pull the lid with both hands. Again, it didn't move.\nBecause of frustration, the assassin exerted more force, yet the fragile-looking metal lid stayed glued to the cauldron.\n\"This thing…!\"\nThe assassin accidentally uttered a couple of words. He clicked his tongue and walked around the cauldron to see how he could open the lid.\nHe didn't notice that a certain plant woke up. It turned around and stared at him with red eyes that glowed in the dark.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 32 : Robbers Killed by \"Cat\" While Attempting to Break into Florida Man's House\n\"Why doesn't this move?!\"\nThe assassin had enough. He kicked the cauldron, hoping to flip it over and get the precious medicines inside.\nDONG\nThe cauldron didn't budge. Instead, the assassin's foot bones cracked because of the impact.\nThe man in black robes groaned and knelt, looking at his broken foot. He bit his lips to endure the pain. Because of the injury, the assassin failed to notice a creeping vine.\nWHOOSH\nA thorny vine suddenly coiled around the assassin's face. Then, it twisted his head.\nCRACK\nThe assassin widened his eyes. Before his consciousness faded forever, he saw the shining eyes of a monster plant. It dragged the assassin to the roof and peeled his clothes. Then, it put him in its mouth.\n.\n.\nCRUNCH\nCRUNCH\nThe sound of breaking bones echoed in the silent forest. Leo frowned and looked at the store's ceiling, wondering what Cat was doing. While looking, Leo slapped a flying mosquito in front of him.\n'There weren't many bugs and insects here before. Did that stupid plant attract bugs around here? He's getting louder than usual. Did he catch a beast around here or something?'\nLeo was in a bad mood because of the bugs. He hung the towel on a hanger in front of the building and entered the store.\n.\nCLICK\nAfter Leo had entered the store and locked the door, the assassins crept out of the bushes and shades. They surrounded the building and placed more talismans on the windows and the front door.\nUnlike Leo, the group of assassins witnessed everything Cat had done. They saw how the monster caught one of their members and ate him alive.\nDuan Mu came out from hiding. He spoke in a hushed voice.\n\"Kill the plant monster first. Treat it as a golden core cultivator.\"\nFive assassins unsheathed their blades and leaped on the roof. They imbued their element Qi into their weapons and hacked the giant head of the chomper plant.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nThe metal blades broke in half upon impact!\n\"What the?!\"\n\"HOW?!\"\nThe five assassins were shocked. They had hunted countless 3rd-stage monster beasts, but they always cut through them like tofu. However, this guy's skin was harder than their steel blades.\n\"Meow?\"\nWhile chewing the previous victim, Cat turned around. Then, it found five more intruders.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nThe assassins pulled out backup daggers from their waists and stabbed Cat's face in unison.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nOnce again, Cat's skin was like an impenetrable fortress. The daggers' tips bent upon impact.\nCat's eyes were still bright red. It glared at the assailants and moved its arm, lashing its newest weapons.\nWHIP\nWHIP\nThe thorn whips lashed the five assassins' bodies. Their torsos were broken in half!\n\"AAAHHH!!\"\nDeath throes of the assassins alarmed everybody in the area. Duan Mu looked up and found that the five-man team was instantly wiped out.\nThat plant was not a 3rd stage monster! Its strength exceeded its usual Qi.\n'Not good!'\nTheir cover was blown. It was a matter of time before the Florida Man came out to fight them. Still, Duan Mu and his men completed their first objective.\n\"ACTIVATE THE QI SEALING ARRAY!\"\nDuan Mu bellowed, and the remaining 13 assassins surrounded the building. They formed a hand incantation and injected their Qi into the talismans in their hands.\nRUMBLE\nAll talismans lit up, creating a red dome, covering the entire building. Even Cat got trapped inside the array formation.\nAll assassins sneered at the chomper monster. They had done this countless times, and no victim had survived this array. Duan Mu grinned while Ouyang Ting let out a long sigh of relief.\nIgnoring the casualty on his side, Duan Mu informed his lord.\n\"Young master, it's over. That monster and the expert inside have already lost their abilities to use Qi. Once he comes out, we can use ranged weapons to kill him. He will be as weak as a commoner as long as they stay inside the dome.\"\nOuyang Ting was interested in this technique. He wished to learn it.\n\"How does this work? Is it because of the talismans?\"\nDuan Mu laughed, \"That's right, young master. Our clan has a deep connection with the Situ Clan. They have been supplying us with these talismans in exchange for our services. We get rid of their competitors, and they reward us with their best talismans.\"\n\"Hahaha. Is that right? I heard the Situ Clan is the best when it comes to alchemy and talisman scribers. One of their clan members is the master of the Cauldron Gnosis Sect, one of the three powerhouse alchemy sects on the mainland! We ride on their tailcoat, and we can expect great things.\"\n\"Young master is knowledgeable. I'm envious.\"\nWhile Ouyang Ting bragged and Duan Mu bootlicked his boss, changes occurred to the monster on the rooftop. It suddenly leaped and charged at the assassins on the ground, opening its mouth and trying to bite the nearest victims.\nOuyang Ting frowned and stood behind Duan Mu for safety. However, the assassin captain laughed again.\n\"Don't worry, young master. No monster and cultivator can escape the array! They will get stuck in there while we're free to attack them.\"\nBOOM\nCat's head smacked with the array barrier. It fell to the ground. Then, it looked at the red dome and the semi-transparent energy wall in confusion and frustration.\n\"Meow?!\"\nCat innocently tried to bite the assassins on the other side of the energy dome. However, he couldn't get through.\n\"Mya?\"\nCat was annoyed. It lashed its whips at the wall, trying to destroy it.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe array dome shook, and small cracks appeared. Again, Cat was confused.\n\"Meow...\"\nDuan Mu and the assassins sneered at Cat's attempt while they leisurely brought out small crossbows and poison darts to shoot at it.\n\"The array can repair itself. No matter how much it tries, its puny attacks can't get through. This array can even fend off any nascent soul cultivator's attacks!\"\nCat tilted its head as it heard the comment. It climbed back to the rooftop and started rotating its whips. After getting a good momentum, it lashed the barrier again.\nBOOMI think you should take a look at\nBOOM\nThe two whips hit the same spot.\nCRACK\nThis time, half of the barrier was cracked like a glass wall on the verge of falling apart.\n\"Huh!?\"\nDuan Mu and the assassins frowned. Nobody had cracked their array barrier to this extent, but this weak-looking monster almost shattered it in a few hits.\nNot letting their guard down anymore, the assassins pointed their crossbows at Cat and imbued their element Qi into their bolts. Then, they unleashed a barrage.\nThe arrows passed through the array barrier as it was designed to block the insider's attacks while allowing the people outside to attack at will.\nDING\nAll bolts bounced off Cat's skin, causing sharp noises as if they were needles hitting a thick steel plate. Instead of harming it, Cat was enraged.\nIt lashed the whips at the barrier again. This time, it didn't stop hitting the same area once or twice. Cat kept hitting it and roared.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe array was fully cracked!\nDuan Mu bellowed, \"Strengthens the array! I'll attack that monster myself!\"\nAfter sending his order, Duan Mu unsheathed his long sword. He gathered metal essence in his sword, strengthening its durability, hardness, and sharpness. A semi-transparent soul of his came out from his body and overlapped with his real body. Then, he jumped to the sky and slashed down, shooting a long-range attack from the sky.\nA crescent energy sword wave descent upon Cat.\nCat looked up. Sensing the danger, it jumped off the roof.\nSWUA!\nOne of its roots was slightly cut and caused bleeding. Cat tumbled and fell to the backyard of the shop. Then, it noticed its small wound.\nBOOM\nThe energy blade hit the building directly. However, it caused no damage to it.\n\"Hmm?!\"\nStrangely, the fragile-looking wood building was intact after being hit by his sword energy. Duan Mu always managed to cut through trees and steel plates with ease, but it didn't work here.\nDuan Mu sensed something amiss. His instinct cried that he was in danger.\n\"MYAAAOW!!\"\nThe monster suddenly yowled like a cat in pain or distress. Its eyes were moist, and it was calling for its parent for help.\nThe assassins repositioned themselves and surrounded Cat. The crossbowmen pointed their weapons at the plant monster again, ready to finish it off.\nThe back door of the shop suddenly blasted open.\n.\n.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe commotion got louder and louder while Leo was in his bed, trying to get some sleep. He sat up and complained, \"What the hell, Cat? Are you fighting something weird in the woods again?\"\nLeo got out of bed. Then, he placed his ear on the wall, trying to listen outside.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nSomething loud was going on, and Leo didn't understand why. He got out of the bedroom and opened the front curtain to look outside.\nThere was nothing there.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe sound came from the east side of the store, where there was no window. Leo clicked his tongue as he didn't want to go out and get swarmed by bugs and night mosquitoes again.\nAs Leo was about to go back to sleep, he received a rare message from the shop domain system.\nDING\n<One of your buildings is under attack!>\n\"...\"\nLeo stopped on his track. He turned his head to look at the message.\n\"Attacked? By whom?\"\nHe didn't remember provoking anybody except the wolves. It confused him why he would be attacked out of the blue. But then, as a former American, his instinct remembered the usual burglary and robbery in the neighborhood.\nLeo scratched his head in frustration.\n\"I thought Asians are educated and humble. I guess not everybody follows the stereotype.\"\nLeo cracked his fists and walked toward the back door. But then, he suddenly had a weird inspiration.\n\"Say, system. I know that I can't steal my customer's lifespan without their consent, but is there a way to punish those intruders for raiding my store? How about a fine? Of course, they have to pay with their lifespan.\"\nNormally, the system never replied to Leo's questions. However, this time, it gave him support.\n<Self-Defense is an exception. You may extract lifespan from criminals if they attempt to harm you, the store, or the employees in the domain.>\n\"Good to know.\"\nGetting the confirmation, Leo felt a lot better. He tried to open the back door.\nClick-Click\nThe knob didn't turn as if it was stuck by something even though it was unlocked. Leo frowned and exerted more force.\nCRACK\nHe exerted too much force. The doorknob was broken.\n\"Tsk.\"\nWithout a choice, Leo kicked the door, sending it flying outside. Then, he heard a strange shattering sound of glasses upon impact.\nThe door was blasted open, and a layer of red wall collapsed.\n\"Finally.\"\nLeo deeply sighed and looked at the broken door. He scratched his head, thinking about how he would repair the door after this. While looking at the door, he noticed that Cat was nearby. He gazed at the plant.\nIt was bleeding. Green blood was dripping from one of Cat's major roots. Moreover, the plant was yowling.\n\"...\"\nLeo silently stared at the injured plant. Then, he shifted his eyes, glancing at the assailants outside. Finally, he discovered the assailants.\n\"You there... Which one of you hurt my Cat?\" Leo stared at the nearest assassin.\nThe black-robed men readied their weapons, preparing to shoot crossbow bolts at Leo.",

He should have lost all supporting inner energy. No matter how strong he is, it's impossible to move in there!\"\nDuan Mu had a bad feeling about Leo. His aura condition didn't change after being hit by the Qi Sealing Array. All soul formation cultivators in the past succumbed to this array. As cultivators relied on Qi as an energy source and ate grain pills instead of hard food, they always ran out of energy after the Qi had been dispersed.\nYet, Leo was still looking healthy!\nSeeing how Leo broke the talisman's seals and came out, Duan Mu ordered his men.\n\"He must be pretending! There's no way that he can move around for long. All units! Keep your distance. Wait for him to run out of energy and become crippled because of starvation and energy depletion.\"\nThe assassins nodded and backed away from the array dome. They were also confident that the array could trap Leo.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo looked around, scanning the perimeter and counting the enemies. A total of 14 people were surrounding this place. However, as Leo looked further, he found another silhouette of another ninja behind a pine tree.\n'14 robbers. Wow, a large group.'\nLeo didn't wait for them to answer his previous question. He deeply exhaled and strode toward his pet.\nThe assassins snorted. One of them shot a bolt at Leo's face, aiming at his right eye. After applying his Qi, the bolt flew at the speed of a modern rifle's bullet!\nThe bolt directly hit Leo's pupil. However, it failed to penetrate through the soft-looking eyeball. Instead, the bolt broke!\n\"What the hell?!\" The assassin was taken aback.\nLeo ignored the crowd. He brought out a low-grade elixir grain pill from his pocket. Then, he fed it to Cat and patted its head.\n\"I'm sorry. I wish I had a bigger house to keep you indoors.\"\n\"Meow...\"\nCat nudged at Leo's chest while crying. Leo wiped its tear and cleaned its dirty dusty face.\n\"You also need to take a bath and brush your teeth. You stink.\"\n\"Meow!\"\nCat sobbed, but it kept nudging its head against Leo's chest. The latter stroked its cheek twice and turned his head, looking at the uninvited guests.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nCountless arrows hit Leo's face, arms, legs, and body. However, none of them managed to pierce through his skin.\n\"Dear customers, you shouldn't throw peas at people,\" Leo complained. His expression turned dark.\nDuan Mu fired a red sword wave energy at Leo from outside the barrier, aiming at his neck.\nSeeing the incoming energy sword, Leo raised his hand and received the energy wave with his palm.\nBOOM!\nThe energy sword exploded like a crimson firework. The flame blast kicked the dust and dirt flying, causing black smoke everywhere. The smoke was contained in the dome, blocking the visual from the outside.\nOne of the assassins mocked Leo, \"Soul Formation Cultivator? More like a dead soul. No one survived Lord Duan's Fire Crescent Slash! Once hit, you'll be burned to death!\"\nThe smoke continued to expand, but it was still trapped inside the red dome. However, everybody believed that Leo was done. The other assassins also smirked. They waited for the dust and flame to subside so that they could finish off the cultivator.\nWHOOSH\nSuddenly, a fist came out of the smoke and flame. It punched through the red dome.\nSounds of shattering glasses echoed, and the red dome collapsed like a broken dome of glasses!\nCLANK\nThe talisman array of Duan Mu was broken. The red dome fragments vanished, and the smoke was blown outside, revealing the silhouette of Leo.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nThe assassins took several steps back in shock. Even Duan Mu couldn't believe his eyes.\nLeo pulled back his punch and walked out of the smoke. He exhaled the dust from his lungs. His green pupils glowed in the dark, staring at the people at the back of his store.\nThe assassins were speechless as Leo's aura was still the same as ever. It didn't seem like the array had affected him at all.\nDuan Mu gritted his teeth. He sent seven more red energy sword slashes at Leo.\nThe Florida Man positioned himself in front of Cat. Using only his left arm, he swatted and deflected the energy waves back to the caster as if they were Ping-Pong balls.\n\"!!!\"\nDuan Mu dodged all the reflected sword waves that came toward him. He descended and landed on the roof of the alchemy workshop.\nHowever, when Duan Mu looked at Leo again, the latter had already vanished from the spot.\nSuddenly, the warm hand of Leo seized the back of Duan Mu's nape!\n\"WHAT?! HOW?!\"\nDuan Mu couldn't even see Leo's movement. By the time he sensed Leo, he was already caught!\nLeo leaned closer to the assassin captain. His dark expression was the same as the characters in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Series.\n\"Dear customer. The store is closed at night.\"\n\"!!!\"\nDuan Mu struggled, trying to break out of Leo's grip. However, his fingers squeezed tight, causing him to get dizzy as the hand pressed on his sensitive nerves. Moreover, the skin around his neck gradually melted, and he could feel the burning pain.\nLeo continued whispering, \"Also, you will be fined for harming the store's mascot and forcing me to destroy a door. The fine will be all your lifespan.\"\n.\nName: Duan Mu\nAge: 64\nRemaining Lifespan: 596 Years, 4 Months, 18 Hours, 8 Minutes\n.\nDuan Mu could see the status window of his lifespan for the first time and last time. The number rapidly decreased. Within seconds, it was down to zero!\nAll 596 years of Duan Mu's lifespan vanished and added into Leo's life force's pool.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nDuan Mu's body was instantly dried and withered. The assassin's captain's body withered and dissipated into ash.\nLeo's green pupils shifted, turning his attention to the other black-robed men.\n\"RETREAT!!\"\nThe men shouted and kicked the ground, flying away from the store.\nLeo deeply exhaled and activated the shop domain system with a thought.\n'System! Collect everything!'\nDINGI think you should take a look at\n<Affirmative. Collecting assailants' lifespan as compensation for damaged properties...>\n<You have collected 554 Years, 6 Months, 3 Days, and 7 Minutes.>\n<You have collected 541 Years, 8 Months, 10 Days, and 16 Minutes.>\n<You have collected...>\n<You have collected...>\n<You have collected...>\nSeries of 13 messages reported that Leo had stolen all lifespan of the raiders. Everything was added to Leo's lifespan pool just like when he traded with the other guests.\nA moment later, he heard the death throes of the escapees.\n\"AAAAAHHHH!!\"\n\"IMPOSSIBLE!!\"\n\"NOOOOO!!\"\nThe running assassins saw their status, witnessing how their lifespan was reduced to zero. They turned into ash while they cried in desperation, leaving behind only their clothes and belongings.\nCHING-CHING-CHING\nLeo heard the casino-jackpot-like sound from the domain system. He rechecked his lifespan status.\n<Your remaining lifespan: 8,128 Years, 6 Months, 7 Days.>\nLeo almost had a heart attack. These guys were rich!\n'Oh, boy. Now, I wish more idiots attacked my store. Actually, please raid my store again! I love it!'\nKilling robbers were so profitable that Leo had the urge to join the dark side. Leo chortled like Mr. Smith from The Matrix.\n\"H-Hiek!!\"\nWhile Leo was laughing, someone let out a weird noise. Leo stopped laughing and looked at the source of the voice. Surprisingly, one of the black-robbed men survived the system's power.\nLeo frowned. He thought he had ordered the system to kill everybody. However, this guy was still around.\n\"System, how is this guy still alive?\"\nDING\n<You cannot steal the lifespan of innocent bystanders, guests, or customers.>\n\"...\"\nIt appeared that one of the black-robed guys didn't participate in the robbery. He might be an accomplice, but he never harmed the store or Cat.\nLeo was annoyed. He snorted and stomped toward the last survivor.\n\"NOO!! LEAVE ME ALONE!\"\nThe guy turned tail and ran. Leo kicked the ground and vanished, leaving behind a deep footprint.\n.\n.\nOuyang Ting was terrified. He thought that the Hound Squad of his clan was an invincible assassin unit that could easily kill any rogue cultivator.\nThe plan backfired. All assassins and Duan Mu were killed.\nHe ran away from the store as fast as he could. He didn't care if he would expose his back to the store owner.\nPOW\nSuddenly, Ouyang Ting felt an impact coming from the back of his head. He tumbled and rolled on the ground for 10 meters before his head hit a tree trunk. He got dizzy and his vision blurred.\nWhile his world was spinning, he heard a voice.\n\"Whoops. I forgot to wear gloves. Oh, well, it was unintentional. I was planning to capture you, but I end up touching you directly. I hope your mutation goes well.\"\nOuyang Ting didn't understand a thing. He tried to get up, but the concussion and the spinning vision prevented him from maintaining his balance or recovering his vision. He fell to the ground again and lay on his stomach.\nA sharp pain suddenly came from the back of his head. He felt like his skin or his blood burst out from the inside. The nauseous feeling made him vomit all wines and water that he had drunk, but all the fluid dirtied his face.\nThe pain spread to his stomach. He felt like all his bones were shattered, including his spinal cord. His stomach exploded from the inside, and his intestines moved as if he had diarrhea.\nAfter the ultimate pain had hit his bones, it transferred to all nerves in Ouyang Ting''s arms, legs, and manhood. He opened his mouth to scream, but his vocal cord failed to produce any noise.\nPOP\nHis lung ruptured. He was no longer capable of holding his breath as his lungs were the same as leaking balloons.\nBecause of the sudden suffocation, Ouyang Ting forgot about the pain. His tongue stuck out as he tried to breathe, but he couldn't suck in the air. In desperation, he moved his arms and hands to touch his throat.\n*WIGGLE*\nThe arms were no longer human-like. They become a mass of grotesque muscle meat, which rapidly consumed his Qi to grow larger non-stop.\nAlthough Ouyang Ting was a strong cultivator, without air, he lasted for 15 minutes before he stopped moving.\nThat was the most painful and torturous lesson that he learned : First, a weak-looking tiger is still a tiger, so one must never underestimate his opponent. Second, never pick a fight with a stronger foe with a higher cultivation base. And lastly, one must prepare for the consequences of his actions.\nIt was too late for Ouyang Ting to apply what he had learned in the future. He paid the price of these lessons with his life.\n.\n.\n\"The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed, boy.\"\nLooking at the corpse of Ouyang Ting, Leo grumbled. He didn't feel bad for accidentally killing a robber, but he was disappointed that he didn't get to steal Ouyang Ting's lifespan.\n\"Oh, well. I could have stolen your lifespan had I worn gloves, but you end up dying because you touched me. Oh, wait. I touched you. Oh, wait. That sounds terribly wrong for many reasons!\"\nLeo scratched his head while he dragged the swelled and mutated corpse of Ouyang Ting back to the store. He hummed, wondering if he could do a little research on the mutated body's blood and organs to get new alchemy materials.\nUpon arriving at the store, Cat wagged its breaches as if it was a dog.\n\"Meow <3\"\nLeo laughed, \"Yeah, I love you, too. Don't eat this MF yet.\"\n\"Meou.\"\nCat pouted. It climbed back to the roof and picked up the corpses of the five assassins that it had killed. Then, it busied itself, peeling the clothes and eating the human bananas.\nBut a second later, it spat them out. Then, it complained.\n\"MEOW!\"\nLeo looked up and remembered something. He warned Cat.\n\"By the way, damn cat! You just ate a grain pill. Your stomach will be full for 48 hours. Don't eat anything, or you'll puke!\"\n\"MA-MEOW?!\"\n\"Don't NANI me! I healed your wound!\"\nCat jumped around and threw a fit. Fortunately, the store was sturdy enough to withstand Cat's weight.\nLeo laughed at his pet and shook his head. He proceeded to drag Ouyang Ting's corpse to the backyard.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 34 – Dead Robber's Father Blames Florida Man for Retaliating Against Robbers\n= Life Sword Sect =\nThe Grand Elder Pagoda's top floor was the home of Han Hao. The entire floor was his living quarter, living room, and bedroom.\nThe floor below, on the other hand, was the monitor room of inner disciples. The sect housed key artifacts that represented the lives of all inner disciples – Life Candles.\nLife Candles were the tools that the sect relied on to monitor their inner disciples' well-being. Every inner disciple's life was connected to one of the candles. Whenever they were healthy, the candle's flame shone. Whenever the disciple was sick, the flame flickered and wavered. When a disciple was injured, the candle melted, and the fire faded.\nBut whenever a disciple died, the candle would reveal the cause of death. If the disciple died because of sickness, the candle stick would always remain intact, but the flame would die out. But if someone killed the disciple, the candle would be broken in half.\nOn the candle stands next to the wall, two hundred candle sticks stood there, and the flame was calm. At the bottom of the candles were the labels and tokens of inner disciples.\nIn the middle of the room with nothing but candles and shelves, a burly middle-aged man sat there, meditating and guarding the candle sticks. He had no facial hair, and he tied his long hair into a topknot like a samurai. The red tiger tattoos on his thick arms and countless sword scars on his skin were his signature feature, and his Daoist Name was Tiger Swordsman.\nTiger Swordsman was another elder of the sect. His position was below Han Meng and Han Hao, but held a high ranking among the internal affairs elders due to his duty – He was in charge of monitoring the statuses of all inner disciples.\nCRACK\nWhile Tiger Swordsman was meditating, one of the candles broke in half and fell to the floor. The elder snapped open his eyes and stood up. Walking toward the candle, the elder picked it up and looked at the name token of the fallen inner disciple.\nOuyang Ting\n\"Ouyang Ting? Which madman provokes the Ouyang Clan? Is he insane?\"\nThe elder pulled the broken candle out of the shelf and brought them to a Buddhist altar on the north side of the floor. The Buddha statue was three meters tall, but it depicted a sleeping Buddha. In front of the statue was a large water bowl with clear water.\nTiger Swordsman deeply sighed and dropped the broken candle into the water bowl. The liquid instantly turned murky white.\n\"Show me what he did before his death.\"\nThis water bowl was another artifact of the Life Sword Sect. Upon dropping a broken Life Candle into this container, the water would show the last 10-30 minutes of the deceased's vision before his death. Unfortunately, it could only show the vision. The audio was not included.\nThe water in the bowl revealed a scene of a dark forest and a certain wooden cabin. At first, the scene remained the same because Ouyang Ting had been stalking the general store.\nA minute later, Leo returned to his store. Then, a group of assassins came out and started putting on talismans around the cabin.\nTiger Swordsman frowned. Although they wore black robes, he recognized this tactic of this assassin unit. After all, they were famous for overusing the Qi Sealing Talismans of the Situ Clan.\n\"Damn Ouyang's Hound Squad. This stupid group should have been eradicated long ago if not for the Ouyang Clan! They're the dumbest one-trick-pony gang. What assassin? They're just a pretentious group of ragtag assassin-wannabe. They have no skill whatsoever!\"\nThe elder was in a bad mood as he hated dishonorable assassins. He forgot for a moment that he was supposed to investigate Ouyang Ting's cause of death.\nSoon, the vision changed. Ouyang Ting moved down from a tree, but he still lurked in the shadow. He watched the fight scene between a group of assassins and a monster plant on the rooftop, but five of them were slaughtered instantly. Then, the assassins activated the array and trap the monster inside.\nSeeing how the assassins stayed outside of the Qi Sealing Array and shooting bolts and arrows at the plant, Tiger Swordsman sneered.\n\"See? In the end, your group is just full of trashy wannabes. None of you know anything about swordsmanship or weapon techniques. You're all nascent soul cultivators, but you can't even take down a 3rd-stage monster. How disgraceful.\"\nTiger Swordsman laughed for a moment, but then, he noticed something weird.\nThe infamous Qi Sealing Array was cracked by the monster's whips.\nHis interest was piqued. He looked closer and clicked his tongue. However, Ouyang Ting was too far away from the scene, and Tiger Swordsman couldn't see the detail.\n\"Get closer, you coward! Get back on a tree and look from above if you are stalking someone! What a fool!\"\nThe elder wished he had a jar of wine and snacks to eat while he watched the show. Once again, he forgot that he was supposed to investigate Ouyang Ting's death.\nThe fight tipped on the monster's side at first. But then, the assassin captain started using a sword technique. It was a long-ranged crescent slash, which generated a sword energy wave that could cut through steel.\nThe elder shook his head. This was a basic skill that all disciples eventually learned from the Life Sword Sect. He didn't know how Duan Mu had learned it, but its strength and speed were subpar. Tiger Swordsman, who had the same cultivation strength as Duan Mu, was confident that he could do it a thousand times better.\nThe monster got pushed back by the sword slash. It fell to the back of the store.\nAfter the monster had fallen off the rooftop, the assassins followed it. Ouyang Ting also moved out of the shadow and ran toward the back of the store. He continued observing the situation from behind.\nOnce more, the vision was poor. Ouyang Ting prioritized hiding over observing, which made Tiger Swordsman annoyed.\nFortunately, the situation developed. The store owner walked out of the store.\nTiger Swordsman raised his brow as he found Leo's odd. Although he couldn't tell if Leo was a soul formation cultivator, the colorful aura around him indicated that he mastered all five elements, which made him a dangerous existence. Picking a fight with a soul-formation cultivator was the same as picking a fight with a Quasi-Immortal cultivator.\n\"Well, it's over. They're done for.\"I think you should take a look at\nThe elder watched how Duan Mu activated the formation and used an explosive sword technique. Leo soon punched and broke the array with ease. Then, he came after the assassin captain in a flash.\nThe fight instantly ended. The assassin captain turned into ash on the spot. The other goons fled in all directions, but they also dissipated into dust even though Leo didn't touch them.\nTiger Swordsman was amazed by Leo's mysterious power. He broke a cold sweat, unable to imagine how he would cope with such a mysterious ability.\nThe elder bit his lower lips. No matter how he simulated the fight between him and Leo, he couldn't figure out a way to win. The power was too domineering.\nDRIP\nThe water curtain rippled as a sweat drop Tiger Swordsman fell into the bowl. Fortunately, the artifact continued to show the last experience of Ouyang Ting.\nThe guy turned tail and ran. He was fast for a peak 3rd-stage cultivator. But facing a soul-formation senior with a monstrous foundation, he was like a kitten in front of a veteran lion.\nOuyang Ting was knocked by something as the vision span. The image blurred, and Tiger Swordsman could no longer see anything.\nThe elder gave up watching. He had enough information about what Ouyang Ting had done.\n\"Idiot. Truly an idiot. He picked a fight with a senior, and he got himself killed. Did he think that all seniors won't lay their hands on juniors? Not everybody follows the doctrine of the Jianghu Alliance. Those \"Senior must not bully junior\" things are outdated. If the juniors deserve it, we obviously will teach them a lesson!\"\nTiger Swordsman deeply sighed. He believed that Ouyang Ting deserved it. However, there was a major problem.\nHow would Life Sword Sect explain to Ouyang Ting's father? Ouyang Long was a member of the Jianghu Alliance, and he was in command of the Ouyang Clan's troops. He would surely know about his son's death and pay the sect a visit. If this matter was handled poorly, it could trigger a war.\nAs Tiger Swordsman didn't have enough influence or power to make a decision for the sect, he picked the broken candle in the bowl and Ouyang Ting's token. Then, he brought it to the higher floor, where Han Hao resided.\n.\n.\nThe Life Sword Sect was not the only place with the Life Candle artifacts. The Ouyang Clan also possessed them as they could be easily made with alchemy. In addition, it was common knowledge that Life Candles were made from a human's spinal cord and the blood essence of Life Candle's owner.\nThe capital city, Cauliflower City, was the heart of the capital was the Jianghu Alliance's palace, which was the gathering place of clan lords and undying old men.\nIn the palace, one of the Ouyang Clan's Life Candles was broken. A clan membered picked them up and looked at the name token in panic. Then, they brought the broken candle stick to their master.\nIn a courtyard of the Jianghu Alliance, Ouyang Long sat at a tea table with two other clan lords. They had been exchanging pleasantries while they admired the scenery and wine.\nBut the Ouyang Clan's servant rushed in and knelt before the three lords.\n\"Report! Young Master Ouyang Ting has fallen!\"\n\"Hmm?!\"\nOuyang Long was a 6'6 toned middle-aged man in long blue robes. He had a long black beard that reached his solar plexus and straight long hair. He also wore scholar headwear to hide a portion of his hair in there.\nUpon hearing of his son's demise, Ouyang Long remained expressionless. He muttered, \"Who killed him?\"\nThe clan member rubbed his spatial ring and ejected an empty bowl and a bucket of water. He poured the water into the container and dropped the broken candle stick in there.\nThe last vision of Ouyang Ting was displayed.\nThe two lords and Ouyang Long watched the water screen together. A few minutes later, only Ouyang Long closed his eyes while the other lords burst into laughter.\n\"Brother Long. Your son was quite bold. Why did he provoke a soul formation cultivator?\"\nAnother lord snickered, \"His death is unfortunate. But still, even we can't comprehend his thought. Why did he do it anyway? From the looks of it, the other party is just minding his business in the woods, but your son brought a group of assassins for him. Is he insane?\"\nOuyang Long's face reddened in embarrassment. He wished that he would have received this report in private. Because of this clan member, Ouyang Long became a laughingstock.\nThe father stood up and politely cupped his fist, \"It seems that I'll be busy for a while. I'll make sure to come back before the mystic realm expedition.\"\n\"Hahaha. Go ahead.\"\n\"Yeah. Just go. We understand.\"\n\"…\"\nOuyang Long nodded and turned around. He glared at the servant with bloodshot eyes.\n\"Prepare the ship. We're going to Life Sword Sect!\"\nThe servant sensed a chill running down his spine. He sweated profusely and ran toward the airstrip, where the Ouyang Clan had parked their flying ships.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 35 : Florida Man Steals Valuable from Crime Scene\nThe airstrip of Cauliflower City was located on the south, outside the city wall. Although it was called an airstrip, it was just an empty land, reserved for airship parking space.\nTwo cruiser-class battleships were stationed there, intimidating the visitors. Further south, a hundred smaller private ships parked in rows and columns. Servants of the ship owners stood around their vehicles, protecting them from thieves and opportunistic cultivators.\nAlthough the tension was high, no guard dared to stop one man from approaching his ship.\nOuyang Long flew over the city wall and arrived at the airstrip. He was embarrassed and frustrated to the point that he wanted to kill someone to vent his anger.\nThe previous servant rushed to the Ouyang Clan's private airship, telling the servants to get on board and activate the engine.\nOuyang Long landed on the deck. Afterward, he waved his hand, calling the previous servant over.\nThe servant rushed to his master's side.\nSWUA\nOuyang Long suddenly unsheathed his sword and beheaded the servant!\n\"This is for what you did!\"\nThe servant widened his eyes in shock. Tears rolled down from his eyes before his consciousness faded to black.\nOuyang Long turned to the other servants and cultivators on the ship. He commanded them.\n\"Listen up! If you don't want to become this guy, NEVER and I mean EVER report any sensitive information to me when I'm in public! Think about common sense!\"\n\"...\"\nThe servants had no idea what the dead guy had done. They bowed and sweated profusely, acknowledging the command. The captain hurried and launched the flying ship.\nOuyang Long snorted at the servants and informed them of his destination, \"To Magpie City.\"\nThe ship ascended to the sky and turned south. It picked up the speed and traveled at 700km/h.\nOuyang Long stood on the deck, refusing to rest inside the cabin. He was still frustrated by the earlier incident. As for the crew, they threw away the corpse and cleaned the deck's floor in a hurry.\nWHOOSH\nWhile the airship traveled south, heading toward the Magpie City, a lone cultivator on a flying sword flew by. Ouyang Long looked up to see the rude guy that dared to fly so close to his airship.\nThen, he discovered an acquaintance : Wu Buyi.\nWu Buyi also noticed Ouyang Long's presence. His flying sword made a U-Turn and came toward the airship. The alchemist jumped off his sword like a professional skateboarder and landed on the deck.\n\"What a coincidence, Lord Ouyang! I've been looking for you!\" Wu Buyi laughed and cupped his fist. Then, he glanced at the bloodstain on the deck.\nOuyang Long was not in a good mood. He spoke in a loud voice, \"What do you want? I have no business with the likes of you.\"\n\"Oh, my. How cold,\" Wu Buyi coughed several times. Then, he pulled out an inferior elixir grain pill that Leo had made. \"I'm here to put this treasure in an auction, and you're in charge of the Cauliflower City's auction house. Do you mind if we talk business?\"\nOuyang Long frowned. As an auction house's owner, he had an eye for treasures : He knew a technique that could identify every item that his customers brought out to sell in his auction house.\nThe elixir grain pill was authentic. Ouyang Long instantly noticed the five-element Qi inside the medicine ball. Although he was not well-versed in alchemy, Ouyang Long could tell that it was highly regarded among senior alchemists.\n\"You've come at bad timing. I have some business to attend to at Magpie City. If you need to put that item in my auction house, go ask my servant at my clan's pavilion.\"\nDespite seeing a precious pill, Ouyang Long waved his hand, trying to chase Wu Buyi out of his ship.\nWu Buyi didn't give up. He brought out a prosthetic eyeball and showed it to Ouyang Long.\n\"Are you sure? I have other precious items. Your servant will eat all the service fees, you know?\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"...\"\nOuyang Long hesitated. He wanted to go and find the culprit that killed his son first. However, half of him valued money more than the useless son's corpse.\nIn the end, Ouyang Long succumbed to his greed. He clicked his tongue and stomped toward Wu Buyi, \"What else do you have? Show them to me!\"\n\"Hehehe. I knew you would be interested. Here.\"\nWu Buyi proceeded to show a blade of immortal grass and a dozen elixir pills. Then, he observed Ouyang Long's reaction.\nHe was not disappointed. Ouyang Long's dilated pupils and round eyes glued to the pills and the immortal grass. The long-bearded man gulped and pointed at the pills.\n\"D-Did you make those?\"\n\"Of course not! I'm running an errand for another master alchemist.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nOuyang Long was stunned. He thought that Wu Buyi had come here to brag about his new pills and his wealth. But since Wu Buyi didn't create them, it posted new questions.I think you should take a look at\nWho made them?\nHow did Wu Buyi get those pills?\nRunning an errand?\nHis curiosity was ignited. Ouyang Long turned around and shouted at his servant.\n\"Turn the ship around! We're going back to Cauliflower City!\"\nThe servants' expressions were complicated, yet they followed their lord's instruction. They turned their ship around and flew back to the airstrip.\nWhile the ship was returning, Wu Buyi began soliciting Ouyang Long.\n\"You know, Lord Ouyang. I know a unique store near Magpie City. I'm sure you will find the store interesting if you see it.\"\n\"I'm not interested in small businesses.\"\n\"Aw. Don't be so bold. I know that you're always interested in rare herbs from the mystic worlds more than anyone. The store owner has so many rare herbs that he made grain pills with them.\"\n\"Not interested. If I want rare herbs, I can always get them for free every season.\"\nWu Buyi was disappointed. He gave up on Ouyang Long, \"Fine. Let's register my items in your auction house, and I'll go ask the others.\"\nOuyang Long snorted. He disliked competitors, so he had no intention of buying stuff from others. Every spirit stone was precious to him.\n\"Don't ever ask me to visit a store again. I'm not spending my precious spirit stones on something worthless.\"\n\"Even if they're immortal grass and a five-element elixir?\"\n\"It's going to cost an arm and a leg anyway. As I said, I'd rather find them for free in the mystic realms.\"\nWu Buyi burst into laughter as he had predicted the answer. Then, he dropped a bomb, \"The store owner doesn't ask for spirit stones though. He just wants our lifespan.\"\n\"...\"\nOuyang Long paused. Then, he frowned and repeated what he understood, \"So, you're saying, he doesn't sell his items for spirit stones, but he's asking for lifespan?\"\n\"Exactly! That's the charm of that store.\"\nOuyang Long was infuriated. He turned around and glared at Wu Buyi, \"Are you trading with an unorthodox cultivator?! Only evil sects practice one of those life force leeching techniques!\"\n\"Whoa, there,\" Wu Buyi took several steps back and raised his arms, trying to calm Ouyang Long down, \"You're misunderstanding something, Lord Ouyang. That person is not an unorthodox cultivator. I can vouch for that. He's an orthodox alchemist, just like me! Do you think evil cultivators can condense five elements? Look at these pills. The element Qi is so pure!\"\n\"...\"\nThe pill quality might be terrible, but the purity of the Qi was unquestionable. It was as Wu Buyi had said : The Qi was pure and pristine without a tinge of evil Qi, which was always left behind by unorthodox cultivators.\nOuyang Long was still skeptical about this shop owner. Thus, he continued to extract more information from the alchemist, learning more about his mysterious person.\n.\n.\nIn front of the alchemist workshop, Leo poured some of Ouyang Ting's blood into the cauldron and pressed the research button.\nDING\n<You have already discovered Yin Fluid.>\n\"Why is it Yin?! He's a dude, right? Did he swing that way?\"\nLeo clicked his tongue in disappointment as Ouyang Ting's blood ended up becoming Yin Fluid. Fortunately, it had a lot of usages, so Leo scooped the blood back into a storage bucket. Then, he hung the mutated corpse on a tree, draining its blood into a bucket.\nAs there were a lot of cleanups to do, Leo chose not to sleep tonight. He climbed the store to the roof and picked up the militated bodies of the assassins.\nLeo separated their clothes from the meat. He tossed the body parts to the backyard, so they would become cat food. As for the clothes, weapons, and belongings, Leo gathered them and arranged them in front of the alchemy workshop.\nThe rooftop clearing was easy but tedious as there were too many human parts to collect. The hard part was the other assassins as they died in a different location.\nLeo couldn't remember where they all went. Thus, he only used his instinct to search for their belongings. He managed to collect 13 sets of clothes and belongings. However, he couldn't find another runaway guy.\nAs the sun was about to go up, Leo gave up searching for the last corpse, hoping to clean his store before sunrise. He turned his attention to the store and peeled the weird yellow papers from the walls and the glass windows.\nAfter the yellow talismans had been removed, Leo stood in the backyard, looking at the pile of black clothes. He giggled, \"After I wash these, I'll have a lot of good rags to clean the store's floor, window, and stuff. They come at the right time.\"\nThe clothes could be recycled. However, the assassin's crossbows, swords, and daggers were the problem. As Leo had no use for them, he thought of a way to get rid of these weapons.\nThere were also interesting items that Leo got from the corpses. A total of 19 rings jiggled in his pocket.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 36 : Florida Man's Used Weed Sold for Millions\nAfter clearing the corpses and the crime scenes, Leo temporarily stopped creating or researching anything. He had another plan for the workshop.\nHaving 8,128 years of lifespan, Leo resumed the upgrade project. There were three things that he needed to do : Upgrade the workshop to level 3, upgrade the refrigerator to level 3, and build a new workshop to increase production.\nSpending 1,000 years of lifespan, Leo upgraded it to level 3 and increased the pill quality.\nRUMBLE\nThe building didn't change much except for the cauldron's appearance. The pot's clear surface had a rain dragon carving on it. The eyes of the dragon glittered as if it was looking at Leo, and it continuously emitted red smoke.\nLeo ignored the fancy-looking cauldron. He walked toward the newly cleared land and opened the shop domain map.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop (Second Building)\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 3\nPrice : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 10 x 10\n.\nAs the Humble General Store had already been upgraded to level 3, Leo could build the second alchemy workshop. He confirmed the system, spending 1,000 years of lifespan.\nThe second workshop was placed adjacent to the first one. Leo aligned it and place it next to the first workshop to save space.\nA new building appeared out of nowhere. It almost looked identical to the first workshop, but it looked older as it had never been upgraded.\nAs the new building came out as level 1, Leo could upgrade it twice. He spent additional 2,000 years of his lifespan upgrading the new workshop to level 3. As usual, he put all points to the quality.\nDING\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 3\nProduction Quality Level - (2/5)\n[Upgrade] : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nBoth workshops had the same status. While admiring the newly upgraded buildings, Leo widely grinned, proud of himself.\nWith two workshops, Leo could produce more grain pills. He threw iron pine nuts in the cauldrons, and let the cauldron run.\nAfter spending 4,000 years of lifespan, Leo turned his attention to refrigerators. A few days ago, he upgraded it to level 2 to enable its electricity. He wondered what level 3 fridges would improve.\nLeo entered the store and touched one of the showcase refrigerators. The shop domain system prompted him.\n<Upgrading this refrigerator costs 100 years of lifespan.>\nUpgrading electrical appliances were cheap. Leo was relieved.\n\"Do it!\"\nDING\nThe showcase refrigerator's appearance slightly changed. The stainless steel turned black, and the cold air was stronger. Just by standing in front of the showcase, Leo could feel the chilling temperature around it even though it contained two thousand blades of hot immortal grass inside.\nLeo was delighted. He upgraded the rest of the refrigerators. He had been enduring the hot and humid air for so long, so he welcomed the cool air from the fridges with open arms.\nAfter upgrading everything, Leo was left with 3,128 years of lifespan. He began searching for new buildings and upgrades for fun, playing with the shop domain menu. As soon as Leo checked the list, he found new locked system buildings.\n.\nWarehouse\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 5 x 5\n.\nSmall House\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 5 x 5\n.\nFarm Plot\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 10 x 10\n.\nStone Road\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 1 Year of Lifespan\nSpace : 1 x 1\n.\nAsphalt Road\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 3 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 1 x 1\n.\nConcrete Road\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 5 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 1 x 1\n.\nAs if the shop tried to tempt him, it showed the icons of each building. Looking at these icons, Leo thought of the ancient base-building games of his old world.I think you should take a look at\n'You're turning my life into a SIM game, my system. Well, it's not like I hate it. This is fun!'\nLeo's next goal was the [Farm Plot], which required 10x10 grids to build. Since it coincided with Leo's goal, he was interested in it. However, the Small House seemed strange as they seemed redundant to him. He wondered why it required 500 years of lifespan to build when he could just sleep anywhere in any building.\n'I understand what warehouses are for, but why a small house? I can sleep in the store. I don't need it.'\nLeo shrugged. He touched the wall of his store. Then, it prompted him with the upgrade cost.\n<Will you upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 4?>\n<Upgrading requires 3,000 years of lifespan.>\n\"...\"\nLeo almost vomited blood as the upgrade price increased again. Moreover, it demanded most of his precious lifespan. Although it was vexing, Leo grudgingly agreed and spent 3,000 years of lifespan, making the humble general level 4.\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 4.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nThe new buildings were unlocked. Unfortunately, Leo ran out of lifespan to spend. He could only look at the new icons and fantasized about what they could do.\nRUMBLE\nAs the store was upgraded, the interior space expanded again. The previously arranged refrigerators and shelves remained in the same place, but the walls were pushed away. Previously, the interior size was about 15x15 meters, after the upgrade, it became 20x20. The 10 fridges and six aisle shelves seemed too few for the wide area.\nWHOO\nLeo heard a sound of an air conditioner. He looked up and found an air duct ventilation system on the ceiling. Cold wind circulated in the store building, and the air wasn't as stale as before.\n\"Wow.\"\nAdmiring the store's enlarged space for a while, Leo remembered something. He turned around and looked at the back of the store.\nThe staff door was still there and was expanded. Leo entered it and discovered that his bed was in the middle of the room instead of being at the corner. Unfortunately, it didn't have a toilet as usual. Leo was disappointed.\n'I guess I'll get stuck with the ancient outhouse system for a while. Should I build a small house for a toilet? Hmm...'\nAfter running out of things to upgrade, Leo lost enthusiasm. He took off his clothes and threw himself on the bed.\n*JIGGLE*\nThe 19 rings were still in the pants pocket. Leo forgot about them as he was mentally exhausted.\n.\n.\n= Grand Elder Pagoda, Top Floor =\nThree elders sat at a table, looking at a kneeling deacon. The latter was a servant of Ouyang Ting, who also visited Leo's store along with Han Hao. However, because of his leaked info, Ouyang Ting knew about the place.\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman glared at the deacon, listening to his confession.\n\"Let me summarize your report,\" Han Hao snorted. \"You told Ouyang Ting about Daoist Florida Man's store, and that brat brought his men there to assassinate him for treasures!?\"\n\"Y-Yes, grand elder.\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman deeply sighed. They finally understood what had happened.\nHan Meng snickered, \"Good riddance. He never showed respect to us. He thought that he could kill every stronger cultivator with his goons, and he has been monopolizing cultivation resources by robbing other disciples. Now that he's gone, the competitive scenes between the inner disciples should be healthier.\"\nTiger Swordsman nodded, \"True. Many good seedlings were destroyed because of Ouyang Ting. Now that he's gone, those that are in hiding can come out.\"\nAlthough the two elders were glad that Ouyang Ting died, Han Hao was concerned. He reminded them of the issues at hand.\n\"And what are we going to explain to Ouyang Long? Tell him the truth and sell out Daoist Florida Man?\"\n\"...\"\nThe two elders closed their mouths. They couldn't imagine which of the two soul formation cultivators would survive if they clashed. Moreover, the Sword Saint Forest was a sacred place for newbie swordsmen. If it was ruined because of them, the cultivators and commoners would blame Life Sword Sect as they were the guardian of that place.\nHan Hao leaned back and downed the snake wine in his cup. He voiced his thoughts.\n\"If we play tricks to protect Daoist Florida Man, the Jianghu Alliance will point their swords at us. But since Ouyang Ting is at fault for provoking a senior, we will simply tell Ouyang Long the truth behind Ouyang Ting's death. If possible, we'll help Daoist Florida Man negotiate with Ouyang Long and retrieve that brat's corpse. Is that alright with you two?\"\nHan Meng and Tiger Swordsman had no issues. Compromising in this situation was the best answer since none of them were the culprits. As for Ouyang Long's wrath, they could only pray that Leo could handle the angry father without their help.\n\"Come to think of it,\" Tiger Swordsman looked at the deacon. \"What should we do with this guy?\"\nAs Han Meng handled the Justice System of the sect, he was the only one who could sentence deacons and elders to prison. He looked at the employee, \"That depends on the outcome of the aftermath. If everything turns out well, one year of salary deduction is enough. But if things affect the sect and the city, that's 10 years imprisonment at the minimum.\"\nThe deacon was shocked, \"T-Ten years?!\"\n\"Property damage is 10 years imprisonment, not including the fine. Being an accomplice gets you the same punishment! Since you bowed your head to that brat for spirit stones and social status, you're an accomplice of Ouyang Ting and Ouyang Long. If Ouyang Long somehow damages the city or harms the commoners, we will prosecute you since you're the cause of all this mess!\"\n\"T-That's not fair! I-I just told him about Daoist Florida Man! Also, I confessed. I'm a witness!\"\n\"Leaking sensitive information is a crime, junior. Let's pray that Ouyang Long won't go berserk over this incident. If better, pray that Daoist Florida Man can suppress Ouyang Long's wrath. If not, your head might roll.\"\n\"...\"\nThe deacon lowered his head, accepting his fate even though the sect's law was one-sided.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, at Cauliflower City, a certain alchemist brightly smiled and stood in front of three old men from the Jianghu Alliance in their courtyard. Next to him, Ouyang Long stared at the three old men with a dark expression as he couldn't believe his eyes.\n\"500 million spirit stones.\"\n\"550 million!\"\n\"570 million!\"\nThese three old men were from three different alchemy sects, and they were bidding to get their hands on a single blade of immortal grass.\n\"700 million!\"\n\"Tsk!\"\n\"Dammit!\"\nFinally, one of them overbid, and their competitors resigned.\nOuyang Long coughed and glanced at Wu Buyi, \"No more bidding, sold for 700 million!\"\nWu Buyi cackled. He wanted to see their reactions when they realized that Leo had over two thousand immortal grasses.\n\"Alright. Next item, 5-element grain pill! I'm sure you all know the significance of a five-element pill since no one has successfully made them before. If you get your hands on this, you might, no, you WILL learn a lot by studying it! I have 20 of them on me, and I'll be selling a batch of eight and two batches of six. The highest bidder gets the batch of eight pills. The rest get six. Now, you should calculate carefully before you bid because you can only bid once!\"\nThe three elder alchemists stared at Wu Buyi with burning eyes. They clicked their tongues and brought out a paper and a brush from their spatial rings. Then, they started writing their offer without showing them to their colleagues.\nOuyang Long deeply sighed. He waited for the transaction to finish as he would get a 15% cut of this private auction. While he was managing this small event, he kept thinking of what Wu Buyi had told him.\n'This fool said the mysterious grandmaster alchemist lives outside of Magpie City. Come to think of it, Ting'er attacked someone in a forest. Does that place near the Magpie City?'\nOuyang Long narrowed his eyes, imagining various scenarios. He suspected that the murderer and the mysterious alchemist were the same person.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 37 : Neighbor Stops Florida Man from Turning National Treasure into Furniture\n\"Oh, I must warn you. If you're thinking you're smart because you only bid one or two spirit stones to get six elixir pills from me, you won't get any. The minimum bid is 600 million spirit stones! Any lower, and I won't sell you any!\"\nWu Buyi snickered and warned the three old alchemists. The three elders clicked their tongues and tore the papers. Then, they brought out a new set of writing papers.\nOuyang Long shook his head as these old foxes had the same idea. Had he been in their shoes, he would have used the same technique to get the elixir pills for cheap. Unfortunately, Wu Buyi was also a cunning fox and a professional alchemist in this field. Nobody could outsmart him in his games.\nWhile waiting for the old alchemists to finish, Ouyang Long whispered to Wu Buyi as he was curious about Leo.\n\"Hey, brat. About your new master, is he a soul formation cultivator?\"\nWu Buyi widely grinned, \"Of course. He's as strong as you. Actually, his foundation is more profound. He doesn't have the domineering and suppressive aura like you, but he can definitely use all five element essence!\"\nOuyang Long narrowed his eyes. He confirmed another coincidence - The mysterious cultivator that slaughtered the Hound Squad was a soul formation cultivator!\n'I have a feeling that they're the same person. Did Ting'er offend him or did he try to steal his pills? Was he an idiot?!'\nHis expression was so dark that he didn't know if he should be angry or ashamed of his son. Still, even if his son was in the wrong, Ouyang Long believed that it was inappropriate for a soul formation senior to kill junior cultivators as it violated the unspoken Jianghu traditions : No senior should bully, harm, or kill a junior as conflicts might escalate. If everybody selfishly slaughtered every junior, the cultivation world would have been in chaos as nobody could cultivate in peace.\nUsing this belief as a core, Ouyang Long concluded that Leo was in the wrong. No matter how rude his son was, he didn't deserve to die!\n'It doesn't matter! No matter how strong his foundation is, an alchemist can't possibly defeat a true martial artist. If he's weaker than me, I'll cripple him and force him to be a pill slave for my clan for the rest of eternity! If he's stronger than me, I'll pressure these old alchemists to excommunicate him from the three alchemy sects! He needs to compensate me for my boy's death!'\n.\n.\n10 AM of the next day, Leo crawled out of his bed. He put on his clothes and dragged his feet out of the store to wash his face and cook some late breakfast. Fortunately, no one visited the store in the early morning or late morning. He got the time for himself to sort things out.\nHowever, Leo soon discovered an issue - Leo ran out of edible wolf meat. Without meat, he had no other food except vegetables, bananas, and other fruits.\nHe looked at the showcase refrigerator and stared at the immortal grass. He wondered if he should continue eating them. While contemplating his future, the corner of his eyes found the grain pills on the aisle shelves.\nHe had two choices : Grain pills or grass.\n\"Grass or pills... grass or pills... pills or veggies... I HATE VEGGIES!\"\nLeo hesitated. He knew that eating mutated fruits, vegetables, or grass would grant him some lifespan. However, Leo had been eating meat every day, and his current palate found it difficult to eat vegetables or grasses.\nHis stomach desired meat!\nLeo turned toward the grain pills. They could fill his stomach for a couple days, and they would get rid of the hunger issues. But again, it would hinder Leo's lifespan gain for two days.\n\"Argh! Fine. No grain pills! I'll eat some fruit instead! REJECT HUMANITY! RETURN TO MONKE!\"\nLeo stomped toward one of the fridges. He picked a gold banana and started eating them. After downing four bananas, Leo burped, having enough food for the morning.\nFrom a cow to a dog-eater, from a dog-eater to a monkey, Leo wondered if he would become something else tomorrow.\nHe checked his lifespan status next, wondering how many years he got from the bananas.\n<Your Current Lifespan: 148 Years...>\nIt was 128 after Leo had spent everything last night. Four bananas increased his lifespan by 20, which was equal to what the elixir grain pill offered.\nLeo snorted as he believed that it was the right decision. He had plenty of fruits, so it would have been a waste not to eat or use them as alchemy ingredients.\nAfter the meal, Leo resumed working. He visited the two workshops to collect the newly made grain pills. Each pot gave him 30 pills of various elements. The majority of the pills were still Metal Grain Pills, but their quality got better.\nThe metal element ones came out as medium-grade instead of low-grade. As for the other elements, they came out as low-grade pills. Even the five-element elixir grain pill came out as low quality.\nLooking at the new batches of pills, Leo wondered what kind of unique pills would come out after he upgraded it to the quality to the max.\nAs the store lacked products and grain pills, Leo queued for another batch of grain pills. Then, he visited the storeroom in the workshop to check the other fruits or vegetables to sell in his store.\nThe mutated fruits and vegetables were still there. Although they sat here for days, they still looked fresh and moist.\nLeo carried a large bamboo basket of Bloodmelons, aka mutated watermelons, to the store and put them at the center of the store, near the front door.\nLeo gazed at the Bloodmelons, wondering how much he should sell them for.\n.\n[Bloodmelon]\nCan only be found in Blood Swamps of demon-infested mystic realms. The melons grow from absorbing blood from the swamps, and their juice is filled with demonic Qi and Yin Energy. It is one of many fruits that Vampires and plant monsters are very fond of. Can be used as a water element catalyst.\n[Traits]\nIncrease water element Qi and demonic Qi by 10 years' worth of cultivation (If consumed)\nIncrease water-based pill's success chance by 30%. (If used in alchemy)\n.\nSince it gave 10 years' worth of Qi, Leo believed that it could be sold for about 20-50 years of lifespan. Also, he believed that it could be used as a lure to attract certain types of monsters.\nTesting its effectiveness, Leo brought one of the Bloodmelons outside. He then rolled it like a bowling ball in the front yard.\n\"MEOW <3\"\nIt only took Cat two seconds to jump from the roof to the front yard. It snatched the Bloodmelon and jumped to the store's roof. Despite not being able to eat anything for 48 hours, it still hogged the melon.\n\"...\"\nLeo stared at Cat, speechless. It seemed that the Bloodmelons were effective lures for plant monsters.\nAs the experiment was successful, Leo returned to the store and calculated the price. He wrote [50] on the label. Although it might be overpriced and might not sell, Leo could still use it as a catalyst in the future or directly consume it as a snack.\nAfter arranging the placement of the basket, aisle shelves, and fridges, Leo picked a broom and swept the store. But before he could even start doing the chore, he heard the voice of Cat from the rooftop.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nThat didn't sound pleasant to hear. It also said this whenever it saw strangers or visitors.\n\"Ah, crap. Here we go again.\"\nLeo toss away the broom and exited the store through the front door. He turned around and looked at Cat, who was still sitting on the roof and staring at the visitors.\n\"No food! They're not food!\"\n\"No Nom-Nom?\"\n\"NO NOM-NOM!\"\n\"Meow...\"\nCat was crestfallen. It turned around and returned to its favorite spot.\nLeo deeply sighed and grumbled. Again, Cat had eaten a grain pill, yet he extorted food from visitors. Its gluttonous nature was troublesome.\nAfter dealing with Cat, Leo turned his attention to the visitors. Surprisingly, he found a couple of familiar faces - Two of which used to visit this place before. One was a deacon that came with Han Hao. As for the other guy, he was the first customer of Leo.\nGao Yan brightly smiled and cupped his fist. He deeply bowed, \"Greetings, senior! I heard about your store, and I hope I can buy some of your rare herbs again!\"\n\"...\"\nLeo stroked his beard and deeply nodded. He had already forgotten about the guy. However, as he stated that he wanted his herbs AGAIN, Leo managed to remember him.I think you should take a look at\n\"Ah, Gao Yan wasn't it?\"\nHe activated the shop domain system and allowed everybody to see their lifespans. Leo also rechecked Gao Yan's status.\n.\nName: Gao Yan\nAge: 16\nLifespan: 202 Years, 3 Months, 18 Days, 4 Hours, and 10 Minutes\n.\nAs for the other disciples, they were pale in comparison. They had about 120 to 150 years.\nLeo believed that Gao Yan had about 120ish years when he first met him. But now, he had over 200 years in stock. He wondered what he did to gain 80 years of lifespan during the past weeks.\nThe deacon stated his business. \"Senior, I've brought more customers. Please allow us to purchase your pills again.\"\nLeo smiled and opened the front door for them, \"Come inside.\"\n\"Thank you very much!\"\nThe deacon gestured for everybody to enter the store. Everybody also saluted Leo and prepared to enter the store in excitement.\nOn the other hand, Gao Yan looked behind him and gazed at the piles of lumber. For an unknown reason, his Qi resonated with the woods.\n\"Senior, what are those?\" Gao Yan pointed at the roughly processed lumbers. Everybody stopped and turned around to see what the famous alchemist-to-be was interested in and gazed at the lumber pile.\nLeo pursed his lips. They were useless woods that he had planned to change into furniture in the future. He didn't mind selling some to his first customer.\n\"Those? They're Iron Pine Wood.\"\n\"Iron Pine... Wood?!\" Gao Yan's eyes gleamed. He remembered the term as he remembered reading about it in an encyclopedia.\n\"Yes. Do you need those?\"\nGao Yan nodded, \"Yes, senior! I can use them as charcoal for alchemy. They are metal-based, right? It will be a big help when I refine difficult pills that require metal essence. Actually, I can upgrade non-element pills into metal element pills with metal-based charcoals.\"\nLeo raised his brow. He had no clue what Gao Yan was talking about as he didn't need charcoal or firewood to make pills. After all, he only needed to spit a few times to supplement the cauldron with all elemental essence.\n\"Well, sure. How much will you need?\"\n\"One log-worth is enough, senior. Umm, how much is it? Are they expensive? I believe they're very rare.\"\n\"...\"\nLeo looked around him. He wondered if Gao Yan was blind as the iron pine trees were everywhere around here.\n'He probably doesn't know. Well, the barks are all black, but these lumbers have already been peeled. Meh, it doesn't matter. I won't take advantage of him. 10 years is enough.'\nLeo coughed and declared the price, \"Only for you, 10 years per a log's worth of lumber. Want it?\"\nGao Yan was delighted, \"Yes, please!\"\nLeo didn't think much. He grabbed a log of processed lumber and placed it in front of Gao Yan. The latter's lifespan instantly decreased by 10 years. One year went to the deacon while Leo got 9 years of lifespan.\nGao Yan happily touched the lumber. He unsheathed his sword and tried to chop it.\nCLANK\nHis sword broke in one hit.\nGao Yan: \"...\"\nEverybody: \"...\"\nGao Yan's face reddened in embarrassment. He shyly sheathed his broken sword. Then, he bowed to Leo, \"S-Senior. If it's possible, could you help me chop them into smaller pieces? I can't bring them home like this. They are too heavy for me.\"\nLeo inwardly questioned Gao Yan about how he would carry everything home. He lifted it with one hand and flipped it around to weigh it. Judging from his feeling, the entire lumber was about five thousand pounds.\nSince it might be too heavy for the teenager, Leo helped him. He put it back on the ground. Using only his bare hand, he karate-chopped, cutting the log into 10 blocks of lumber.\nGao Yan and the disciples watched Leo in awe and respect. The deacon was also interested in the wood and touched its surface. As soon as he touched it, he sensed the overwhelming metal element Qi inside.\n\"T-This is...\"\nThe deacon realized what the lumber was. He was stunned.\n\"I-Isn't this tougher than steel?! Wait. Isn't this sacred wood?! ARE ALL OF THESE SACRED WOODS?!\"\n\"EH?!\" Gao Yan was stunned.\nLeo rolled his eyes. He went into the store and grabbed a cubic block of sacred wood. He placed it in front of the store to show the deacon, \"Y'all need to refine it first before it can become sacred wood. This block is the real sacred wood. As for those, they're just iron lumber.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\nThe deacon touched the surface of the sacred wood block. He gasped in excitement, \"S-Senior! I'll buy this! How much?!\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. As he had learned from his past mistakes, he chose to probe for information first before he named the price.\n\"What do you need it for?\"\n\"Are you kidding, senior?! I know many top blacksmiths on the continent. This is the finest material to make a holy weapon! It doesn't matter if it turns out to be a wooden sword. It can instantly kill every type of undead monster in one hit!\"\nLeo raised his brow. He glanced at the raw iron lumber and wondered if he should make more of these sacred wood blocks. Then, he thought of the making process.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe : Sacred Wood]\nOne Iron Pine Lumber\nWood and Metal Essence\n.\nIt didn't need a lot of material : Any piece of iron pine lumber that could fit in the cauldron was enough. Moreover, it only took 10 minutes to make. The only downside of this item was the labor as Leo had to manually uproot the trees, cut the branches, and peel the bark by hand.\nThinking of the tedious labor, Leo jacked the price.\n\"100 years. Want it? You have the 10% discount since you're affiliated with the store, so that will only cost you 90 years.\"\n\"T-This...\"\nThe deacon gulped. He took several deep breaths, contemplating if he should purchase it.\nWhile the deacon contemplated his choice, Gao Yan asked Leo, \"Senior, sir. If I remember correctly, it takes a whole year of dedication and hard work for an alchemist to refine this rare lumber into sacred wood. Is that true?\"\nLeo held back his laughter. It took 10 minutes of idle refining as the workshop automatically made it for him. He grinned and messed with Gao Yan, \"That was nothing. I made it during my free time. I was planning to turn it into a chair or something. From what I learned, sacred wood is a good material for furniture.\"\n\"F-Furniture?!\" The deacon almost vomited blood. \"P-Please don't turn it into furniture! I'll buy it! I'll buy it!\"\nLeo stroked his beard and widely smiled. Once again, he managed to get rid of unused items in his store for lifespan.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 38 : Florida Man Discovers New Shrooms Species in His Pocket\nAfter collecting the deacon's lifespan, Leo invited them into the store. Everybody entered the building first, but Gao Yan remained behind. The latter rubbed an emerald ring on his middle finger, and it shone.\nWHOOSH\nThe 10 pieces of iron pine lumber vanished into the ring!\nLeo saw that. He rubbed his chin and thought of the rings in his pocket.\n'What are the rings? Rings of Power? Rings of Magic? Ah, right. Some kind of inventory or Doraemon's 4th dimension pocket, maybe?'\nLeo wished to inquire Gao Yan about it. However, before he could do it, the people inside the store suddenly ran out and looked at the building. Then, they went inside and made a loud noise, distracting Leo.\n\"SPATIAL DISTORTION?!\"\n\"I-Is this the legendary spatial array?! Isn't this what the people experience in the mystic realms?!\"\n\"I heard only the elusive Soul Transformation cultivators can tamper a large space. T-This is awesome!\"\nThe disciples speculated while they admired the spacious interior of the store. They forgot about their purposes here.\nLeo lightly snorted and shook his head. He found them odd.\n'There's a guy with a strange ring that can make large objects disappear over here. Why are they surprised because my store is bigger than it looks? Man, cultivators are weird.'\nHe planned to research the rings later. For now, he had to attend to the customers.\nAfter admiring the store enough, the disciples began inspecting the vegetables, immortal grass, and pills. As usual, most of them purchased two metal element pills, except Gao Yan.\nGao Yan didn't care for metal element grain pills. He grabbed 15 wood element pills at once.\nLeo frowned at Gao Yan. As the leftover inferior-grade pills would cost him 150 years, he wondered if this guy was sane.\n\"Boy, you will have 40 years lifespan remaining. Are you sure you want to buy those?\"\nGao Yan snickered, \"My master hasn't refined the immortal grass that I got from you yet, senior. I can gain my years back after eating the immortal pills. Also, if my cultivation base rises, my lifespan will go up naturally, right? I learned it from the sect's library!\"\n\"...\"\nSince Gao Yan looked like a smart hardworking kid, Leo hoped that he would succeed one day. He agreed to sell the wood grain pills to the boy. Afterward, the others also paid for the goodies.\nGao Yan and the group didn't linger in the store after the purchases. They bid farewell and returned home happy as they got rare cultivation resources for them to use. The deacon received 53 years of lifespan in total as a commission as the total transaction was 530 years of lifespan.\nLeo gained 477 years in total after the cut. After sending the group off, Leo closed the store's door and hummed, resuming his chore. He also checked the shelves if some of the pills needed to be restocked.\nLife was good. Leo hoped that every day could be peaceful and quiet like this in the future.\n*JIGGLE*\nWhile Leo was sweeping the store with a broom, the rings in his pockets jiggled again. He paused and pulled out a ring to inspect.\nIt was a ruby ring. The gemstone was slightly small, but the workmanship was world-class as it glittered under the sunlight like a diamond.\nThinking of what Gao Yan did to his ring, Leo mimicked him. He rubbed the ruby several times as if he was caressing Djinn's lamp.\nFive minutes later, nothing happened.\nLeo furrowed his eyebrows, confused. Trying harder, he swiped his index fingertip on his tongue and touched the ring with it.\nCRACK\nThe gemstone and the ring cracked. However, countless streaks of light shot out from the ruby like a water fountain. The lights transformed into ten thousand objects, rolling and piling on the floor. Then, the ring crumbled into dust.\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nLeo was speechless. He looked at the random junk on the floor and picked a blue marble stone among 50 thousand balls around him. Then, he brought it closer to his eyes.\nThis blue ball emitted blue smoke. Leo sniffed at it.\nIt smelled like ocean wind mixed with vapor from boiled water.\nPIKI\nAfter holding the marble stone for a few seconds, it changed color from blue to black. Leo tilted his head, wondering if this material just mutated. Interested in the object, Leo carried it to the workshop cauldron and waited there.\nAfter the cauldron finished making a new batch of pills, Leo collected the goodies and tossed the black stone in there. Then, he pressed the research button to get some information.\nDING\n<You have discovered Essence Stone!>\n.\n[Essence Stone]\nCan be found underground in any mystic realm. Unlike spirit stones, it contains a great amount of Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Qi.\n[Traits]\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 10 years' worth of cultivation. (Consumption)\n[Alchemy Recipe : Soul Stone]\n1,000 Essence Stones\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Catalyst\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Essence\n.\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo found something weird again. He scratched his head in confusion and returned to the store.\nLooking at the piles of random scraps on the floor, Leo regretted playing with the ruby ring. He deeply sighed and purchased plastic bins to store the items.\nLeo didn't think much. He gathered the blue stones in one bin. Random clean clothes, except loincloths and underwear, were arranged to the side as he might try them on later. Bolts and arrows were put into the second bin.\nThen, there were strange books with Chinese words. Although the shop domain automatically translated everybody's speech into English, it didn't translate written words.I think you should take a look at\n'Goddammit. I need a full translation function. Rather, is there anything that can make me learn an ancient Chinese language with a click?'\nLeo searched his online store system for Chinese linguistic ability, hoping for a miracle.\nDING\nA list showed up. However, everything was pricy.\n[Universal Auto-Speech Translation] : 1,000,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Universal Linguistic Knowledge] : 5,000,000,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Goblin Linguistic Knowledge] - 100,000,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Cathulhu Linguistic Knowledge] - 100,000,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Canine Linguistic Knowledge] - 100,000,000 Years of Lifespan\nSkimming through the list of linguistic skills, Leo was glad that he wasn't thrown into one of the weird planets, such as goblin or cathulhu ones.\nAs the list was too long, Leo opened the filter menu and narrowed it down to only the Chinese language or anything related.\nDING\n[Divine Shang Language Auto-Speech Translation] : 20,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Divine Shang Language Reading Comprehension Knowledge] : 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nInstead of showing as Chinese, the language was called \"Divine Shang\". Finally, they looked affordable. Still, even the cheapest knowledge cost 10,000 years of lifespan.\nLeo looked at the moon rune language on the book cover for a moment and tossed them to the third plastic bin.\n\"Meh, I can't read it now. I swear I'll read them someday. Next...\"\nAside from the book, there were other scrolls and bundles of talisman papers. Leo threw scrolls and books into the third bin while the talismans went to the fourth container.\nOnce the small stones, the arrows, and the books were sorted, the store looked a lot cleaner. However, miscellaneous items, such as bottles of pills, sealed wine jars, throwing knives, and random weaponry remained.\nLeo threw the weapons to the backyard, where he had collected swords and crossbows. Then, he turned his attention to the pills next. Opening the lid and pouring the content out, Leo found something familiar. As he had made so many pills, he instantly recognized its features and texture.\nThese were compressed rice balls, aka the regular grain pills. They contained no value.\nAs Leo didn't need the rice balls, he played with them. Leo spat on the small pills.\n*SIZZLE*\nAll grain balls turned white, and they started to rot. Strangely, mushrooms grew from the pills.\nAs usual, Leo laughed at his weird creation. He brought the sample to the workshop and threw one in the pot for research.\nDING\n<You have discovered Sweet Dream Mushroom Seed!>\n.\n[Sweet Dream Mushroom Seed]\nThis is a seed of the notorious mushroom that once terrorized the Jianghu 500 years ago. It can be grown in any place with thick Qi, and it's resilient to temperature changes. However, it is not advised to domesticate it unless your mental strength is the same as Buddha's. Can be used as a catalyst for every element.\n.\n\"MUSHROOM, YOU SAY?!\"\nLeo chortled. As a cultured man, he was overjoyed.\n\"Hoh, boy. The cultivation world is so much fun!\"\nNo one was there to retort Leo - No martial artist in this world cultivated mushrooms, especially the ones with dubious names. Also, Leo completely ignored the important warning.\nThe crazy Florida Man rushed back into his store and mutated all the non-element grain pills into moldy mushroom seeds. He carried them in his arms as if they were precious treasures and brought them to the second workshop's building.\nAs this building was empty, he chose it as a place to cultivate mushrooms. He put all the rotten pills there and opened the shopping menu. He purchased a hundred shelves and pots, spending 200 years of his lifespan. Then, he ran around, digging mutated soil around the store and filling the small pots.\nAfter filling the pots with mutated soil, Leo buried the rotten pills in there, two for each tank. Then, he watered them, giving the dirt enough moisture. Then, he cut some holes in the sides of the pots, allowing the shrooms to come out from there. Although Leo had no idea how to grow shrooms, he proceeded with it as he had nothing to lose.\n*JIGGLE*\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm While working, the remaining 18 rings in his pocket jiggled. Leo patted his pants and widely grinned.\nHe would be very busy today.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan, the deacon, and the group traveled to the sect.\nOn the way home, Gao Yan was absentminded. He thought of the ingredients in the store, wondering how he would use them to concoct pills in the future if he could.\nAs Gao Yan daydreamed, he accidentally stepped on something slippery and fell on his butt.\nThe group heard about the fall of Gao Yan. They turned around and laughed at him.\n\"Gao Yan, you're our future alchemist. Why are you so clumsy? How can we entrust you to make cultivation pills if you clumsily explode cauldrons?\" The deacon jeered.\nGao Yan pouted and pushed the ground, getting ready to stand. However, his hands touched something that wasn't supposed to be there. He turned around to see what he sat on.\nIt was a pile of ash and black clothes. A crossbow, a sword, a spatial ring, and a token of Hound Squad were there.\n\"Huh?\"\nAs Gao Yan picked up a spatial ring from the ground, the others noticed the black clothes and the items.\n\"What are those?\"\nThe deacon picked up the token of the Hound Squad. He flipped it around and frowned.\nThere was a signature of the Ouyang Clan behind the token.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 39 – Florida Man's \"Cat\" Feeds on National Treasures\n\"Spatial ring?\"\nGao Yan picked up a spatial ring from the pile of assassin's ash. He cheerfully laughed and tried to access it.\nPIKI\nUnfortunately, as soon as Gao Yan inserted his Qi into the ring, it released a strong electric current, repelling Gao Yan's Qi and zapping him.\n\"Ouch!\"\nThe deacon noticed that Gao Yan got his hands on the spatial ring. He warned the alchemist trainee.\n\"Be careful with the no-name spatial rings. A strong cultivator usually locks their rings with their element essence or Qi. Unless you're stronger than the ring's owner, its residual Qi will repel you and might kill you on the spot.\"\nGao Yan and the other disciples were surprised. The former looked at his spatial ring, which he had gotten as a gift from Wu Buyi. He wondered if he could lock it, too.\n\"Senior, how do you unlock or lock a spatial ring?\"\nThe deacon coughed, \"Simple. When your strength is at the golden core stage, you can start using complex Qi threads to form an array spell. There are a thousand lock techniques that you can learn from the sect's library. Only if you understand the techniques, you can unlock someone else's rings, granted that you manage to memorize ten thousand locking techniques on the mainland.\"\n\"… Wow,\" everybody was flabbergasted by the profound of the lock techniques. They wondered if they could learn all of them and unlock the no-name rings.\nTeasing the disciples enough, the deacon revealed a hidden technique, \"But that's a very troublesome method. Unless you want to preserve the rings and the content inside, you can do so. But if you're like me and other elders, we simply inject our Qi or essence into it and destroy the locking spell inside. Then, all items in there will be ejected from the ring. You just have to be stronger than the ring owner as I mentioned earlier.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"Be warned though. If the ring has a large inventory space, you might find yourself buried in a mountain of items. In the past, a sick bastard store an entire mansion in his ring, and it was stolen. The thief overrode the locking spell and got himself buried under the mansion alive. It's a risky method. Be sure to unlock the ring in an open space while you're hovering in the sky. Let the items fall under you, not on top of you.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan's hands trembled as he imagined himself being crushed under a mountain of heavy items in the ring. He put it in his pocket, waiting to ask Wu Buyi to unlock it for him later on.\nThe deacon silently collected the clothes of the assassin. He kept the clan token and urged, \"Let's move. We need to return to the sect before nightfall. Oh, I almost forgot. The sect now forbids everybody from collecting the spirit grasses around here. Senior Florida Man might be growing them, and we don't want to provoke him.\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir.\"\nGao Yan and the disciples gulped as they looked at the grasses around them. They were all blue, and they emitted strong spiritual energy. Everybody wanted to pick them up, but the deacon glared at them.\nWithout permission, the group swallowed their greed and continued their journey home.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo had fun.\nCHING-CHING-CHING\nAfter cleaning the mess in his store, Leo played with more rings, wondering if he could get more items. Blue stones and similar items gushed out from the rings, and they were destroyed in the process. Leo sorted all items and repeated until the last ring.\nWhen everything was over, Leo looked at thirty 2000-liter bins, full of blue stones. He clicked his tongue and pushed the wheeled bins through the back door, bringing them to the storehouse in the first workshop. As for the regular grain pills that he got from other rings, he brought them to the second workshop and left them there for the time being.\n.\nThe next day morning, Leo came out to check his mushroom farm in the second workshop building, and he was pleasantly surprised - The surface of the soil was all white. At this rate, they would grow up into fine mushrooms soon. Every pot was the same. The black soil turned white as the mushroom spores rapidly grew and consumed its nutrition.\nCelebrating this occasion, Leo added more spit to every pot, hoping that his fluid contained enough nutrition for the unknown mushrooms. He wondered if it would taste like Truffles.\n\"Grow up quickly, okay? Even if you're zombie cordyceps, I can still eat you. Actually, I ate them a lot when my age was still 4 digits. I'm immune to your zombie fungi. Hehehehe.\"\nLeo left the mushroom farm alone. He exited through the front door and collected two more batches of grain pills.\nCarrying the grain pills to the store, Leo put them into the same Tupperware boxes on the shelves. He also separated the leftover inferior and lesser-grade ones into other boxes and placed them near the Bloodmelons.\nAs the newly made batches were better in quality, Leo decided to get rid of the old pills by selling them a bit cheaper than the other pills.\nThe new low-graded pills were all sold for 20 years of lifespan each. However, as for the old ones, Leo retained the old price, aka 10 years of lifespan.\nAfter sorting the new products, Leo returned to the workshop. Instead of making more grain pills, he carried the iron pine lumber there and chopped them into 1-cubic-foot blocks. Then, he tossed one into each cauldron and refined them.\n10 minutes later, two sacred wood blocks came out. The edges had been sharpened, and the size expanded to one cubic meter.\nLeo hummed as he threw more lumber cubes into the cauldrons and let them run. Then, he carried the two blocks of sacred wood and lined them in front of his store, displaying his wealth, hoping to lure some thieves into attacking this store again.\nAfter making 20 blocks of sacred wood, Leo was bored. He switched the products to rejuvenate juice so that he could get something delicious to drink. He also thought of the corianders, which he had been using to make coffee.\nLeo finally remembered that he had forgotten to research them.\n\"Ah, silly me. I should have done that several days ago. I'm getting old.\"\nLeo waited for ten minutes. After collecting his favorite root beer, he tossed a stalk of coriander to check its usefulness.\n.\n[Aroma Coriander]\nAroma Corianders are a common weed, commonly found in Unicorn-infested areas. As the corianders constantly gain nutrition from the unicorn's stool, they produce a similar scent to the stool. Although they feed on dubious resources, many humans may find them flagrant and use them as garnish to dress their food. Can be used as an Earth Element catalyst in alchemy.\n[Traits]I think you should take a look at\nContain strong caffeine. Might rupture some blood veins if it's consumed directly.\n.\nIt was just another catalyst. Still, as Leo didn't plan to sleep tonight, he picked one and put it in his mouth, checking how much he could get from eating this plant.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year.>\nLeo was disappointed.\n'Not suitable in cooking. I guess I'll keep using them as coffee beans.'\nHe resumed making rejuvenate root beer and walked toward the field, east of the store building.\n.\n.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nWhile Leo was busy at the workshop, Cat played with a sacred wood block in front of the store as it found the cubes interesting. It tried sitting on it and hitting it with its whips.\nBOOM\nAs clumsy as a cat, Cat made an accident - One of the sacred wood blocks was broken in half.\n\"Myaaa?!\"\nCat panicked, afraid that Leo might scold it. It grabbed the broken pieces and tried to patch them together. However, it kept failing.\nAs all hope was lost, Cat used a drastic measure - It copied Leo's actions by spitting on the wooden block and attaching the pieces like jigsaw puzzles.\nAs Cat clumsily tried to repair things without knowledge, its roots got stuck in the middle of the broken sacred wood block.\n\"MYAAA?!\"\nShocked and confused, Cat ran around with the sacred wood block in tow like a panicking cat with a plastic bag getting stuck on its hind leg. It ran into the forest and hit many things on its path.\nBy the time that Cat came back to its sense, the wooden block was gone. However, Cat sensed something odd about its roots. It looked down to see the weird roots that had been itchy.\nThe root merged with the broken sacred wood cube, turning it white.\n\"Meow?\"\nCat tilted its head and swung the root around. It pierced an iron pine tree nearby. A few seconds later, the tree withered and dissipated into dust. On the other hand, Cat sensed that it had absorbed the tree's Qi, making it stronger.\n\"Meow <3\"\nAddicted to the feeling, Cat ran back to the store. It grabbed the sacred wood blocks that Leo had previously arranged. Then, it broke them and tried to attach the wood blocks with the remaining roots.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nOuyang Long and Wu Buyi left Cauliflower City. They both boarded the former's airship and flew to Magpie City.\nThe airship arrived at noon. However, it didn't stop there. It changed course and flew east, heading toward a certain place first.\nWu Buyi was delighted when Ouyang Long was enthusiastic about visiting Leo. He never stopped talking.\n\"Daoist Florida Man's techniques are profound and mysterious. He doesn't need to move, but he can let us see our lifespan. Actually, he can see through our true names with just a thought! Anyone that introduces themselves using false names is easily exposed. It's better if you be honest in front of him.\"\nOuyang Long was patient. He kept listening, learning more about the so-called Florida Man. However, as Ouyang Long learned more, his anxiety rose.\nSomehow, this Florida Man's strength seemed illogical. From the last vision of Ouyang Ting, the Florida Man was overwhelmingly strong to the point that he could destroy the Situ Clan's Qi Sealing Array with one punch. However, Wu Buyi expressed that the Florida Man's aura was a soul-formation cultivator, which was unusual. Even Ouyang Long couldn't destroy Situ's Qi Sealing Array in one or two strikes.\nOuyang Long was concerned - If Florida Man's strength was not the soul formation stage, then how strong was he?\n\"Damn Buyi, stop talking for a moment,\" Ouyang Long coughed and asked. \"Is Daoist Florida Man really a soul formation cultivator?\"\nWu Buyi snickered, \"Yes, he is. I saw him myself. His aura is definitely the soul formation stage.\"\n\"I've been thinking. You said that he came from a higher realm, right? What if he has been suppressing his aura to the soul formation stage? What if he's actually stronger than that?\"\nHearing the theory, Wu Buyi burst into laughter.\n\"That's possible, but it's very unlikely. You see. If he's really stronger than the soul formation stage... Let's say he's a soul transformation stage cultivator. He would have had a presence of a quasi-immortal, and his body would have produced thick element essence around him. If he was an immortal, everything living beings around him would have been mutated because of his aura. Regular plants and weeds would have evolved into spirit grasses or spirit plants. Everything he touched would also transform like the plants in the mystic… realm?\"\nWu Buyi paused mid-sentence. He slightly opened his mouth as he remembered something. He thought of Leo's past requests and the items in his store.\n\"Immortal grass? Fruits and vegetables… Wait a minute?!\"\nWu Buyi sweated profusely. He realized something scary.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 40 : Forklift Certified Florida Man Worshiped as Immortal\nLooking at Wu Buyi's reaction, Ouyang Long snorted in disgust. He shook his head and rebuked him.\n\"Immortals cannot stay or enter this world, Buyi. Our world is protected by Shang Emperor. The natural laws of this world repel every native immortal. Any immortal from a higher realm trying to enter this world will be instantly killed by the Heavenly Tribulations.\"\nOuyang Long was a studious type. When he was young, he researched a lot about the immortals and the world's nature.\nFrom his perspective, there was a limit to how strong a cultivator could climb up the ranks. A total of 9 stages separated mortals apart;\nCommoners, aka the regular people,\n1st stage : Muscle Tempering Stage,\n2nd stage : Qi Condensation Stage,\n3rd stage : Foundation Establishment Stage,\n4th stage : Golden Core Stage,\n5th stage : Nascent Soul Stage,\n6th stage : Soul Formation Stage,\n7th stage : Soul Transformation Stage,\nAnd the 8th stage : Quasi-Immortal Stage.\nOnly commoners and cultivators with the cultivation stages could live in this mortal world. If one managed to advance to the 9th stage or higher, they would be automatically expelled from this world by the laws. Everybody who had prolonged their stay was killed by the Heavenly Tribulations.\n\"Err... are you sure?\" Wu Buyi doubted if that was the case.\n\"WE FREAKING LEARNED THIS FROM THE SCHOOL TOGETHER! Dammit, how could you forget about common sense!?\"\n\"But that is not...\"\nWu Buyi thought of the abundant immortal grass in Leo's store. He also remembered that he gifted cabbages and bananas to Leo. But when he revisited him, he found golden sand bananas and yin cabbages instead.\nAgain, Wu Buyi believed that Leo's past actions made a lot of sense if he could transform everything he touched into rare herbs or treasures, such as immortal grass, vegetables, and fruits. He still clearly remembered Leo's expression when he asked for local fruits, vegetables, and seeds.\nThe alchemist didn't know what to feel. If this theory was true, he would have hit the jackpot as his business partner was a powerhouse expert instead of a soul formation cultivator. But if everything was his delusion, the future trades might be complicated as someone stronger than Ouyang Long might try to rob the store.\nWu Buyi prayed. He wished that Leo was a real immortal.\n.\n10 minutes later, the airship hovered over the store. Ouyang Long looked down and found three buildings in the forest. Wu Buyi also noticed the two alchemy workshops behind the store for the first time.\nAs Leo had been clearing the land, many trees were uprooted and piled behind the two workshops. The cleared land spread toward the east stream, which was the only source of water in this area.\nWu Buyi gazed at the cauldrons. Sensing that they were in the middle of making something, he was interested in the content. However, when Wu Buyi recalled the theory that Leo was an immortal, he gulped and prayed hard.\nOuyang Long ordered the ship captain to maintain the altitude. He jumped down from the ship and landed in front of the store. Wu Buyi also quickly followed the guy.\nAs soon as they landed, the chomper plant monster crawled on the roof and approached them. It smiled at the duo.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nWu Buyi ejected a monster carcass and tossed it to Cat in a hurry. He also prostrated to the monster plant.\n\"Sir Guardian, please tell your master that Wu Buyi has brought a new customer!\"\n\"Meow?\"\nCat tilted its head and smiled. As nobody had shown this much respect to it before, it started to like Wu Buyi. Cat extended its vine and patted his head like how Leo always used to. Then, it took the carcass and crawled back to its usual spot.\nMeanwhile, Ouyang Long looked at Wu Buyi in disgust.\n\"I can't believe you've fallen so low, Wu Buyi. Why do you, a nascent soul cultivator, kowtow to a 4th-stage monster? This is unsightly.\"\nWu Buyi looked up and shushed. He glared into Ouyang Long's eyes, \"Mind your words, idiot! Don't provoke it.\"\nNoticing how flustered Wu Buyi was, Ouyang Long gave up on the alchemist. He rolled his eyes and turned his attention to the store building.\nWu Buyi didn't tell Ouyang Long - The growth rate of a plant monster was usually slow. It took a hundred years for them to advance or evolve one minor rank.\nHowever, when Wu Buyi first came to the store, Cat was just a 2nd-stage monster at best. The last time he visited the store, Cat was a 3rd-stage monster, whose strength was on par with golden core cultivators, aka 4th-stage cultivators. But after a few days, it got stronger again.\nIt might even be stronger than him at the moment!\nAlthough Wu Buyi respected Leo and Cat, Ouyang Long didn't. The latter looked at Cat's branches, vines, and roots.\nCat's luster roots gleamed in white, as bright as white jade. Moreover, it produced the same aura as sacred wood, which repelled all evil energy around the creature.\nBehind the chomper plant, a transparent dao spirit of the creature hovered behind its master. It had the appearance of a dark-skinned humanoid infant with long ears.\nOnly Ouyang Long, who was a soul formation cultivator, could see the spirit. He smirked and muttered to himself.\n\"A 4th-stage monster manages to realize the Dao? This is a rare specimen indeed. Wu Buyi, help me kill the monster so we can share its monster parts. Its roots are made of sacred woods. They're the best ingredient for making anti-undead weapons!\"\nWu Buyi widened his eyes in shock. He yelled at his friend and stood between Ouyang Long and Cat.\n\"NO! YOU'RE CRAZY! THAT IS DAOIST FLORIDA MAN'S PET!\"I think you should take a look at\nOuyang Long had enough of Wu Buyi's idiocy. He snorted and hit the alchemist with a palm strike.\nBOOM\nThe palm hit the alchemist's chest, sending him flying toward the glass window of the store.\nWu Buyi's back hit the glass window. However, it remained intact. Wu Buyi also sensed something soft supported him, acting as a cushion to prevent injuries.\nThen, for the first time, Wu Buyi heard a system voice.\n<An employee has been assaulted by a visitor.>\n.\n.\nLeo had been looking at the back door of the store. He pouted and looked at the backdoor.\nPreviously when Leo transferred the blue stones out, Leo discovered that the bins were a lot bigger than the door frame. Thus, he brought them out by removing the glass windows of the front store and carried them through the window frames. After transporting everything out, he put the glass windows back.\nThe transportation took a long time, but he managed to bring the unnecessary items out. Still, Leo learned from his mistake : Never bought large stuff while he was inside the store!\nAnnoyed by the limitation of the doors, Leo unscrewed the hinges and removed the entire backdoor. Then, he started slicing the door frame, expanding its space.\nLeo's fingernail extended upon his will. Using his fingernail as a knife, he cut through the wood with ease. After five minutes, Leo tripled the size of the backdoor.\n\"I should have done this earlier. Man, I wasted my time for nothing.\"\nLeo looked at the wide door and thought of turning the sacred wood blocks into DIY doors and door frames. However, he didn't have sufficient tools for carpentry as modern tools were incapable of cutting through iron pine lumber.\nAs Leo couldn't leave the wall with a large hole, he stacked some rough iron pine lumber on top of each other, serving as a temporary blockade. Then, he moved on to the backyard.\nLeo looked at the bins behind the store. Some of them still contained books, arrows, bolts, and weapons of the assassins. He sighed and pushed them to the back of the alchemy workshops. As there were three mountains of items there, Leo chose to use the empty large bins to store the precious materials, such as iron pine nuts, iron pine leaves, and immortal grass.\nWhen Leo was done, all 30 large bins were full, and the field was clean. He gazed at the grain pill ingredients and deeply sighed.\n\"I probably can't refine all of you in my lifetime. How many million pills do I have to make to get rid of y'all?\"\nLeo left the bins behind the workshops. He then entered the alchemy workshop storeroom, which was filled with transparent plastic boxes of blue stones. Containers stacked on top of each other, reaching the ceiling. Every box was full to the brim. The baskets of fruits and vegetables were placed in front of the second workshop as there was no other place for him to store them.\nHis warehouse was full!\nLeo regretted what he did. He lamented that he shouldn't have played with the spatial rings of the fallen cultivators.\nWhile grumbling, Leo looked at the black ring on the middle finger of his left hand, which had been with him for 50,000 years.\n\"Hey, little alien parasite. Can you become one of those fancy Doraemon rings? I want to store these things inside you. Can you open a pocket dimension for me?\"\nLeo rubbed the ring. However, the system didn't react to his wish, and it didn't break.\nHe was disappointed. Still, Leo checked the online shopping system to see if he could buy the feature from the system.\nDING\n<Such a feature doesn't exist.>\nOnce again, Leo was hit with the cruel reality. He didn't get the luxury that many main characters in cultivation novels had.\nLeo didn't give up - he explored the shop domain system next and stared at one of the building icons.\n.\nWarehouse\nRequirement : Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice : 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace : 5 x 5\n.\nLeo frowned as the 5x5 meters space might be too small for a warehouse. He wondered if it was worth the investment. Still, even though Leo wanted to build it, he didn't have enough lifespan to afford it.\n\"Hah. I wish a stupid cultivator visited me at night and attacked my store.\"\nAs soon as Leo finished his prayer, he heard a loud noise from the front of the store.\nBOOM\nIn addition, the system gave him an alert.\nDING\n<One of your employees has been assaulted by a visitor.>\nLeo widened his eyes. He looked up and moved his fingers, praying.\n\"Praise Jesus! God bless Florida.\"",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 41 – Male Karen and Two Pets Killed by Florida Man During Pokemon Fight\n\"Hmm?\"\nOuyang Long furrowed his brow. He stared at Wu Buyi, whose body was suspended in the floating bubble barrier in front of the glass windows. He scanned the surroundings, checking if another cultivator was nearby.\nIt wasn't hard to find Leo in the backyard. The guy was slowly walking toward them.\nOuyang Long clicked his tongue. It seemed that the store owner was there. Getting ready to meet the rumored man, he stopped paying attention to a weak alchemist.\nDING\nSuddenly, a series of texts appeared in front of Ouyang Long. It showed his age and his remaining lifespan.\n.\nName: Ouyang Long\nAge: 251\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,599 Years, 9 Months, 22 Days, 1 Hour, and 13 Minutes\n.\nSeeing his lifespan, Ouyang Long was stunned for a moment. Then, he revealed a proud smile. As someone from a rich family, he managed to purchase five elixir pills, which increased his lifespan by 100 years each. He believed that the medicines worked perfectly.\nHowever, Ouyang Long never had someone who could identify one's remaining lifespan. The Florida Man's ability made him envious.\nHe wanted to learn this technique!\nThere were many ways to get his hands on this technique – Kill and steal the technique book, force the store owner to reveal the secret, or make him submit and reveal the secret.\n'That's it. I'm going to kill you and get that technique! I'll avenge Ting'er and kill that idiot Buyi later. Everything in his store will be mine, and no one can blame me that I kill two alchemists.'\nOuyang Long crossed his arms behind his back and faced the approaching cultivator. A few seconds later, an elderly man with long white hair and a white beard walked out from the shade and showed himself.\n'Hmm?'\nStrangely, the clothes of the old man were weird. He didn't wear respectable clothes or robes. Instead, he wore an oversized white cotton t-shirt, baggy shorts, and a pair of crocs. Had Ouyang Long never paid attention to the elder's rainbow aura, he would have mistaken him as a weird commoner.\nHe didn't notice that Leo's body was built like a fitness gym coach. His thick arms, firm chest, muscular calves, and refined thighs were bigger than average cultivators, but they were hidden under the wrinkled skins and baggy clothes.\n'No presence of a cultivator. No pressure from an expert. No charisma. No manner. Tsk. Am I looking at a country bumpkin? Rather, he must be a fake cultivator. He must have used many artifacts and tricks when he killed the Hound Squad and Ting'er. That must be it! Since he's an alchemist, he must have used some forbidden medicines on himself that day, and he's powerless right now. Most strength boost pills have a long drawback effect. Since Ting'er just died a few days ago, he should not have recovered his strength yet. Yes, that must be the case!'\nAfter making the conclusion, Ouyang Long sneered. He decided not to show respect to this person to exert dominance. Once he could get Florida Man to submit, he would enslave him and extort for the techniques and wealth later.\nOuyang Long shouted, \"Florida Man! How dare you provoke the Ouyang Clan and the Jianghu Alliance?! How dare you kill my son!?\"\nFlorida Man's expression was complicated. He looked at Ouyang Long in disdain, but the corners of his mouth curved up as if he was laughing. He said with a deep voice.\n\"I don't even know who you are.\"\n.\nLeo was confused. He really meant it when he said he didn't know who the guy was.\nThis guy showed up on a fancy flying ship and attacked one of Leo's employees. Then, he acted like a male Karen.\nLeo always hated Karens. When he was still a human, he always wanted to punch every loudmouth Karen regardless of their pronouns and genders. From his point of view, they were the enemies of common sense and a civilized world.\nLooking at the Karen Man, Leo gave up talking common sense. He looked at the lifespan status of Ouyang Long to see how many years he could get from this guy.\n'Oh! 1,599! This guy is loaded!'\nNothing made Leo happier than seeing a hoodlum with a long life. He rubbed his hands and licked his lips, preparing to order the system to harvest the lifespan.\nWhile Leo was absentminded, Ouyang Long shouted again.\n\"I said – Who do you think you are?! Kneel and beg for forgiveness at once, and I'll spare your sorry life!\"\nHearing the threat, Leo was amused. He brightly grinned and walked closer toward Ouyang Long, wanting to see his angry face up close. He also slightly tilted his head, giving the visitor an obnoxious look.\n\"… Why should I?\"\nSeeing Leo's reactions, Ouyang Long was annoyed. His two dao avatars manifested behind him, showing off his abilities and cultivation base. The two spirits transformed into a long fire dragon and a water dragon. Unlike western dragons, they had long body like a snake, but they had short arms. Both dragons floated in the air, mimicking Shenlong from Dragon Ball Series. The two dragons roared and bore fangs.\nOuyang Long looked at his dao avatars and sneered at Leo, \"See this? This is what a soul formation cultivator can do. I wonder if a fake like you can do this much.\"\n\"… Okay?\"\nLeo blankly looked at the spirit dragons. He pursed his lips, hiding his astonishment. He had faced countless Godzillas, monsters, and mutants before. However, he had never seen materialized ghosts, especially ghost dragons.\nAs soon as Leo looked at them, the shop domain system activated and automatically showed their statuses.\n.\nName: Dao of Water Dragon\nAge: 39\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,139 Years, 8 Months, 2 Days, 4 Hours, and 1 Minute\n.\nName: Dao of Fire Dragon\nAge: 72I think you should take a look at\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,823 Years, 11 Months, 4 Days, 22 Hours, and 40 Minutes\n.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo was stunned. He never knew that ghosts had a lifespan. He was pleasantly surprised.\n'1,599 + 1,139 + 1,823… How much? Oh, I forgot to include the months. Meh, I'm not Asian. Forget about math. The system will calculate everything for me anyway.'\nAlthough the number looked enticing, Leo had worries – If he recklessly killed Ouyang Long right away, he might not be able to steal these dragons' lifespan as they hadn't attacked the store yet. For the sake of exploiting the system loophole, Leo came up with a plan.\n\"Ahem. I don't want to be rude, but using Pokemons in combat is animal cruelty, mister. If you're looking for a Pokemon duel, I suggest you look elsewhere. For example, far off the distance is where you should F off and jack off to a Vaporean.\"\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi listened to their interactions in shock and fear. The latter couldn't stop sweating as he expected a big battle soon.\nThe alchemist opened his mouth and tried to speak. However, the shop domain system still suspended him in mid-air. It also disabled his ability to speak or move.\nWu Buyi was helpless. He could only watch his idiot friend commit suicide.\n'Rest in peace, Ouyang Long. I'll burn gold papers for you.'\n.\nOuyang Long didn't know if he should be enraged or amused as Leo's words made no sense to him. However, he figured that Leo looked down on his Dao Avatars, which he had spent years nurturing.\nDaos, in cultivation terms, referred to beliefs, goals, and way of life. Every person, even commoners, walked a different path to pursue their Dao.\nMeanwhile, a Dao Avatar was the manifestation of a cultivator's Dao Spirit. When a cultivator realized their Dao or was enlightened, their dao would gain sentient and become an independent spirit, which would help their creators in their journey to pursue the daos.\nUsually, Dao Avatars manifested when a cultivator reached the nascent soul stage. However, many talented cultivators and monsters could awaken their Dao Avatars early, such as Cat.\nOuyang Long's eyes could see through hidden dao avatars of every cultivator. He didn't see anything in Leo's aura, so he concluded that Leo was a trashy cultivator that couldn't realize his dao. Thus, he had no reason to be civil.\nHe pointed his hand at Leo's face.\n\"Go! Pull out his tongue and sever his legs. But don't kill him, though. I want him to be my alchemy slave!\"\nWu Buyi wanted to yell and threaten that every alchemist in Jianghu wouldn't forgive him if he touched Leo. However, his voice couldn't come out.\nThe two giant dragons moved. The red dragon opened their mouths and unleashed a fire breath. The blue one glared at Leo's feet, and turned the ground into ice.\nCRACK\nThe lower half of Leo's body was frozen in ice. The fire beam descended and devoured Leo directly!\nWu Buyi was still in the floating bubble barrier. The fire and the ice attack didn't reach him, but he could feel the extreme temperature. He trembled, getting nervous.\nHe was not worried about Leo, but he was afraid of Ouyang Long's fate. Thus, Wu Buyi closed his eyes, not wanting to see the result.\nOuyang Long laughed and waited for the attacks to finish. When the two dragons ceased their attacks, he created an ice lance and a flame spear in both hands. Then, he threw them toward Leo.\nThe lance and the spear entwined in mid-flight. As soon as it hit Leo's stomach, they exploded.\nBOOM\nFragments of ice and fireballs scattered everywhere. Several flame balls landed on the rooftop while the ice shards hit the ground and pine trees at a distance, yet none of them hit Ouyang Long and the dragons.\nBecause of the explosion of fire and ice, it generated a thick fog of vapor. It shrouded Leo's silhouette and the result of the attacks.\nOuyang Long was not in a hurry. He waited for the fog to subside. While he was waiting, he glanced at the store building. Strangely, it did not catch fire after the explosion. The glass windows, the walls, the rooftop, and the doors remained intact.\nHe turned his attention to the floating bubble in front of the store's glass windows next. The alchemist was still alive, and the barrier was undamaged.\nSomething was not right about this store.\nNot letting his guard down, Ouyang Long swung his hand, generating a strong gale. The wind blew away the fog, revealing the result of the previous attacks.\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\nLeo still stood there, blinking and frowning. His t-shirt was burnt to ash, leaving with only his pants and crocs. Moreover, his hair and beard weren't damaged. As for the ice, they were all melted.\nDING\n<Warning, the store is under attack.>\n<You may collect lifespan from the assailant as compensation for the damage.>\nBoth Leo and Wu Buyi received the same messages. The former grinned while the latter's face lost all color.\n\"Oh, no,\" Wu Buyi discovered another scary secret of Leo.\n\"Oh, yes,\" Leo was overjoyed. He slow-clapped and congratulated Ouyang Long.\n\"Congratulations. You played yourself.\"\n\"What?\"\nOuyang Long didn't understand anything. His attacks were enough to injure any soul transformation as the dragon dao spirits were the strongest among all elemental avatars. However, Leo seemed to be unaffected by the fire and ice power.\n*SNAP*\nThe sound of a finger snap stunned Ouyang Long. He didn't understand why, but everything in the world seemed to grow bigger. Moreover, he could no longer feel his arms, legs, or body.\nOuyang Long didn't realize that his entire body but his eyes instantly turned to ash. The eyes slowly melted and dried a few seconds later. As for the dragons, they dispersed into small gem shards and fell to the ground.",

      "content": "﻿Chapter 42 : Florida Man Hijacked Plane to Sell His Homemade Meds\n\"HEHEHEHE! Profits!\"\nLeo ignored Wu Buyi's gaze. He walked toward the ash pile of Ouyang Long and picked up his clothes. He swung them five times, shaking the items out of the robes' pockets.\nPU\nPU\nTwo rings, five throwing knives, two long swords, and blue stones came out. Leo glanced at the throwing knives and the two swords in disgust and picked up the rings and blue stones. Then, he checked his lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 4,988 Years, 11 Months, 4 Days, 3 Hours, and 54 Minutes.>\nLeo brightly smiled. His wish had been granted, and he had enough lifespan to upgrade his store again. Because of the joy, he forgot about Wu Buyi.\nThe store system released Wu Buyi. The alchemist gasped for air and panted. Then, he gazed at Leo in awe and respect.\n\"S-Senior immortal. I was wrong! Please forgive my past offense!\" Wu Buyi prostrated to the ground. He threw away his shame and wailed like a baby.\nLeo finally remembered that somebody else was nearby, and this alchemist witnessed everything. In addition, the giant flying ship was still around.\nAlthough Leo didn't mind that Wu Buyi brought stupid cultivators here, the capitalist side of him didn't want to share the lifespan that he had gotten from Ouyang Long. Thus, he came up with an excuse.\n\"I can't give you commission this time since your customers attacked me and my store. Next time, you should bring better customers.\"\n\"I-I understand, senior!\"\nWu Buyi didn't dare to ask for rewards. Even if he had the right to claim it, he wasn't brave enough to demand his share. After all, Ouyang Long downright attacked Leo, and the latter could easily claim that Wu Buyi betrayed him.\nMeanwhile, Leo inwardly laughed. As he didn't have to pay Wu Buyi a commission, he got to keep everything. He then turned his attention to the flying ship.\n\"Won't you invite the people up there to see my store?\"\n\"I-ugh.\"\nWu Buyi hesitated. As the servants belonged to Ouyang Long, he was afraid that they might seek vengeance. However, after thinking of Ouyang Long's personality, they might not be loyal.\nLeo looked at Wu Buyi again. He frowned, \"There's still an issue about you running away with my elixir. If you don't feel like working, we can end our contract here.\"\n\"N-No! I'll work, senior! I'll work my hardest!\"\nAfraid of Leo, Wu Buyi flew to the airship.\n.\nUpon returning to the airship, Wu Buyi rushed to the ship captain. He whispered in a hushed voice.\n\"Alright. Whatever you hear, do not panic. I repeat, do not panic.\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir?\"\n\"Ahem, well.\" Wu Buyi cleared his throat and looked around him. As he didn't see anybody nearby but the captain, he revealed the truth.\n\"Ouyang Long is dead.\"\n\"...\"\n\"He offended an immortal and got himself killed. Now, the immortal wants everybody on the ship to come down and trade with him. If you refuse, he will kill everybody here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't know what Ouyang Long has done to you or how loyal you are to him. But know this : The person down there is a thousand times scarier than your lord. So if you value your life, convince everybody to go and pay respect to the immortal. If possible, buy something from his shop, and nobody gets hurt.\"\n\"...\"\nThe ship captain was just a golden core cultivator. The rest of the servants and crew were all foundation establishment stage. Thus, nobody here could disobey Wu Buyi's order.\nThe captain silently bowed and picked up a crystal, which was a sound amplification artifact. Although his face was as pale as a sheet, he announced to the crew and Ouyang Long's servants.\n\"Attention, all crew. Ouyang Long is dead, and we have received a new order. We shall park our ship in a few minutes, and all crew must come down to pay respect to an immortal expert. Please be calm and act accordingly for your safety.\"\nWu Buyi left the quarterdeck and observed the crowd on board. As he had expected, their expressions were complicated. Still, there was no sign of resistance as nobody was loyal to the cruel master : They only served Ouyang Long out of fear.\nA few minutes later, the ship descended and hovered over the forest. The crowd jumped down from the flying ship and gathered in front of the general store.\nA certain plant monster instantly noticed their arrival. It came out to greet them with its usual catchphrase.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"...\"\nThe people were confused. They came here to greet an immortal, not a monster plant. Fortunately, Wu Buyi escorted them and translated Cat's language.\n\"That's the pet of the immortal expert. It just wants a toll fee. As long as you give it a monster carcass or food, it will leave quietly.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nNot every cultivator sustained on grain pills. As common food was cheaper, many servants stored real food in their spatial rings and clothes. Everybody brought out commoner's food, such as jerkies, hard bread, and animal carcasses. Then, they put them on the ground in front of the chomper plant.I think you should take a look at\nCat bobbed its head up and down like a vibing bird. It gathered everything in its arms, aka branches. Then, it crawled away in glee.\nLooking at the monster, a few servants giggled, finding it cute. As for the rest of the crew, they were astonished as they had never seen such a smart monster plant.\nCREAK\nThe sound of an opening door disrupted their attention. An elderly man with a long beard came out of the building and gazed at them. As soon as they noticed Leo's rainbow aura, everybody knelt and prostrated on the ground, paying respect to Leo.\n.\nLeo had changed his clothes. He temporarily put on Hound Squad's uniform as his previous clothes were burnt and destroyed. Upon seeing the crowd of 200 people, Leo crossed his arms while he stroked his long beard.\n\"Welcome to my general store. You can come inside and have a look at my items. If you have any questions, you can either ask me or Wu Buyi over there. Also, we only accept lifespan as currency.\"\n\"L-Lifespan?! Our lifespan?\" Everybody gulped. None of them dared to look up or raise their heads.\nLeo glanced at Wu Buyi, who was the only one standing. The latter wiped his sweat with a handkerchief and elaborated to the crew, explaining how this store worked.\nA minute later, the 200 cultivators raised their heads. They understood the instructions, but nobody was brave enough to enter the building.\nSeeing that nobody moved, the captain of the ship, Zhong, volunteered so that Leo wouldn't be offended.\nZhong was born an orphan, so he had no surname. This year, he was 75. Although his strength reached the golden core stage, he was considered trash as his cultivation base stagnated for 40 years. Ouyang Long found him and enslaved him, forcing the guy to work here. And today, he ran into a new tyrant.\nPreparing to die, Zhong took three steps forward. He politely cupped his fist, saluting the Florida Man.\n\"I wish to purchase your items. Could I see what you have for sale?\"\nLeo shrugged, gesturing him to enter the store. He also enabled Zhong to see his own lifespan.\n.\nName: Zhong\nAge: 75\nLifespan: 465 Years, 1 Month, 12 Days, 4 Hours, and 54 Minutes.\n.\nSeeing his lifespan for the first time, Zhong was astonished. His knees became as soft as jelly, and he fell on his knees.\n\"M-My lifespan?\"\nLeo didn't stop there : He allowed everybody else to see their lifespans. When 200 status menus appeared at once, the crowd murmured. They looked at their remaining years and compared them with their friends as if they were children comparing grade sheets.\nWu Buyi bitterly smiled while Leo widely grinned. The latter turned around, planning to walk into his store. But after walking two steps, he uttered.\n\"Mister Wu Buyi, you can keep the swords and the knives. I have no use for them.\"\n\"E-Eh?\"\nWu Buyi widened his eyes and looked at the swords near Ouyang Long's remaining ash. His jaw slightly dropped.\n\"T-The swords? I can have those swords?!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Don't make me repeat myself. Take them away or I'll smelt them into ores. I'm not into fencing.\"\n\"...\"\nWu Buyi rushed toward the swords and picked them up. He rubbed the hilts and appraised them up close.\nOne of them was Ouyang Long's flying sword, which he often used as a personal flying vehicle. As for the other one, it was a Chinese thin broadsword. From a glance, it looked fragile as it could bend and curve like waves. However, Wu Buyi noticed its hidden properties.\nIt could store Fire and Water Essence inside the blades, and Wu Buyi could borrow its power at will. Moreover, it automatically regenerated its Qi and Essence.\nIn short, this broadsword was a treasure!\nWu Buyi kowtowed again. He slammed his head on the ground, \"THANK YOU, SENIOR! I SWEAR WITH MY DAO OATH! I'LL FOLLOW YOU FOR LIFE!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes to avoid the cringe. He gazed at Zhong next.\n\"Come. I'm in a good mood today. All items are 50% off. Just tell me if you need something.\"\nZhong nodded and followed Leo into the store. He glanced at Wu Buyi, who received Ouyang Long's personal items as gifts. He thought to himself.\n'Ouyang Long was selfish. He never gifts anybody except his son. But if this person is kind enough to reward others, maybe he is not as selfish as Ouyang Long.'\nZhong got his hopes up. He wondered what Leo had in store.\nHe was not disappointed. As soon as Zhong entered the building, he was greeted with unique refrigerators, shelves, and rare fruits. A large basket of Bloodmelons stood out like a sore thumb while a table nearby highlighted transparent boxes of pills.\n\"Grain pills?\" Zhong was curious.\nLeo nodded and explained, \"Yes. Those are element grain pills. Normally, I sold them for 10 years of lifespan per pill, but I'll sell them for five years per pill. How about it?\"\n\"WHAT?!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 43 – Local Laborers Idolize Florida Man as Savior\nZhong cultivated Earth Qi, which was commonly known as an unpopular element. Cultivators commonly pursued offensive power and techniques so that they could have a strong signature skill or legacy, boosting their reputation and obtaining a cool Daoist Title.\nFire and Metal Elements were every cultivator's favorite as fire symbolized destruction while metal was versatile in offense and defense. Water Element came third as it prioritized support techniques, but it could still be useful in combat. Wood was also popular among alchemists and botanists, making it on the same tier as Water.\nOn the other hand, Earth seemed lackluster compared to Water or other elements. Mostly, Earth-based techniques focused on defensive abilities and craftsmanship. A few martial arts focused on Earth Elements, but they were far weaker than other elements in fights. As a result, alchemists avoided making earth element cultivation pills as they weren't marketable.\nWithout cultivation resources in the market, Zhong couldn't cultivate. Moreover, Zhong was old and weaker than his peers, so he couldn't enter any mystic realm.\nHowever, in front of Zhong, there were so many earth grain pills. Although they weren't proper cultivation resources, they were enough to strengthen his dantian and foundation.\nHe saw hope!\n\"F-Five years of lifespan per pill?\" Zhong trembled in excitement.\n\"Yes. Oh, those are old pills. If you want new ones with better quality, they are on the shelves. The price is 10 years per pill, though.\"\n\"Better quality?!\"\nZhong ran toward the shelves and looked at the pills in the Tupperware boxes. As Leo said - they looked bigger and glossier. He began counting the pills in the box.\n'20… 22… 25… there aren't many. I need to get all of these.'\nZhong reached out for the pills, planning to buy everything.\nTOK-TOK\nKLUK-KLUK\n\"Ah.\"\nThe sound of a marble hitting the wood floor and rolling distracted Zhong. He looked at Leo and noticed that the latter accidentally dropped two black marble balls. He helped the elder pick them up.\nLeo wryly smiled, \"Ah, thanks. Oh, you can put them anyway on the shelf. I can't touch you. If you touch me even the slightest, you will die.\"\n\"…\"\nZhong gulped, thinking that Leo was threatening him. He obediently put the black stones on a shelf. Before Zhong let go of the stone, he noticed something.\nThe stones contained a thick amount of Earth Essence!\nNot Qi, but Essence!\nFurthermore, Zhong sensed other elements in there!\n\"S-Senior!\" Zhong picked the two black balls and showed them to Leo, \"Can I buy these?\"\n\"Oh, that?\"\nLeo deeply sighed. They were once the blue stones that Ouyang Long dropped. Leo touched these stones with his bare hands, and they all mutated into essence stones.\n.\n[Essence Stone]\nCan be found underground in any mystic realm. Unlike spirit stones, it contains a great amount of Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Qi.\n[Traits]\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 10 years' worth of cultivation. (Consumption)\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stone]\n1,000 Essence Stones\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Catalyst\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Essence\n.\nAs Leo still remembered the detail, he came up with a price on the spot.\n\"Those are essence stones. One of them can give you about 10 years' worth of fire, water, metal, wood, and earth element essence. I'll sell you for 100 years of lifespan per stone. Oh, wait. That's the full price. How about 50 per stone after the discount?\"\nLeo learned from his past mistake. He used the amount of obtainable Qi as a base and add zero behind it to name the price. As Leo was in a good mood, he gave the captain a special discount.\nZhong almost fell to his knees while he held the two black stones in his hands. He repeatedly nodded, \"E-Essence?! I-I'll buy them, senior! I'll also take all Earth grain pills!\"\n\"Hoh?\"\nLeo rechecked Zhong's lifespan, worrying that he might not have enough to pay the bill. Fortunately, he had enough.\n\"That will cost 350 years of your life. Do you want the inferior earth grain pill, too?\"\n\"Y-Yes, please.\"\n\"Good. There are five left, so… 375 years.\"\nLeo walked picked up an empty Tupperware box and gathered the pills into one container. After closing the box, he put on rubber gloves to prevent accidents and passed the box to Zhong. He deducted the lifespan afterward.\nZhong received the container and put it in his spatial ring. Then, he bowed 90 degrees.\n\"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENIOR!\"\n\"You're welcome. Alright. You can call the others to come in.\"\n\"Yes, senior!\"\nWith this many pills and the two essence cores, he could finally break through the bottleneck and reached the nascent soul stage, becoming a true expert. Moreover, he might awaken new elements after consuming the essence stone.\nUnbeknownst to both parties, Leo underpriced his items once again.\nOne year's worth of Qi in cultivator's terms meant 100 strands of Qi. However, when it came to essence, it translated as one drop of essence. Because cultivators needed 1,000 strands of Qi to condense one drop of essence, the value differed.\nIn summary, one year's worth of essence translated into 1,000 strands of Qi, which was equivalent to 10 years' worth of Qi!\nAs such, Zhong would gain a total of 100 years' worth of five elements Qi per essence stone, and he only needed to pay 50 years of lifespan!\nThat was a bargain!\nZhong was grateful. He shed a tear of gratitude, and he swore in his heart that he would never forget this kindness.\nMeanwhile, Leo had no idea that he miscalculated once again. He thought that he got smarter as he managed to scam 375 years of life from a random dude.\nLeo returned to his bedroom and collected more earth grain pills to refill the stock. While he was at it, he put a new box and filled it with the essence stones. Then, he placed the box on a shelf and waited for the next customer.\n\"NEXT, PLEASE!\"\n.\n200 servants of Ouyang Long were skeptical at first as they didn't want to waste their lifespan buying useless pills or unknown objects. However, Zhong came out happy and showed them the two essence cores that he got. He also praised Leo.\n\"The elder is very kind! Don't be afraid and exchange your lifespan for the pills or items in there. You won't regret it.\"\nThe crowd didn't have as many years to live as Zhong as they were all foundation establishment cultivators - Their average lifespan was 280-350 years, which was not a lot.\nStill, five of Zhong's colleagues braced for danger and entered the store.\nFive minutes later, the five men came out with a wide smile on their faces. They rushed toward Zhong to thank him.I think you should take a look at\n\"Brother Zhong! You're right. The elder is generous!\"\n\"Look at the pills and the essence stones! With these, we might even catch up to you!\"\nThe five men all bought two essence stones and a dozen grain pills of their choice. Zhong looked at their items and was happy for them.\nNoticing their reactions, the other servants stopped hesitating. They queued and entered the store, five people at a time. Wu Buyi acted as a bouncer, managing the number of people inside the store so they wouldn't be crowded.\n.\nHours later, the sun rose. All servants got their items, and nobody could stop smiling.\nAfter the last customer left the store, Leo came out to see the crowd. As soon as he came out, everybody saluted.\n\"THANK YOU, SENIOR!\"\n\"WE ARE FOREVER GRATEFUL!\"\nSeeing the crowd's reactions, Leo was confused. He raised his brow and looked at Wu Buyi, but the latter shook his head.\nLeo sighed and shrugged. He got so much from the transactions, so he didn't care what they thought. He parted them with a few words.\n\"Come back when you're stronger. This place will always open the door for you, regardless of your past or background.\"\n\"!!!\"\nLeo wanted them to come back as customers. However, his wording and the auto-translation system made it vague, and the crowd interpreted it differently.\n\"W-We can come back?\"\n\"He will accept us?\"\n\"H-He doesn't care about our backgrounds?\"\nThe crowd thought that Leo would hire or take them in as his servants. They were astonished.\nLeo coughed and waited for them to leave so that he could finalize his share with Wu Buyi. However, the crowd lingered as if they were confused about something.\nSince they continued staying, Leo came up with a plan to make them leave. He gave them a random sermon.\n\"Listen. Indeed, everybody wasn't born equal. Some lucky bastards were born with a silver spoon in their mouths and got everything handed to them. On the other hand, people like us fought for clean water and competed for scraps to live for another day. We struggled our hardest to survive.\"\nListening to Leo's speech, half of the grown men shed manly tears, thinking of their bitter past struggles. His words resonated with their lives.\nLeo coughed and borrowed some philosophies from his old world. \"What do you think the difference between you and your former master is?\"\nZhong swiped his tear. He answered, \"Wealth and status?\"\n\"Wrong.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nWu Buyi also raised his brow. He asked, \"S-Senior. What is it, then?\"\nLeo brightly smiled, \"Opportunity.\"\n\"???\"\nWu Buyi and the crowd still doubted Leo's word, but the latter continued asking them.\n\"What do you think you and your former master have in common?\"\n\"…\"\nThe crowd murmured. They weren't prepared for a sudden quiz, but Wu Buyi tried answering, \"Two arms and legs?\"\n\"Physically, that's correct, but that's not entirely right either.\"\n\"Then… what's the answer, senior?\"\nLeo giggled and looked at the crowd, \"Opportunity.\"\n\"Huh?!\"\nThe crowd and Wu Buyi were even more confused. Leo just said that Ouyang Long's opportunity and their opportunity were different. But a minute later, Leo flipped his words and said that they had the same opportunity.\nAfter capturing the crowd's full attention, Leo got to his point.\n\"My point is – You and your master have the same opportunity, but his opportunity is different from yours since his parents and his family spoon-fed him everything. But for you, you actually have an equal opportunity, but nobody teaches you that you have. They're right in front of you, but you never realized it.\"\n\"!!?\"\nLeo pointed at the pills and essence stones they bought, \"Those are your opportunity.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe crowd widened their eyes as everyone started to get the general idea of what opportunity Leo was talking about. As long as they could digest the element essence in the stones, their cultivation base would rise, which enabled their future opportunity.\nBefore they started imagining or interpreting his words the other way, Leo turned around and pointed at the store, \"That is also your opportunity.\"\n\"T-This… I SEE!!\"\nEverybody finally understood what Leo tried to say. Had they cowered in fear and never taken a step in, they wouldn't have had the pills in their hands.\nLeo pointed at Wu Buyi with his thumb, \"That guy is also your opportunity.\"\n\"EH?!\"\nAgain, the crowd was enlightened. Without Wu Buyi, nobody could have come down and gotten their pills and essence stones.\nLeo clapped and laughed, \"You see. Opportunities are around you. You see it, but you never seized it. In general, you lack information, but your ex-master has it. While you're in the dark, he seized almost every opportunity around him. You and your ex-master have equal opportunity, but you can't seize it because you don't know. That makes your opportunities different.\"\n\"W-Wow.\"\nAfter sidetracking enough, Leo connected the point and made use of the teaching.\n\"Therefore, I want you to remember me, my store, and our encounter when you go home. Right now, you are still in trouble. Your master is dead, and you have no place to go. You might be lost, but you're not hopeless anymore. Opportunities are around you. Let me give you a push, aka another opportunity. This is a new page of your life. Go start anew with the pills and stones in your hands. Get stronger. Become someone successful. Once you overcome the hurdles or become successful, you can come back to my store with your heads held high. If you fail and encounter a roadblock, you can still come back to gain another opportunity from me. Got it?\"\n\"…\"\nZhong and his colleagues all knelt and cupped their fists. They lowered their head in unison while their tears covered their faces.\n\"I SWEAR WITH MY DAO OATH! I WILL NEVER FORGET YOUR TEACHINGS!\"\n\"I'LL BECOME SOMEONE WORTHY TO BE YOUR SERVANT, SENIOR!\"\n\"WE'LL BE STRONGER, AND WE WILL COME BACK TO REPAY YOU, SIR!\"\nLeo blankly gazed at the crowd, confused about what they were doing.\n'Err… What the hell is wrong with you? I just want you peeps to get stronger and get more lifespan to spend in my store.'\nLeo had no idea what they were thinking. He looked at Wu Buyi, asking him with his expression.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi was still crying. He wiped his tear with his handkerchief and muttered, \"Senior, your wisdom is profound and boundless. I'm so glad I'm following you.\"\n\"…\"",

Wu Buyi handed him the personal token of Ouyang Long and bid him farewell.\nThe flying ship took off. It was unknown if Zhong would bring them back to Cauliflower City or somewhere else. It was up to them to decide their fate.\nAfter the people had left, Leo rechecked his gain.\nAll grain pills were sold out. After there was no pill left, everybody purchased three or four essence stones instead. Leo sat in front of his store and wrote a few numbers, calculating the sales.\n750 low-graded grain pills, 150 lesser grain pills, and 650 essence stones sold.\n7,500 + 750 + 32,500 = 40,750\nWu Buyi took a 10% share. He got a whopping 4,075 years as commission!\nHowever, Leo was 36,675 richer. Combined with what he had, he got 41,663 to spend!\nHe was rich!\nBoth Wu Buyi and Leo laughed in unison. The former's laughter was the loudest as he never imagined that he would get this much after one trip. However, his laughter was not long.\nWhile wearing rubber gloves, Leo poked Wu Buyi from behind. The former brightly smiled and opened his palm.\n\"The payment for the elixir pills?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi's smiling face was frozen. A second later, he sweated profusely. Wu Buyi took a step back and presented Leo with a spatial ring.\n\"I-I have sold the elixir for spirit stones, senior. Everything I have is in my ring. You can check it.\"\nLeo deeply frowned as he still remembered how items could burst out of these rings. He clicked his tongue, not wanting to explode another ring.\nNoticing Leo's dark expression, Wu Buyi trembled in fear. He kowtowed, \"PLEASE FORGIVE ME! I TRIED MY BEST TO GET THE BEST VALUE OUT OF THE PILLS, SIR!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and calculated what he should do with Wu Buyi. He wasn't angry at him, but he didn't know how to use the ring. Leo was also concerned if he should ask Wu Buyi directly.\nAfter a brief thought, Leo decided to reveal more secrets to the alchemist.\n\"Listen, Wu Buyi. I don't know how to use the rings. Can you teach me?\"\nWu Buyi's ears perked up. He raised his head and cheerfully smiled, \"Of course, I can teach you anything… eh?\"\nFinally, Wu Buyi realized something wrong – It was common knowledge that cultivators could use spatial rings to carry items in the ring's pocket space. Every foundation establishment cultivator had at least one ring with them, and these rings could be purchased in any big city or big sect. Even young adults knew how to use one.\nHowever, Leo, who looked like an ancient figure, had no idea how to use a spatial ring?\nWasn't he an immortal?\nOuyang Long's words when they were on the airship haunted him.\n[He's a fake cultivator!]\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Wu Buyi shook his head, getting rid of the thought. However, his doubt lingered and drove the alchemist crazy. Unable to figure it out, Wu Buyi probed for information.\n\"S-Senior, can you turn normal grass into immortal grass?\"\nLeo snorted, \"What if I say I can.\"\n\"Y-YOU CAN?!\"\nAgain, Leo scoffed and wiggled his finger, asking Wu Buyi to follow after him. The latter nodded and followed Leo into the woods.\nAfter walking 200 meters, they left the contaminated soil and found regular pine trees and grasses. Although there were traces of Cat's rampage in the area, most of the plants were green.\nLeo pointed at the grass and plants, \"Are they immortal grasses?\"\n\"No. Of course not, senior. Those are plain grasses.\"I think you should take a look at\n\"Good.\"\nLeo took off his gloves and uprooted a stalk of grass. The grass blades instantly turned black. He then showed it to Wu Buyi.\n\"Is this immortal grass?\"\nWu Buyi gasped for a moment. Then, he bit his lower lip and prostrate to the ground.\n\"PLEASE FORGIVE ME! I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU!\"\n\"Meh, forget it. Now that you know, keep your mouth shut.\"\n\"YES, SENIOR!\"\nLeo placed his hand on a pine tree, mutating it into an iron pine tree. As usual, he hugged and uprooted it. He put the entire log on the ground and began harvesting iron nuts and leaves. He also tossed a handful of mutated pine nuts toward Wu Buyi.\n\"Do you know what they are?\"\n\"Umm, pine nuts, senior?\"\n\"Wrong. They are iron pine nuts. You can make iron grain pills with them. One iron pine nut, one starch, one metal catalyst, and Fire Qi is all you need. But if you use multiple essences like me, you will get element grain pills.\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior!\"\nWu Buyi never heard of this recipe before even though he was an expert alchemist for decades. He took notes and kept the nuts in his spatial rings.\nHowever, Leo didn't stop there. He pointed at the fallen tree and ordered Wu buyi.\n\"The leaves of the tree can be used as metal element catalysts. There are also plenty of nuts here. Go and collect everything.\"\n\"YES, SENIOR!\"\nWu Buyi quickly collected nuts and leaves. With a spatial ring, Wu Buyi finished harvesting within two minutes. Meanwhile, Leo observed Wu Buyi how the latter used the ring as storage, learning from watching.\n.\nLeo led Wu Buyi back to the store. While walking Leo resumed asking him about spatial rings.\n\"Tell me about the rings. How can I use them? Teach me like I'm six years old.\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior.\"\nWu Buyi stopped hesitating or questioning Leo. He taught the Florida Man like how he taught his disciples.\n\"These rings are called \"Spatial Rings\". The Situ Clan and the Fang Clan are in charge of mass-producing them. There are two types of rings – locked rings and ownerless rings, but we'll talk about them later. Every cultivator can simply insert a strand of Qi into the ring and fetch the items you seek from the pocket space, granted that they are ownerless rings. Also…\"\nWu Buyi explained the nature of locked rings and ownerless ones. He also taught Leo how to deposit items into the rings.\nBy the time they returned to the store, Wu Buyi finished his lecture. However, Leo looked dissatisfied.\nLeo had no idea what Qi or essence was. So far, he had been using his saliva as \"Essence\" instead of using inner energy or superpower. He wanted to ask Wu Buyi to teach him how to use Qi, but his face wasn't thick enough to do so.\nFor the moment, Leo got what he wanted. As for the ring issues, he would eventually solve them. He kept the ring that Wu Buyi had given him. Then, he entered the store and fetched a new bottle of Rejuvenate Tea and threw it toward Wu Buyi.\nThe alchemist received it and noticed the tea's quality. He widely grinned, \"Thank you, master!\"\nLeo scoffed, \"Next time, buy it with your own lifespan. If you don't have anything else to do, go home. I'm going to work on my store.\"\n\"Yes, master!\"\nWu Buyi deeply bowed and flew back to Magpie City, heading back to Life Sword Sect.\nMeanwhile, Leo didn't notice how Wu Buyi had been addressing him. It changed from \"Fellow Daoist\" to \"Senior\", and then \"Senior\" to \"Master\". His mind was occupied with countless plans and the shopping system.\nAfter Wu Buyi was gone, Leo rushed and began upgrading his store, aiming to raise the alchemy workshop's quality to the max.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 45 – Florida Man Discovers New Giant Potato Species, Turns Everything into French Fries\nWith 41,663 years of lifespan to spend, Leo planned his expansion. He upgraded the workshops to level 4, using 2,000 years. Then, he increased the pill quality to level 3.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 4\nProduction Quality Level – (3/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nAs usual, the next upgrade required the general store building level 5, and it would be costly. Since Leo had no issue with lifespan, he continued upgrading the general store building.\nDING\n<Will you upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 5?>\n<Upgrading requires 4,000 years of lifespan.>\n\"No problem! Do it!\"\nDING\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 5.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nRUMBLE\nThe store building trembled as the interior space expanded once again. Leo inspected the size and widely grinned.\nPreviously, the interior space was 20x20. After the upgrade, it became 25x25. The 625 square meters of space, modern LED lighting, and air conditioners had the same standard as modern convenience stores. The wooden floor was covered by seamless white marble tiles, making the store brighter.\nLeo rushed to the store's back room right away, wondering if his bedroom expanded.\n\"YESSSS!\"\nAs Leo had expected, it got bigger, but there were changes. The previous one-door entrance became a double-door model, and the backdoor behind the storeroom also became the same type. The previous hole that Leo had made were sealed and replaced with double metal doors.\nSatisfied with the changes, Leo scanned the corners of the store next, hoping for a modern toilet.\n\"NOOO!!\"\nUnfortunately, the humble general store didn't follow Japan's standards. No restroom or toilet existed for customers.\nLeo was dejected. He walked randomly into the store and deeply sighed, preparing to rearrange the fridges and shelves once again. As Leo kept walking, he found a partitioned section next to his bedroom. He stopped thinking, then he checked the new area.\nThere was a small room hiding in a corner. Leo approached the wooden door and opened it. Then, he discovered what he always desired.\nA modern toilet for employees was right in front of him.\n\"YEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHH!!\"\nLeo fell on his knees and kissed the toilet bowl. He hugged it and cried.\n\"I missed you so much! I'm tired of outhouses!\"\nAt long last, Leo could take the number two without getting stalked by a certain dung eater. Although this toilet came without a bidet, Leo was fine with it. If he wanted to, he could always purchase a bidet from the online shopping system to install it later.\nStill, the existence of the toilet brought new questions.\nWhere does the water go?\nWhere does the waste go?\nLeo didn't remember installing a water system or a septic tank under the store. He was also afraid that the toilet wasn't connected to any drainage system, and that the toilet's content might flood the restroom as soon as he flushed the toilet.\nHe looked inside the room and found the standard face-washing basin and a mirror. He opened the faucet, checking if the water ran.\nZAAAA\nThe water ran, and Leo was baffled.\nWhere does this water come from?!\nLeo scooped the water and drank it. It tasted exactly like tap water in the modern world.\nAs disciplined as he was, Leo turned off the faucet, saving the water. He then flushed the toilet to see if the water would flood the restroom.\nZAAAA\nThe water flowed normally as the blue water refilled the bowl. Nothing leaked from the bottom of the toilet, and there was no smell.\nLeo had the urge to remove the toilet to see the water system. But since the system could magically upgrade electric appliances, he left the toilet be. After all, there was no point in learning how every atom in the world worked or existed.\nAfter getting the store to level five, Leo resumed his routine. He upgraded the two workshops to level five as well.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 5\nProduction Quality Level – (4/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nIf Leo could upgrade the workshops one more time, the production quality level would max out. He was excited to see how his future pills would come out.\nAfter spending 8,000 years of lifespan, Leo was left with 33,663 years. He continued shopping and browsed the domain system, looking at the buildable structures.\n.\nWarehouse\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nSmall House\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nFarm Plot\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nFarm Plot (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 5\nPrice – 1,000 Years of LifespanI think you should take a look at\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nGranary\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 5\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nStone Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 1 Year of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nAsphalt Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 3 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nConcrete Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 5 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nOnly the second farm plot and a granary were added to the list. Looking at the icons, Leo couldn't decide which structure to build first. But since Leo loved being productive, he chose to build two farm plots first.\nLeo came out of the store and opened the domain map menu. As he had cleared the land around the main general store, he had plenty of room to place new farms. Leo dropped the two 10x10 farmland ten grids south of the store, aka in front of the store.\nAs soon as Leo confirmed the construction, the land in front of the store was flattened. The dark dirt was automatically plowed and softened, suitable to plant any seed.\nLeo giggled and carried a sack of seeds that Wu Buyi had given him days ago. He dropped the sack in the middle of the first farm plot and touched the soil.\nDING\nSuddenly, the area lit up, and the system showed the farm's status.\n<Please allocate your point. Your current free point: 1.>\n.\nBasic Farmland Level 1\nAutomaton Farmer – (0/1)\nGrowth Speed Level – (0/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (0/5)\nProduction Quantity Level – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\n\"Hmm?\"\nIt was different from the workshop - Alchemy workshops came with a pre-assigned point, but the farmland allowed Leo to choose.\nWithout hesitation, Leo spent 4,000 years of his lifespan, upgrading the two farmlands to level five. Then, he assigned five points to quality. He rushed to the second farm and did the same.\nInstantly, 8,000 years of lifespan were gone. Leo was left with 23,663 years of lifespan.\n.\nBasic Farmland Level 5\nAutomaton Farmer – (0/1)\nGrowth Speed Level – (0/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5) (Max)\nProduction Quantity Level – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\n\"Alright!\"\nLeo hummed as he bought a hoe from the shopping system to plow the land. But again, as soon as his tool hit the farmland, the system prompted him with a message.\n<Please drop your seeds on the farm to cultivate (0/100).>\n\"…\"\nLeo crossed his arms, looking at the system message. He deeply sighed.\n\"I guess I'm a real CULTIVATOR (farmer), now. Damn!\"\nWithout adequate farming knowledge, Leo randomly picked one hundred seeds from the sack and scattered them around the farmland.\nDING\n<27/100>\n<40/100>\nThe number kept going up. Leo giggled and kept spreading the seeds. When the number hit the requirement, the message changed.\nDING\n<Cultivating…>\nSimilar to the workshop cauldrons, a timer appeared above the farmland. However, there was a piece of additional information.\n<Time: 59 Minutes, 55 Seconds…>\n<Possible Result: Unidentified Potato 100 %.>\n\"One hour?!\" Leo was stunned. \"Are you beansprouts?! Why do you grow so fast?!\"\nWhile standing on the farm, the seeds that Leo had randomly thrown sank into the soil. Then, gold sprouts emerged from the ground.\nLeo gulped and stood there, waiting for the plants to mature. Leo forgot that he had another farm he hadn't planted anything yet.\n10 minutes passed. The potato plants reached knee height. At a glance, they looked mature enough to be harvested, but they continued growing.\n30 minutes later, every potato plant was chest high. The farmland turned into a mini jungle.\nWhen the timer was over, every plant was a head taller than Leo. He gasped and gazed at the massive plants in awe. Then, he slowly uprooted a plant, and a massive head of potato came out.\nThe massive potato was three meters deep in the soil, and its glossy skin lustered in gold color. The potato was boiling hot even though Leo hadn't done anything to it, and it gave out a burnt sweet potato scent.\nLeo salivated. The smell reminded him of a fast-food franchise.\n\"How many French Fries can I make with these?!\"",

After pulling out the 3-meter-long gold potato, Leo harvested more.\nWhen Leo was done, the farmland self-repaired itself, reverting to the soft-plowed land with black dirt. Meanwhile, Leo gawked at the pile of massive radioactive potatoes, sitting on the south of the farmland. The majority of potatoes came out smaller than the first one while a few had the same size. They emitted the pleasant scent of boiled sweet potatoes even though they were raw.\nLeo picked the smallest piece, which was as big as his entire body. He patted off the dirt and peeled its skin with his fingernails. Then, he took a bite.\nThe texture was soft and hot. It also tasted exactly like sweet potatoes.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Similar to wolf meat – A mouthful of potato gave Leo a year of lifespan. Moreover, it was delicious.\nHowever, it lacked something important. It lacked sauces!\nLeo cut a small piece of potato there to research. He rushed to the first workshop and fetch a handful of tomatoes. Then, he brought them to the alchemy cauldron.\nDING\nHe researched the potato first, hoping to see something good.\n.\nVirgin Yang Potato (Perfect-Grade)\nCan only be found in a mystic realm with a hot and wet climate. It's a rare breed that instantly grows by absorbing fire essence from the ground and environment. However, it also instantly withers within a few minutes after it has been harvested. Alchemists value it highly as Virgin Yang Potatoes are a rare catalyst for yang-type cultivation pills. Can also be used as a substitute for starch in cooking.\n[Traits]\nIncrease a massive amount of lifespan (consumption)\nGuarantee 100% pill-refinement success chance if used as a catalyst\nExtremely delicious!\n.\nFiery Yang Tomato\nCan only be found in a mystic realm in a hot climate. It contains a thick amount of Fire Essence, and it can be refined into fire-type cultivation pills. Chefs also love them as they make good tomato sauce, though they are a little spicier than regular tomatoes.\n[Pill Recipe – Yang Flame Dan]\nOne Virgin Yang Tomato\nOne Yang Catalyst\nFire Element Catalyst\nFire Essence\n.\nLeo giggled as the tomatoes and the new potatoes suited each other. He tested them by trying to make some pills first. As Leo hated multi-tasking, he brought two sets of ingredients and filled the two cauldrons at once.\nDING\nThe cauldrons rumbled and automatically closed the lids. A timer appeared.\n2 Hours, 59 Minutes, 58 Seconds\n\"Three hours, huh?\"\nLeo disliked the long waiting time. Moreover, he had one more issue – The potatoes could quickly go bad!\nLeo rushed back to the pile of potatoes, hoping that they would still be fresh. Unfortunately, it was too late. When Leo got back, all potatoes, including the half-eaten one, already turned purple. It only took less than five minutes for them to rot.\nLeo shrugged and deeply sighed. They might look inedible by a human standard, but his stomach was different. Not wasting the food, he grabbed the purple potatoes and continued eating them as if nothing had happened. The premium taste was gone, replaced by the moldy odor and moss.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\n<You are immune to Yang Poison.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\n<You are immune to Yang Poison.>\n<Your lifespan…>\n…\nAn hour later, all harvested potatoes withered and transformed into black soil. Leo gazed at the half-eaten potato, which turned into black dirt.\nThis was the primary issue of this plant - They grew fast, but they also died early. Leo wished he could have magic that could stop food from going bad.\nThinking of a place to store food, Leo recalled that he hadn't constructed some system buildings yet. He threw the dirt away and explored the shop domain system.\nGranary and warehouse building icons in the system window shone, standing out from the rest. Leo pursed his lips, wondering if they were a waste of lifespan or if they could solve the storage issues. As he had nothing to lose but lifespan, Leo tried building a granary, placing the 5x5-grid building south of the farmland.\nA small 25-square-meter hut appeared. Leo deeply sighed in disappointment and touched the small frame of the hut's door, wondering if it was upgradeable.\nLeo was surprised. The system prompted him with a message.\n<Will you upgrade the Granary Level 1 to Level 2?>\n.\nGranary Level 1\nStorage Size Level – (1/5)\nFood Preservation Level – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThere weren't many things to choose from. However, the food preservation option was the most attractive here. Leo pressed the text, wondering if the system would be kind enough to tell him what effect it would give.\nDING\nA new window popped up, showing the detail.\n.\nFood Preservation Level 1I think you should take a look at\n– Prevent pests, worms, insects, and rats from entering the granary.\n- Preserve food and prevent food deterioration for one week.\nFood Preservation Level 2\n– Prevent small animals from entering the granary.\n- Preserve food and prevent food deterioration for two weeks.\nFood Preservation Level 3\n– Prevent large animals from entering the granary.\n- Preserve food and prevent food deterioration for one month.\nFood Preservation Level 4\n- No unauthorized humans, cultivators, spirits, monsters, or demons can enter the granary.\n- Preserve food and prevent food deterioration for three months.\nFood Preservation Level 5\n- No microorganism, germ, bacteria, fungi, or virus can enter the granary.\n- Preserve food and prevent food deterioration for one year.\n.\nLeo's jaw dropped. He finally understood the usefulness of the granary. Without hesitation, Leo quickly upgraded the granary to level 5. Then, he put two points to the food preservation level right away.\nBut before Leo put any point to the storage size level, he examined the interior of the granary first. He opened the small door and looked inside.\nIt was as small as the exterior as it only covered 25 square meters. It was not enough to store Leo's massive crops.\nLeo left the granary and put two points into the storage level. Then, he rechecked the structure again.\nRUMBLE\nThe outward appearance of the granary improved, but it still looked like a small cabin. The building had a double-door entrance, and it was 2.5 meters high, which seemed too big for a small structure.\nBut when Leo got inside, he had a déjà vu. The storage room was many times larger than it appeared. Similar to what had happened to his general store, the interior space was expanded while the exterior remained the same.\nLeo looked at the ceiling and measured it with his eyes. It was as least 5-6 meters high. Then, he paced in the store and looked at the clean marble floor. After walking for 30 minutes, he managed to roughly guess the dimension.\n'At least 100x100 dimension. DAMN, it's huge!'\nHe reopened the granary status and rechecked its description. This time, he pressed the storage size level text to see the detail.\n.\nGranary Level 5\nStorage Size Level – (3/5)\nFood Preservation Level – (2/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nStorage Size Level 1 – 25 x 25 m\nStorage Size Level 2 –50 x 50 m\nStorage Size Level 3 – 100 x 100 m\nStorage Size Level 4 – 150 x 150 m\nStorage Size Level 5 – 250 x 250 m\n.\nLeo almost cried. For once, his investment was worth every penny. He wished he had known about its secret and built it earlier.\nAs the food issues were solved, Leo resumed growing crops. He scattered seeds to the two farmland, growing more potatoes.\nOne hour later, the two 100sqmt farmlands produced 200 giant heads of Virgin Yang Potatoes. Leo dug them all by hand and stored them in the massive granary. Then, he sat there, watching the mountain of gold.\n10 minutes passed. The food didn't change.\n30 minutes later, nothing rotted. The hot potatoes still looked fresh and the sweet scent made Leo hungry again.\nLeo shed a manly tear. He prostrated to the ground and kissed the marble floor of the granary.\nHis food was secured. He had enough French fries for life!\nAfter securing his source of French fries, Leo returned to his original plan, aka making ketchup and sauces. He skipped and danced back to the workshop.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo's action didn't escape Cat's eyes. It widely grinned.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nIt stalked Leo and waited for him to go into the workshop building. As soon as he went in to fetch some tomatoes, Cat nimbly climbed down and sprinted toward the granary. As the doors were large, Cat managed to slip inside to see the interior.\nFood Preservation Level 2 did not grant Leo enough security to repel Cat, who was a monster plant, from accessing the granary. As a result, Cat easily got in.\n\"MYAAA?!\"\nCat was surprised when it found the massive interior space and the mountain of gold potatoes. It salivated as the scent was irresistible.\nAs the previous elixir grain pill's effect had already worn off, Cat could eat hard food again. It climbed the potato mountain. Then, it started nom-noming.\nNobody noticed Cat's dao avatar spirit, who had been following the plant around. The infant shone in gold light as it absorbed the virgin yang energy from its master.\nThe infant spirit's eyes glittered, and she widely smiled. She faded and disappeared into Cat's body, and the plant also emitted gold light.\nCREAK\nThe eye parasites suddenly sank into Cat's skin. Then, a small head of a tan-skinned little girl emerged, and the prosthetic eyes became her eyes. She slowly pushed her head out, extending her body out of the chomper's head.\nThe little baby girl laughed. As she and the large chomper mouth were the same body and soul, they meowed in unison.\n\"Meow <3\"",

As he had learned from the granary, he built a warehouse behind the first alchemy workshop. Then, he checked its upgradeable features.\n.\nWarehouse Level 1\nWarehouse Automaton Level - (0/5)\nStorage Size Level – (1/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nDifferent from the granary, the warehouse offered automaton workers, which seemed odd. Leo was puzzled about what the warehouse workers could contribute to this building, so he pressed on the text, hoping to see its detail.\nDING\nLeo wasn't disappointed. A new window appeared, explaining how the worker would do.\n.\nAutomaton Worker Level 1\n- Enable one warehouse automaton\n- Automaton will automatically gather items in the shop domain that exists in your warehouse.\nAutomaton Worker Level 2\n- Enable two warehouse automatons\n- Retain the previous operation function.\n- Increase automatons' traveling speed by 20%.\nAutomaton Worker Level 3\n- Enable three warehouse automatons\n- Retain the previous operation function.\n- Automatons can explore outside of the shop domain for resources.\n- Increase automatons' traveling speed and gathering speed by 30%.\nAutomaton Worker Level 4\n- Enable four warehouse automatons\n- Retain the previous operation functions.\n- Automatons can mine minerals, chop wood, and collect food resources inside and outside the shop domain.\n- Increase automatons' traveling speed, gathering speed, and carry limit by 50%.\nAutomaton Worker Level 5\n- Enable five warehouse automatons\n- Retain the previous operation functions.\n- Automatons can hunt and butcher animals for meat and other resources.\n- Automatons can retaliate if provoked or attacked first.\n- Increase automatons' traveling speed, gathering speed, and carry limit by 100%.\n- Increase automatons' strength, stamina, agility, and dexterity by 100%.\n.\nOnce again, Leo regretted not building a warehouse earlier. He smacked his forehead and upgraded the warehouse to level five. Then, he increased the workshop size to level four and added one level to the automaton feature.\nThe physical appearance of the warehouse changed from a hut to a concrete house with a massive double door. However, the interior of the building expanded to 22,500 sqm, which was larger than the general store's space. The ceiling was also taller than the granary.\nCRACK-CREAK\nA wooden humanoid mannequin rose up from the ground. It stood on two legs while its arms dangled. Its face had two camera lenses, serving as its eyes. However, it had no mouth or nose.\nLooking at the round head of the human-sized wooden doll, Leo wondered how he would order it to work. It simply stood there, staring forward in a daze.\nLeo patted its head, checking if he could summon a system window to command it. Unfortunately, nothing happened. After pondering for a few minutes, Leo remembered that the description told him to add an item to the warehouse first.\nHe pushed a large bin of blue stones and essence stones into the warehouse. Then, he placed it at the center of the building.\nBefore Leo could walk out, the automaton mannequin turned around and walked toward another large bin behind the workshop. Although it walked like a ragdoll, it moved its arms, pushing the bin toward the warehouse.\nLeo watched it work. The doll was a lot slower than him as it didn't have the same superman strength. It took a few minutes for the doll to bring a large bin full of blue stones to the building.\nThe automaton didn't stop there. As soon as the bin entered the warehouse, its head turned 360 degrees as it observed the warehouse's space. Then, it pushed the second bin toward the deepest part of the warehouse and carefully arranged it there. It moved to the first bin and brought it next to the second container afterward.\nSeeing how it automatically arranged the warehouse, Leo was satisfied. He left the doll alone to fetch other resources, which he had stored in the first alchemy workshop. He spent hours moving the food-related alchemy ingredients to the granary, and he tossed in some iron tree bark and iron pine nuts into the warehouse, letting the automaton recognize the collectible resources.\nDING\nAfter three hours passed, the workshops completed the Yang Flame Dan. Leo stopped what he was doing and went to the cauldron to see the result.\nWhen Leo opened the first cauldron's lid, 30 red Ping-Pong-sized balls were covered in flame, and they hovered over the pot. The flame balls were suspended there, waiting to be collected.\nNot afraid of the fire, Leo took off his gloves and grabbed one of them with his bare hand.\nDING\n<The Basic Alchemy Workshop Level 5 has refined 15 Medium-Grade, 13 High-Grade, and 2 Superior Yang Flame Dans.>\n.\nMedium-Grade Yang Flame Dan\nIncrease physical strength by 25% for 120 Hours\nIncrease fire essence by 50 years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease yang Qi by 50 Years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease lifespan by 5 years\n.\nHigh-Grade Yang Flame Dan\nIncrease physical strength by 35% for 168 Hours\nIncrease fire essence by 70 years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease yang Qi by 70 Years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease lifespan by 7 years\n.\nSuperior-Grade Yang Flame Dan\nIncrease physical strength by 50% for 240 Hours\nIncrease fire essence by 100 years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease yang Qi by 100 Years' worth of cultivation\nIncrease lifespan by 10 years\n.\nThe pill quality made a difference. Leo was glad that he had upgraded the workshop correctly. At long last, Leo had proper cultivation pills for cultivators.\n'These balls are similar to wolf Fenrir Dantian Pills. Speaking of which, I only have two sets of materials. I should upgrade the workshop's quality to the max first.'\nLeo collected the cultivation balls and stored them in an empty Tupperware in the warehouse. Afterward, he queued the cauldrons to make more cultivation pills. Then, he rechecked his remaining lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 14,688 Years…>\n\"Hold up. Where does all my lifespan go?\"\nNoticing that a lot of his lifespan was gone, Leo was shocked. A shopping spree could sometimes be financially dangerous as money could vanish in a flash.\nLeo had planned to upgrade the store to level six, but upon seeing how little he had, Leo changed his mind. He stopped the upgrade project and summoned the shopping system. Afterward, he searched for a language skill that he had bookmarked a few days ago.\nDING\n[Divine Shang Language Auto-Speech Translation] – 20,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Divine Shang Language Reading Comprehension Knowledge] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nLeo smacked his forehead. He no longer had enough lifespan to buy the auto-speech translation feature. However, he still had enough for the reading skill.\nAlthough vexing, Leo purchased the reading comprehension skill so that he could read books of this world.I think you should take a look at\nDING\n<Integrating knowledge, please do not move…>\nTwo hundred small floating system panels appeared and surrounded Leo. Strong rays of light burst out, followed by the intense pain that stunned Leo. His vision blurred, and he was forced to kneel.\nLeo remembered this feeling. It always happened whenever his cancer cells and his DNA evolved. Every time it happened, he always fell unconscious for days or months. The last time, it took him six months to recover. Leo was afraid that he might black out for a year this time.\nThe two hundred system windows vanished, and the system congratulated him.\nDING\n<Divine Shang Language Reading Comprehension Skill has been successfully installed.>\n\"…\"\nSurprisingly, Leo didn't faint. The pain vanished like smoke. His vision slowly recovered, and he regained his body balance. Leo stood up while he massaged his temples.\n\"What was that?\"\nLeo dragged his feet and looked for a sacred wood block to sit on. However, as Cat stole all sacred wood, he found nothing in front of his store. Noticing that his precious sacred wood chairs were gone, Leo yelled at Cat.\n\"DAMN CAT! DID YOU EAT MY FREAKING CHAIRS?!\"\nBecause of his loud noise, Cat rushed out of the granary. As soon as \"she\" left the building, Leo noticed her.\nSeeing how Cat emerged from his precious granary, Leo was enraged. He felt like his pet had sneaked into his fridge and eaten the food inside.\n\"DAMN CAT! YOU ATE MY POTATOES, DIDN'T YOU?!\"\n\"MYAAA!!\"\nCat ran away. She sprinted, using her roots like spider legs.\nAfter Cat vanished into the forest, Leo scratched his head and rushed inside the granary to see the carnage - Pieces of potatoes and dirt scattered all over the floor. Two of the giant potatoes were half-eaten, but the rest was soiled and scratched by Cat's thorny vines, roots, and branches.\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply sighed. Although he was angry, he wasn't heartless enough to hit the innocent creature. Moreover, Leo could simply grow more potatoes to replace the damaged ones, so there was no point getting mad at Cat. He fetched a broom in the alchemy workshop and cleaned the place. As for the small pieces of potatoes, he collected them to a corner, planning to either use them as cat food or alchemy materials later.\n.\n.\nLate morning of the same day, Wu Buyi returned to Life Sword Sect. He headed back to the alchemy quarter, but he ran into his colleague.\nHan Hao, who was in charge of preparing the mystic realm gate, found the returning alchemist. He stopped what he was doing to greet the guy.\n\"Hey, how's business, you lazy bum?\" Han Hao sneered at Wu Buyi.\n\"Excellent! My lifespan is now over 4,000!\"\n\"…\"\nThe corners of Han Hao's mouth twitched. He was envious and annoyed that Wu Buyi ditched the sect's work for a side job. Thus, he reminded Wu Buyi.\n\"Don't forget about the mystic realm opening. There are less than 2 weeks left, and we don't have enough healing pills for the participants.\"\nHearing about the mystic realm, Wu Buyi remembered that he hadn't heard about the quota of the sect yet, \"What about the quota selection? Have the sect master decided?\"\n\"Yeah. Five elders, two deacons, one core disciple, one inner disciple, and one outer disciple.\"\n\"What about me? Do I get the elder slot?\"\nHan Hao cackled, \"Of course not. You missed the selection meeting. Why would anybody vote to send you?\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nWu Buyi's expression turned ugly as he missed this season's expedition. Still, he instantly recovered and grinned as he no longer needed to rely on the mystic realm to grow stronger.\nHe had 4,000 years to live. Why should he compete for a trivial travel ticket?\n\"Fine. Anyway, care for a drink?\"\nWu Buyi brought out a bottle of rejuvenate tea that he got from Leo. Seeing the juice, Han Hao drooled and repeatedly nodded, \"Yes! Yes! Right away, my good friend.\"\n\"Tsk, you two-face geezer.\"\n\"Hehehe. Why should I decline such a delicacy? Come on, let us drink that premium tea!\"\nBoth men laughed and flew toward Han Hao's pagoda.\n.\nWu Buyi and Han Hao forgot about work and enjoyed the delicious tea. However, one liter of tea could not last long. 20 minutes later, the bottle was empty.\nBoth men looked at the empty bottle and deeply sighed. They wished they had a dozen bottles of rejuvenate tea to enjoy.\nWu Buyi thought of Leo's shop. He remembered that there were a dozen bottles in the fridges, and it only cost 200 years of lifespan per bottle. With his membership, the price would only be 180. He counted his fingers, calculating if he should sacrifice a couple thousand years of his life for such luxury.\nWhile Wu Buyi was in deep thought, Han Hao asked, \"Stinky crook, you went to the capital city, right?\"\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"\n\"Have you met Ouyang Long?\"\n\"Ah…\"\nWu Buyi remembered the incident. He sweated profusely, wondering if he should tell his friend.\nHan Hao continued asking, \"I bet Ouyang Long knows about his son's death, and he must be dying to come here and find the killer. Say, damn crook, I heard an airship pass by. Was it Ouyang Long's ship?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi didn't know what to explain. He was afraid that Han Hao might have a heart attack if he revealed the truth.\nMeanwhile, Han Hao noticed the strange expression of Wu Buyi. He frowned, \"Why are you nervous? Something happened?\"\n\"Umm, there is an issue…\" Wu Buyi fidgeted, unable to craft the right words to explain.\n\"…\"\nHan Hao suspected his colleague. He stopped looking at his face and scanned through Wu Buyi's clothes and belongings with his eyes and Qi. Then, he noticed an aura of a premium flying sword, which Wu Buyi had put it next to his chair.\n\"Where did you get that flying sword? I have a feeling that I have seen it somewhere before.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Also, isn't that a treasure sword behind you? I thought you hated practicing swordsmanship. Why are you carrying a sword artifact? And why the hell hasn't your aura merged with the sword? Is it not yours?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi couldn't hide it anymore. He slowly pulled out a name token from his sleeve pocket and put it on a table in front of them.\nIt was the name token of Ouyang Long.\nWu Buyi took several deep breaths to calm down while Han Hao's eyes were almost ejected out from the eye sockets due to shock. Then, the former confessed.\n\"Daoist Florida Man has killed Ouyang Long. He's dead.\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nBoth men remained quiet for five minutes, and their expressions were dark and solemn, maintaining Kenshiro-like faces. Han Hao's hand didn't stop shaking as he reached out to pick up the name token to see up close. Then, he asked in a hoarse voice.\n\"… When did it happen?\"\n\"Umm, last night.\"\n\"… Wasn't Ouyang Long as strong as our sect master?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"… And how is Daoist Florida Man? Is he injured?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"… And how did Ouyang Long die?\"\n\"Daoist Florida Man instantly turns him to ash. I don't know how.\"\n\"… Was the fight fierce?\"\n\"One-sided. Ouyang Long died in one move.\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao and Wu Buyi's expressions were solemn. The former slowly stood and muttered.\n\"... Let's run away.\"\n\"But why?!\"\n\"I DON'T CARE!\" Han Hao cried a river, \"I DON'T WANNA DIE! THE JIANGHU ALLIANCE'S GOONS ARE GOING TO SWARM OUR SECT! WE NEED TO CONVINCE OUR SECT MASTER TO GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 48 – Arrest Warrants Issued against Florida Man for Allegedly Disintegrating Corrupted Cop to Ash\n200 kilometers north of Cauliflower City was Frozen King City, the home of the Ouyang Clan. Unlike regular towns and cities, the entire population consisted of slaves and servants of the family while the people with Ouyang surname controlled the administrative offices.\nIn short, this place was the Ouyang Clan's domain.\nNot only the Ouyang Clan was wealthy enough to establish and govern a city, but they also had a deep background. Every daughter and maiden of the Ouyang Clan was sent to marry prominent lords and talented cultivators around the world, drawing in top experts to join their clan and serve as their underlings. They used these top experts to train their combat slaves and soldiers, increasing their military prowess.\nBecause of their military power and wealth, their family earned a seat in the Jianghu Alliance, which upheld the judicial system – Their purpose was to eliminate evil sects and enforce the laws in this chaotic world, where cultivators ran rampant.\nWith the authority power in their hands, Ouyang Clan became the most influential family on the mainland. However, someone recently offended them.\n.\nIn the main house of the Ouyang Family, the patriarch of the Ouyang Clan, Ouyang Zi, sat on the throne in a large meeting hall, gazing at the 11 elders and the grand elder of the Ouyang Clan, who gathered here to answer the summon.\nA red carpet at the center of the room was the only empty place. The elders sat on their honored seats, located on the sides of the carpet. Their chairs faced the center of the room, forcing them to look at the other elders on the opposite side of the room. Meanwhile, two hundred entourage, servants, and children of the elders stood behind them, listening and observing the meeting.\nOuyang Zi had a long grey braided beard. His fur helmet hid his hairless head, and he wore a black fur coat on top of his robes as the temperature of the Phoenix city was always under minus 30 degrees Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit). Because of his large physique, big muscle, and his 7'4 height, he was a giant among men.\nThe crowd also wore multiple layers of robes while some sported fur coats like the patriarch. However, they looked tiny in front of their clan leader.\nOuyang Zi tossed the broken Life Candle of Ouyang Long to the middle of the room and informed everybody of disturbing news.\n\"Ouyang Long is dead.\"\n\"…\"\nAll elders stared at the broken candle in silence. The grand elder closed his eyes while the other members frowned.\nThe grand elder asked, \"Patriarch, who killed him?\"\n\"A soul formation rogue cultivator.\"\n\"A rogue cultivator? Soul formation stage?\"\nThe elders were puzzled. Considering Ouyang Long's strength and wisdom, he shouldn't have been so weak to the point that he got killed by a soul formation cultivator. Even if he lost, he should have easily escaped.\n\"Doesn't he have the fastest flying sword, the Cugatti? Even if he lost all his limbs, he shouldn't have died.\"\nThe patriarch shook his head, \"Ouyang Long didn't have a chance. He died in one move.\"\nThe elders widened their eyes and murmured, exclaiming and chatting with their subordinates behind them. The noise was so loud that Ouyang Zi smacked the armrest with his fist to silence them.\nBOOM\nThe wooden armrest was broken. However, Ouyang Zi opened his palm and released his wood essence. A few seconds later, the wooden armrest grew from the wooden chair and restored itself.\nAfter repairing his chair with his power, Ouyang Zi bellowed.\n\"Order!\"\nThe crowd stopped talking. They looked at their clan leader, waiting for further instructions.\nSeeing that the crowd shut their mouths, Ouyang Zi proceeded with the first agenda, \"We will select a new representative to replace Ouyang Long. I want new candidates. Any suggestion?\"\nEvery elder looked at each other for a moment before they turned to the grand elder, whose strength was second after the patriarch. One of them stepped up and saluted Ouyang Zi.\n\"I would like to nominate Lord Ouyang Ke.\"\nThe rest of the elders also stood up, \"We believe senior Ouyang Ke is the right candidate.\"\nOuyang Zi nodded. He then looked at the grand elder, \"What do you think? Care to work at the Jianghu Alliance?\"\nOuyang Ke was already 330 years old. His thin stature and wrinkled skin made him look like a dried mummy. His long white hair and thick white eyebrows covered half of his face but highlighted his deep eyes. Every youngster often mistook him for a ghost, and they were scared of him. In addition, his cultivation base was at the soul formation stage, and he was one step away from reaching the soul transformation rank, which was where Ouyang Zi had reached.\nAfter getting nominated, Ouyang Ke laughed. He leaned against his chair and sipped the rejuvenate tea, which he made for himself.\n\"I'm afraid I have to decline. I'm an alchemist, and I'm also a guest elder of World Tree Sect. I don't have time for politics.\"\nOuyang Zi agreed with Ouyang Ke. He turned to the elders, \"You heard him. My uncle is busy. Anybody else wishes to nominate another candidate?\"\nThe elders were disappointed. They looked at each other as nobody dared to nominate each other. After all, they didn't want to stand out and ire a certain someone.\nAs nobody spoke, the patriarch was disappointed. He baited them to get their attention.\n\"The next mystic realm expedition is 12 days away. The candidates will get to participate using our family's quota.\"\nThe elders were tempted, but they were afraid of something. They bit their lower lips, waiting for the others to take the bait.\nSuddenly, a young man behind the grand elder coughed. He looked at the patriarch and made a suggestion.\n\"Can I nominate myself?\"\n\"…\"\nThe elders bitterly smiled. Some of them let out a sigh of relief as THAT PERSON made a move himself.\nThe grand elder giggled while the patriarch deeply frowned. The latter asked the former.\n\"Are you allowing this, uncle?\"\n\"Why not?\" Ouyang Ke couldn't stop smiling. \"Sometimes, adults like us have to step back and let the next generation basks in the limelight. Since my grandson is confident, let him have it.\"\n\"We're talking about the Jianghu Alliance here. Do you think those undying geezers will allow it?\"\n\"It doesn't matter. Let him learn the ropes and expand his horizon.\"\n\"…\"\nOuyang Zi deeply sighed. He gazed at the youngster, whose cultivation base surpassed most of the people here.\nHe was Ouyang Feng, the grandchild of Ouyang Ke. He joined the Death Sword Sect and became the youngest nascent soul cultivator at the age of 18. Ouyang Feng was 25 this year, and he was at the pinnacle of the nascent soul realm, waiting for the right opportunity to break through.I think you should take a look at\nOuyang Feng was a stud among men. He had a handsome face, toned muscle, a tall physique, and light skin. His kept hair, black robes, and perfectly smooth skin made him attractive among the female servants and daughters of other clan members.\nLooking at the handsome youth, Ouyang Zi was reluctant.\n\"Are you sure you want this? Your opponents will be those soul-formation geezers in the alliance. They're going to bully you.\"\nOuyang Feng brightly smiled, \"More like they will offer their granddaughters to me as soon as they notice my talent!\"\nEverybody in the room burst into laughter. Even Ouyang Zi grinned.\n\"Alright. If you say so, go and dominate the alliance. Make it yours for our family!\"\n\"Yes, patriarch!\"\nThe elders in the room smiled, relieved that the scary guy got what he wanted. However, they still remembered an issue, which involved the death of Ouyang Long.\nOuyang Zi also noticed their expressions. He concluded the agenda.\n\"Alright. Since there is only one candidate, Ouyang Feng will be chosen as the new representative of our clan by default. Is that alright with you?\"\nThe elders saluted, \"We agree with you, patriarch!\"\n\"Good,\" Ouyang Zi paused to take a deep breath. Then, he moved on to the next important agenda.\n\"Next agenda, the killer of Ouyang Long. Justice must be upheld, and we will not allow anybody to tarnish our reputation! Unfortunately, we must also prepare for the mystic realm expedition so we cannot focus on revenge at the moment.\"\nThe elders looked disappointed as the patriarch didn't reveal the identity of the killer. They could only give up pursuing the matter until the end of the mystic realm season.\n\"However,\" Ouyang Zi continued. \"That doesn't mean we will give up on the criminal. I have the complete sketchs of the rogue cultivator that killed Ouyang Long!\"\nOuyang Zi waved his hand, and a thousand papers were ejected from his spatial rings. Everybody in the room immediately used their Qi to pull one of the papers into their hands.\nThe portrait of Leo was neatly drawn, and all papers were identical. Ouyang Feng also got his hand on it.\n\"Remember his face. Since he's strong, one of the sects might invite him to join their expedition team, and we might encounter him in the mystic realm. If anybody finds him in the mystic realm or somewhere on the mainland, contact me! Do not pick a fight with him or provoke him. Got it?!\"\nOuyang Feng, Ouyang Ke, and every clan member put the warrant papers in their clothes. Then, they saluted Ouyang Zi.\n\"We understand, patriarch!\"\n\"Good. You're dismissed, except for Ouyang Ke and Ouyang Feng. You two stay behind. We need to teach you what you need to do as a representative.\"\nThe elders deeply bowed and guided their followers to leave the meeting hall. As for the grand elder and his grandson, they remained in the hall.\nAfter everybody had left, Ouyang Zi brought out a cultivation pill and gave it to Ouyang Feng. Coincidentally, it was a Fenrir Dantian Pill, which another alchemist had made long ago. However, it was medium-grade, and it took the alchemist one entire year to refine this pill using three sets of ingredients.\n\"Feng'er. You cultivate poison Qi, right? This pill should bring you to the soul formation stage. Eat it when you find the right place to cultivate in the mystic realm.\"\nOuyang Feng accepted the pill in glee. He looked at the Fenrir Dantian Pill and smiled, \"Did Uncle Situ make this?\"\n\"No. It was someone from the Tang Clan. Tang Clan is the best in poison, and this pill is one of their specialties.\"\n\"Hahaha! Thank you, patriarch. I won't disappoint you!\"\n\"Good. Also, we need to talk about what you need to do…\"\nOuyang Ke and Ouyang Zi began teaching the young man about the etiquette, rules, and tasks he had to do. Also, they revealed the secret warehouse that they had entrusted to Ouyang Long.\nTwo hours later, they finished their lecture. Ouyang Zi reminded him, \"Be careful about your status as well. You might be as strong as many geezers out there, but you're still a member of the Death Sword Sect. Those hypocrites from the Life Sword Sect won't work with you, and the alchemist sects won't talk to you. However, you can always ask the Situ Clan to sell you some talismans and artifacts. Also, if possible, seduce the fairies of the Amazonian Sanctuary. As long you get their favor, you can use them to coax those virgin alchemists for their treasures and pills.\"\n\"I get it, patriarch! That's my forte!\"\n\"Haha. Good. Now, go!\"\nOuyang Feng bowed and left the meeting hall in joy. He looked forward to courting the fairies of the all-female cult, which only trained female cultivators.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Cat ran around in the forest. Her human infant torso practiced moving while her waist was still attached to the chomper's head. She ordered her lower parts to sit and rest while her branches extended and grabbed a few pine nuts to eat.\nCat put a raw pine nut in her human mouth at first. She tried crushing it with teethless gum.\n\"MYA!!\"\nShe regretted it. Her humanoid gum were too soft to crack the nut, and she hurt herself.\nStill, Cat didn't give up. She circulated metal Qi into her mouth, reinforcing the gum. A minute later, she retried.\nCRACK\nHer hardened gums easily crush the metal-like nut like a press machine, and she savored the wood-like taste. After chewing the entire outer skin of the nut to small pieces, she swallowed them all.\n\"Meow <3\"\nEating with a human mouth was different than the monster mouth as the tastebud was more sensitive. As for the monster's mouth, it was still useful for eating large food.\nWhile eating pine nuts in the forest, a small flying ship passed by, but it immediately turned around. One of the cultivators onboard jumped down and landed in front of Cat.\nThe person wore a thick triangle straw hat, and a thick veil covered the person's face. The long robes covered most of the skin, but the small wrinkled hands revealed her age and gender.\nCat looked at the female cultivator and tilted her head. Although the person looked different from the cultivators she had seen, Cat asked for a toll fee anyway.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nThe old lady giggled. She took off her hat and opened her cloth veil, revealing the face of a kind grandmother.\n\"Hello, child. How does an infant dryad like you manage to survive here all alone? Where is your parent?\"\n\"Meow?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 49 – Child Welfare Agents Concerned as Florida Man Let Infant Daughter Wander in Forest\nAmazonian Sanctuary was a lot different from cultivator sects and clans – It was similar to a charity organization, which sheltered and nurtured female martial artists and cultivators without seeking profits.\nIn this world, cultivators ran rampant and used their strength advantage to bully the weak. Beautiful women, elders, children, and commoners were usually abused and exploited. As a result, female cultivators banded together and created Amazonian Sanctuary to shelter and protect themselves. They also educated women on self-defense techniques. If they had a high aptitude for cultivation, elders of the sanctuary always took them in and trained them. However, they only accepted female disciples.\nCommoners favored the Sanctuary. Many people donated their food to show support for these female cultivators. Slowly over time, the sanctuary became a famous place for female cultivators to join. More young girls joined the sanctuary.\nWhen cultivators advanced through the ranks, their physique and appearance were refined. And when adult women refined their physiques, they became more beautiful. Soon, their reputation preceded them and brought them danger. Many sects and clans heard their fames and sent delegations to befriend them, hoping to seduce a few of their members to become their brides.\nTheir motives disgusted and terrified the sanctuary's women. As they were afraid of being seized by male cultivators, they trained harder, and they actively recruited strong prospects to become their sanctuary guardians.\nXu Nuan was a 113-year-old headhunting elder of the Amazonian Sanctuary, and she was in charge of recruiting prospects and talented women. Her specialties were monster beast taming and veterinary.\nPer the regulations of the sanctuary, Xu Nuan covered her appearance under the long thick veils that extended from her triangle straw hat. Her cloth mask and her green robes also hid most of her skin, except her hands.\nOriginally, Xu Nuan and her scout team planned to visit Magpie City in searching for talented young girls among the commoners. Their flying ship flew from Eiei Province from the east to the west, heading directly to the Life Sword Sect.\nHowever, along the way, Xu Nuan noticed a strong aura of a monster. As a tamer, she was interested in how a monster managed to survive near a cultivator city. Xu Nuan ordered the ship to stop. She then jumped down from her ship to inspect the monster.\nThen, Xu Nuan found a chomper plant monster. She noticed that the monster had already evolved several times, and she was about to condense her humanoid physique, judging from the upper torso that grew out from the monster's head.\n'A plant monster… Isn't this a dryad?'\nXu Nuan was surprised. She looked at the brown-skinned infant, who flailed her arms around as if she was not used to her new body. As an experienced veterinarian, she identified Cat's age instantly.\n'A-An infant?! She has just been born recently?! But her strength…'\nXu Nuan gulped. As a nascent soul cultivator, she could see her aura, but she couldn't see Cat's hidden dao avatar. Judging from the the intensity of Cat's Qi volume, the monster was as strong as her.\n'A 4th-stage monster? But she's still an infant! How can she reach this stage so fast? Even monster beasts in the mystic realms require at least 300 to 400 years to reach this stage. Right, does she have an owner or a parent?'\nWhile Xu Nuan pondered, Cat initiated the conversation first.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n'Huh? Hehe, she's funny.'\nXu Nuan felt like she was looking at an innocent monster child. She asked for Cat's origin.\n\"Hello, child. How does an infant dryad like you manage to survive here all alone? Where is your parent?\"\n\"Meow?\" Cat tilted both her heads.\nNoticing that Cat didn't understand her, Xu Nuan giggled and summoned her Dao Avatar. A spirit of a 5-meter-tall gorgeous maiden appeared. Her celestial robes barely covered anything, but nobody was there to admire the spirit's seductive body.\nThe spirit extended her hand and patted Cat's humanoid head. The large finger gently stroke her head and wiped the dirt off her face. Then, it disappeared.\nCat purred. She felt nice. Moreover, she felt like she understood Xu Nuan's thoughts.\n\"What's your name?\" Asked Xu Nuan.\n\"Meow!\"\nXu Nuan nodded. Just now, she connected her mind with Cat's, allowing them to directly communicate via telepathy. She slowly adapted to Cat's thoughts.\n\"Your name is Cat? Oh, you have a master, I see. Who is your master?\"\n\"Muu… Meow?\"\n\"Your master is… your father?\"\n\"Meow <3\"\n\"You love him, I see. He must be a good father.\"\n\"Meow! Meow, meow. Meow meow!\"\nCat didn't stop meowing. She narrated the battle between her and the mysterious assassins in black clothes. And then, when she was injured, Leo came to save her. He then defeated everybody instantly.\nXu Nuan didn't understand the meow language, but she perceived the thoughts and Cat's memory. She was astonished by the story, and she respected Leo, who fought to protect the little girl.\nAt first, Xu Nuan thought of taming Cat and bringing her back to the sanctuary. But after listening to her, Xu Nuan changed her mind.\nThere was no point in taking her away from a good parent. Instead, Xu Nuan wanted to meet Leo to satisfy her curiosity. After all, a man who treated a monster nicely couldn't be a bad person.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nUnfortunately, Cat was a glutton. She never forgot that Xu Nuan hadn't paid the toll fee yet.\nXu Nuan couldn't stop laughing. She ejected a skinned deer's carcass and gave it to the chomper. Cat caught it with her monster mouth and chew it in glee.\nAfter feeding the dryad, Xu Nuan asked her again.\n\"Where is your parent? Can you tell me?\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat hummed and started walking back to the general store. Xu Nuan smiled and followed after her. While she was at it, she sent a telepathic message to her disciples and followers on her ship.\n'Park the ship and follow me. Do not cause trouble.'\n.I think you should take a look at\n.\n\"Finally done.\"\nLeo finished cleaning the granary. He looked at the half-eaten potato piles that he separated for Cat, thinking about how quick they rot. He also thought about the Yang Poison that the system mentioned.\n'Should I research the rotting potato?'\nLeo went to check on the alchemy workshops. Unfortunately, they were still in the middle of making Yang Flame Dan, so Leo couldn't do anything about them.\nSince the cauldrons were busy, Leo postponed the research project for now. He turned his attention to the warehouse automaton – It still worked at its own pace, collecting nuts and pine leaves around the warehouse.\nLeo was relieved that he got a helper. He left it alone and walked toward the stacks of iron pine logs, which hadn't been processed or peeled yet. For the sake of killing time, Leo cut the branches and roots with his hands. Then, he threw everything except the main trunk to the side and began peeling the tree's bark.\nWorking was one of the best ways to strengthen one's concentration and prevent ADHD. Leo forgot about everything else and was absorbed in the job.\nA few hours later, Cat returned. She visited him in the backyard and nudged her head against his back.\n\"Meow <3\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and stopped working on the 4th log of the day. He wiped his hands using a robe of a dead assassin. Then, he patted the chomper.\n\"What? Are you reflecting on your mistake?\"\n\"Meow.\"\n\"Huh? Do we have a guest?\"\nLeo looked up and noticed that Cat had developed an upper torso of a baby girl. She looked like a newborn infant, and her chubby arms and face looked adorable.\nHe deeply sighed. Leo was aware of Cat's identity as a dryad, and he already expected this to happen.\n\"You've evolved well.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nLeo snickered and softly pinched the chubby cheek of the infant girl. Then, he pointed at the mutated corpse of Ouyang Ting, \"Don't bring guests to the backyard. Also, that stupid corpse is getting smelly. Get rid of it for me. I have no use for it anymore.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nCat giggled and ran toward the hanging corpse. She skillfully pulled the body out of the hook and threw it into the large mouth. The sound of broken bones and crushed meat followed.\nLeo put on a newly washed robe, which once belonged to one of the assassins. He then rushed to the front store to welcome the guest. When Leo got to the front store, he saw an elderly lady in green robes. Moreover, he sensed 20 life signatures behind her, but they were 200 meters away.\nThe woman frowned as soon as she noticed the uniform of the Hound Squad. Although she looked disturbed, she fixed her expression and cupped her fist.\n\"Greetings, senior. My Daoist Name is Beast Mother, and I come from the Amazonian Sanctuary. Excuse me for the sudden visit, but is it you who raises the dryad?\"\n\"Oh,\" Leo glanced at the backyard. He sighed, \"Hello, ma'am. Did my kid cause you trouble?\"\n\"No, not at all.\"\nXu Nuan glanced at Leo's uniform. She also noticed that Leo had the same aura as a soul formation cultivator. As someone with a lower cultivation base, Xu Nuan didn't dare to be rude.\n'Is he someone from the Hound Squad of the despicable Ouyang Clan? He doesn't look like one. I heard their members were trash-like cultivators. I never heard that a soul formation cultivator was one of their members… Ah, right. I'm stupid. That girl just told me.'\nXu Nuan wanted to smack her head as she recalled Cat's story.\n'The dryad said her master slaughtered a group of assassins that hurt her. Did he destroy the Hound Squad and got their clothes? Doesn't he have better clothes to wear? Why is he wearing that cursed uniform?'\nShe no longer suspected that Leo had any connection to the Hound Squad. However, she asked him to make sure.\n\"Senior, sir. I see that you're wearing the uniform of an assassin trope. May I ask what your relationship with the Ouyang family is?\"\n\"Ouyang family?\" Leo raised his brow. He felt like he heard that name before, but he couldn't remember. It sounded important, but Leo completely forgot about it.\nSeeing Leo's confused expression, Xu Nuan dryly laughed, \"If you aren't willing to disclose the detail, then please forget it. Forgive this junior for stepping out of the line.\"\nLeo didn't listen to Xu Nuan. He kept thinking, trying to recall his memory. Afraid that he might have dementia, Leo worked hard to think.\nThen, he remembered.\n\"Ah, Ouyang guys. I remember someone by the name of Ouyang… Size. No, Ouyang… Width? Ouyang Short? Ah, stupid me. Ouyang Long! Yes, Ouyang Long! That Long-Long-Man. Right. Oh, please excuse me. I'm getting old and forgetful. That Ouyang Long guy said something about I killed his son, and then, he tried to kill me. Of course, I clapped his butt cheeks and sent him to the afterlife. Are you looking for him or related to him?\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan heard something unbelievable. She widened her eyes and swallowed her saliva in shock.\n'Is he insane?! Did he kill Ouyang Long? That Ouyang Long, one of Jianghu Alliance's elders?!'\nXu Nuan coughed and secretly wiped her sweat. She lowered her head and asked again.\n\"May I know your name, sir?\"\nLeo widely grinned. He loved it when people asked for his name. Although he wanted to say \"John Cena\" for a laugh, he minded his manner and used his old alias.\n\"Florida Man. That's my Daoist Title.\"\n\"… Florida?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 50 – Florida Man Searches for Sexy Alligator to be His  Wife\nWhile Xu Nuan and Leo chatted, the followers and disciples of Amazonian Sanctuary caught up with the former. They came out of the forest and stood behind her.\nThe young women in green robes wore thick veils to hide their faces. However, their clothes highlighted their figures and showed their sexy long legs.\nLeo inwardly laughed at the women and shook his head.\n'You're hiding your faces, but you're showing your legs. Are you seeking attention or do you want to hide your beauty? Make up your mind!'\nLeo looked away from the young girls. Even though he hadn't seen a woman in 50,000 years, he didn't feel the excitement or drive like when he was a human. Moreover, none of them was his type.\nHe was into something otherworldly that no sane person could comprehend.\n\"Ahem,\" Leo coughed. \"I see that you bring companions. Well, welcome to my store. Are you looking for something peculiar? Maybe you might need something from my store.\"\nXu Nuan came back to her senses. She turned around and found her 20 disciples, who tagged along to gain experience. Xu Nuan wryly smiled and informed the women.\n\"Be respectful toward this senior. His Daoist title is Florida Man. Also, keep the veils on.\"\n\"Yes, senior,\" The young women cupped their fists.\nXu Nuan turned her attention to Leo. She asked, \"What kind of store are you running, senior?\"\n\"Just general stuff, food, pills, and random consumables,\" Leo turned around and opened the doors for them. The cool air from the air conditioner left the building, and the ladies were surprised.\n\"Cold air?\"\n\"Y-Yin Qi?!\"\n\"No, I sense other elements! T-There are other Qi!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and ignored the exclamation. He entered the building, inviting the group in.\nXu Nuan swallowed her pride and fear. She glanced at her disciples, \"Stay here. Come in when I tell you.\"\n\"Y-Yes, master.\"\nXu Nuan followed Leo into the store for the first time.\nWhen Xu Nuan entered the building, she gasped in astonishment. Like the others, she was interested in the spatial distortion array and the secret of the store.\n\"Spatial Array? Senior Florida Man, are you an array master?\"\nLeo shrugged and made an excuse, \"More like an alchemist. As for the store, you can say that I'm relying on a friend's help.\"\n\"Friend?\" Xu Nuan was curious, \"Can I know the name, senior? Maybe, I could ask him to help my sect expand my warehouse.\"\nLeo shook his head. As he couldn't tell that he got this perk from a system, he made up a fake identity of his friend, \"He's dead.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry… What was his name?\"\n\"His Daoist name was Wilson. He was a silent guy, and his head was very round – like a volleyball. He… died in a sea.\"\n\"Wilson?\"\nLeo giggled as he was sure that nobody in this world would understand the reference and the real identity of Wilson, \"Do you know him?\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't. Umm, anyway,\" Xu Nuan dryly laughed and looked around. Instantly, her eyes fixated on a showcase refrigerator, which contained hundreds of Yin Cabbages.\nXu Nuan was a monster tamer, and many monster pets under her care needed Yin Qi from food. She also tried to grow Yin Cabbages in her sanctuary, but she always failed. Seeing so many cabbages in the store, Xu Nuan was excited.\n\"Senior, how much are the cabbages? Can I buy all of them?\"\nLeo widely grinned. He immediately activated the shop domain system, allowing Xu Nuan to see her lifespan.\nDING\n.\nName: Xu Nuan\nAge: 113\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,077 Years, 9 Months, 5 Days, 5 Hours, 6 Minutes\n.\nLeo raised his eyebrows, impressed by the woman's vitality. She had more lifespan than Han Hao, Han Meng, and other geezers around her age.\nMeanwhile, Xu Nuan almost fell on her butt in shock. Her shaking hand pointed at her status window as she had never seen anything like it.\n\"W-What is this?!\"\n\"Your lifespan, ma'am.\"\n\"My… lifespan?\"\n\"Yes, your remaining days. It slowly ticks down. Once it reaches zero, you will die by a natural cause.\"\n\"O-Oh…\"\nXu Nuan gulped. She extended her hand to touch the floating screen, but her arms went through it. She then asked Leo, \"A-Are you a life force cultivator, sir?\"\n\"You can say that,\" Leo giggled and explained how his store worked. \"Also, my store only accepts lifespan. Normally, I sell one yin cabbage for 50 years of lifespan. But since this is your first visit, I'll only sell it for 10 years per cabbage. How about it?\"\n\"…\"\n.\n[Cabbage of Extreme Yin]I think you should take a look at\nThis poisonous cabbage can only be found in a demonic realm as it is one of demon's staple food. No cultivator should consume this as it is full of Poison Qi and yin miasma. However, it can be used in alchemy to make potent poison.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Demonic Poison Potion]\nOne Cabbage of Extreme Yin\nOne Liter of Yin Fluid\nOne of any Poison Element Catalyst\nPoison Qi\n.\nXu Nuan was taken aback. She only wanted the cabbages as pet food. However, 10 years per cabbage was still expensive.\n\"Can I pay with spirit stones, senior?\"\nLeo rubbed his chin, \"Spirit stones?\"\n\"Yes. Can I pay one million spirit stones per cabbage?\"\nXu Nuan was aware that yin cabbages were rare, and they could only be found in a mystic realm with thick Yin Qi. Still, she didn't know that it could be used in alchemy.\nLeo closed his eyes and pondered. He thought of the blue stones that he got from the assassins and wondered if they were spirit stones.\n'If those blue stones are spirit stones, I should gather more of them. Every spirit stone can be turned into essence stones, right? And those essence stones seem more valuable than spirit stones.'\nFor the sake of securing a returning customer, Leo compromised and made a counteroffer.\n\"You're quite a bargainer. Alright. I'll sell you these cabbages. However, there's a condition.\"\n\"A condition?\"\n\"For every cabbage you buy, I want 100 regular cabbages on top of the one million spirit stones. How about it?\"\n\"Regular cabbages?\"\nXu Nuan was confused. She paused to think and look around the store, looking at Golden Sand Bananas, Immortal grass, Bloodmelons, grain pills, and Yang Flame Dans.\nPills and Dans?\nXu Nuan recalled Leo's words that he was an alchemist. Then, she began putting pieces of a puzzle together.\n'He has plenty of resources from mystic realms. He can kill a soul formation cultivator like Ouyang Long. He isn't afraid of the Ouyang Family. Wait a second. Aren't those dans emitting fire essence? Only grand master alchemists can make flame essence cultivation pills! Also, he makes a strange request for regular cabbages. Does that mean…'\nXu Nuan took several deep breaths. Unlike Han Hao or Wu Buyi, she directly asked Leo to confirm her theories.\n\"Senior Florida Man, are you an immortal?\"\nOnce again, Leo was taken aback. He tried to avoid the question, \"Define immortal.\"\n\"Well, for example, you can freely travel between worlds. Your cultivation base is at the Celestial Stage or higher, or you have been living over 3,000 years.\"\n\"Does living more than 3,000 years count?\" Leo was amused.\n\"Well, mortals can't live longer than 3,000 years. The highest record that a quasi-immortal made long ago was 2,950 years or so before he turns into ash.\"\n\"Oh,\" Leo stroked his beard and laughed. He joked with Xu Nuan. \"If I go by your logic, wouldn't I be a deity? I've been living for 50,000 years.\"\n\"WHAT!?!\" Xu Nuan was shocked once again. Her face was as pale as a sheet, and she sweated profusely.\nLeo paused and covered his mouth. He had the urge to slap his lips for revealing sensitive information. He feigned laughing and changed the subject, \"It was a joke. Please forget about it. Let's talk about the cabbages. Do you accept my condition?\"\nXu Nuan came back to her senses. She knelt and cupped her fist, \"I'm willing to work for you, senior!\"\n\"Err…\"\n\"Just say the word. As long as you won't harm me or my disciples, I'm willing to do anything even if you ask for my purity.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression turned dark. He inwardly cursed.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm 'Who would want to bed an old hag like you?! I'd rather bang a sexy alligator than doing it with an old woman! I just want your lifespan. Gimme your lifespan, dammit!'\nHe coughed and averted from the subject, \"Don't go overboard. I only need normal cabbages. Do you think I'm a sex fiend?\"\nXu Nuan looked up and blushed in embarrassment. She also let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Thank you very much for your benevolence. If you need anything else, please tell me!\"\nOnce again, Xu Nuan spoke like a robot, trying to get on his good side.\nSeeing how Xu Nuan was humble, Leo had an idea, \"How about you can do that now? I need customers and lifespan. Do you think your followers might find my items useful? I can sell them for cheap, but they have to pay with their lifespan, though.\"\nXu Nuan nodded in agreement, \"That won't be a problem. Actually, our sanctuary's training method focuses on Water Techniques, and water Qi from the Bloodmelons will be very useful.\"\nHearing that Xu Nuan's people might love Bloodmelons, Leo gave her an incentive. He secretly added her as an employee of the store, encouraging her to bring more customers to his shop.\nDING\n<You have been enlisted as the general store's employee.>\nXu Nuan heard a mysterious voice. Once again, she was surprised.\nLeo explained, \"From now on, every time you buy items from me, I'll give you a discount. If you introduce customers to me, I'll pay you a 10% commission from what I receive from the transactions, okay? If they pay with lifespan, I'll share you the lifespan I obtain. If they pay with spirit stones, I'll give you spirit stones. Deal?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 51 – Parents Shocked - Florida Man Seduces Underage Girl Using Fairy\nXu Nuan was still confused, but she followed his instructions anyway. She exited the building, and her spatial ring ejected a thousand sacks, containing 10,000 spirit stones each. Then, she cupped her fist and bowed at Leo.\n\"I'd like to buy 10 yin cabbages, senior. This is my payment. As for the regular cabbages, I have to make a return trip to fetch them for you.\"\nLeo nodded in approval. Since she paid more than what Leo had requested, he packed 12 yin cabbages and gave them to Xu Nuan.\n\"Consider two extra cabbages as your discount. Oh, you can invite the others to see the Bloodmelons if they want them. I promise that I'll sell them at an affordable price.\"\nXu Nuan brightly smiled and stored the 12 cabbages in her spatial ring. She bowed again and turned around, facing her disciples.\nMeanwhile, the young maidens observed their mentor in a daze. They saw how Xu Nuan behave in front of Leo and were stunned.\nXu Nuan returned to their side. She brightly smiled at them, \"Everybody can rest assured. Senior Florida Man is an ally of the sanctuary. I just got 12 Cabbages of Extreme Yin from him with only 10 million spirit stones. They're very cheap!\"\n\"T-Ten million spirit stones?!\"\nFor the disciples, 10 spirit stones could change their lives. However, their master just paid 10 million spirit stones for 12 cabbages, which didn't make sense.\nXu Nuan giggled and explained the value of the cabbages, \"The cabbages are beneficial to the Frost Unicorn back in our sanctuary. One cabbage is enough to raise one's cultivation strength by one major stage. I have 12, so we can evolve 12 unicorns. It is worth it.\"\n\"O-Oh.\"\nThe girls thought of the sanctuary guardians back home. They stopped making a fuss and gazed at the sacks of spirit stones. Still, they were envious of Leo, who just scored 10 million spirit stones from their master.\nOne of them gulped as she had a bold idea. She deeply inhaled and mustered her courage. Then, he approached Leo.\nThe woman gracefully saluted, placing her hands on her knee and slightly bent forward.\n\"Greetings, senior. My name is Qi Niu. I don't have a Daoist title yet, but I'm a 5th-rank foundation establishment beast tamer. I heard from my master that you provide her rare herbs, and I wish to see your merchandise.\"\nLeo brightly smiled. He liked well-manner women the most.\nThe girl suddenly took off her veils and headwear, revealing her beauty and stright long brown hair. She had the face of a Chinese idol even though she didn't put on makeup. Then, Qi Niu purposely unbuttoned a few buttons, showing her chest skin. With with a long stride, she walked while showing her thighs and moving her butt to attract Leo's gaze.\nLeo's smiling face turned stiff. The corners of his mouth curved down as his instinct kicked in – The PTSD in the past when he was a human returned. He shook his head and rolled his eyes.\n'Oh, boy.'\nWithout saying anything, Leo summoned the shop domain menu, revealing all the disciples' lifespan statuses. He also checked the age of Qi Niu.\n.\nName: Qi Niu\nAge: 16\nRemaining Lifespan: 265 Years, 9 Months, 4 Days, 5 Hours, 36 Minutes.\n.\nLeo facepalmed.\n'I knew it. My radar isn't wrong. This girl is a jailbait.'\nThe moral integrity of Leo was still as strong as ever. He was disturbed by the teenager's seductive behavior. While Leo was massaging his temples, he glanced at the sacks of spirit stones outside the building. Leo instantly figured Qi Niu's ulterior motive.\n'That must be why. Haiya. Everywhere is the same.'\n.\n.\nWhile Leo secretly cursed the immoral teenager, Qi Niu and the other disciples were stunned when blue screens showed their remaining lifespan and age.\nAveragely, a 3rd-stage cultivator, aka foundation establishment cultivator, had about 180-280 years of lifespan. The followers of Xu Nuan all had the same lifespan range, except for one little girl.\nOne of them was a new prospect of the sanctuary, and she was still a very young. She had not even learned a cultivation method yet, and she was still a commoner without a cultivation base. However, her status appeared and showed her hidden talent and superior constitution.\n.\nName: Yao Qiqi\nAge: 6\nRemaining Lifespan: 196 Years, 6 Months, 9 Days, 9 Hours, and 7 Minutes\n.\nWhen Yao Qiqi was born, the little girl had an ill fate. Her parents were killed by bandits. Fortunately, the people of the sanctuary found her near her parents' corpses and agreed to bring her along. Since then, she had been tagging along with the disciples of Xu Nuan as she couldn't stay on the flying ship.\nYao Qiqi was the youngest among the group, and she still wore a commoner's clothing. Moreover, she carried a stuffed teddy bear doll in her arms.\nThe little girl's brown hairs were tied in two bundles. The grey one-piece dress reached her knee, and the inner robes were thick enough to hide her thighs and skin. She still wore straw sandals that were made by the other disciples, and her round eyes sparkled as her mind was filled with hope and dream.\nTo everybody in the sanctuary, including Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi was an innocent child that they had to protect and raise carefully. Nobody was allowed to taint this little angel.\nLooking at her lifespan, Yao Qiqi was curious. Like other people, she tried to touch it and failed to grasp the screen.\n\"This looks fun!\"\nYao Qiqi waved her hands around, trying to catch or disperse the menu. However, the screen rippled like the surface of the water and was reconstructed.\nXu Nuan noticed the little girl's action. She patted her shoulder and warned her.\n\"Qiqi, behave.\"\n\"Y-Yes, master.\"\nYao Qiqi pouted and hugged the teddy bear. Then, she looked at her elder sisters and the grandpa in the store building, wondering what they were doing.\nA minute later, Yao Qiqi was bored as she didn't understand worldly matters. She looked at the nature to see if there was anything interesting around here.\nThen, Yao Qiqi found an area with grass flowers. The grasses were blue, and the flowers were bright pink.\n\"So beautiful!\"\nYao Qiqi giggled and ran toward the flowers. While carrying the doll, she leaned closer to look at the flowers. Then, she reached out to touch it.\nVIIING\nSuddenly, a transparent spirit flew by and emerged from the flowers. An infant dark elf girl floated in the air and orbited around Yao Qiqi.\nThe little girl's eyes followed the spirit of the dark elf. She clamored.\n\"Wow. A fairy!\"\n\"???\"\nXu Nuan and the other disciples turned around and found Yao Qiqi 10 meters away. One of the disciples rushed to her side and warned her.\n\"Qiqi, don't wander around on your own. Also, don't touch anything here. They have an owner.\"\nYao Qiqi pouted and looked at her senior, \"But Qiqi wants to see flowers.\"\nThe disciple looked at the flower and discovered that they were spirit grasses. She gulped and turned around, looking at her master.\n\"M-Master? There's a spirit grass patch here.\"\nXu Nuan's expression turned dark. She hushed them, \"Don't touch it! Leave them alone!\"\n\"Y-Yes, master.\"\nThe disciple turned to Yao Qiqi, \"Qiqi, we can't steal flowers from this place. They have an owner, okay?\"\n\"Muuu.\"\nYao Qiqi pouted. She turned to look at the flowers again as she really wanted to bring them home.\nWHOOSH\nSuddenly, the dark elf spirit early floated in front of Yao Qiqi again. She tilted her head and stared into her eyes.\nMeow\nYao Qiqi also tilted her head as she heard the spirit's voice. She mimicked it.\n\"Meow?\"\nMeow-Meow?\n\"Yes, I can hear you. Meow-Meow!\"\nYao Qiqi looked up and pulled the disciple's pinky finger. Then, she pointed at the spirit in front of her.I think you should take a look at\n\"Sister Lu. There's a flower fairy in front of me.\"\nThe disciple next to Yao Qiqi looked at the girl in bemusement. She around, but she couldn't see anything. Then, she sighed.\n\"Qiqi, there is no fairy around here.\"\nYao Qiqi jumped and pointed at the dark elf spirit's face, pinpointing her location, \"But she's here!\"\nThe other disciples turned around. Again, none of them found anything unusual except the little girl pointing at empty air.\nXu Nuan deeply sighed. She walked toward Yao Qiqi and picked her up. She carried the girl in her arms, stopping her from wandering around.\n\"Mind your manner, Qiqi. We're visiting a guest.\"\nYao Qiqi's eyes were moist. She was on the verge of crying as nobody believed her.\n\"But there is a fairy in front of me…\"\n\"…\"\nA crying little girl could break every compassionate human's heart. Seeing how the girl crying, everybody surrounded the girl and tried to soothe her.\nUnfortunately, the more they tried to console Yao Qiqi, the more depressed she was. Qiqi wailed.\n\"But the fairy is really there. Why doesn't anybody believe in me?\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan and the girls were at a loss for words. They tried to distract Qiqi with candies and a new doll, but none of them worked.\n.\n.\n\"Meow?\"\nCat, who was in the middle of chewing Ouyang Ting's corpse, suddenly turned around. She spat the half-eaten body and picked up a toilet brush and the earth jar that Leo had stored stream water. She brushed her teeth, poured the flesh water into her mouth, and gargled. Afterward, she swallowed the water and tossed her toothbrush and earth jar away, breaking the container in the process. Cat crawled toward the crowd to see the commotion.\nAs soon as Cat crawled over the store building and saw the commotion, she tilted her head for a moment.\n\"Meow <3\"\nThe dryad torso gazed at the little girl among the crowd. She waved her hands at the latter, but the little girl didn't notice.\n\"Meow?\"\nCat noticed that people around Yao Qiqi were in the way. She pouted and came up with an idea. Then, she clapped her little hands.\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat wiggled her roots, vines, and branches, preparing for a long leap.\n.\n.\n*Hic* *Hic*\nFacing a sobbing child, everybody was helpless. They could do nothing but hug her, waiting for Yao Qiqi to calm down.\nXu Nuan deeply sighed and ordered her disciples, \"After Qi Niu comes back, I'll ask her to bring Qiqi back to the ship.\"\nThe disciples sighed and agreed with their master. They gave up on Qiqi as there was nothing they could do.\nWHOOSH\nSuddenly, a shadow of a large figure flew over their heads.\nBOOM\nCat landed 50 meters behind the group of women. Then, she dashed toward the granary next to the empty farmland.\nThe women turned around to look. Then, everybody found the monster plant.\n\"M-Monster?!\"\n\"EEEK!!\"\nThe disciples panicked and pulled out their weapons. Xu Nuan immediately stood between them and Cat, trying to calm everybody down.\n\"Stand down! That is Daoist Florida Man's pet. It won't hurt us!\"\n\"P-Pet?\"\n\"M-Monster plant as a pet?\"\nThe disciples gulped and shrank back in fear. A moment later, they slightly relaxed and put away their swords.\nWhen everybody thought that everything was over, Cat slipped into the granary and came out. She carried a bundle newly harvested of fully grown immortal grass. Moreover, a hundred white flowers bloomed, emitting strong Qi and life force.\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat crawled toward the group. One of her vines coiled around the bundle of flowers and extended them toward Qiqi.\n\"!!!\"\nThe group of disciples was stunned. They almost drew their swords. But seeing that the monster was carrying a bouquet of flowers and offering it to Yao Qiqi, they looked at Cat and Yao Qiqi in confusion and astonishment.\nOn the other hand, Xu Nuan covered her mouth with one hand, finding the situation cute and adorable.\nNone of them had noticed it yet. The flowers were not ordinary flowers.\nThey were flowers of the immortal grass.\nVIIING\nThe dark elf spirit's arm and hand overlapped with the vine. It was as if the infant spirit held the flower bouquet in her hand, and she gave it to Qiqi.\nYao Qiqi stopped crying. She gazed at the fairy and Cat.\n\"Miss Fairy?\"\n\"Meow,\" Cat giggled.\n\"Is this for me?\"\n\"Meow!\"\nFinally, Yao Qiqi brightly smiled, \"Thank you very much, Miss Fairy!\"\n\"Meow-Meow <3\"\nYao Qiqi accepted the flowers. She hugged the banquet and her teddy bear.\nFLUTTER\nSome of the flower's spore spread, and Yao Qiqi directly inhaled them. Instantly, her body brightened in a silver light.\n\"Eh?\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nYao Qiqi floated and slipped off from Xu Nuan's arms. Everybody then exclaimed in shock.\n\"QIQI!\"\n\"WHAT IS HAPPENING!?\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo looked outside the window and stared at the crowd.\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nHe was confused about why they were making such a loud noise. He scratched his head, planning to educate Cat later.\nMeanwhile, the seductive teenager continued to reveal her skin, showing her thigh and cleavage.\n\"Senior, do you have a girlfriend?\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 52 – Florida Man Revives 6-YO Girl Using Tea and Food after Allegedly Killing Her with Radiation\nLeo had no time to play with Qi Niu. He put on rubber gloves, preventing the girl from touching his skin.\n\"Lady, my body is hazardous. If you touch me, you will die.\"\nQi Niu didn't give up. She undid two more buttons, revealing more of her skin.\n\"Senior, what is your type? Big breasts? Small breasts? Or, are you into something special? I know a few techniques. Do you want me to show you?\"\nAgain, Leo started to get annoyed. He bellowed, \"Stop that. If you don't, I'll kick you out of the store. This is my last warning!\"\n\"…\"\nQi Niu paused and glared into Leo's eyes. She was offended, but she couldn't voice her frustration.\n'I swallow humiliation and lower myself, yet you ignore me?! How dare you!? Do you think you're better than the others? You're not the only rich man in this world! Fine, I'll find another man!'\nThe girl gave up seducing Leo. She snorted and stomped out of the store without purchasing anything.\nSeeing how the girl reacted, Leo snorted. He was relieved that he managed to shake off a troublemaker.\n\"Next!\" Leo called for a new customer. He looked out the window.\nHowever, Xu Nuan and the disciples didn't hear him. They surrounded a floating little girl and shouted in panic.\n\"QIQI!\"\n\"WHAT'S HAPPENING?!\"\n\"MEOW?!\" Even Cat was among them.\nQi Niu was also shocked. However, she clicked her tongue and observed the group from the side, not participating in the commotion.\nLeo was different. He observed Yao Qiqi and Cat. Then, he noticed that the girl was holding a bundle of immortal grass flowers.\n\"Flowers?! Flowers from the immortal grass?!\"\nLeo approached the crowd. He was planning to ask Cat and Xu Nuan about the girl. But suddenly, Yao Qiqi emitted a strange aura, which didn't belong in this world. Xu Nuan and others could only see a rainbow aura from Qiqi, but Leo saw something familair.\n'Isn't that…?'\nLeo remembered the phenomenon. He gazed at Xu Nuan, and their eyes met.\n\"S-Senior Florida Man. We're so sorry. I've never imagined that one of my people will experience a breakthrough like this.\"\n\"Breakthrough?\"\nLeo inwardly laughed. This was not a cultivation breakthrough.\n50,000 years ago when Leo was still a regular human, he went through a similar ordeal. The fallout radiation turned every cell in his body into cancer cells, and they mutated everything – arms, hands, feet, legs, stomach, chest, face, eyes, ears, mouths, and innards. However, the cells kept him alive. Leo remembered that he begged other people to kill him as he couldn't tolerate the pain, but everybody was also hit by the radiation and died. In the end, Leo waited for his death alone on the street of corpses.\nHis cancerous cells destroyed all human cells, organs, bones, and a portion of his brain. Leo remembered that his consciousness went back and forth between the ray of light and the abyssal darkness several times during the process. When Leo came back to his senses, he found himself in the same body, but he aged significantly. In exchange for the rapid aging, the cancer cells reverted to good cells, and his bones and muscle fibers were stronger than before.\nMoreover, Leo found himself inside a strange spaceship of an alien, but that was a story for another time.\nLooking at Yao Qiqi in the ray of light, Leo recalled the bright light that he had seen during his first mutation. He wondered if it was the same.\n'Poor girl. If she goes through what I did, she would lose her mind. The pain is not something a kid can endure.'\nLeo gave Cat a meaningful look, scolding her with his eyes.\nCat was taken aback. She shook her head, denying her responsibility. She also pointed at the flowers and blamed them for the phenomenon.\n\"…\"\nLeo snorted and turned around. He ran into the store and entered his bedroom. Looking under the bed, Leo grabbed a Tupperware box of the newly made elixir grain pill, which he had hidden from Cat and Wu Buyi.\n.\nMedium-Grade Elixir Grain Pill\nSatisfy the hunger for 120 hours.\nIncrease metabolism and regenerative abilities for 25 days.\nIncrease lifespan by 50 years.\nIncrease five elemental Qi by 50 years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nHad Wu Buyi seen it, it would have driven him crazy. However, Leo kept these pills in case of emergency as they could be used as a temporary healing pill.\nLeo picked one of them from the box and stored the container in the same place. He then picked a bottle of rejuvenate tea and rushed out to see the little girl.\nAs soon as Leo arrived, he witnessed a nightmarish scene – Yao Qiqi's arms and legs swelled and bloated like a heinous t-virus-infected zombie in Resident Evil Series. The disciples screamed in fright while Xu Nuan's face was as pale as a sheet. Even Cat started crying, regretting that she had given Qiqi the flowers.\nLeo walked with long strides. He jumped and caught the floating girl. Then, he landed on the ground with the little girl in his arm. Then, Leo tossed the banquet of immortal grass flowers away.\nNoticing that Leo touched the girl, Xu Nuan and the girls were shocked. It was common knowledge that a cultivator during a breakthrough was sensitive to bodily contact. Had a cultivator been touched during their advancement, the cultivator would have suffered from the Qi deviation as the touch might destroy the Qi flow.\nIn this case, Yao Qiqi was in danger of Qi deviation! Her Qi could go berserk!\n\"NO! HER ADVANCEMENT WILL BE RUINED!\" Xu Nuan panicked.\nOn the other hand, Leo didn't care. He crushed the grain pill into small pieces. As Leo was not into romantic stuff, he simply poured the crushed pill into her mouth. Then, he opened the cog of Rejuvenate Tea bottle and slowly poured the content down her throat, forcing her to swallow the grain pill along with the tea.\n.\nHigh-Grade Rejuvenate Tea\nRegenerate and restore bone marrow.\nDecrease physical age by 7 years per liter.\nIncrease metabolism by 35% for 168 hours.\nMedium chance to increase appetite.\n.\nLeo had no idea if the tea could help, but he had to risk it all. After all, every medicine he got was her last hope.\nCREAK-CRACK\nThe sound of cracking bones scared Leo. He bitterly gazed at the little girl in his arm, begging heaven and hell to spare her. While Leo gazed at Yao Qiqi's face, he also checked her lifespan status.I think you should take a look at\n.\nName: Yao Qiqi\nAge: 6\nRemaining Lifespan: 399 Years, 6 Months, 9 Days, 9 Hours, and 2 Minutes\n.\n\"399 Years?!\"\nAs Leo hadn't checked Qiqi's lifespan earlier, he didn't know if the tea and the pill worked. Still, as she had a long life, Leo didn't believe that she would perish because of a simple radiation mutation.\nCREAK\nThe swelling arms and legs slowly subsided and reverted back to normal limbs. Yao Qiqi's complexion got a lot better, but she sweated profusely. She was still in pain, and Leo could feel the heat coming from her skin.\nLeo let out a long sigh as she survived the critical condition. He took off one of his gloves and swiped the sweat drops on her face.\n\"Ah…\"\n\"Meow!!!\"\nAt that moment, Leo and Cat's hearts sank. The former made a mistake.\nHe touched Yao Qiqi with his bare hand!\nLeo tightly closed his eyes, blaming his stupidity and muscle memory. He just wanted to help the little girl, but he might have harmed her instead.\nWithout saying anything, Leo bit his lower lip and gestured for Xu Nuan to carry her instead.\nXu Nuan carefully received Yao Qiqi and princess-carried her. Leo was also careful not to touch Xu Nuan with the hand without a glove. After passing the responsibility to the woman, Leo deeply sighed.\n\"I did my best to help. Let's pray that she can turn this ordeal into a fortuitous encounter and become a main character of this era.\"\nLeo said without thinking as his mind was still in chaos. He wanted to apologize to Xu Nuan for his blunder, but his brain couldn't come up with the right words.\nMeanwhile, Xu Nuan and the girls gazed at Leo in awe and respect as his mysterious medicine and tea suppressed the swelling and bloating symptoms instantly. They believed that Leo sincerely helped Yao Qiqi.\nWhile carrying Yao Qiqi, Xu Nuan lowered her head, \"Thank you for saving her, senior! Without you, I don't know how Qiqi would survive this!\"\nThe other girls also knelt. They cupped their fists and spoke in unison, \"Thank you for saving our little sister!\"\nLeo heavily scratched the back of his head and grumbled. He felt bad, and he wanted to confess.\nSuddenly…\nRUMBLE\nYao Qiqi's body emitted rainbow light again!\nHowever, this time, Xu Nuan could sense Qi inside the little girl. She sensed a small dantian crystal in her belly.\nYao Qiqi just condensed a dantian, which every Qi Condensation Stage cultivator strived to complete. However, this little girl did it instantly. Her cultivation base skipped the Muscle Tempering Stage and the Qi Condensation Stage! Her status rose to the Foundation Establishment Stage!\nThat was not all, Xu Nuan sensed more than one type of element Qi inside her!\n\"Qiqi… Oh, my goodness. You…\"\nXu Nuan found a trace of Fire Qi, Water Qi, Wood Qi, Earth Qi, and Metal Qi inside her!\nYao Qiqi could cultivate five elements at once!\nThe little girl slowly opened her eyes and blinked several times. She gazed at Xu Nuan's face, which was full of tears.\n\"Grandma. I had a bad dream and a good dream.\"\n\"Yes, Qiqi?\"\n\"I dreamt that I was eaten alive by blood monsters. I was drowning in a blood pool, and the blood pool turned into a monster. It was so painful.\"\nXu Nuan slowly put the girl down. She brought out a handkerchief and wiped Yao Qiqi's sweat. The other girls also surrounded the little girl and fanned them with their skirts, circulating the airflow for the two.\nLeo immediately raised his hand and blocked his view. Then, he turned around. He didn't want to take advantage of these adolescent girls and looked at their underwear. After turning around, he raised his eyebrows.\n'Wait, she's okay?'\nLeo patted his chest and deeply exhaled. He almost had a heart attack. While he stood there, he eavesdropped their conversation.\nYao Qiqi continued narrating her dream, \"But then, grandma. I saw a handsome angel.\"\n\"An angel?\" Xu Nuan and the girls were curious. Some of them glanced at Leo and repeated her word.\n\"Handsome angel?\"\n\"Yes, sister! A handsome angel rescued me from the monster and fed me a delicious pill and water. Then, he gave me a blessing touch. When he touched my face, I was no longer in pain!\"\n\"…\"\nWhile his back faced the group of women, Leo widened his eyes in bemusement. He thought that his touch would have killed her.\n'Wait. My touch helped her? But how?!'\nLeo coughed several times as he choked. He also facepalmed and shook his head, confused and baffled by this event.\nOn the other hand, Xu Nuan and the girls quickly connected the dots. They gazed at Leo in respect.\nXu Nuan concluded her thought and explained to everybody, \"Senior Florida Man is your savior, Qiqi. He fed you a medicine pill and healing water. Then, he cured you.\"\nThe girls nodded in agreement as they saw everything. Even Qi Niu who had a malicious thought couldn't help but agree.\n\"AHEM!\"\nLeo was still choking. He cleared his throat and walked back to his store, hiding the complex expression on his face. He tried to change the subject.\n\"Well, everything is my fault since I didn't teach my pet correctly. As an apology, I'll give everybody a bottle of rejuvenate tea for free, but I'll only give it to those who buy at least one of my items by using their lifespan.\"\nThe girls deeply bowed toward Leo. Even Xu Nuan had the urge to kowtow to him.\nYao Qiqi got back on her feet. She turned to Leo and bowed 90 degrees. Then, she shouted, \"THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE, SENIOR HANDSOME ANGEL! YAO QIQI WILL NEVER FORGET THIS FAVOR!\"\nThe girls giggled while Leo's face reddened in embarrassment. He was bad at taking compliments, especially if someone suddenly called him handsome.\nLeo coughed, \"AHEM! Alright. Next person, please. I don't have all day to entertain you.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 53 – Florida Man Distributes Drugs to Underage Girls. Parent is Happy.\nAfter the hectic, Xu Nuan asked Qi Niu to bring Yao Qiqi back to the ship. The girl obeyed the order and escorted the little girl back. As for the others, they followed Leo into the store and browsed his items.\nBecause of Leo's deeds, the girls stopped being on guard around Leo. They treated him as a respectable senior and took off their veils and headwear. They were all gorgeous and beautiful.\nThe group looked around the store and inspected the vegetables. Some of them gawked at the yang flame pills while others fixated on grain pills.\n\"Senior. How much is this?\"\n\"Is this expensive?\"\n\"What can this pill do?\"\nLeo patiently answered them one by one.\n\"The grain pills are 20 years of lifespan each. Oh, be careful with that glass jar. Those are Prosthetic Eyeballs of Fenrir, and I sell one for 500 years of lifespan. And about that yang flame dans, it boosts your physical strength for a few days and permanently increases your fire essence, yang Qi, and lifespan. The medium-grade one is 40 years each. The high grade is 70 years.\"\nThe girls gulped as they were oblivious of the pill's true value. Most of them returned the item to the shelves as they didn't think it was worth losing their lifespan for rare pills. However, everybody couldn't look away from the Bloodmelon, which gave off a bloody scent.\nOne of them pointed at the melon, \"Senior, how much for this?\"\nLeo deeply sighed as these girls were hard customers. Since he figured that the girls valued their lifespan highly, he cut down the price tag and gave them a bargain.\n\"10 years of lifespan each.\"\n\"Eh?\" Some of the girls were surprised. They surrounded the Bloodmelon basket and started picking them up. One of them carried five in her arms.\nYoung girls could be terrifying when they saw discounted items in a store. In less than 10 seconds,  the baskets of bloodmelons were empty.\nLeo frowned and gazed at the disciples, who hoarded several melons in their arms. He asked them.\n\"Do you even realize what they can do?\"\nThe girls widely grinned. One of them nodded, \"I'm a simple girl. I sense water Qi, I buy!\"\n\"…\"\n.\nBloodmelon\nCan only be found in Blood Swamps of demon-infested mystic realms. The melons grow from absorbing blood from the swamps, and their juice is filled with demonic Qi and Yin Energy. It is one of many fruits that Vampires and plant monsters are very fond of. Can be used as a water element catalyst.\nTraits\nIncrease water element Qi and demonic Qi by 10 years' worth of cultivation (If consumed)\nIncrease water-based pill's success chance by 30%. (If used in alchemy)\n.\nLeo was aware of this item's description. Since he couldn't eat all of them to get lifespan, he might as well sell them for some changes.\nThe 19 disciples each took five melons. Leo absorbed their lifespan, and everybody stored the items in their spatial rings in glee. Then, everybody saluted Leo, thanking him for selling them for cheap.\nHowever, one of them hesitated. She turned around and gazed at the refrigerator chest, which contained rejuvenate tea.\nLeo noticed her gaze. He laughed.\n\"Fine. Nobody is going to buy that expensive tea anyway. I'll give everybody one bottle each. Oh, I forgot to mention. The medium-grade rejuvenate tea can decrease your physical age by five years. What I fed that little girl was a high-graded one. I didn't give her a lot, so she will just look one or two years younger.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAll girls stopped their feet in their tracks. Their round eyes glinted in red light as if they transformed into predators.\nLeo broke a sweat. Their dark expressions were the same as Yandere girls in anime. Still, Leo quietly passed 19 bottles of medium-grade tea to the disciples.\nAfter everybody got their tea of youth, they quickly stored them in their spatial ring and kowtowed to Leo.\n\"Senior! I'll definitely return here to buy more one day!\"\n\"Senior Florida Man, please save more of that tea. I'll get stronger and come back!\"\n\"Please tell us when you have another promotion! I won't miss it!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo blankly waved his hand and dully stared at the girls. He wondered if he should start selling cosmetic items, dresses, or women's shoes in the future. He might as well purchase stylish evening dresses from the online shopping system and resell them to these girls.\nPutting his idea into action, Leo secretly opened his online store system and searched for woman's dresses. He randomly picked one of them, which looked like something that a Hollywood star would wear at a movie premiere.\nDING\nIt cost Leo only one year of lifespan.\nThe box of dress appeared in front of Leo. He opened it and pulled the dress out.\nAs soon as the dress came out, the girls stared at it with round eyes. One of them clattered their jaws in astonishment while the others drooled.\nThe girl that had asked for rejuvenate tea asked first. She dropped the formality and got to the point.\n\"How much?\"\nLeo gazed at them with a poker face. He coughed as he felt bad for doing this.\n\"10 yea-\"\n\"BUY! MINE!\"\nThe girl leaped at the dress and snatched it from Leo's hands, leaving the latter stunned. Then, she triggered something unbelievable. The 18 girls that had already exited the store rushed back in and surrounded him.\n\"SENIOR, I WANT ONE, TOO!\"\n\"SELL IT TO ME, TOO!\"\n\"I WANT THREE OF THOSE! CAN I HAVE RED, WHITE, AND BLACK PLEASE?!\"\n\"…\"\nOnce again, Leo witnessed women's terrifying purchase power and their weird logic. They treated useful pills and immortal grass as expensive items, but they didn't hesitate to buy anything that could improve their appearance and look.\nFor the girls, their looks, dresses, and cosmetic items were their social statuses. They might look calm and disciplined, but they were competitive when they compared their beauty with their peers.\n\"Relax. Give me a moment. Let me check the stock first.\"\nLeo politely asked them to open a way for him to return to his bedroom, to which they agreed. Upon entering his bedroom, he closed the door behind him and reopened the online store.\nDue to the demand, he bought 19 sets of the same dress in three different colors. A large box appeared, and a total of 57 dresses were inside. Everything cost only 57 years of lifespan.\nLeo returned to the girls and showed them the dresses.I think you should take a look at\n\"WOW!\"\n\"MINE!\"\n\"I'LL TAKE THOSE!\"\nLike vultures, the 19 girls quickly took three dresses each. Even the previous girl that already had a dress took three more.\nCHA-CHING\n58 dresses blessed Leo with 580 years of lifespan. Combined with the Bloodmelon, this transaction gave him 1,530 years of lifespan. Unfortunately, after cutting the dress cost and Xu Nuan's share, Leo's profit was only 1,319 years.\nThe girls started squealing and pressed their dresses on their bodies, checking the sizes. Their noise got so loud that Xu Nuan, who had been watching them from outside, coughed and reminded them of their manner.\n\"BEHAVE, GIRLS! WHAT ARE YOU, LITTLE KIDS?!\"\nThe girls stopped talking and closed their mouths. However, they couldn't stop smiling, looking forward to trying their new dresses.\nLeo shook his head and deeply sighed. He watched them leave the building.\nXu Nuan proceeded to yell and ordered the girls to sit. She gave them a loud sermon for minutes. Afterward, she chased them back to the ship.\nAfter sending them away, Leo approached Xu Nuan and gave her a bottle of high-grade rejuvenate tea and a medium-grade elixir grain pill. He also asked her.\n\"If that little girl's condition worsens, feed her the tea, but don't give her the pill. When she can start eating food again, give her the pill so that her inner energy can stabilize.\"\nAgain, Xu Nuan bowed, \"Thank you very much, senior. Without you, I don't know what would happen to Qiqi.\"\n\"Don't mention it. Oh, be sure to check your lifespan. You got your commission from those kids.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n.\nName: Xu Nuan\nAge: 113\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,230 Years, 9 Months, 5 Days, 4 Hours, 13 Minutes\n.\nUpon seeing the increase in her lifespan, Xu Nuan was stunned. She remembered that it was only 1000ish when it appeared.\n\"S-Senior, how?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"It's your incentive. If you introduce me to more customers, you will get one-tenth of what they spend in my store.\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan bitterly laughed as she understood the purpose of this scheme. Still, she appreciated it.\n\"Those girls must have spent a lot. I think my lifespan increases by 150 years or so.\"\n\"Yeah, they spent a lot on those dresses. Anyway, thank you for doing business. If you need more Bloodmelons or this tea, do come again.\"\n\"I will. Oh, by the way.\"\nXu Nuan noticed that Leo didn't seem to be affiliated with anybody. She tried asking him.\n\"Would you like to accompany us to the mystic realm this season? We have an available spot open for you.\"\nLeo dryly laughed, 'This again?'\nThe mystic realm seemed interesting, but Leo hadn't solved the language barrier issue yet. He needed 20,000 years of lifespan for the auto-speech translation.\n\"I'm afraid I…\"\nLeo was about to refuse. But then, Xu Nuan suddenly described her previous expedition.\n\"Our sanctuary's gateway brought us to the wetland last season. Our people ran into countless strong crocodiles and alligators, and we got a lot of water-based herbs and 4th-grade monster cores. We also managed to capture a few specimens. Actually, I tamed several lizardmen and a three-tailed alligator queen during the last expedition. In this season, we expect the gateway to take us back to the previous wetland since we failed to conquer it. I wonder if you are inter-\"\n\"DID YOU SAY, ALLIGATOR QUEEN?!\"\n\"Est, err…\"\nLeo accidentally grabbed Xu Nuan's shoulders and shook her. Fortunately, he still wore rubber gloves, so she wasn't infected.\nXu Nuan was taken aback. She didn't expect that Leo would get excited over a monster. Still, she was delighted that Leo showed interest in their expedition and her story.\n\"Yes. Would you like to see it?\"\nLeo widely grinned and almost said yes. Fortunately, he closed his mouth before a word could slip out of his mouth. Leo then facepalmed.\n\"I-I'm so sorry. I'm in a bit predicament. I can't join your expedition right now, or I might bring trouble to you and your girls.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nXu Nuan nodded in understanding.\n'I see. Since Daoist Florida Man killed Ouyang Long, the Ouyang Clan might be targeting him. Therefore, if he joined the Amazonian Sanctuary, he might bring trouble to us. What a considerate senior!'\nOn the other hand, Leo had another thought.\n'No matter how tempting it is, I must stay here and wait for stupid cultivators to raid my store again! I need more lifespan for that juicy auto-speech translation! Without it, I can't go on an adventure! But man, I miss my alligator.'\nAs Xu Nuan failed to invite Leo to visit her sanctuary, she bid farewell.\n\"Then, I would like to excuse myself. Again, thank you for saving Qiqi.\"\n\"Don't mention it.\"\nXu Nuan turned around and flew back to her flying ship.\n.\n.\nAfter the women were gone, Leo glanced at Cat.\nThe culprit behind the commotion noticed Leo's stare and ran away. However, she ran into his granary.\nLeo facepalmed for the nth time. He ignored the mischievous plant and turned his attention to the bouquet of grass flowers. They were still blooming and fresh even though they were left on the ground for a long time.\n\"Hah. What a day. Because of you, I almost killed a little girl.\"\nLeo picked the bundle of grass up and inspected the white flowers. He pursed his lips and brought them to the alchemy workshop.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 54 – Florida Man Threatens to Cut Cat's Legs for Food\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 6,007 Years, 11 Months, 2 Days, 13 Hours, 26 Minutes.>\nLeo grumbled as his lifespan wasn't enough to purchase the auto-speech feature. He needed 14,000 more. However, he had enough to upgrade his store to level six.\nHe could upgrade the store to level 6 right now, but there was nothing to gain other than expanding the store's interior space.\n\"Meh, what the hell.\"\nLeo chose to save up his lifespan for the language. After all, 20,000 years of lifespan was harder to collect.\nDING\nWhile Leo was in deep thought, the cauldrons finished making two batches of yang flame dans. Leo wasted no time and tossed a white flower into the pot and pressed the research button.\nDING\n<You have discovered Immortal Flower.>\n.\nImmortal Flower\nCan only be found on matured immortal grasses. It contained a thick amount of life force and five element Qi. However, it is not suitable to be consumed raw as it contains poisonous pores. Can be refined into True Immortal Pill, which can instantly unlock the potential of any cultivator.\nAlchemy Recipe – True Immortal Pill\n10 Immortal Flowers\n100 Blades of Immortal Grass\n10 Fire Element Catalyst\n10 Water Element Catalyst\n10 Wood Element Catalyst\n10 Earth Element Catalyst\n10 Poison Element Catalyst\n10 Yang Element Catalyst or one liter of Yang Fluid\n10 Yin Element Catalyst or one liter of Yin Fluid\nFire, Water, Metal, Earth, Wood, Yang, and Yin Essence\n.\nThis one was unusual. Other pills and alchemy recipes only required one main ingredient and a few miscellaneous items, but this recipe asked for 10 of each catalyst and main ingredient. Moreover, it demanded 100 blades of immortal grass.\n\"Yang Element and Yin Element? This is new.\"\nFrom a glance, this recipe seemed difficult, but Leo believed that he might have enough ingredients. He wondered if yin liquid could be used as a yin catalyst. Testing the possibilities, Leo brought a bucket of Ouyang Ting's blood to the workshop and researched it one more time.\nDING\n<You have already discovered Yin Fluid.>\n.\nYin Fluid\nCan be found in a monster's blood or a demon's blood. Alchemists usually dilute their blood in freshwater to increase the yin fluid quantity. Consuming it raw can be dangerous as it can mutate ordinary cultivators into fiendish cultivators. Can be used as a substitute for Yin Catalysts in alchemy.\nTraits\nIncrease Yin Qi by one year's worth of cultivation (100cc) (Consumption)\n.\nLeo had almost ingredients. However, the issue was the yang fluid or yang catalyst. Leo remembered that he had potatoes that could be used as yang catalysts, so he turned around and was about to go check the granary.\nWhile looking around, his eyes noticed the broken earth jar that he had been using to store fresh water from the stream. Leo massaged his forehead, suppressing his anger.\n'That damn plant did it again. Can't she just behave like a normal plant?!'\nLeo deeply sighed. He spent two years, purchasing a 100-liter earth jar from the system store and replacing the broken one. As for the broken pieces, Leo crushed them into small fragments so that he could use them to decorate his front yard.\nWhile Leo tidied the field, he finally came to a realization. He wondered if his bathing water could be researched.\nPutting his theory to the test, Leo grabbed the giant jar and dashed toward the stream. He scooped the water using the container until it was 70% full. Then, he ran back to the store with the freshwater and some small fish inside.\nBOOM\nLeo put the jar near the alchemy workshop. He took off his clothes and jumped into the large jar.\nZAAA\nAs soon as Leo got in the water, the transparent liquid became green, and the fish floated on top of the water. He glanced at the small fish and picked them up. Like a professional basketball player, he threw one into the first alchemy cauldron.\nPLOP\nIt went in. Leo immediately researched the fish, hoping to get something useful.\nDING\n<You have discovered poisonous fish.>\n.\nPoisonous Fish\nThis fish is long dead. Cannot be used in alchemy or consumption. Please throw it away.\n.\nUnfortunately, it was useless. Leo discarded the rest of the fish in the jar. Then, he scooped a handful of water and got out of the unlikely bathtub. He put the content into the cauldron and researched it.\nDING\n<You have discovered Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water.>\n.\nPinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nCan be found in Unicorn's blood or an angel's blood. It is one of the most precious alchemy ingredients because of its rarity and usefulness in various high-ranked pills.\nTraits\nEither kill or bless anyone that touches the water. Not recommended for consumption.\n.I think you should take a look at\n\"… I was hoping for Yang Fluid. Why the hell does it turn out to be the holy water?!\"\nLeo never felt this blessed in his life. He wondered if his body was made of god's blood or something.\nAs Leo had all ingredients at hand, he began putting stuff into the first alchemy cauldron.\n10 Immortal Flowers – Checked.\n100 Blades of Immortal Grass – Checked.\nYin Fluid – Easy! Checked.\nYang Fluid – Simple! Checked.\nFire Catalyst?\nLeo tilted his head for a moment. Then, he smacked his forehead. He had been making Yang Flame Pills using Fiery Yang Tomatoes, Virgin Yang Potatoes, and the fire catalyst that Leo got from fruits.\nHe gazed at the basket near the cauldron and the tomatoes. It was full of red oranges\n.\nTiger Killing Orange\nCan be found in volcanic mystic realms. It produces great aroma and burning hot air. Rumor said that it can be used to make a delicacy drink. Can be used as a substitute for Fire Element Catalyst in alchemy.\nTrait\nVery delicious\n.\nThese oranges were among the mutated fruits that Leo had gotten from Wu Buyi. Unfortunately, it could only be used as a catalyst, so Leo hadn't been using it much until he got the tomatoes.\nLeo continued his checklist.\nWater Catalysts – Bloodmelons, Checked.\nEarth Catalysts – Golden Bananas, Checked.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Metal Catalysts – Iron Tree Barks, Checked.\nWood Catalysts…\nWhere are Cat's roots?\nLeo paused. He turned around and dashed toward the granary. Upon entering the building, Leo found Cat, who was busy eating potatoes.\nCat shrank in fear. She hissed at Leo, warning him not to punish her.\nLeo widely grinned. He rubbed his hands and glanced at her long roots.\n\"Listen here, Cat. I need a portion of your roots for alchemy. Can I get some?\"\nHISS!\nNoticing Leo's strange expression and malicious aura, Cat climbed the building and latched onto the ceiling, hissing at him.\nLeo deeply sighed, \"I just want 10 pieces of your roots. What's the big deal? You ate a lot of my food, but I only want something that you will eventually discard. Why resisting?\"\nHISS!\n\"…\"\nLeo pursed his lips. Since Cat refused to cooperate, he could only return to his workshop to look for another alternative. He was not shameless enough to forcefully cut her roots and get the necessary ingredients.\nHe turned to another corner of the granary, which stored a hundred baskets of other fruits and vegetables that Leo hadn't used yet. He grabbed an item, which continuously emitted brown gas.\n.\nWeeping Onion\nCan be found in a mystic realm with dense earth miasma. It produces brown tear gas to protect itself. Can be used as an earth element catalyst in alchemy.\nTrait\nProduce deadly tear gas.\n.\nLeo always avoided it as it smelled, and the gas made his eyes itchy. Even Cat avoided them.\nHe picked 20 of the onions and brought them back to the alchemy workshop. He put 10 in the pots, completing the last set of ingredients. After spitting a few times into the fireplace, Leo completed feeding the workshop some essence.\nDING\n<Refining True Immortal Pills…>\n167 Hours, 59 Minutes, 57 Seconds…\nLeo almost cursed out loud. This pill needed a whole week to complete!\nBecause of the long refining time, Leo aborted the plan to make another batch of True Immortal Pills. He put in ingredients to make rejuvenate tea instead as he needed one active workshop to make some goodies to sell.\nLeo grumbled and brought the prepared ingredients back to the granary. He put everything in its place and looked at the ceiling, gazing at Cat.\nCat was still paranoid. Even though she was at fault, she was still behaving like a spoiled brat.\n\"Alright. I guess I didn't educate you enough. Come down here, Cat!\"\nHISS!\nEven though Leo no longer wished to harm or cut her roots, Cat was still afraid of him. She kept crawling and running on the ceiling.\nAs Cat started to get on his nerve, Leo warned her, \"If you don't come down here, I'll go and grab you myself. And if I catch you, you'll get some spanking, okay? Will you come down obediently and work with me, or will you be forced to work and get spanked? Choose one.\"\n\"Meow…\"\nCat was smart. Upon noticing Leo's voice tone, she paused to contemplate the pros and cons. A few seconds later, she crawled down and approached Leo.\nMLEM\nTrying to reduce her penalties, Cat licked his face. She also tried to kiss him, but her chomper mouth ended up sucking his head in her mouth instead.\n\"…\"\nCHU-CHU\nLeo's entire head was wet and smelly. He patiently pulled his head out and gently pinched her lips.\n\"Cat. We have to talk, okay? I've been feeding you a lot of things. It's about time that I need your lifespan again.\"\n\"Meow?\"\nLeo opened her lifespan status, checking her balance.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 55 – Florida Man Challenges Thunderstorm by Standing on Open Field\nName: Cat\nAge: 0\nRemaining Lifespan: 6,300 Years\n.\nSometimes, Leo wondered, how much did Cat eat to get her lifespan to this point? He deeply sighed in envy.\n\"Cat. I need some of your lifespans. Can you share them with me? You don't have to give me everything. Just give me half.\"\n\"Meow?\" Cat mischievously smirked.\n\"What? You dare to ask me what I will give you in return?! You ate my potatoes and other food, you little brat! You've been freeloading me for several days now. You need to pay rent!\"\n\"Meow!\" Cat pouted and pointed at the remaining pile of giant potatoes.\n\"You want all of those? You greedy punk!\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nLeo gave up on Cat's gluttony and greed. He compromised as he didn't want to take advantage of this little kid.\n\"Fine. I'll give you the entire stock of potatoes as long as you spit out the seeds. I need those to regrow them, okay?\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nThe two came to a term. Cat obediently gave 4,000 years of her life force to Leo.\nDING\nAfter getting the lifespan, Leo's life force reached 10,000, which was halfway to his goal. He could only wait for more customers or hoodlums to show up again.\n.\nWithout a visitor, Leo killed his time by farming and clearing land. He also didn't forget to make pills, sacred wood blocks, and tea. The mannequin doll also helped him collect resources.\nThe next morning, Leo resumed working as usual. However, for the entire day, nobody visited his store. He hummed in a good mood as he got to enjoy a quiet and slow life for once.\nThe next day, nobody showed up. However, Leo was happy as he got to replenish grain pills, tea, and yang flame pills in the store.\nOn the third day, no one visited him. Not even a beast showed up to attack his store.\nAfter three days of idling, Leo felt like something was missing in his life, yet he was in a good mood as he managed to stock up on sacred wood blocks. He focused on making wood blocks for an entire day and fill the backyard behind the workshop with hundreds of them.\nSeven days passed since Xu Nuan last visited him, and Leo was bored.\nHe sat in his store, gazing at the shelves full of yang flame pills, grain pills, and vegetables. He deeply sighed.\n\"Where are all the customers? Where are those crazy cultivators?\"\nHe was tired of uprooting woods and making random items with the alchemy cauldrons. He wondered where all the people went.\nBecause of boredom, Leo finally took a day off from the farmland and alchemy workshop. Leo spent the rest of the afternoon in his bedroom, chilling and enjoying the afternoon nap.\nBOOM\nSuddenly, a loud boom came from the first workshop. Leo jumped out of his bed and rushed toward the cauldron.\nWhen Leo came out of the store through the backdoors, he saw a pillar of rainbow light, trekking to the sky. It shone upon the cauldron, highlighting its location. Leo looked up, but he couldn't find the source of the light beacon.\nRUMBLE\nBlack clouds gathered above the beacon of light. A lightning storm brewed, and thunder sounds followed.\nMeanwhile, Cat had been sitting on the rooftop. When the thunder sound echoed in the sky, she shrieked and sprinted to the granary building. Upon getting inside, she shivered in a corner, burying herself under the mountain of potatoes.\nLeo stared at the sky and the dark clouds. He bitterly smiled.\n\"It's you again. Are you following me to this world, too?\"I think you should take a look at\nThis was not the first time that Leo encountered the sentient thunderclouds. He still remembered vividly as if he had just met the clouds yesterday as the experience that day imprinted in his mind.\n.\n.\nLife Sword Sect, Magpie City\nIt had been over a week since Ouyang Long was dead. Because of the incident, Wu Buyi and Han Hao summoned all elders of the sect for an emergency meeting. Then, they gathered at the foot of the Claymore Mountain.\nThe Claymore Mountain was a billion years old tall mountain. It was three times taller than Mt. Everest, and its shape was similar to a massive long sword. The local cultivators and commoners called it Claymore Mountain, paying homage to the founder of the Life Sword Sect, who used a claymore as his personal weapon.\nAt the top of the mountain, Life Sword Sect's master resided. He rarely spent time managing his sect as he was usually in seclusion. Every time he went into seclusion, he always remained on the mountain for decades.\nHowever, Han Hao could no longer wait for the sect master to come out. He gathered everybody in the sect at the foot of the mountain and knelt.\n\"Sect Master, we need your help!\"\n\"Sect Master! Our sect is in danger!\"\nThe elders kept shouting, hoping that the sect master could hear them. Although everybody wanted to climb the mountain and visit the sect master directly, they couldn't enter as it was heavily protected by a killing array.\nAfter a week of kneeling, the elders started to lose hope. They looked at each other, wondering if they should flee the sect before the Ouyang Family and the Jianghu Alliance invaded them.\nRUMBLE\nWhile kneeling, the thunderous sound from afar distracted everybody. Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and a dozen elders stood up and gazed east.\n\"Tribulation Clouds?\"\n\"Is someone breaking through? Those tribulation clouds seem a bit thick.\"\n\"When I advanced to the nascent soul realm, my tribulation clouds were as big as a small hill. But those clouds are…\"\nThe elders gulped. The clouds kept expanding and condensing larger. A few minutes later, they reached Magpie City, and the clouds slowly descended.\nHan Hao narrowed his eyes. He had been living for over a hundred years, but he had never seen tribulation clouds this thick. Moreover, Han Hao suspected that they came from a certain place.\n\"Say, Wu Buyi.\"\nWu Buyi stood up and gazed at the clouds, \"Yeah?\"\n\"I heard that when an alchemist makes a pill that transcends the mortal world, tribulation clouds will appear to destroy the pill. Is that true?\"\nWu Buyi deeply sighed, \"Correct. Heaven Tribulations appear to test cultivators during their breakthroughs, but they can also test the newly made immortal pills. If the pill quality is not the pinnacle grade or high grade, the made pills will be destroyed. But this tribulation also depends on the maker of the pills. We, the alchemists, can share the burden of the Heaven Tribulations. Half of the lightning bolts will strike the pill owner if they carry the pills. However, if the alchemists choose to avoid trouble, all lightning bolts will concentrate on the pills. Well, in short, if the alchemist is strong enough, he can actually protect the low-grade immortal pills from being destroyed.\"\nHan Hao silently thought of Leo, \"Do you think those clouds come for Daoist Florida Man?\"\nWu Buyi sweated profusely. He repeatedly nodded, \"Considering the size of the clouds, I think so. He must have made an immortal pill!\"\nWhile the crowd spectated and speculated, an elderly man came out from his cave. He had a long white beard, but he had no hair. His thick droopy eyebrows covered half of his eyes. However, his aura was the same as Ouyang Long's.\nSect Master Hua Jiashan used his cane as he walked. He gazed at the east, where the tribulation clouds had been gathering. He solemnly pondered.\n\"The world is full of surprises. It has been 500 years since I last saw the Heavenly Tribulation of Immortal Pills. The last soul formation alchemist died protecting the pill in vain, and Ouyang Tong stole the pill and ascended to the higher realm. Since the pill appears again, I'm sure the despicable Ouyang Clan will swarm there to steal the pill. No, I forgot about the demon clans and unorthodox cultivators. Those undying bastards will definitely go there to snatch the immortal pill after the tribulation.\"\nHua Jiashan snorted and sent a voice transmission to his subordinates.\n\"All elders, prepare to depart after the tribulation is over. We must protect the alchemist at all costs. Do not allow his pill to be stolen by unorthodox cultivators or despicable thieves!\"\nThe elders at the mountain foot widened their eyes in astonishment. They cheered as their sect master finally came out from seclusion.\n\"FINALLY!\" Han Hao was delighted. He sent his voice transmission to Hua Jiashan to inform him about Leo and Ouyang Long's death.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo jumped on top of the alchemist workshop. He deeply sighed as he baited the lightning bolts.\n\"COME HERE, YOU LITTLE SHIT! I WON'T LET YOU DESTROY MY PRECIOUS ARTIFACTS AGAIN! I MADE THIS, SO THIS IS MINE!\"\nLeo remembered how the tribulation lightning bolts destroyed some of the alien artifacts when he brought them out of the spaceship. In the end, only the ring survived.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 56 – Florida Man Struck by Lightning Bolts, Becomes Super Florida Man\n50,000 Years Ago…\nIn a dark room inside a round structure with a flat metal surface, 10,000 3-meter-tall capsules trapped mutated humans inside while the green fluid prevented them from rotting. However, nobody was there to monitor their conditions. On the floor, a dozen corpses of humanoid creatures were already dried and decayed.\nWHOOSH\nThe only entrance to this room was a sci-fi door. It automatically slid to the side as someone stood at the other side of the door. From a circular passageway, a thin silhouette of a human entered the dark lab.\nThe skeleton-thin middle-aged man with white hair looked around the room with his green eyes. He grumbled as he inspected the room, searching for survivors.\n\"Anybody there?! HELLOOOO?!\"\nHELLOOO\nELLOO\nLOO\nHis voice echoed in the strange lab. The man scanned the room, searching for anything that he could use or eat.\nLeo, who hadn't eaten anything since he woke up in the strange place, was desperate. He was starving, and he slowly lost the strength to walk or move. He looked around the room and found that it was similar to the place that he came from.\n\"WHERE IS THIS PLACE?!\"\nBecause of the shock and panic, Leo forgot about the horror movie flags as one shouldn't shout or make a loud noise in a foreign place. Instead, he should have remained quiet to keep his presence hidden from potentially unknown entities.\nAs Leo dragged his feet to explore the room, he accidentally stumbled upon a corpse on the ground. As he fell, his hand reached out to grab something to balance himself.\nBEEP\nLeo's hand touched a console panel, and it lit up in green color. The strange machine activated, and the control panel became bright, including the large tube in front.\nLeo looked up and found another mutated human in the tube. It looked like something from Resident Evil games as it had a zombie-like face and disfigured limbs. Fortunately, this was not Leo's first time that he saw another mutant.\nThe thin middle-aged man sighed and looked at his arms and hands. His hands were twice bigger than Shaq's hands, and the green cysts on his face were the same as many zombie monsters in the capsules.\n*COUGH*\nLeo vomited a mouthful of green liquid. His stomach churned as if something inside was eating his innards.\n\"Damn cancer cells! Just kill me!\"\nConfused and frustrated, Leo punched his stomach. The impact dizzied him, but he somehow felt better.\n*BLECH*\nAgain, Leo hurled more liquid from his mouth. This time, a one-foot-long larva came out along with the puke. As if it knew that it was no longer inside its host, it turned around and looked at Leo.\nHISS\nIts face split open like a flower. Then, it crawled toward Leo.\n\"GO TO HELL!\"\nLeo mustered his feeble strength and stomped it.\nSPLASH\nIt was crushed and splattered green liquid everywhere.\nLeo panted in exhaustion. He slightly leaned backward to bend his back while he shut his eyes tight.\n\"UGH!\"\nAfter the stretch, Leo felt a lot better. The pain in his stomach was gone.\nWhile Leo was about to give up living, the capsule in front of him suddenly released the pressure inside the container. The green liquid decreased, and the mutated zombie in the tube collapsed to the bottom of the container.\nLeo sighed and looked at the dead zombie in pity.\n\"Sucks to be you. Just don't wake up.\"\nFortunately, such a scenario didn't happen. A long metal, attached with sharp blades, slowly descended from the top of the capsule. It pressed the corpse to the bottom of the container, and it started spinning.\nWHIZZ WHIZZ\nLeo felt nauseous. That capsule turned into a blending machine, slicing and grinding the mutated corpse inside into mincemeat. Despite the disgust, Leo kept watching, wondering what the machine tried to do.\nA few minutes later, the capsule finished turning the zombie into red juice. It retracted the blades and filled the tube with yellow liquid.\nRed blood and mysterious yellow fluid turned into orange HUMAN juice. Leo's expression turned dark as he imagined himself drinking it.\nGROWL\nBecause of such a thought, Leo got hungry. His stomach rebelled, forcing him to bend forward in pain.\nThe capsule didn't end there. After mixing the juices together, the machine added strange powder into the container. Then, the same blades descended to stir the juice.\nWHIZZ WHIZZ\nNothing traumatized and captivated Leo more than watching this strange machine mixing something inhuman. Leo noticed that it started throwing random grass, leaves, monster bones, and strange meat into the container.\nWHOOSH\nWhile Leo kept watching, the other capsules also activated. They repeated what the machine in front of Leo did, crushing the mutants inside and militating them into red juice.\nLeo no longer had the strength to walk or leave this room. He sat there and looked at his side, finally noticing the dried corpse that he had stumbled on.\n\"Oh, you. What are you?\"\nIt was not a human corpse as its skull was too big. It also had big hands and long fingers like Leo. Moreover, it had white hair.\nLeo bitterly smiled. He remembered that he woke up on a single bed, and many tubes were inside him, filling his body with white fluid. His mouth was also covered by a strange mask, feeding him nitrogen-like gas.\nThinking of how his current state looked like the corpse of this creature, Leo wondered if this alien mistook him as one of its kind and tried to resurrect him. Unfortunately, something killed the alien before Leo could find out the truth behind the experiment and his resurrection.\nPZZSSSHHHH\nFinally, the machine in front of Leo finished blending and mixing random substances. The capsule glass turned red, and Leo could feel the heat.\nHowever, inside the glass, only a suspicious finger-sized ball was left behind. Moreover, the capsule glass was open, allowing Leo to access the content.\nSeeing the strange ball, Leo had a sick thought. He wondered if it was edible. Because of hunger, he no longer cared about the ingredient of this weird ball.\nLeo stood up and reached out to grab it.\nSCREECH\nUnfortunately, the ball immediately transformed into a larva, similar to the thing that Leo had crushed earlier. It jumped and opened its flower mouth, trying to bite him.\n\"DAMMIT\"\nLeo punched the creature by reflex. Although he didn't use much strength, the creature was shattered upon impact, splashing its green blood everywhere.\nAfter killing the monster, Leo bitterly smiled. He turned toward the other capsules in the large room as they were also creating a similar creature.\n\"I take it back. This is hell.\"\nLeo turned around and gathered his last bit of strength to leave. But as he looked at the alien corpse, he noticed glittering objects on him.\nOn the alien's fingers, Leo found five rings of different colors.\nCurious, Leo returned to the corpse and pulled out the rings. Again, it was his reflex as a former Florida Man.\n\"Ah, crap.\"\nUnfortunately, out of five rings, four were broken in half upon touch. Only one remained intact. Leo put the clear gold ring on his finger and admired it.\nWHOOSH-CLICK\nLeo's luck was downright terrible. The door automatically closed and locked Leo inside the room. At the same time, the 9,999 capsules finished creating 9,999 alien larvae.\nSeeing how his situation changed from bad to worse, Leo was on the verge of giving up. He sat down and waited for the larvae to find him.\n\"That's enough. I'm out. Let me die.\"I think you should take a look at\nLeo bitterly laughed and rubbed the gold ring. He deeply sighed and prayed for a quick death.\nDING\nAs Leo was about to close his eyes and lie down, a semi-transparent blue screen appeared in front of Leo. It showed strange moon rune language at first, but Leo somehow understood them. He read the first sentences on the screen.\n<Identifying New User…>\n\"Huh?\"\n<Confirming New User's Data...>\n<Confirming New User's Identity…>\n<New User's Karma Identified.>\n<New User's Gnosis Identified.>\n<Evaluating Compatibility with Entity Fate Crystal…>\n<Evaluating Completed! Compatibility Rate: 99.10 %!>\n<Merging New User's Gnosis and Karma with Entity Fate Crystal…>\n\"What?\"\nLeo didn't understand anything as the message popped up so fast. Before he could even comprehend what the message meant, the golden ring already merged with his finger.\nInstantly, Leo could no longer breathe. His body slowly floated, and his skin emitted rainbow light. A million small worms suddenly emerged from the pores of his skin, and they extended everywhere, turning him into a porcupine.\nCLANK-CLANK\nThe tiny tentacles from Leo's skin crushed the machine, ceiling, floor, walls, larvae, corpses, and random objects. They melt every metal and creature. Then, they sucked the liquid into Leo's body.\nThe thin body of Leo absorbed the nutrition from the tiny tentacles even though they were made of metal material or glass. He even took in the green fluid of the larvae and the corpses of aliens.\nThe tentacles kept melting and sucking fluid while Leo looked around in confusion. Then, his consciousness slowly faded, and his heart stopped beating.\n.\n\"Umm.\"\nLeo didn't know how long he had died or slept. He felt like something zappy and tingling hit his chest so hard that his heart resumed beating. Slowly, Leo opened his eyes.\nWhen Leo could see everything clearly again, his first sight was a thick black thundercloud. It rumbled and flashed countless strings of light.\n\"Oh, a thunderstorm?\"\nBANG\nAs soon as Leo talked, a lightning bolt struck his chest. The terrifying heat and the electricity instantly burnt half of his body. He could even sense the heat frying his soft brain.\nHowever, a blue screen showed up, informing Leo.\nDING\n<Warning: You are under attack.>\n<Your current lifespan: 1,150 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"What?\"\nLeo was confused. He didn't even have enough time to check his current appearance or the surroundings as the new lightning bolt came for him.\nBOOM\nOnce again, Leo felt like he was burnt alive.\nDING\n<Warning: You are under attack.>\n<Your current lifespan: 650 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nIn one hit, Leo's lifespan decreased by 500 years. However, it was far from over.\n\"Son of a…!\"\nLeo grasped the gist of the situation. He looked up and tried to predict the timing to dodge the lightning bolt.\nHowever, before the next lightning bolt came, Leo's constitution changed. He felt that some of the heat transferred to his hair and fingers. Moreover, some of the residual energy merged with his muscle fibers and blood cells.\nDING\n<Your current lifespan: 1,350 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nLeo's lifespan bounced back. Not only it refunded the decreased years, but Leo also gained 200 years extra!\n\"Eh? How?\"\nBOOM\nBefore Leo could react, the next strike landed directly on his head. Leo's consciousness blacked out for a few seconds, and he fell to his knees.\nDING\n<Warning: You are under attack.>\n<Your current lifespan: 350 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nRUMBLE\nThe thunderclouds echoed in the sky. As if heaven waited for Leo to recuperate, no lightning came for him when he was unconscious.\nA few minutes later, Leo regained his sense. He swore that he saw the River Styx and the Grim Reaper on a ferry boat. However, the reaper chased him away, saying that Samsara God rejected him.\nDING\n<Your current lifespan: 1,550 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nLeo didn't know how, but the fried brain cells were resurrected, and he could feel their presence inside him. He could even command them to move around. Furthermore, he could tell what each cell thought of him.\n\"What the hell? What am I?\"\nBOOM\nThe next strike came when Leo least expected it. Again, the thunderclouds headshot him. However, this time, Leo didn't fall unconscious.\nDING\n<Your current lifespan: 1,350 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nDING\n<Your current lifespan: 1,750 Years, 10 Months, 16 Days, 14 Hours, 43 Minutes.>\nThe damage was also a lot less, and his body somehow adapted to the recovery process. Leo was no longer injured by the lightning anymore.\nGetting addicted to the lightning strikes, Leo looked up and challenged heaven, \"Do it again! I love it!\"\nBOOM\nUnfortunately, the next strike didn't come for him. It hit something else.\nFinally, Leo looked around the check his surroundings. He then found himself in the same mysterious room, but the ceilings were blasted open. Upon further inspection, Leo found several floors and the rough structure of a massive damaged spaceship.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nIt was too late for Leo to inspect the spaceship as lightning bolts started destroying modules and melting metal objects. The white lightning bolt changed their color to red, and they were as sharp as lightsabers. Everything that the red lightning bolts hit, they left behind red melting holes and lava.\n\"Shit. WAIT! THERE ARE THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T EXPLORED YET!\"",

He spread his arms, taunting the heaven.\n\"Smite me, I dare you! I broke promises. I slept with your mother… your sister and your dad, too!\"\nBANG\nA yellowish lightning bolt directly struck down and the light pierced through Leo's chest. An electric current ran through his body, but his muscle fibers and cells absorbed everything.\nLeo burst into laughter. He was not the same as when he first came out from the alien spaceship. Green lightning bolts did nothing to him.\nHe had seen seven types of lightning bolts. The first type was white bolts, which only caused electricity and heat damage. Leo had never measured the voltage, but he used to struggle with it after the first evolution. But after the second mutation, Leo was no longer affected by simple heat and electric current.\nThe second type was the memorable green lightning bolts. It defied physics as it had a physical form. Leo got struck by it once when he successfully survived the second mutation. Despite being stronger than most mutants and monsters on Earth, the lightning used to leave a gaping hole in his chest, and Leo almost died.\nThe purple lightning belonged to the third category. Its destructive force and heat exceeded that of the previous tier, and it was a homing type. Leo once faced them during his third mutation, and the lightning bolts followed him to the underground bunker, where he sheltered from the outside world.\nThere were four more colors – Yellow, Orange, Red, and Black. Every rank was stronger than the previous color. So far, Leo had gone through everything in the previous world.\n\"IS THAT ALL YOU CAN DO?! GIMME MORE!\"\nLeo chortled as he glanced at his lifespan status.\n<Current Lifespan: 11,557 Years…>\nLeo had been hit three times so far, and every strike increased his lifespan by 500 years. He could never be happier.\nBOOM\n\"Again!\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\n\"Oh, yes! Baby!\"\nBOOM-BOOM-BOOM\n\"Ahn! Kimoji---!\"\nLeo's clothes were burnt, leaving him naked. However, he and his brother stared at heaven in enthusiasm. Had any modern people seen him at the moment, they would have called the cops to take the pervert exhibitionist away.\nWindstorm picked up as the lightning bolts zapped Leo's chest. His hair and beard fluttered by the strong gale, and tree leaves were sucked into the sky.\nSeeing how nature stole his precious iron pine leaves in the nearby forest, Leo was enraged. He purchased a flag pole and a red-blue flag. Then, he waved them.\n\"See this? This is Florida! Come down here and catch me if you can! I'll let you touch my butt cheeks!\"\nAs if the tribulation clouds were offended, the lightning bolts changed color from green to purple.\nBOOM\nThe lightning bolts were no longer random. Like homing missiles, they concentrated on Leo's chest and head as if Heaven tried to roast or burn him alive.\nUnfortunately, Leo received no punishment. He was rewarded with the heavenly energy, which increased his life force.\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 14,641 Years…>\n<Current Lifespan: 15,154 Years…>\n<Current Lifespan: 15,666 Years…>\nThe national flags were instantly burnt to ash, but Leo's skin remained smooth and flawless. He sneered and waited for the clouds to upgrade their power.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 16,173 Years…>\n<Current Lifespan: 16,689 Years…>\n..\n<Current Lifespan: 22,745 Years…>\nPatience was key. Leo counted his fingers and whistled in a good mood.\nBOOM-BOOM\nTwo purple lightning bolts came for his crotch. However, the long glossy thing was harmless.\n\"Nope. Can't touch dis.\"\nBOOM-BOOM\nTwo purple lightning bolts attacked his eyes in unison. Extreme heat and electric current blurred his vision for a moment, but they did nothing to his eyeballs other than temporarily blinded him.\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 24,819 Years…>\nWhen Leo's sight adapted to the collective heat and statics, he noticed that the dark clouds slowly dispersed. He pouted in disappointment.\n\"Only 30? Lame! You used to hit me 100 times straight. How come you're so lazy?\"\nLeo rested his hands on his shoulders. His boner was killed.\nDING\n<Repairing!>\nDespite being the only one that got hit, the first workshop's rooftop was charred black. However, the blackened part slowly regained color as the building automatically self-repaired.\nLeo looked around. The forest around the store was devastated by the windstorm, but most of the mutated pine trees stood tall. Only the blue trees and regular pine trees lost most of their branches.\nFortunately, Leo stored most of his merchandise in his warehouse. Sacred wood blocks and processed items were safe in the building. As for the store and the second workshop, it was still intact.\nLeo returned to his room and put on a new set of clothes. Then, he returned to the cauldron, which just completed the pills.\nThe cauldron was glittering in rainbow colors. Leo widely grinned and touched it to see what the workshop made for him.\nDING\n<You have refined 16 Medium-Grade, 13 High-Grade, and 1 Superior-Grade True Immortal Pills.>\n.\nMedium Grade True Immortal Pill\nPermanently increase physical strength by 25%\nIncrease Yin and Yang Qi by 500 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 500 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Lifespan by 500 years.\n.\nHigh Grade True Immortal Pill\nPermanently increase physical strength by 35%\nIncrease Yin and Yang Qi by 700 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 700 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Lifespan by 700 years.\n.\nSuperior Grade True Immortal Pill\nPermanently increase physical strength by 50%I think you should take a look at\nIncrease Yin and Yang Qi by 1,000 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 1,000 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease Lifespan by 1,000 years.\n.\nLeo's eyes almost jumped out of the eyes sockets as soon as he saw the funny numbers. He also choked.\n\"ONE THOUSAND YEARS PER PILL?!\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm He fell to his knees, praying to Jesus while hugging the cauldron. He was never this happy.\n\"I'VE FOUND A CHEAT! THIS IS SO BROKEN, AND I LOVE IT!\"\nAfter kissing the black pot, Leo gazed at the hovering rainbow pills over the cauldron. He reached out to collect them. As soon as Leo touched the superior pill, it zapped him. He could also sense strong radiation coming from it.\nLeo smirked as the radiation was harmless to him. He popped the pill into his mouth. Although he didn't care about strength boost or Qi, the one thousand years of lifespan booster was necessary to him.\n\"NOOOOOOO!!\"\nLeo frowned as he heard someone's desperate cry from afar. He chewed the pill like a snack while his hands collected the floating rainbow pills. Then, he turned around to look where the noise came from.\nWhen Leo turned around and looked up, he found a dozen jetski boat-like flying ships and a hundred people standing on floating swords to the south. To the north, a thousand cultivators also surrounded the forest while they rode on their floating weapons. Moreover, a dozen old men on a massive flying claymore sword observed Leo from the sky.\nLeo was stunned. He didn't know that he got so many visitors.\n\"This must be my lucky day!\"\nLeo rubbed his hands, looking forward to welcoming customers. Unfortunately, the next words of a cultivator from the south stunned him.\n\"HAND OVER THE IMMORTAL PILLS!!\"\nLeo's smiling face froze. His friendly expression turned dark, but the corners of his mouth curved up wider.\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n.\n.\nAn Hour Earlier\nThe South Peninsula of the main continent belonged to the Situ Clan, the prestige craftsmen clan. This family produced over a thousand elite alchemists, scribes, blacksmiths, and merchants, and they also joined prominent alchemy sects, blacksmith unions, and array schools. Aside from the Ouyang Clan, they were considered the wealthiest family.\nHowever, no matter how rich they were, mortals had a finite lifespan. Every clan member desired nothing more but a way to increase their longevity and restore their youth.\nAt a harbor town, one of the Situ Clan's elders sat on a peer, holding a fishing rod. He waited for a fish to bite the bait while he meditated, circulating his Qi. Because of the deep meditation, the fisherman somewhat dozed off, being half-asleep.\nThe fisherman was a skinny old man with a white goatee. He wore a ragged grey robe, which barely covered his skin. He was also short as his height was merely 5 feet tall. His tattered straw hat latched onto his head, hiding his bald head.\nBZZ\nWhile the fisherman enjoyed his daydream, something in his hat buzzed. The fisherman slowly opened his eyes as he heard someone's voice entering his mind.\n'Grandfather, our scouts from Magpie City have reported that pill tribulation clouds are gathering there. Someone has made an immortal pill. Should we take a look?'\n\"Immortal pill, you say?\"\nSitu Nantian stood up. He rubbed his goatee beard and nodded, \"Send someone to snatch the alchemist before the likes of Ouyang get him! If he can make an immortal pill, he must know the recipe! Capture him, ALIVE!\"\n'Will do. Say, grandfather. When will you return? The Tang Clan's grand elder is looking for you. He said something about he needed your help to make some poison arrays for his clansmen.'\n\"That damn pest Tang Tian, I assume.\"\n'Y-Yes, grandfather.'\n\"Alright. I'll head back right now. Oh, send the strongest elders there. Since the alchemist can make the pill, he must be at a soul formation stage or higher. Don't send nascent soul soldiers there to die in vain. Tell the men to expect a bitter fight since the other clans will be there, too.\"\n'On it!'\nSitu Nantian deeply sighed. He cut the voice transmission and collected his fishing rod. Coincidentally, something took the bait. He grinned and pulled the fishing pole.\nZAAA\nA 5th-stage giant octopus caught the bait. From a glance, it was at least 100 feet long.\n\"Ah, how nice. I finally get my ink ingredient for my talismans.\"\nSitu Nantian laughed. He waved his hand and placed a yellowish talisman on the monster's forehead.\nBOOM\nThe talisman shattered, and so did its brain. The monster instantly died.\nThe elder collected the monster and the fishing rod in his spatial ring. He then turned around and paused.\nWHOOSH\nAn array appeared around him. Then, he vanished.\n.\nWHOOSH\nA few seconds later, Situ Nantian appeared in an enclosed chamber. The walls and the ceiling had countless symbols drawn on them, forming a teleportation array for the Situ Clan's family members.\nThe elder exited the room. As he came out, he found four nascent soul cultivators, standing guard in front of the room. They all saluted Situ Nantian.\n\"Welcome back, Grand Elder!\"\n\"Welcome back, sir.\"\nSitu Nantian nodded and looked around. He lightly took a step, but he vanished from where he had stood. Instantly, his body reappeared 300 meters away from the place, exiting the underground structure and standing in front of the underground dungeon's entrance.\nAgain, a dozen nascent soul guards bowed to him. Situ Nantian ignored them and took a long stride.\nWHOOSH\nThis time, he traveled 10 kilometers, leaving behind his afterimage.\nWHOOSH\nWith every step Situ Nantian took, he teleported 10 kilometers away. In less than a minute, he arrived at the Situ Clan's headquarters city – The Zenith Sith.\nAs Situ Nantian entered the main courtyard of the family and was about to visit the main hall to report his arrival, a hundred streaks of lights shot out from the grand palace, heading north.\nSitu Nantian gazed at them. He noticed that two of the clan elders were with the people. He then deeply sighed.\n\"They must have gone for that alchemist. Well, it's not like they can get him before me.\"\nHe took his time, taking another stride. He appeared directly in front of the palace. After all, he had other business to do as he was the only quasi-immortal of the clan.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, among the cultivators that came from the north, one of the groups belonged to the Ouyang Clan. Leading the group was none other than Ouyang Feng, the grandchild of Ouyang Ke. He led the battalion of 20 nascent soul cultivators and two soul formation cultivators here to scout the place. However, he was ordered not to attack or provoke Leo.\nUnfortunately, the youth failed to realize the gravity of the situation. He took the initiative to intimidate Leo first.\nNot only Ouyang Feng came here to steal the pills, but the other cultivators from the north and south also had the same idea. They locked on their killing intent on Leo, and they all bellowed.\n\"SURRENDER AND COME WITH US, OR YOU'LL DIE HERE!\"\n\"HAND OVER THE PILLS, OR DIE!\"\n\"I AM BO CAI, THE KING OF MOUNTAIN BANDIT! Y'ALL CAN GET LOST OR STAY HERE AS A CORPSE!\"\n\"YOU DARE?!\"\n\"YOU WANNA DIE, PUNK?! I SAW HIM FIRST! THOSE PILLS BELONG TO THE FATUI CULT!\"\n\"DEATH SWORD SECT CALLS DIBS ON THOSE PILLS. NOBODY INTERFERE!\"\nThe noise kept getting louder as the guests started yelling and bickering at each other.\nOn the other hand, Leo drooled, gazing at the shop domain map, counting the number of red dots.\n\"225… 230… 235… Damn, I'm gonna be rich.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 58 – Florida Man Destroys Illegally Parked Wooden Boat, Kills the Ship Owners\nHua Jiashan, Wu Buyi, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman observed the situation on a massive flying sword 10 kilometers away from the store. They had been watching Leo ever since the lightning storm turned purple.\nAside from Hua Jiashan, everybody sweated profusely. They had gone through a heaven tribulation at least once in their lifetime, but nobody had seen purple lightning bolts.\n\"Why are the lightning bolts purple, sect master? Do you know anything?\" Asked Han Hao.\nHua Jiashan deeply exhaled. He reminisced about the past, \"It's the same tribulation as the soul transformation stage ascension. You should be prepared for it.\"\n\"Soul Transformation Ascension?\"\nThe elders nodded as they understood the term. After the nascent soul stage, every major realm advancement required them to go through a deadly heaven tribulation.\nThe prerequisite of the soul formation stage was getting hit by green lightning bolts. To get to the soul transformation stage, one had to overcome the purple lightning, which was capable of destroying any weak soul formation cultivators upon touch.\nHua Jiashan explained the ranks of heaven tribulation to everybody here.\n\"As fellow mortals, we have to overcome heaven's trials to attain immortality. Transparent Heaven Tribulation got us to the nascent soul stage. The Nature Tribulation made us… I mean, me… a soul formation cultivator. The purple one represents Poisonous and Hypocrisy that can torment soul formation cultivators' minds and break them. It tested your character as a human if you are determined enough to reach the next stage, which I have already failed once.\"\nFrom Hua Jiashan's experience, the purple heaven tribulation's specialty was the power to inflict great pain and confusion on the cultivators. Every strike from heaven could potentially make grown men and a geezer like him beg for death because of the excruciating pain.\nHua Jiashan deeply sighed as he gazed at Leo in envy. He was certain that the latter was not a soul formation cultivator but a quasi-immortal or someone with a higher status, judging how he overcame the purple lightning bolts with ease.\n\"I witnessed how Situ Nantian went through a similar heaven tribulation years ago. After the purple tribulation, there is the Gold Tribulation. One strike from the yellow heaven was a hundred times stronger than 100 purple lightning strikes. I still couldn't believe how Situ Nantian survived heaven's onslaught that day. Did you know that the south of our continent wasn't a peninsula 500 years ago? There were a dozen provinces back then, but everything sank into the sea after Situ Nantian advanced to the quasi-immortal stage. The Gold Tribulation Lightning destroyed everything.\"\n\"…\"\nThe elders gasped in shock and astonishment. As they were a lot younger than Hua Jiashan, they couldn't imagine what the mainland's map was like before Situ Nantian and the heavenly tribulation destroyed a portion of the land.\nRUMBLE\nWhile they chatted, the black clouds dispersed. Leo already got down from the rooftop and put on some clothes. He then reached out to collect the pills.\nHua Jiashan gazed at the empty sky. However, his eyes saw hundreds of cultivators from the north and south, rushing toward the general store at a frightening speed. He deeply sighed.\n\"The hyenas have arrived. We have to go in and help our friend. Right? Wu Buyi?\"\nWu Buyi, who had been standing behind Hua Jiashan, dryly laughed. He was embarrassed, \"T-That's right, sect master. He's our ally. He has been providing aid to our disciples. We must return the favor. Also, his store has a lot of good stuff. Speaking of which, I still need to concoct some Longevity Pill since I got plenty of immortal grass from Daoist Florida Man.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan gave Wu Buyi a meaningful look. He knew that the guest alchemist was greedy. However, as Han Hao and Wu Buyi were sworn brothers, he left the guy be.\nWHOOSH\nThe flying sword rushed toward the store. In a few seconds, it covered five kilometers. However, the greedy cultivators from the north and south already reached the place. They started shouting.\n\"HAND OVER THE IMMORTAL PILLS!!\"\nThe voice was so loud that Hua Jiashan and everybody could hear it from afar. Their expression turned dark.\nTiger Swordsman recognized the owner of the voice. He grumbled, \"That's Bo Cai, the Mountain Bandit King. I don't know if he's stupid or reckless, but he's only a nascent soul cultivator. Why is he trying to provoke Daoist Florida Man?\"\nHan Meng shook his head, \"He probably thought that Daoist Florida Man is not in full condition after transcending the purple heaven tribulation. Well, he's a thief. I doubt his intelligence is half of a baboon.\"\nHua Jiashan snorted. He taught the elders, \"Remember. When we cultivate, we improve our physique and physical strength. For example, if I'm injured, I'm still a soul formation stage cultivator by its core. My punch still holds the same strength. Even if my Qi is depleted, one or two punches are enough to kill a nascent soul cultivator!\"\nEverybody nodded. They learned the lesson by heart as they never challenged a stronger foe regardless of how injured they were.\n\"That's right. An injured tiger is still a tiger. A rabbit can't possibly kill an injured tiger no matter how hard it tries.\"\nAgain, Hua Jiashan bitterly sighed, \"Unless those rabbits are carnivorous and they come in groups.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Another lesson for you. When facing foes with a weaker cultivation base, you must account for their number. If they have ten or more people, you can easily win. If they have a hundred people, you must utilize strategies and avoid fighting all of them at once. Against a thousand, you must flee!\"\n\"Y-Yes, sect master.\"\nAs they listened to Hua Jiashan, they noticed an infamous celebrity among the northern people. Han Meng was the first to notice the guy.\nAmong the flying ships from the north, one of them carried the insignia of the Ouyang Clan. Moreover, it was a luxurious cruiser ship that could house over a thousand cultivators.\n\"That ship… Isn't that from the Ouyang Clan's main headquarters?!\"\nEverybody's face turned white, especially Han Hao. He thought that Ouyang Zi came here personally.\n\"Is Ouyang Zi there? Is he coming for Daoist Florida Man?!\"\nHua Jiashan narrowed his eyes, scanning the ship from afar. A moment later, he shook his head.\n\"No. I don't sense Ouyang Zi or Ouyang Ke on that ship. No soul transformation cultivator is onboard.\"\nHearing that the scary guys were not around, everybody let out a long sigh of relief. Still, there were two hundred nascent soul cultivators and a dozen soul formation cultivators there.\nWu Buyi widely grinned as he didn't see any quasi-immortal or strong guys among the crowd. He laughed, \"I guess we don't have to do anything after all.\"\n\"Why?\" Han Hao and others squinted their brows and stared at the alchemist.\nWu Buyi mimicked Leo's fingers-napping posture, \"Trust me. He only needs one snap to kill everybody. Sect Master, can you hang back and keep the flying sword higher? We don't want to miss the show.\"\n\"???\"\nHua Jiashan was puzzled by Wu Buyi's strange behavior. Thus, he turned his attention to Leo and rescanned the latter's cultivation base.\nThe next minute, Hua Jiashan dropped his jaw.\n\"Your friend... has no cultivation base?!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"No… This is not it!\"\nHua Jiashan could differentiate between quasi-immortals and soul transformation cultivators as he had seen them in action. However, Leo's constitution was a lot different from those men.\nLeo's body didn't gather Qi or essence from the surroundings. On the contrary, his body PRODUCED Qi and element essence, filling the environment with his strange aura. The area around the store was filled with dense essence!I think you should take a look at\nThere was only one explanation.\n\"A True Immortal! A Celestial Being! That man is not a mortal!\"\n\"!!!\"\n.\n.\nLeo pursed his lips and smiled at the crowd. He grabbed another pill in his hand and popped it in his mouth.\n\"So, what are you going to do about it? This is my snack.\"\nAlthough the crowd bickered and yelled at each other, they didn't forget that Leo was still in possession of immortal pills. They bellowed at him when Leo started eating more pills.\n\"GIVE IT HERE!\"\nOne of the flying ships dove down. A dozen nascent soul cultivators jumped off and brandished their weapons, charging at Leo.\nThe Florida Man didn't do anything fancy. He kept chewing immortal pills as if they were popcorn.\nTen spearheads and ten swords, cladded in element Qi, hit Leo's head, but none of them penetrated his skin.\nDING\nDING\nDING\n<You have been attacked.>\nLeo widely grinned. He ignored the people and activated the shop domain system, revealing their lifespan.\n\"Thank you very much, dear customers,\" Laughed Leo.\n\"Huh?\"\nAs usual, Leo commanded the system to take their lifespan in his mind. The group of 20 nascent soul cultivators saw their numbers decrease to zero instantly, but they failed to comprehend what had happened – Their bodies dried and disintegrated into dust.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 14,154 years, 1 Month, 5 Days, 20 Hours, and 52 Minutes.>\nLeo couldn't stop smiling. Killing thieves and hoodlums was more profitable than selling goodies. He wondered how many cultivators would be stupid enough to attack him again.\n\"So?\" Leo looked at the crowd from above.\nUnfortunately, the previous diving flying ship was unmanned. It fell on top of Leo.\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression turned stiff. He raised his free hand and caught the bow of the ship.\nBOOM\nThe ship stopped moving. Leo silently held the 100-meter-long wooden ship with one hand and stared at the weird vehicle.\n\"Umm, excuse me, dear customers. You cannot park your ship on top of my head. Please think logically before you drive. Rather, do you even have a boat license?\"\nLeo jumped up 200 meters in the sky, appearing 200 meters away from Ouyang Feng's cruiser ship. While he still held the ship. He lightly flickered his fingers and knocked the ship.\nBOOM\nThe finger flick shattered the entire ship into fragments. Shrapnel, wood pieces, and random objects scattered everywhere and flew toward the massive ship of Ouyang.\nSmall wooden planks hit Ouyang Feng's crew. The young master also got hit by a small piece of metal, but he didn't flinch.\nEverybody stopped bickering and glared at Leo. They reevaluated his condition, but none of them could measure his true strength.\nWhile floating in the sky, Leo gave Ouyang Feng a meaningful look. As his hand was freed, he grabbed three more pills and shoved them in his mouth. He loudly chewed them to troll the young master.\n\"So… What's your problem again?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo didn't wait for Ouyang Feng to respond. As he didn't know how to fly, he descended and landed on top of his store building. Instead of sinking through the roof tiles upon landing, the tiles shone and created a thin layer of barrier, protecting the tiles from Leo's weight and momentum.\nAfter the rough landing, Leo picked three more pills to eat. He looked away from Ouyang Feng and gazed at the crowd from the south.\n\"What about you? What did you say again? I remember that there was a Genshin Impact fan among the crowd. Where is the Fatui?\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nWu Buyi burst into laughter while Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, and others were speechless. They had never seen Leo in action before, and they were curious how he turned 20 nascent soul cultivators into ash without touching them.\n\"Yeah, he's an immortal, alright,\" Hua Jiashan nodded.\nHan Hao was curious, \"Have you seen an immortal before, sect master?\"\n\"Just a glimpse, but I can't say how strong an immortal truly is.\"\n\"I see.\"\nWu Buyi patted Han Hao's shoulder and pointed at Leo, \"Look no further, friend. Witness the greatness of my business partner! BEHOLD… THE DAO OF FLORIDA!\"\n\"… You don't even know what Florida means,\" Han Hao facepalmed and shook his head.\nMeanwhile, Hua Jiashan pondered, trying to figure out the true meaning of \"Florida\".\n'What is Florida? Is it a unique plant, place, name, or a mystic art that I don't know about?'",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 59 – Florida Man Complains as Thieves Refuse to Attack Him\nBo Cai was a burly middle-aged cultivator. He had a messy beard and unkempt brown short hair. His strength stagnated at the nascent soul stage for decades, and he was worried about his future potential.\nLike the others, he was attracted to the tribulation clouds. At first, he thought that a powerful expert attempted to break through. However, when he arrived, he overheard a conversation.\nHe heard someone speaking about pill tribulation.\n'If I remember correctly, a geezer said this was a pill tribulation. Someone made an immortal pill. I don't know what it's for, but I need those. Any free pill is necessary for my advancement!'\nAlthough Bo Cai wished to steal Leo's pills, he was afraid of his strength. He believed that Leo was a soul-formation cultivator, and he should be injured.\nHowever, Leo's performance didn't indicate that he was injured. He seemed too healthy for someone who had transcended purple heaven tribulation. He had doubts.\n.\nBo Cai was not the only one with the same thought. Ouyang Feng also wondered if Leo was really injured. The young master patted his robes and asked an old man behind him for advice.\n\"Senior Cheng, do you think that man is injured?\"\nCheng Yuanzhi had a trimmed full beard, short hair, and brown skin. He was a soul formation cultivator, and he was an elder of the Death Sword Sect. Ouyang Feng was also his disciple.\nAs a soul formation cultivator, he could see through other cultivators' hidden dao avatars. However, he couldn't see through Leo's Dao. Confused, Cheng Yuanzhi narrated his thoughts out loud.\n\"I can't see through his strength. Rather, I can't figure out what he is. He doesn't have a dao avatar, but his aura is definitely a soul formation cultivator.\"\n\"Are you sure? He seems strong,\" Ouyang Feng doubted Leo was really a soul formation cultivator.\n\"His foundation must be very weak. He doesn't have a dao avatar. I think he's just pretending to be strong and healthy.\"\n\"Should we continue besieging him? He will eat all the pills at this rate.\"\n\"Please be patient, young master. Let the other guys jump that man first. We'll claim the spoils of the victor. I think the Fatui Cult won't leave him alone.\"\n\"… If you say so.\"\nOuyang Feng took a deep breath and crossed his hands behind his back. He glared at Leo, waiting for his opportunity.\n.\nMeanwhile, the people from the South all wore black robes. They also wore cone-shaped clothes as headwear. Fortunately, none of them had white clothes or Leo would have branded them as racists.\nThey came in a group of 20. Fifteen of them were at the nascent soul stage. Four were soul formation, and one was a soul transformation cultivator. However, after witnessing the death of the first group, they didn't dare to make a move.\nEverybody glanced at their squad leader, who was the soul transformation cultivator.\n\"Senior Situ. What do you think?\"\nTheir leader was a part of the Situ Clan, Situ Luan. However, he was also an elder of the Fatui Cult. Like the other elders from the clan, he came here to steal the pills and capture Leo. Similar to Cheng Yuanzhi, the Situ Elder observed Leo, but he couldn't find his dao avatar.\nStill, as someone who had gone through purple heaven tribulation, he believed that Leo wasn't so simple. He raised his hand, warning his men not to move recklessly.\n\"That man is not a simple alchemist. I'm afraid he might be a soul transformation cultivator or a quasi-immortal. I don't think it's possible to kill him.\"\n\"Why? Isn't he injured or in bad shape after the tribulation? Those were purple lightning bolts.\"\n\"Then, let me ask you this,\" Situ Luan snorted. \"If someone went through a heavenly tribulation and looked fine, which was stronger, Heavenly Tribulation Lightning Bolts or that person?\"\nThe Fatui Cult's members stopped talking. They groaned and glared at Leo.\n\"Should we abort the mission?\"\nSitu Luan looked around. He saw a dozen soul formation cultivators and a couple soul transformation cultivators hiding in the crowd. He sneered, \"No. We'll poke that alchemist from a distance and bait the others to take action. After they kill each other, we'll kill the guy with the pills.\"\nThe cultists nodded. They pulled out talismans, which Situ Luan had supplied them. They threw the talismans into the air, and they moved by themselves, forming a wall array.\n100 talisman papers emitted metal essence, and it gathered Qi from the surroundings. An energy ball was formed.\nSitu Luan's underlings laughed, \"I doubt he can survive the killing array! This formation can replicate heavenly tribulation lightning, and we can control it!\"\n\"That's right. We can create a lightning bolt stronger than purple heavenly tribulation! Even if he can survive the ordeal, he won't survive this!\"\nSitu Luan frowned and shook his head. He was the creator of these talismans, so he knew their power well.\n'It won't be enough to kill him, but it should be able to force the others to move.'\nSitu Luan waved his hands and controlled the energy ball. Then, he pointed at Leo.\n\"Go!\"\n.\n.\nLeo blankly stared at the crowd, waiting for the next group of thieves to attack him. He had an eye on the Fatui Cult's people and Ouyang Feng's group as their voices were the loudest.\nHowever, after the death of the first group, nobody made a move. They looked at each other as if they were in a standoff.\nSeeing how the people hesitated to make a move, Leo kept eating the pills. While he was at it, he thought of a way to trigger or troll the spectators. He came up with an idea.\nLeo ignored the crowd and entered his store. He went to his bedroom and grabbed the box of elixir grain pills. Then, he carried it out and exited the store through the front door.\nStanding in front of the store, Leo ate the 20th immortal pill. There were 10 left, but Leo didn't care. He shouted.\n\"10 immortal pills left! If you don't do anything, I'll eat everything!\"I think you should take a look at\nThe crowd glared at Leo with bloodshot eyes, yet nobody made the first move. They waited for the others to act first.\nSeeing how cowardly they were, Leo snorted. He tossed three more pills into his mouth.\n\"…\"\nThe observers hesitated. They glanced at the Fatui cultists, who were preparing an attack.\nRUMBLE\nThe Killing Formation was ready. It formed a large purple energy ball.\n\"GO!\" Shouted Situ Luan.\nBANG\nThe energy ball transformed into a streak of light. It fell down and hit Leo and sent an electric current throughout his body.\nHowever, as Leo was holding immortal pills and grain pills, the lightning bolt's energy got through the items too.\nPOP\nPOP\nThe pills in the box and the remaining immortal pills turned into dust. Leo silently watched everything disintegrate with a blank look.\n\"…\"\nSitu Luan and the crowd were also surprised. They didn't expect the array to destroy the goodies. One of the groups clicked their tongues and shouted.\n\"Tsk. This is pointless. Let's leave.\"\n\"No point staying. Consider yourself lucky.\"\n\"Hmm! Be grateful that this father allows you to live another day.\"\nAs they turned around, the destroyed pills emitted rainbow aura energy and reacted to the lightning bolt. The talisman array of Situ Luan also resonated with the energy.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the?\"\nThe talismans broke the formation and flew toward the rainbow energy.\nLeo quietly stared at the torrent of wind, which slowly condensed into a mini black hole in front of him. He frowned and took several steps back.\nDING\nWhile Leo was wary of the distorted space in front of him, the shop domain system warned him.\n<Warning! A rift has occurred in your shop domain!>\n\"A rift?\"\nThe talismans got sucked into the warped space. They were pulled and lengthened before they sank into nothingness.\nRUMBLE\nThe suction force got stronger. It started pulling everything in the surroundings into the rift.\nLeo turned around and shut the store's front door. He then looked at the store's front windows, worrying that the windows might not last against the force.\nFortunately, the building emitted faint light, producing a thin barrier to resist the force. Every item inside was safe. The granary, warehouse, alchemy workshops, and farms were protected.\nRUMBLE\nThe rift expanded, and the vacuum force got more severe. Leo stomped his feet, planting them firmly on the ground. However, he still felt that he was slowly pulled toward the small black hole.\n'What the hell did that stupid lightning do?!'\nLeo was annoyed and frustrated. He activated the shop domain system and ordered it to harvest the lifespan of the assailants earlier.\nDING\n.\n.\nSitu Luan observed Leo from above. He sneered at him, who seemed flustered because of the lightning bolt earlier. Although they accidentally destroyed the immortal pills, their attack served their purposes.\n\"He's riling up. I think it affects him somehow,\" Situ Luan remarked.\nHis subordinates agreed, \"Yes, senior. No one can take that killing array and remain calm. Its destructive force is stronger than the purple lightning bolts!\"\n\"Indeed. It's unfortunate that we destroyed the pills, but we manage to filter out the crowd. The greedy guys are going to leave, and we can easily capture him.\"\nThe Fatui cultists smirked, waiting for Leo to succumb to the pain of purple lightning.\nDING\nSuddenly, a strange semitransparent screen appeared before them, showing their lifespan status.",

Similar to the others, they reached out to touch the screen, but their hands went through the system panel.\nCHING-CHING-CHING\nSuddenly, the lifespan rapidly decreased. From 999 years, Situ Luan's lifespan dropped to zero!\n\"Hah?! What the hell?!\"\nUnable to comprehend anything, Situ Luan turned his attention to Leo. However, it was too late for him and others to react as their bodies disintegrated into ash, flowing away by the wind. Their spatial rings, clothes, and belongings fell to the airship's deck.\nThe captain and the crew of the Fatui Cult's airship trembled in fear. As they didn't attack Leo, they go to keep their lives. Everybody rushed back to the cabin while the captain turned their ship around to flee from there.\nUnfortunately, something prevented them from leaving. The rift in front of Leo's store generated an intense gravity force, pulling the entire ship and the crewmates into the black hole.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nThe captain, the ship, and the crew lost control as they were a lot weaker than the other cultivators. They were the first who got sucked into the whirlpool of gravity rift. Their bodies were shattered and reduced into small particles before they vanished into the arm-sized hole. Even the large ship was compressed and disappeared.\n.\nLeo was the closest person to the rift. He broke a sweat as he didn't want to get sucked into the black hole. He cursed the Fatui people for making things complicated.\n\"Those idiots. Can't they just attack me and be done with it? Why do they have to create something this complicated!?\"\nLeo looked up and glanced at Bo Cai and Ouyang Feng. However, the crowd already turned around and tried to flee.\nSeeing how the crowd was leaving, Leo was frustrated. He activated the shop domain system, letting everybody in the area see their lifespan. Then, he shouted.\n\"IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO REDUCE YOUR LIFESPAN TO ZERO, GET DOWN HERE!\"\nThe voice was so loud that it caused a ripple in the air. Even though there was a black hole and a magnetic field in front of Leo, it failed to negate his sound.\nNascent soul and golden core cultivators in the sky screamed as their eardrums shattered. They lost their body balance and fell to the ground one after another, except for the lucky ones that came with a flying boat.\nOuyang Feng and some of the clansmen fell to the floor, and their ears bled as well. Ouyang Feng groaned and begged his master.\n\"Master, help me! We need to get out of here!\"\n\"…\"\nCheng Yuanzhi was unaffected by the voice. However, he was shaken by the presence of the system screen in front of him, showing his remaining lifespan.\n.\nName: Cheng Yuanzhi\nAge: 332\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,033 Years, 5 Months, 7 Days, 9 Hours, and 12 Minutes.\n.\nCheng Yuanzhi hesitated if he should flee with Ouyang Feng or submit to this person. He was afraid that Leo would kill him as how he slaughtered the Fatui cultists.\nRUMBLE\nAlthough Cheng Yuanzhi wanted to submit, he had no time to react. The rift's suction force intensified, and their flying ship could no longer resist gravity. It was slowly pulled toward the store.\nNo longer hesitating, Cheng Yuanzhi grabbed Ouyang Feng and leaped toward the sky, flying north and fleeing the scene. As for the people of the Ouyang Clan, Cheng Yuanzhi abandoned them. They were pulled into the rift one after another.\n.\nBo Cai was not as fortunate. His eardrums were shattered, and he fell directly to the rooftop of the alchemist workshop number two, where Leo had used to grow weird mushrooms. As the rooftop was in a triangle shape, he rolled and fell to the ground in front of the workshop.\nWhile crawling and trying to get back on his feet, something tiny slipped out of the building and entered his nostril. He sneezed, but the thing already entered his respiratory system.\nBo Cai was an experienced cultivator. He could sense small cells inside him. When the mysterious mushroom spore entered him, he circulated his Qi to drive it out.\nSoon, a strand of Bo Cai's Qi touched the mushroom spore. It wrapped around it like a rope, and the string floated up, carrying it from the lung to the throat.\nWIGGLE\nHowever, the spore instantly consumed the Qi string and grew larger. It rapidly grew and blockaded the respiratory system!\nBo Cai gasped for air as he suddenly couldn't breathe. He smacked his chest and grabbed his neck, circulating more Qi to destroy the blockade.\nUnfortunately, this action was the same as feeding the fire with oil. The Qi strings ended up becoming food for the spore, and the forbidden mushroom started to grow from inside him. It rapidly ate Bo Cai's Qi and cells from the inside and emitted odorless and transparent gas, which soon reached his brain.\nThe mountain bandit's body uncontrollably shook for a minute before he stopped moving. After the severe seizure, Bo Cai hadn't died yet. Instead, he fell unconscious. Moreover, he had a strange dream.\nIn the dream, Bo Cai found himself laying on the field of an abandoned town, and he was strangely hungry. There was nothing there but decayed wood and metals.\nPLOP\nSuddenly, Bo Cai saw something fall from the sky. They looked like pigs, and they smelled like the most delicious grilled boars that he once tasted. Driven by instinct, Bo Cai tried to stand up, but his ruptured eardrums ruined his body balance, and he fell to the ground.\nBo Cai groaned and crawled toward the fallen pig. He salivated, hoping to get a piece of that meat. He soon reached the twitching body of a massive pig with a humanoid body.\nAs Bo Cai wasn't aware that he was in a dream, he failed to think with logic. He opened his mouth and bit the pigman.\nCHOMP\n\"AAAAAHHHH!!\"\nBo Cai heard the weird voice of the pig. It sounded strangely like a human. However, the meat in his mouth was delicious and juicy. Unable to control his hunger, Bo Cai aimed for the sweetest part of the pig – the neck.I think you should take a look at\nCHOMP!\nCHOMP!\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo's instinct forced him to turn around. He had a bad feeling about the back of his store as he saw several people from the south falling on top of the workshop buildings.\n'Not again. I'm gonna need a fence or something to block those rude idiots from infiltrating my store's workshops. They might steal my precious items in the warehouse and the buildings. Oh, speaking of which, I forgot about the mushroom. It has been a long time. They should have grown by now.'\n.\n[Sweet Dream Mushroom Seed]\nThis is a seed of the notorious mushroom that once terrorized the Jianghu 500 years ago. It can be grown in any place with thick Qi, and it's resilient to temperature changes. However, it is not advised to domesticate it unless your mental strength is the same as Buddha's. Can be used as a catalyst for every element.\n.\nLeo thought of the Sweet Dream Mushroom, which he had left in the second alchemy workshop. He wondered if they had grown nicely as he could use them as universal catalysts for every pill and item. He also wondered if he could get some lifespan from the mushroom.\nAs Leo was the type who could easily be distracted, he turned around and kicked the ground. Instantly, he broke away from gravity and arrived in front of workshop number two. He gazed at the door and found that it was still locked.\nSeeing the locked door, Leo was relieved. He reached the lock pad and was about to unlock it.\n\"GET OFF ME!\"\n\"MONSTER!\"\nThe voice came from the right side of Leo. He looked at the source of the voice. Then, he found an interesting scene.\nThere was a mushroom zombie, grabbing and trying to eat a helpless cultivator. The latter summoned his dao avatar and swung his sword at it, but the zombie's skin was too hard for the sword to cut through. It soon caught and pinned down the cultivator. Then, it bit the poor guy's neck.\nThe nascent soul cultivator used everything to resist. But a few seconds later, he stopped moving. Then, the zombie continued eating the corpse.\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nLeo thought that a cultivation world was weird enough, but he didn't expect to see a cordyceps zombie in real life. He was amused, so he continued observing it for a while.\nRUMBLE\nUnfortunately, Leo ran out of time. The rift got larger, and it became two meters wide. The iron pine trees and the soil got pulled into it, leaving only the system buildings, the farms, and the structure's foundations intact.\nGROWL!\nThe zombie also floated because of gravity. The corpse and the zombie got sucked into the rift along with the other weak nascent soul cultivators. A hundred people disappeared into the distorted black hole at once.\nRUMBLE\nAfter a hundred cultivators entered the rift, the gravity force subsided. The rift shrank and vanished like smoke.\n\"…\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Leo pursed his lips. He was relieved that the black hole disappeared. He checked the front of the store to see the damage.\nThe front yard area ended up becoming a large crater. The farmlands were semi-devastated as the area around the farm turned into moats, leaving only two pillars of farm plots. The granary near the farm was the same as the rift stole a lot of soil and dirt around it.\nFallen iron pine trees and strange blue trees were also plenty. A dozen fell into the moats and got stuck there. Tree leaves were scattered everywhere and dirtied the windows and the tiles on the roofs.\nLeo checked the store's windows and found that it was still in good shape. He widely grinned and patted it, satisfied with its durability.\nAfter the crisis subsided, Leo turned his attention to the visitors. He wondered how many were left after the chaos. He looked up and scanned the sky.\n\"…\"\nThey were gone.\nNo one was there anymore.\n\"DAMMIT!\"\nLeo regretted that he only managed to get only 40ish people's worth of lifespan. He lamented the loss of the other 160 cultivators.\n\"I should have challenged or annoyed them more! I could have done something cliché like… if you can make me flinch in three hits, I'll give you a pill or something. I would have conned them to attack me and I would have gotten their lifespan that way! Dammit! I'm so stupid!\"\nHe slapped his forehead several times as his heart couldn't take it. He felt like he had wasted over 100,000 years of lifespan for nothing.\nWhile Leo had a mental breakdown, a massive flying sword slowly approached the area. It descended and hovered over the farmland. Then, the people on the swords got down.\nThey were Wu Buyi, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Hua Jiashan, and a dozen elders who used to visit the store.\nLeo sensed the newcomers. He changed his expression and smiled at them, \"Welcome, dear customers. Are you here to rob me, or are you here to purchase my goodies. But sincerely, please hit me with your best shot, and I'll give you the painless death.\"\nWu Buyi, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman sweated profusely. They waved their hands and reminded Leo that they were his customers, not enemies.\n\"It's us, Daoist Florida Man! We're your friends!\" Han Hao panicked.\nWu Buyi prostrated to the ground, \"Lord Immortal, please don't joke around. We're here to buy your items!\"\nHan Meng also kowtowed, \"Daoist Florida Man! We're not your enemies. Please come back to your senses!\"\nTiger Swordsman gulped and politely saluted, \"Sir, we are from the Life Sword Sect. We're not your foes.\"\nSeeing how the top elders reacted to Leo, the other minor elders also knelt and cupped their fists, begging for forgiveness.\n\"Senior, sir. We've come in peace.\"\nMeanwhile, Hua Jiashan bitterly smiled and shook his head. He sighed and cupped his fist. Then, he lowered his head to give face to Leo.\n\"My name is Hua Jiashan. I'm the sect master of the Life Sword Sect. Thank you for taking care of my disciples and these idiots. We're forever grateful to you, so I've come here to pay respect and gratitude myself.\"\n\"Oh,\" Leo finally recognized their faces. He was slightly disappointed. \"It's you, people. I thought I hit the jackpot. Anyway, welcome! Well, please excuse the mess here. Let's talk inside the building. I'll serve you tea.\"\nEverybody's faces were as pale as a sheet. Judging from Leo's tone, they figured that the guy really mistook them as enemies, and he almost killed them. Still, they accepted Leo's invitation and entered his store.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 61 – Billionaire Florida Man Reveals Business Secret: \"Free Child Labor is a Must-Have!\"\nThe guests entered the store and admired the expanded space. As usual, they exclaimed in astonishment. Only Hua Jiashan remained expressionless.\nLeo was generous this time. He brought out Rejuvenate Tea and gave one bottle to each guest, treating it as if they were modern beer. Then, he brought the sacred wood blocks from the warehouse and put them in the store, using them as temporary chairs.\n\"Please take a seat. Oh, the drink is on the house.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and others gazed at the blocks of sacred wood with wry smiles. They had the urge to slap Leo's face for using these precious materials as chairs. Still, they were afraid of his strength, so they kept their mouth shut, swallowing their heart pain.\n'Isn't this sacred wood?'\n'Are we sitting on these?'\n'For real?! He's using sacred wood as chairs?!'\n'People are killing each other to get a piece of sacred wood, but he's treating it as… furniture?!'\nBecause of the emotional damage, their expressions were the same as Hide the Pain Harold. A few inwardly cried.\nLeo proceeded to serve them tea. Hua Jiashan silently accepted the rejuvenate tea while Wu Buyi and Han Hao cheerfully received them. Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and the other elders, however, were surprised to receive such an expansive gift.\nWu Buyi and Han Hao chugged down the content in unison. They instantly emptied the bottle and burped out loud.\n\"WOO! That hits the spot! Can I have a second?\" Wu Buyi giggled.\n\"Don't be rude. He's already generous enough to share this top beverage. Oh, by the way, sir. I see that you have so much rejuvenate tea. Could I buy some from you?\"\nLeo paused for a moment. He thought about scamming them to gain their lifespan, but he had a change of heart. After all, he only needed 10 minutes to make a liter of drink, and the ingredients came from his backyard.\n\"A million spirit stones per bottle,\" Leo casually named the price.\n\"Sweet!\" Han Hao burst into laughter. \"I need six more, please. I'll pay upfront.\"\nLeo flinched for a moment as he remembered that he didn't know how to use spatial rings. He deeply sighed and pulled out the ring that Wu Buyi once gave him. He wore black rubber gloves and passed his ring to Han Hao.\n\"Store it here.\"\n\"Yes, senior!\" Han Hao took the spatial ring and transferred his spirit stones from his ring to another. While he was at it, he snooped Leo's ring with his Qi sense, wondering what he had been collecting. Then, Han Hao was surprised.\nThere was a billion spirit stones in there!\nHan Hao gulped. His hands trembled as he had never seen such wealth before. Even though he was a millionaire, his wealth couldn't be compared to Leo's.\nMeanwhile, Leo was clueless about how much he possessed. He thought that the ring had enough space to magically store more spirit stones. As more spirit stones came his way, Leo believed that it should be the right time to start mass-producing Soul Stones.\nCurious, Leo asked the guests if they had heard about Essence Stones or Soul Stones before. He picked one of the essence stones in a box on a shelf. Then, he showed it to everybody while they were still enjoying the drinks.\n\"I'm thinking about introducing new merchandise. What do you think?\"\nLooking at the black stone in Leo's hand, the elders looked perplexed as they had never seen anything like it before. However, Hua Jiashan calmly identified it.\n\"Essence Stone? Isn't this a contraband item?\"\n\"Contraband item?\" Leo's heart sank. He didn't expect it to be an illegal item.\n\"Yes,\" Hua Jiashan explained, \"The emperor forbids every cultivator of the mainland to possess or use essence stones. He once claimed that it could potentially turn righteous cultivators into fiend cultivators because of their impurity.\"\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows as the item description from the alchemy workshop said otherwise.\n.\n[Essence Stone]\nCan be found underground in any mystic realm. Unlike spirit stones, it contains a great amount of Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Qi.\n[Traits]\nIncrease Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Element Essence by 10 years' worth of cultivation. (Consumption)\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stone]\n1,000 Essence Stones\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Catalyst\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Essence\n.\nAs Leo respected his loyal customers, he revealed what the system had told him.\n\"I think your emperor lied to you. One essence stone contains 10 years' worth of cultivation. It also has all five element essence in it.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe elders were flabbergasted while Hua Jiashan revealed a bitter smile. The latter confessed, \"Yes, I'm aware. The emperor made that law so that the court could monopolize the essence stones.\n\"WHAT?!\" Han Hao, Wu Buyi, and others had never heard of this. They were stunned, \"So, the essence stones are safe?\"\n\"Of course, it's safe. It's a precious cultivation resource. Fellow Daoist Florida Man is right. It contains every type of element essence in there, and every stone can bless you with 10 years' worth of cultivation. Think about it. One spirit stone has nothing but neutral Qi, and we can only get one year's worth of Qi per piece. But essence stones have a fixed standard since every stone is naturally formed and refined by nature. You can only mine it from a divine mystic realm!\"\n\"…Wow.\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows as he found this world's standard weird. Since these people had millions of spirit stones, he wondered why they didn't bother using them to cultivate.\n\"Is it better to use a million spirit stones or a few essence stones to cultivate?\"\nHua Jiashan bitterly smiled as he thought that Leo tested him. He pointed out the flaws of spirit stones.\n\"Spirit stones are merely pebbles that got contaminated with natural Qi from a mystic realm. You can find them anywhere there. Although it's useful for beginners, it barely offers element Qi for cultivators. If we overly rely on spirit stones to grow or refine our dantians and bodies, our foundations will be very weak. It's better to cultivate element Qi or essence from pills, nature… or from essence stones. Obviously, essence stones are crucial for every cultivator above the golden core stage.\"\nLeo nodded as he appreciated the info. As he planned to attract more customers and seduce greedy cultivators to attack him, he decided to provoke this so-called emperor and the court.\nWhile looking at the crowd, Leo offered them a huge bargain.I think you should take a look at\n\"What if I say I have a million of these? I can sell them to you for cheap. Of course, I'll only take lifespan as a currency.\"\nThis time, Hua Jiashan widened his eyes in astonishment. He stood up, \"Are you crazy, Daoist Florida Man!? You will ire the imperial court! They will send quasi-immortals and 10,000 soldiers to hunt you down if they find out!\"\nHearing Hua Jiashan, Wu Buyi and Leo widely grinned. They snickered in unison.\n\"Let them come!\" Leo calmly stroked his beard.\n\"A new era is upon us, sect master. Let them witness the new dawn of our golden era!\" Wu Buyi mimicked Leo's motion and stroked his goatee beard.\n\"…\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and Hua Jiashan gave Wu Buyi a weird look. They wondered why this alchemist supported Leo so much.\nWhile Wu Buyi sidetracked everybody, one of the elders asked for the price of the stones.\n\"Senior, how much for an essence stone? I would like to buy some.\"\n\"Oh, right. The price.\"\nLeo recalled that he once sold essence stones to Zhong and the ship crew of Ouyang Long. Thinking about them, he wondered if they were fine since they had the contraband items with them.\nAs Leo had sold these stones for 50 years of lifespan each, he decided to maintain the standard.\n\"Normally, I sold these for 100 years of lifespan. But since you have been visiting me often, I'll only sell it at the cost price, which is… one year per piece!\"\nLeo no longer cared about maximizing profits by selling them at a reasonable price. After all, he could always convert spirit stones into essence stones by touching them. He still had millions of spirit stones and essence stones in the warehouse, and he could easily get more by selling tea.\nIn addition, pricing them cheaply could awaken a human's greed. Even though they might not need them, they would be tempted to hoard as many essence stones as possible, wasting their lifespan resource in the process.\n\"BUY!!\"\nAs Leo had envisioned, Han Meng, Han Hao, Wu Buyi, and Tiger Swordsman stood up and shouted in unison. They didn't care if their lifespan would be depleted tomorrow as the item was too cheap!\nLeo laughed and quickly operated his shop domain, extracting their lifespan. He also ran back to the warehouse and fetched them a large sack of essence stones.\nThe transaction was quick. Everybody got several hundred stones in their arms as these elders quickly spent almost everything, leaving them with 100 years to live and cultivate. However, their expressions were full of joy.\nWu Buyi tested the stone in front of everybody. He inserted his Qi into one of the essence stones and absorbed the essence that leaked out. Wu Buyi then manipulated his Qi to coil around the invisible essence droplets in the air and inhaled them.\n\"!!!\"\nAs soon as Wu Buyi absorbed the wisp of essence that attached to his Qi, he gasped for air in shock. The thick essence was legit, and he could feel the other element essence that he didn't have.\n\"My word… With only one of these, I might even refine my dantian and be able to cultivate all five elements! No wonder the emperor makes it illegal!\" Wu Buyi exclaimed.\nHearing Wu Buyi's remark, the elders were confident. They stored the essence stones in their spatial rings, keeping them a secret.\nMeanwhile, Hua Jiashan hadn't moved. He observed how Leo and his subordinates interact. Upon seeing that Leo sincerely helped the sect, Hua Jiashan let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"I'm overthinking, I see.\"\nHua Jiashan thought that Leo had an ulterior motive. But since Leo sold the precious cultivation resource so cheaply, he no longer suspected him.\nHowever, Hua Jiashan wasn't interested in the essence stones. He had his eyes on something else. He gazed at the showcase refrigerators, which still kept immortal grass, golden sand bananas, cabbages of extreme yin, and weird vegetables in there.\nThe sect master rubbed his long droopy eyebrows as he suddenly had an idea. He offered him a deal.\n\"Since you have been helping us a lot, how about we give you a hand. I have an idea.\"\n\"Yes?\" Leo stopped counting the essence stones in the sack and looked at Hua Jiashan.\n\"I see that you're running the store by yourself. How about we send a few young disciples here to help you take care of your store and clean up the mess? Of course, we will be paying them, so you don't have to worry about their wages.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo found the offer interesting. As his store continued to expand, he started to get mentally exhausted whenever he juggled between the workshop and the store.\nHe needed someone to help him tidy the store while he was busy in alchemy and the farms. He also needed a nanny or a caretaker to keep Cat out of the granary. Although Leo had the warehouse automaton to help him, it was not enough. Also, this didn't include the night security issue as people could simply sneak into the shop domain premise when Leo was asleep.\nAs Leo couldn't find any demerit from the offer, he leaned toward accepting the deal. However, his habit died hard. He asked to make sure.\n\"Indeed, free child labor is a must-have for every business, but what's the catch?\"\nHua Jiashan giggled. He nodded in approval that Leo instantly recognized his hidden agenda.\n\"If possible, I hope that you can teach our disciples a thing or two. Those children are too sheltered, and they need to experience the world more. I hope that you could provide them a place to learn about the outside world. Of course, we will keep switching disciples since they might end up purchasing your items and need some time to cultivate.\"\n\"…\"\nIn short, Hua Jiashan indirectly asked Leo to be his sect's guest elder or a coach for the interns.\nLeo shrugged as he didn't hate the idea. After all, those free workers would eventually spend their lifespan purchasing something from him.\nUnfortunately, Hua Jiashan didn't live 500 years for nothing. He added another suggestion.\n\"Also, I see that you have plenty of alchemy resources. How about I send people from the alchemy department to help you concoct pills? Of course, we'll foot the workers' wages.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi coughed several times as he was in charge of the department. He smacked his chest, \"Lord Florida Man. You can always count on me. I have almost a hundred years of experience, and my pill-making success rate is over 70%! I can assure you that I can make at least 20 high-grade pills per batch… if you give me enough time.\"\n\"…\"\nLooking at Wu Buyi, Leo pursed his lips. He pointed at the Yang Flame Pills on the shelves.\n\"Do you know those pills?\"\nWu Buyi laughed for a moment before his smiling face was frozen. Then, it was distorted in shock and disbelief.\n\"Y-Yang Flame Pills?! T-These are medium-grade and high-grade Yang Flame Pills!\"\n\"You're quite slow, aren't you?\" Leo sighed as Wu Buyi was quite dumb sometimes. He wondered how the alchemist failed to notice the fire pills.\nLeo tested Wu Buyi, \"How long do you need to make these if I give you the recipe?\"",

He hated to reveal his capabilities, but he had no choice since Leo asked him. He confessed.\n\"About one month per batch. I will also need assistants to maintain the fire and essence during the concoction. That doesn't include the time I need to invest to prepare my condition since I will have to sit in front of the cauldron for three months straight.\"\nHua Jiashan and others nodded in approval as the time Wu Buyi needed was much less than average alchemists. From their standard, it usually took two to three months for an alchemist to concoct a batch of cultivation pills. After all, making pills was not an easy task, and it was time-consuming. Alchemists were respected as specialists because of this reason.\nUnfortunately, Leo's standard was different.\n\"Too slow.\"\n\"Eh?!\" The elders were stunned.\nWu Buyi was offended, and his face twitched. He believed that he was one of the fastest pill-makers on the continent. Thus, he asked Leo how long it took to make them.\n\"T-Then, how long did you take to make those…MEDIUM-GRADE pills?\"\nWu Buyi stressed the quality of the pills. He could make a batch of 15-20 high-grade pills 60-70% of the time, and he was confident in his abilities. He was sure that Leo's concoction method was inferior to his.\nLeo snorted and told them the truth, \"Three hours!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nWu Buyi dropped his jaw and the tea bottle. The glass container hit the floor, but it didn't shatter upon impact. Everybody except Hua Jiashan stood up in shock.\n\"ONLY THREE HOURS?! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!\"\nLeo widely grinned. He wondered if he should show them his trade secrets.\n'Should I, or should I not? This is kinda childish to flex, but I need to compare the standard of this world and the system's abilities. Well, since these guys will send free laborers to help me, they will eventually learn about the workshops anyway. Oh, wait. How about this? I don't have to tell them about the system or how the workshop works. I just magically make them…remotely! Yup! That will work.'\nAfter coming up with the idea, Leo coughed, \"How about I show you how it's done?\"\n\"YES, PLEASE!\" Wu Buyi repeatedly nodded. The others were also curious.\n\"Follow me.\"\nHua Jiashan finally smiled. He followed Leo through the back doors, and they arrived in the backyard. In front of them were two alchemy workshop buildings.\nFortunately, both cauldrons were idle as Leo had just collected everything. Although Leo could have used both of them at once, he didn't feel like it. He had a feeling that it might be overkill to demonstrate how he usually worked.\n\"Please wait here. I'll go get the ingredient from the granary.\"\n\"…\"\nNot wasting time, Leo asked the crowd to wait there. He went to fetch the ingredient from the granary.\nThe crowd was slightly confused. They noticed that Leo wore a clear gold ring, and he also carried a spatial ring of billion spirit stones in his pocket. They wondered why he didn't store the materials in his spatial ring.\nMeanwhile, Leo entered the granary and found Cat inside. She was still terrified of the heavenly tribulation, and she refused to come out.\nLeo cut a handful of virgin yang potatoes and left her alone. He also took a fiery tomato and a tiger-killing orange along as he needed both. He returned to the workshop.\nUpon returning to the workshop, Leo discovered that Wu Buyi had been rubbing and inspecting the cauldron in curiosity while the other elders silently gazed at the workshop buildings. On the other hand, Hua Jiashan frowned and glared at the second workshop.\nWhen Hua Jiashan noticed Leo's arrival, he immediately pointed at the second workshop.\n\"Fellow Daoist, what are you keeping in that building? I sense dreadful air from that place. It smells like…death.\"\n\"Oh? That?\" Leo ignored Wu Buyi and tossed three ingredients into the cauldron without even looking. He gargled and spat at the fireplace, and the cauldron lit up automatically.\nDING\nNobody could hear the system bell sound. The cauldron's lid was closed, and it started working.\n\"!!!\"\nWu Buyi jumped away from the cauldron in panic. He circulated his Qi in his eyes to inspect the flow of Qi in the pot. Then, he looked at Leo, who already walked toward the second workshop.\n\"Eh? What?\"\nWu Buyi couldn't understand how Leo did it. Normally during a concoction process, an alchemist always pressed their palms on their cauldron to inject their element essence and Qi into the pot, extracting the essence from the ingredients and mixing them together. Nobody could make pills without touching their burning cauldrons.\nYet, Leo nonchalantly ignited the cauldron and walked away.\nThe other elders were also flabbergasted and baffled. They had seen how Wu Buyi worked with his pills before, and they had never seen a crazy alchemist that worked on their pills remotely. Question marks floated on top of their heads as they looked back and forth between the cauldron and Leo.\nMeanwhile, Leo stood in front of the second workshop, and Hua Jiashan followed him. The latter began sweating as he recognized the aura. The sect master's voice was also cracked.\n\"Say, fellow Daoist. Please answer me honestly. Are you cultivating another contraband item?\"\n\"Why?\" Leo giggled, \"What if I do?\"\nLeo paused for a moment. He still remembered the mushroom seeds, and he forgot to water them for days. He wondered what could go wrong.\n\"T-This is not the time for a joke, Daoist Florida Man. I know this aura. Isn't this Sweet Dream Mushroom?! Do you realize what you're doing?\"\n\"Are they that bad? They're good catalysts for alchemy though. I'm also planning to eat some of them.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHua Jiashan choked and coughed. He smacked his chest twice as his heart skipped a beat.\nAfter almost having a heart attack, Hua Jiashan told Leo what he had experienced when he was young 500 years ago.I think you should take a look at\n\"Fellow Daoist Florida Man. This is different from essence stones. Sweet Dream Mushrooms are the deadliest hallucination mushroom that turns cultivators into monsters. They consume Qi to grow, and their spores can eat cultivators and their Qi from the inside. Five hundred years ago, five countries and 20 million people perished because of one Sweet Dream Mushroom from the Fungus Mystic Realm! One of the islands becomes a forbidden area because of these mushrooms! I saw how deadly these mushrooms were. Once you inhale or consume them, you will become a mindless monster that lives on by eating fellow cultivators! You must destroy these mushrooms right now!\"\nHua Jiashan's words entered Leo's left ear and exited his right ear. The Florida Man pulled open the door and witnessed the magnificent scene of a miniature fungi apocalypse world.\nCountless buds of orange mushrooms latched onto the ceiling, floor, and walls. Each came in various sizes. The biggest mushroom head was one foot in diameter, and they were average three feet tall. As for the smallest ones, they were finger-sized.\nLeo glanced at the door and peeled a patch of mushrooms. Then, he closed the door.\nHua Jiashan was already 100 meters in the sky as he kept his distance from the mushrooms. He screamed his lungs out.\n\"DAOIST FLORIDA MAN! BURN THOSE BLASPHEMOUS THINGS BEFORE YOU BECOME A MONSTER! NOW!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo pursed his lips as he believed that Hua Jiashan overreacted. He carried it to the second workshop's cauldron and tossed the patch in the pot. Then, he researched it.\nDING\nThe information was shown to Leo.\n.\n[Sweet Dream Mushroom]\nThis is one of the deadliest mushrooms that almost destroy the world 500 years ago. It originates from a fungi-infested mystic realm, and it grows by consuming every type of Qi and essence. As it is from a fungi species, it can rapidly grow and multiply. It only takes one day from one mushroom to terraform everything in a radius of one kilometer into a field of sweet dream mushrooms.\nHowever the hazardous it brings, it comes with great benefits. Immortals and cultivators with virgin yang can consume them to increase their vitality and lifespan. If refined, it can become a life-saving pill that immortals can kill for.\n[Pill Recipe – Hope and Dream Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yang Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n[Pill Recipe – Determination Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yin Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n[Traits]\nIncrease Lifespan by one year per gram (Consumption)\n.\nHow could he destroy these precious mushrooms when he could farm lifespan by eating them directly?\nLeo salivated. He rushed into the second workshop and closed the door behind him. After shutting the door, Leo cut the biggest mushroom and weighed it with his feeling.\nIt was light by his standard, but it was roughly 20 kilos. Leo immediately calculated in his mind.\n'One gram = one year? Then, 20 kilos would be 20,000 freaking years?! Oh, my Florida! I'm freaking rich!'\nWithout hesitation, Leo started nom-noming, ignoring the fact that many guests were waiting for him outside.\n.\n.\nOne hour later, Leo came out. His clothes got slightly stained because of the mushroom's spores and dust. However, he had never felt this energetic before. Leo believed that he could work all night that day.\nAfter coming out, Hua Jiashan slowly descended. But when he noticed that Leo's clothes were stained with orange dust, he backed away.\n\"D-Daoist Florida Man. Are you okay? Can you talk?\"\n\"Huh?\" Leo frowned, \"Of course, I can talk. What's the big deal?\"\nHua Jiashan let out a sigh of relief. From his experience, people who touched the mushrooms would be zombified in seconds. They also lost their abilities to talk or communicate when they were infected, yet Leo seemed fine as he responded to his questions.\n\"Are you feeling okay? Do the mushroom spore do something to you?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\nLeo shrugged, \"Aside from being delicious, I don't feel anything. I guess I'm immune to the poison.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan was still wary of the mushroom spore and poison. He kept his distance from Leo.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi was glued to the cauldron. He panted and stared at the cauldron in a daze while he commented.\n\"S-Such technique is unprecedented! Not only do the fire element and the mysterious yang Qi flow together in harmony, but there is no waste in the ingredients! Who could have thought that you can use yang Qi as a conductor while the fire element Qi acts as fuel instead of burning the ingredients. Wait…S-Splitting ingredients into 30 sets?! Daoist Florida Man aims to refine 30 pills at once, and he's not even touching the cauldron?! How does he do this remotely?!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo gave Wu Buyi a weird look. He left the nerd alone while he licked his fingers and cleaned the dust on his clothes with it. Also, as Hua Jiashan was worried about the fungi, Leo walked back to his bedroom and put on the hazmat suit. Then, he returned to the group.\nSeeing the clothes, Hua Jiashan was relieved. He avoided the second workshop and landed in front of the first workshop. He also urged Leo.\n\"Again, please destroy those mushrooms. They must not exist.\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 63 – Florida Man Builds Recycling Center to Remove Trash, Spreads Cordyceps Zombie Virus\nWhile everybody ignored Wu Buyi's nerdy remarks, Hua Jiashan attempted to convince Leo to give up cultivating the sweat dream mushrooms.\n\"Have you ever seen Jiangshi, Daoist Florida Man?\"\n\"Jiangshi?\" Leo was not familiar with the vocabulary.\n\"An undead. A dead human mutating into a monster with a human physique.\"\n\"Ah, a zombie. I know.\"\nLeo finally figured out the word. He thought of the zombies in Chinese movies. They dressed a dead person in ancient clothes and put a talisman on their forehead. Then, those corpses with talismans came back to life, and they jumped instead of walking like Western zombies. The images of Jiangshis were still funny to him\nHua Jiashan continued, \"The mushrooms can turn every cultivator nearby into Jiangshi-like monsters. They can also infect other cultivators by biting and spraying mushroom spores on their skin. Once infected with the mushroom spores, one can only kill himself to escape from the mushroom's poison since there is no cure. This is why you must burn everything before it's too late, Daoist Florida Man.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply sighed as he understood the danger. Cultivating the mushrooms was the same as producing T-Virus. Since it was too dangerous to be contained in a shabby wooden cabin and it might put his future employees' lives at risk, Leo decided to abort the mushroom project for the time being until he could get a better building or structure that could contain the hazardous plants or mushrooms.\n\"Alright. I'm gonna take care of those. Well, since I'm immune to the mushroom, I'll do it myself. As for you, make sure you cover your nose and mouth.\"\n\"Thank you very much for your understanding, Daoist Florida Man!\"\nHearing Leo's promise, Hua Jiashan was relieved. He cupped his fist and deeply bowed.\nWhile wearing the hazmat suit, Leo reentered the building. He gazed at the otherworldly orange mushrooms. Then, he noticed something strange.\nThe mushroom patches that Leo had peeled from the door earlier had already regrown! Moreover, the parts that Leo had eaten were regenerating!\n\"Uh-oh.\"\nLeo sensed a chill running down his spine. He racked his brain, thinking of what he should do. Then, he came up with an idea.\n\"System. Can you erase the mushrooms from the building?\"\nDING\n<Cleaning Feature requires Recycling Center Building.>\n\"…\"\nA new piece of information piqued Leo's interest. He rechecked his lifespan after the big harvest, wondering how much he got for the next shopping spree.\n<Current Lifespan: 91,131 Years, 4 Months, 16 Days, 8 Hours, 36 Minutes.>\nLeo gulped. He remembered that he had terminated about 40ish cultivators, and he ate a few kilograms of mushrooms. However, his lifespan jumped from 25,000ish to over 90,000!\nStealing people's lifespans was super effective. Leo wished that more people could come here to attack him again.\nAs Leo had plenty of lifespans, he quickly purchased the auto-speech translation ability, costing him 20,000 years of lifespan. Then, he opened the door and rushed to the main store building.\nHua Jiashan and the elders were surprised that Leo came out so quickly. The former asked Leo, \"What's wrong?\"\n\"Ah, there are some issues. Those mushrooms have already regenerated, and I need to use some… special magic to remove the pest.\"\n\"Special Magic?\" Han Hao, Han Meng, and everybody were interested, \"What magic?\"\n\"You'll find out soon.\"\nLeo didn't bother explaining. He touched the wall of the store building and ordered the system to upgrade it. Although it cost a whopping 5,000 years of lifespan, Leo didn't flinch since he was rich.\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 6.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nLeo checked the list of the new buildings. However, the recycling center wasn't among them. He pushed on and upgraded the main building again. This time, the system asked for 6,000 years.\nDING\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 7.>\n<New Construction Options!>\n.\nSmall House\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nSmall House (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 6\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nSmall House (3)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nClothing Store\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 6\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nFarm Plot (3)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 6\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nAlchemy Workshop (3)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 6\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nLivestock Shed\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nRecycling Center\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 500 Years of LifespanI think you should take a look at\nSpace – 20 x 20\n.\nMystic Realm Portal\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 20\n.\nLooking at the long list, Leo believed that he might run out of space to build soon. He might have to rearrange the buildings or organize them to save space in the domain. After all, the grids were limited.\nMoreover, there was an extra building that Leo never expected to see.\n'What the hell? Mystic Realm Portal? But why?'\nLeo didn't understand what the system wanted sometimes. Although he wanted to build the portal, he decided not to as there were too many eyes around him. Leo saved his lifespan and built only the recycling center, placing it adjacent to the warehouse behind the first alchemy workshop.\nRUMBLE\nThe upgrade began. The moats and the ground behind the alchemy workshop were equally elevated, and a new structure grew from the ground. However, nobody noticed it except Leo.\nThe general store building transformed as the walls were repainted. It became a two-story building, but the ground floor's walls were made from bricks instead of wood. As for the second floor, it retained the cabin-like architecture.\nThe backdoors were also changed. Instead of being doors, it became a wide shutter door. However, because of its large frame, it looked too big for a 10 meters wide building when Leo and others looked at it from the outside.\nThe crowd's mouths were agape as they stared at the transforming building. They looked up and ignored the shutter door as it became insignificant to their eyes. Even Hua Jiashan blankly stared at the general store in awe. As for Wu Buyi, he already forgot about the cauldron.\nSeizing the opportunity when the visitors were distracted, Leo kicked the ground and vanished. He reappeared behind the alchemy workshop, which was close to the newest building.\nThe recycling center building was behind the workshop. As it occupied 20x20 grids, it took up a lot of space. Half of the land appeared as a junkyard while the other half was a rusty-like shed. However, something in the shed emitted blue light, which was similar to the light of spirit stones.\nLeo bypassed the empty junkyard and entered the rusty shed. He touched the wall, hoping to see the information of this building.\nDING\n.\nRecycling Center Level 1\nAvailable Production - None\nAssigned Material: None\nAutomaton Worker – (1/10)\nWorker Speed – (0/10)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nIt showed no other detail except the simple menu. Leo scratched his head as he couldn't figure out how it would help him.\n'Oh, well. When all hope is lost, I'll just upgrade this to the max.'\nFortunately, the upgrade cost of this building was the same as the others. Leo immediately spent 6,000 years of lifespan, upgrading it to the highest possible level at this stage. He also allocated all points to the worker slot.\nDING\n.\nRecycling Center Level 7\nAvailable Production - None\nAssigned Material: None\nAutomaton Worker – (7/10)\nWorker Speed – (0/10)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nSeven wooden mannequins rose up from the ground and stood idly in front of Leo. They had the same appearance as the warehouse worker, but they all wore yellow plastic helmets and yellow jackets.\n\"I guess you are following the OSHA handbooks by the book, eh?\"\nLeo laughed at them. The mannequins flailed their arms in response to Leo's stereotypical joke in protest.\nSince they had no work, Leo fiddled with the menu, exploring how it worked. He touched the [Assigned Material] in hoping to see some hints or descriptions.\nDING\n<You may choose any material you wish to discard or destroy. Once assigned, the workers will automatically collect the assigned material at the recycling center and attempt to create a new product from the discarded materials. The level of the recycling center determines the quality of the new items.>\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"…Okay. That's normal, I guess.\"\nThe mannequins worked similarly to the warehouse's worker as they automatically collected items to their perspective building. However, only the recycling center could produce something out of the junk.\nBut the information didn't tell Leo one thing.\n\"And how do I assign those mushrooms to this place? But if these mannequins touch the mushrooms, will they be alright? Can the mushrooms infect wood golems?\"\nWHIRRRR\nAs if the mannequins understood Leo's words, they turned around and walked in unison. They marched toward the second alchemy workshop.\nLeo was surprised. He followed after them to see how they worked. As Leo walked along with the mannequin automatons, they arrived at the second workshop at the same time.\nWhen Leo and the automatons came out of the alley and gathered in front of the second workshop, the elders noticed their presence. They watched them from afar, wondering what Leo was doing.\nTiger Swordsman narrowed his eyes. As he played with similar golems during his training, he recognized them.\n\"Ah, golems. So, Daoist Florida Man must be capable of using Spirit Summon Dao. It's rare to see spirit summoners these days.\"\nHan Meng added, \"Yeah. Aside from you, nobody in our sect uses Spirit Summon Dao. Your contracted spirit is a tiger, right?\"\nHan Meng and Tiger Swordsman were close friends. They used to be rivals when they were young, and they grew up together in the same sect. While Han Meng was an expert in flying swords, Tiger Swordsman was a hybrid between a swordsman, a shaman, and a physical cultivator. He came up with the combination of Daos to reinforce his physique, making him stronger than every nascent soul elders in the sect in terms of physical strength and endurance. Moreover, he had a shaman ability, which allowed him to summon spirits to pilot his manmade golems.\n\"Haha, not exactly. My golems are humanoid tigers, and they use big swords like me. They look completely different from Daoist Florida Man's golems.\"\nWhile Han Meng and Tiger Swordsman chatted, Leo fiddled with his online shopping system and purchased large Tupperware boxes to store the mushrooms. He then opened the door and let them go inside.\nHua Jiashan had been on standby. He waved his hand and created a round barrier array with his Qi, blocking the air from the workshop from reaching them.\nPIKI\nPIKI\nIt was a good decision. A few seconds later, the leaked spores of the mushrooms latched on the array barrier and stained the semi-transparent energy dome. It gradually expanded as it ate Hua Jiashan's Qi.\nHua Jiashan's face was ashen. He drew a word in the air, creating the Chinese word \"Fire\".\nBOOM\nAs soon as the word was completed, it lit up in red, and the barrier dome was ignited on fire, burning the mushroom spores on it. A few seconds later, Hua Jiashan's barrier reverted back to the light blue dome.\n\"Be careful. Don't go out until Daoist Florida Man finishes removing the mushrooms. If you accidentally inhale one of the spores, you're dead.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and the elders gulped. They gazed at Leo in wary, hoping that he could get rid of the dangerous items soon.\nMeanwhile, Leo and the mannequins struggled inside the workshop. The mushrooms seemed to possess a will or become sentient. As soon as Leo and the mannequins plucked or peeled the mushrooms, they rapidly regrew and attempted to spread the mushrooms on their skin.\n\"Oh, boy. Do I really need to summon Hans?\" Leo grumbled. He shoved a piece in his mouth and chewed it raw. As for the mannequins, they calmly removed the big heads and stored them in the Tupperware boxes outside the building.\nThe situation turned into a tug-of-war. The mushrooms absorbed Leo's radiation to grow while Leo and the mannequins cut them and prevented their growth. The stalemate continued for 30 minutes.\nThen, someone broke the stalemate. A certain plant stopped hiding in the granary and came out. Even though she had eaten plenty of potatoes, she was still hungry for more.\nCat crawled on the newly upgraded general store building and crept toward the backyard. She then saw Leo and the new mannequins. However, her food radar picked up the presence of the mushrooms in the Tupperware boxes.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 64 – Florida Man Jumps into Nuclear Reactor Pool While Filming New Jackass Knockoff Movie\nIn the workshop, Leo was frustrated. Because of his radiation, the mushroom grew faster than usual, and they started creeping to his legs, trying to devour him whole.\n\"Damn mushrooms. You dare to eat your creator? You're just livestock!\"\nLeo had enough. He stopped playing around and exerted 10% of his strength by gripping the biggest mushroom and pulling it.\nSWUA\nHalf of the mushrooms in the building came off in one pull!\nLeo didn't stop. His two hands pressed them and molded them like clay mud, turning the mushroom into a giant ball. Despite his attempt, the molded mushrooms extended their branches and released their spores. Little dust got in Leo's nose and mouth. Some of the spores latched onto his face.\n\"Tsk. I shouldn't have opened the mask to eat you. Anyway, big mistake, dude.\"\nThe spores in Leo's nose and mouth instantly died as the radiation was more concentrated than his outer skin. Still, it didn't stop the ball of mushroom from growing.\nGetting desperate, Leo thought of the system. He recalled that it mentioned something about the cleaning feature, which Leo hadn't tried yet.\n\"System, where is the cleaning feature?\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned the feature, the mannequins stopped working and stared at him. Then, a new system window appeared, showing the shop domain map. On the map, there was a red radar-like highlighted area.\n<Please designate the cleaning area.>\n<Please noted. Activating the cleaning feature will instantly transfer all items in the designated zone to the recycling center. Half of the items will be lost as a penalty. You can only activate this feature once a day.>\n\"Err…\"\nLeo approved and disapproved of this feature. He liked how the system might be useful in this situation, but the system didn't tell him if the mushrooms would be contained after the transfer. He thought of the recycling center's shed, which was on the open field.\n'If I use the system, won't the spores spread to the nearby area? There is no freaking wall over there!'\nHesitated and frustrated, Leo pulled back his fingers. Instead of using the feature to remove the mushroom in the building, he touched the wall and summoned the upgrade menu instead.\nDING\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 5\nProduction Quality Level – (4/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nInstead of using the feature, Leo wanted to try something new first. He upgraded the workshop to level seven, and he put one upgrade point to the pill quality. As for another point, Leo went against his policy and picked an automaton alchemist.\nDING\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 7\nAlchemist Automaton (1/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nA new wooden mannequin rose from the wooden floor. At the same time, the building space expanded and transformed.\nFrom the outside, the workshop became a two-story building like the store. Externally, it remained the same size. However, the interior space of the workshop expanded, working the same way as the general store's dimensional space.\nThe quality of the walls, floor, and ceiling was also upgraded. The wooden floor changed into a cold concrete floor, and the interior walls were the same. The ceiling, however, was made from plaster tiles, supported by metal frames. There was no ventilation system other than the windows.\nAs the windows were still closed, Leo was relieved. He turned to the alchemist robot and pointed at the mushrooms.\n\"Do something about it! Make a pill out of them if you can! You can use the ingredients in the granary and the warehouse!\"\nThe mannequin nodded and walked with a long stride. It raised its arm, and it transformed into a giant cleaver blade. Then, it karate-chopped the mushroom ball that Leo was holding.\nSWUA\nThe mannequin cut the ball in half, but it didn't stop there. It swung its hand horizontally, cutting the ball again. The mushroom wall fell on the ground and was separated into four pieces.\nTOK-TOK-TOK\nAs if the mannequin was cooking, it continued chopping, slicing the mushroom ball into smaller pieces. In addition, the chopped mushrooms stopped multiplying for an unknown reason.\n\"…\"\nSeeing how the mannequin had everything under control, Leo stopped idling around. He ordered the recycling workers to continue working and closed the cleaning feature menu. Then, he pulled another section of the mushrooms and compressed them into another big ball. As usual, he tossed it toward the alchemist worker.\nThe alchemist mannequin caught it and chopped it in half. As soon as the blade cut the mushroom ball, the fungi stopped regenerating.\n\"I should have done this long ago. Man, I got scared for a moment.\"\nLeo proceeded to help the other workers collect the mushrooms and packed them in the Tupperware boxes. After the first box was full, two of the yellow-jacket mannequins began carrying the box to the recycling center.\nWorrying about the outbreak, Leo escorted the mannequins. He closed the door behind him and came out of the building. As soon as Leo came out, Hua Jiashan and the crowd stared at the transparent box, which contained the fully grown mushrooms.I think you should take a look at\n\"T-Those blasphemous mushrooms! I-I…\"\nHua Jiashan stuttered for a moment. As if his PTSD kicked in, he fainted, and the barrier dome was dispelled. Han Hao and Han Meng rushed in to support the sect master while Tiger Swordsman and others brought out random objects and used them as fans.\n\"…\"\nLeo felt a bit guilty. He purchased an inhalant stick from the online system and tossed it toward the group, \"Use this! It helps.\"\nWu Buyi caught it and looked at the tube-like object. He flipped it around as he had never seen this material before.\n\"Lord Florida Man, sir. What's this?\"\nLeo didn't bother looking at Wu Buyi and others. He walked into an alley between the two workshops and shouted, \"An inhaler stick! Open it and shove it into your elder's nose!\"\n\"…\"\nAlthough confused, Wu Buyi flipped the inhalant stick around the object and managed to unscrew the cover. Then, he sniffed at it and caught a pleasant scent of ammonia.\n\"I see. Indeed, it's an inhalant. But will it work?\"\nSometimes, Leo was inconsiderate with his words. Wu Buyi could also be innocently honest and stupidly naïve when he received orders from a senior. As a result, Wu Buyi took the advice word by word.\nWith his full force, Wu Buyi shoved the stick into Hua Jiashan's nose!\nThe Life Sword Sect's elders widened their eyes in shock as Wu Buyi's action caught them off guard. They yelled at him, \"What the hell, Wu Buyi?! How dare you insult the sect master?!\"\n\"B-But, Lord Florida Man asked me to…\" Wu Buyi let go of the stick and took a step back.\nThe crowd glared at Wu Buyi while the latter sweated profusely. Fortunately, Hua Jiashan recovered fast. He pulled out the stick to look at it.\n\"I feel better now. Don't be too harsh on him.\"\n\"…\"\nThe crowd stopped baring fangs at Wu Buyi. The latter was also relieved that the inhalant stick worked. Meanwhile, Hua Jiashan stared at it for a moment before he put it back into his nose and took a deep breath. Then, he closed his eyes, enjoying the pleasant scent.\nThe elders blankly stared at the elder in envy. They wondered if the inhalant  stick was an exceptional medicine that Leo personally made.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm RUMBLE\nWhile the elders were preoccupied with the modern ammonia stick, Cat jumped down from the general store's rooftop and stood menacingly in front of the second alchemy workshop. She opened the door with her roots and inserted her vines into the building.\n\"Hmm?\"\nHua Jiashan stood up in a panic. Although his subordinates had warned him about the monster, he was still stunned when he noticed Cat's constitution and hidden dao avatar.\n\"Does Daoist Florida Man raises this monster?!\"\nHan Hao and others found nothing wrong with it, \"What about it, sect master?\"\n\"It's exceptionally strong and weird. Wait a second. What is it doing?!\"\nIt was too late for everybody to react. Cat already scooped pieces of mushroom that the alchemy mannequin had chopped, and she threw them into her chomper mouth. She chewed it in glee.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nHua Jiashan panicked and screamed. A moment later, he fainted again.\n\"SECT MASTER!\"\nThe crowd was also panicked as the sect master's PTSD was so severe. Even Wu Buyi was helpless as he had no idea why a powerful expert fainted so easily.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo observed how the mannequins dealt with the contained mushrooms. They brought the container to the cement pool, which was filled with strange blue water.\nThe mannequins climbed the edge. They opened the Tupperware's cover and poured the mushrooms into the blue water.\n\"Wait a minute.\"\nLeo rushed to the pool and looked into the water. Then, he noticed how the water dissolved the mushrooms into dust.\n\"…\"\nLeo gulped. He wondered if the blue acid water might be harmful to him. To test things out, he took off his clothes, leaving him with only a naked butt. He then playfully coughed.\n\"This is Florida Man. Welcome to Jackass!\"\nLeo sometimes wished that he could have the theme jingle to accompany his actions. Still, as silly as he was, he jumped into the pool.\nBOOM\nWater splashed everywhere, but none of them hit the mannequins. It was slightly hot but refreshing. Leo felt like he was dipping in a hot spring.\nLeo came up to the surface. He laughed and swam as if it was a normal swimming pool. As he hadn't taken a proper shower for almost a month, some dirt came out from the pores of his skin. The water around him changed into a rainbow color.\nAfter a minute of swimming, Leo concluded that the acidic water couldn't do anything to his skin. Even though he accidentally swallowed a mouthful of water, it did nothing to his stomach.\n\"I guess I now have a personal swimming pool.\"\nWhile Leo had fun, the drainage at the bottom of the pool sucked in dust and waste from Leo. New blue water also came out from the other bottom hole, refilling the lost water.\nDING\nLeo hadn't noticed the machine next to the cement pool. It started running, and a long line of belts moved. A few seconds later, blue marble orbs exited the machine, sitting on the running belt. The orb was carried to the end of the belt line and fell into a large empty pool.\nDING-DING\nThe spirit stones rolled on the empty pool and glittered under the sunlight.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 65 – Meth Making is Popular among Pharmacy Company, Said Florida Man Who Successfully Converted Famous Chemist into Meth Chef\nAfter a quick bath, Leo came out of the blue pool. He made sure to wipe his body with a towel and put on his clothes before he returned to the workshop. However, as Leo got sidetracked by his pending silliness and craziness, things developed in the workshop.\nThe group of workers were on their way to the recycling workshop. However, none of them carried a box of mushrooms with them. Instead, they returned empty-handed.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo gazed at the wood mannequins. He inspected their bodies if they were infected by the mushrooms, but they seemed unharmed.\n\"Where are the mushrooms? What happened?\"\nThe mannequins couldn't answer. They simply stared at Leo's face, waiting for his next instructions.\nSeeing their reactions, Leo scratched his head, \"Fine. Go clear the forest weeds in the backyard for me. Throw everything in the junkyard, but don't toss them into the pool. I need to sort them out first. Can you do it?\"\nThe mannequins flinched as they updated the new instructions. They turned around in unison and left the junkyard to the back.\nMeanwhile, Leo rushed to the workshop. He needed to know what happened to the mushrooms as they were the finest ingredients for new pills. Upon reaching the front of the workshops, Leo glanced at the group of elders, who were nursing Hua Jiashan back to health.\n\"???\"\nLeo frowned and turned in another direction. Then, he saw the cause of the mess – Cat was there, scooping and eating mushrooms in glee. Some spores latched on her mouth and skin, but they couldn't grow for an unknown reason.\nCat also noticed Leo's arrival. When the humanoid head spotted him, she waved her hands at him.\n\"You…\" Leo facepalmed. Cat was too innocent, and he couldn't get angry at her. \"Cat. You're not supposed to eat that. The mushrooms are dangerous. It will turn you into a zombie. By the way, are you a zombie yet?\"\n\"Meow?\" Cat tilted her human head, unable to understand his words.\n\"What do you mean by a zombie? Well, a zombie is a walking corpse of a human or a monster. They smell bad, and they attack random people to spread their diseases. You can get really sick if you get bitten or infected.\"\n\"Meow!? Meow-Meow?!\"\n\"Yes, you're eating zombie disease dust at the moment. The mushrooms are the disease spreader.\"\n\"MEOW!!\"\nCat stopped eating. Her human part cried, but the chomper mouth continued chewing the mushrooms. After the mouth swallowed everything, the long tongue came out and licked his face.\nLeo rolled his eyes. Cat's bad breath was stinker than Morbol from Final Fantasy Series, and he took 9,999 emotional damage from the odor.\nWhile Cat licked him, Leo inspected her oral health. A thousand small fangs were yellowish, and pieces of rotten potatoes were still stuck between her teeth. Fortunately, there was no sign of a zombie mushroom growing in her mouth.\nLeo was relieved. He patted the plant girl and entered the building to see the carnage.\nInside the building, most of the mushrooms were removed, leaving only a small portion that the alchemy mannequin had processed. However, the mannequin was not in the workshop.\nLeo pursed his lips and collected the remaining small pieces of cut mushrooms in a container. He closed the Tupperware box and left it there for the time being. Then, he looked at the roof.\nWIGGLE\nA small portion of mushrooms remained in the corners of the building. However, the growth speed was drastically reduced as they lacked nutrition.\nLeo walked closer to the mushrooms in one of the corners. As soon as he got close, the mushrooms were attracted to his radiation aura, and they moved toward him. They also grew faster.\n\"Yeah. Figured as much. I'm the cause.\"\nLeo quietly peeled the mushrooms in the corners and put them in the same Tupperware box. Then, they stopped growing.\nThe crisis was over. Leo wiped his sweat and gazed at the mushrooms in the containers.\n\"I'll regrow you when I have a better building. For now, you guys need to go swimming. Hehehe.\"\nLeo exited the building with the box. When he got out, Cat was still there, sobbing like a little baby.\nA crying little girl benefited no one. Leo sighed and patted the giant plant girl, \"Listen, you're not going to be infected or anything. You're immune to the disease.\"\n\"Meow?\"\n\"Yes. Really!\"\n\"Meow? Meow?\"\n\"Really, really!\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat stopped crying. She kissed him by sucking half of his upper body into her mouth and repeatedly licked his face like a lollipop. After wetting his face and hair enough, Cat hummed and crawled back to the granary, which ended up as her house.\nLeo blankly stared at the plant girl and shook his head. He no longer bothered wiping his face or hair as it would have ruined the cloth or the towel.\nCREAK-CRACK\nWhile Cat was crawling home, the alchemy mannequin returned. It came from the granary's direction, and it carried a bunch of potatoes in its arms. The doll arrived at the second alchemy cauldron and dropped 10 potato pieces in there along with a piece of sweet dream mushroom. Then, it looked at Leo.\nLeo shrugged as he knew what the mannequin asked for. He spat at the fireplace of the cauldron, giving it some essence.\nDING\n<Refining Hope and Dream Pills…>\nThe lid was automatically closed as the cauldron started working. A timer menu, which only Leo could see, appeared in front of the cauldron.\n<6 Days, 23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 58 Seconds…>\nThe process took as long as the immortal pills. Leo bitterly smiled as he wouldn't be able to use this workshop for a week.\nCREAK-CRACK\nThe alchemy mannequin didn't stop working. it pressed its hands at the cauldron as if it was manually refining the pills. Then, something magical occurred.\nThe system informed Leo.\nDING\n<Alchemy Workshop's Automaton is helping you refine Hope and Dream Pills.>\n<Tips: Workshop Automatons can raise the pill's quality and quantity by one tier. Having more than one automaton working on the project at once can decrease the refinement time.>\n\"Wow.\"\nLeo smacked his forehead. He wished he knew about this feature sooner.I think you should take a look at\nStill, the work here was finished. It was time to bring the mushrooms to the recycling center. Leo turned around to check on Hua Jiashan and the elders next.\n\"…\"\nThe group of old men stared at the alchemy mannequin in a daze. Their faces and expressions seemed like they had seen a ghost.\n\"Umm, hello? Houston to Earth?\"\nHua Jiashan came back to his senses, but the nasal inhaler stick was still stuck in his nose. He coughed and corrected his demeanor.\n\"D-Daoist Florida Man. What's with your alchemy techniques? Why are you using your golem to concoct a pill when it's better to do it yourself?\"\nIt was common sense for alchemists to focus on one cauldron at a time as the pill refining and pill-making process required commitment and concentration - A slight distraction could ruin Qi flow in the cauldron, and the materials might be wasted.\nHowever, Leo was like a hipster to this world's common sense. He remotely concocted a batch of pills in a cauldron, then he started another by using a golem. These actions baffled the crowd.\nWu Buyi smacked his chest a few times as his heart couldn't take it. His face flushed, and his blood pressure spiked. The alchemist elder's trembling hand pointed at the golem and the first workshop's cauldron.\n\"L-Lord Florida Man… Y-You are concocting two sets of pills at the same time?!\"\n\"Oh,\" Leo shrugged. \"What's wrong with that? Actually, in the near future, I might do three at once. Get used to it.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi stopped moving. A moment later, he stiffly fainted while he stood.\n\"ELDER WU!\"\n\"ELDER WU BUYI! NOT YOU, TOO!!\"\nThe elders panicked and rushed to Wu Buyi's aid. They fed him herbal pills, hoping to get him back to health.\nLeo shook his head and purchased a dozen inhalant sticks. He tossed them to the crowd.\nHowever, Hua Jiashan nimbly waved his hands and collected all of them. He opened one of the sticks and put it in his available nostril.\n\"…\"\nThe elders and Leo blankly stared at Hua Jiashan. It seemed that the sect master had an addiction issue.\nFortunately, Hua Jiashan passed the rest of the inhalers to the others. Han Hao took one and proceeded to give it to Wu Buyi. The guy slowly came back to his senses and recovered.\nLeo sighed and gave up on explaining to them. He minded his business and brought the mushrooms to the recycling center's pool.\n.\nAn hour later, Leo finished taking another bath in the acid pool. He returned to check on the group.\nWhen Leo arrived, he found the gang, staring at the cauldron in a daze. Their eyes shone as they could see through the black pot and inspected the pills inside.\nLeo checked the timer.\n\"Oh, it's finished.\"\nLeo nonchalantly opened the lid, and the pills floated out of the pot. They hovered over the cauldron, emitting a medical scent.\nWu Buyi sat in the middle of the crowd, looking stupid. His unaligned eyes looked like chameleon's eyes, and he drooled like an infant toddler.\n\"Am I dreaming? How is this possible?\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and Hua Jiashan were also speechless. They counted the pills to make sure.\nOne of the elders confirmed the result.\n\"30 pills. More than half are high grade. Two are superior grade, and 10 are medium grade…\"\n\"Uwee…\" Wu Buyi let out a weird noise. His mind was no longer on Earth. He muttered to himself, \"60 years of practicing and training? What was the point? Why did I waste so much time on those lousy techniques while a better technique is right in front of me?\"\nEverybody stared at Wu Buyi. They came to a conclusion.\n\"I guess he's broken,\" Han Hao facepalmed as his friend lost it.\nHua Jiashan also coughed to hide his embarrassment, but the two inhalant sticks were still stuck in his nose. He cupped his fist and lowered his head.\n\"You have opened our eyes and broadened our horizons. Thank you for the lesson.\"\n\"Don't mention it,\" Leo stroked his beard and took the credit even though he didn't do anything.\n\"Say,\" Hua Jiashan widely grinned. He confirmed the deal with Leo. \"Could I ask you to teach our disciples your concoction techniques?\"\nLeo had expected this. He shook his head, \"Sorry. No.\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"I see.\"\nHua Jiashan also understood why Leo refused. After all, accepting a disciple was a big thing in the cultivation world as it was related to their legacy and Daos. They had to make sure that no outsiders or evil cultivators learn and spread their techniques to the public. Otherwise, their sects, clans, or organizations would lose their purpose.\n\"But they can watch.\"\n\"Oh?\" Hearing that Leo permitted the disciples to watch, Hua Jiashan was delighted. \"The disciples will be very happy. I bet this idiot is happy, too. Right?\"\nHearing Hua Jiashan's words, Wu Buyi came back to his senses. He looked back and forth and repeatedly nodded, \"Yes, you're right! But what were you talking about again?\"\nEverybody: \"…\"\n.\n.\nAfter the demonstration, the deal was finalized - The Life Sword Sect's elders returned home happy. Han Hao and Han Meng would be in charge of sending helpers to the store to work here for free. Hua Jiashan ended up paying 100 years of his lifespan to purchase 100 inhalant sticks from Leo. Tiger Swordsman got Leo's permission, and he would send commoners to sell Leo some vegetables and fruits in exchange for spirit stones or essence stones.\nAs for Wu Buyi, he didn't return home. He groveled in front of the store, begging Leo for something else. The elders didn't bother bringing him along as this guy already lost his mind.\nLeo stared at Wu Buyi, who didn't stop kowtowing to Leo. The latter wailed.\n\"PLEASE TAKE ME AS YOUR DISCIPLE!! TEACH ME, MASTER!!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had a headache. He regretted revealing his secrets to Wu Buyi.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 66 – Florida Man Trainee Warned Not to Insert Fingers into Electric Outlet, Gets Electrocuted.\n\"I have nothing to teach you,\" Leo rejected Wu Buyi's request.\n\"Then, can I observe you when you concoct new pills?\" Wu Buyi negotiated.\n\"Fine. I'm working on one right now. Go take a look if you want, but don't disturb me.\"\n\"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MASTER!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi smacked his forehead to the ground. He was so overjoyed that he cried. However, the alchemist was greedy by nature. After getting an inch, he wanted a foot.\n\"One more request, master. Can I bring the disciples from the sect to learn from you?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Do whatever you want.\"\n\"YES, MASTER! HAHAHAHA!\"\nWu Buyi was delighted. He immediately dashed toward the second alchemy workshop, where the alchemy automaton had been working on the Hope and Dream Pills.\nLeo sighed. In the end, he took in Wu Buyi as a subordinate. Although they didn't officially agree to it, their statuses already changed that way.\nAfter Wu Buyi was not in sight, Leo resumed working. He rechecked the remaining lifespan and buildable structures.\nSo far, Leo spent 20,000 years of lifespan on the native auto-speech translation feature so that he could understand the locals outside the shop domain. Then, he upgraded the store and the second workshop twice, costing him 13,000 years of lifespan. This didn't include the cost of the recycling center and its upgrade – 6,500 years in total.\n<Current Lifespan: 51,731 years…>\nOnce again, the investment was money-sinking, but Leo enjoyed doing so. After all, this was the only entertainment he had in this world.\n\"Let's go. I want the most expensive building first!\"\n.\nMystic Realm Portal\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 20\n.\nAs this structure demanded a lot of space, Leo picked the empty area west of the farmlands and granary. Coincidentally, it was at the southwest corner of the domain.\nDING\n<Activating the Cleaning Feature.>\n<Half of the natural resources will be sent to the recycling center.>\nAlthough some of the trees hadn't been cleared in the area, the system automatically removed them. Half of the vanished trees reappeared in the junkyard due to the cleaning feature.\nRUMBLE\nAs usual, the ground elevated, creating a concrete foundation of a platform. An oval ring frame of blue steel manifested from nothingness and hovered above the platform's center. The central axis of the oval steel remained in place, but the wings began to rotate, producing strange energy at the center of the ring.\nNatural Qi gathered in the center of the platform. Then, four pillars emerged from the concrete ground, becoming the four scorpion tail obelisks, pointing at the rotating ring.\nWHOOSH\nThe structure continued to charge its energy. Blue light gathered, and a beacon of blue light shot up from the ring to the sky.\n\"Wow.\"\nLeo admired the scene, thinking of it as a firework or a light show. He also clapped his hands for it.\nHowever, admiring it wouldn't change anything. Leo approached his new toy and touched the scorpion tail obelisk, wondering what it was for.\n.\nMystic Realm Portal – Level 1\nEntry Limit (Person) – (1/10)\nPortal Cooldown Reduction – (0/5)\nPortal Duration – (0/5)\nNext Destination: Unknown Low Plane\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nStatus: Ready to Open\n.\nLeo almost vomited blood when he noticed the upgrade cost. Instead of 1,000 years of lifespan per level, the portal required 10,000!\nThe upgradable things here were self-explanatory. Still, Leo touched every panel to see the explanation.\n<Entry Limit – The number of people allowed to enter the portal at a time.>\n<Portal Cooldown – After activation, the portal will undergo a maintenance cooldown. Without the reduction, the average cooldown is 80-90 days. Each upgrade decreases the cooldown time by 10 %.>\n<Portal Duration – The length of the active portal. Once a portal is opened, it will remain open for ten days. Upgrading this section increases the length by five days per level.>\n<Next Destination – Indicate the next destination that the portal will link to. The destinations cannot be chosen as it generates randomly. A low-level portal can only find low-tier mystic realms while a high-level one can send you to demon realms or immortal realms.>\nLeo nodded in approval. By having this, Leo had something to look forward to.\n<Current Lifespan: 41,731 years…>\nLooking at the remaining lifespan, Leo started calculating. He counted his fingers, counting the number of buildings that he needed to upgrade.\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLEEEEEEE!!! HOWW!?\"\nLeo heard a certain someone's voice from behind the store. It seemed that Wu Buyi had a heart attack or something similar. He shrugged and continued working.\n.\nAt night, Leo finished upgrading the essential buildings. The first alchemy workshop, warehouse, granary, and two farm plots were raised to level seven, costing him 10,000 years of lifespan.\nThe next investment was the third alchemy workshop. He erected it next to the second workshop. Leo didn't care what Wu Buyi might think about it since he had no time to check his reactions. He upgraded it to level 7 like the others as well, and he also raised the pill quality to level 5. As for two additional points, he put one in automaton and one in pill quantity each.\nAfter dumping 7,000 years of lifespan for the pill factory, Leo built another farm plot next to the first farm. Using the alchemy workshop as a template, Leo allocated the points of all farms the same way.\n.\nBasic Farmland Level 7\nAutomaton Farmer – (1/1) MAX\nGrowth Speed Level – (0/5)\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Production Quality Level – (5/5) MAX\nProduction Quantity Level – (1/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of LifespanI think you should take a look at\n.\nThree automatons rose up from the ground, and they began working by themselves. They used the seeds that Leo had stored in the granary to sow the lands, and they carried tools to do their jobs.\nLeo left them alone as the resource shortage wouldn't be a problem in the future. The only issue was the limited worker slot as one automaton might not be able to harvest everything on their own, which was why Leo needed helping hands from Life Sword Sect.\n<Current Lifespan: 27,731 years…>\nAfter making sure the production factories operated, Leo turned his attention to the welfare of his future employees.\n.\nSmall House\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nLeo was reluctant to build this, but he did it anyway. He built all three available small houses and erected them east of the general store.\nThat day, Leo designated the eastern part of his domain as the residential area. Although the granary was nearby, he didn't care as he could spend his lifespan to move it elsewhere like in a simulation game.\nAfter the three buildings appeared, Leo stopped what he was doing to inspect the potential homes of future employees.\nIt appeared as a one-story straw shack. No matter how Leo looked at it, it was too pathetic to be called a house.\nFortunately, the system allowed Leo to upgrade them.\n.\nSmall House Level 1\nHouse Size – (1/5)\nHouse Quality – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 500 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThe upgrade cost was cheap. Without hesitation, Leo tested one of them by raising its level to seven. Then, he put five points to house quality and one to house size.\nRUMBLE\nThe straw shack instantly transformed into a 25 sqm concrete house. It was still one story, but the exterior appearance drastically improved.\nCurious, Leo entered the first house to check the space inside. Then, he had a déjà vu. It seemed that the spatial expansion was a thing for his system.\nInstead of finding a small 25 sqm studio-room house, Leo found a sizable home. Judging from his eyes, Leo estimated that it was about 49 square meters or more.\nAs Leo looked around the house, he noticed something attractive. He saw a small room in the corner. Without hesitation, Leo rushed toward the small room to check it right away.\n\"My word…\"\nLeo finally found what he had desired the most – A functional modern toilet!\nAlthough Leo had one in the store, having one in a private home was a real improvement.\n\"Should I move here?\"\nLeo was tempted to bring his belongings there to occupy the first house. However, after minutes of contemplation, he shut down the thoughts.\nIt was not the time. There might be a bigger house in the future. After all, this building was called \"Small House\" for a reason.\n\"I'll wait until I get something worth my time. A mansion, maybe? If possible, my dear ring, I want a penthouse with glass walls, please. Oh, I also need a swimming pool in my yard and a large space to park my Rolls Royce and Bugatti.\"\nLeo started having a daydream while he stood in the middle of the empty house.\nWhile Leo was absentminded, Wu Buyi knocked on the door and coughed. The former came back to his senses and turned around.\nWu Buyi's face was as pale as a sheet. He sweated bullets, and bloody saliva seemed to leak from a corner of his mouth.\nWorrying about Wu Buyi, Leo asked him, \"What's up? Do you need help? Did you just vomit blood?\"\n\"M-M-Master. Care to explain what you were doing? This disciple doesn't understand how you created buildings and… MYSTIC REALM PORTAL out of nothingness *cough*.\"\nWu Buyi's condition was worse than Leo had imagined. Leo pulled an elixir grain pill from his pocket and softly flickered it into the alchemist's mouth.\nBecause Leo controlled his strength, the pill was still intact. However, it slightly grazed the alchemist's uvula, causing him to choke. Fortunately, the medicinal effect soothed him as it boosted his lifespan.\n\"Better?\" Asked Leo.\n\"T-Thank you very much, master.\"\nLeo bitterly smiled and looked around, trying to change the subject. He then came up with an idea.\n\"I'm building a house for you. Since you'll be studying here for a while, it won't be good if you stay out 24/7. You can bring your belongings here. Oh, the toilet is over there. If you don't know how to use something, just ask me.\"\n\"… Eh?\"\nWu Buyi was taken aback. He looked inside the house and found LED lights and an air conditioner. He also found random small holes in the wall.\nLeo followed Wu Buyi's gaze and found electric outlets. He broke a sweat and warned Wu Buyi.\n\"If you're not immune to… tribulation lightning, do not stick your finger or anything into those holes. They will zap you, and you will die.\"\n\"… Y-Yes, master,\" Wu Buyi gulped, but he was tempted to do it. He fervently looked at Leo, \"I can feel the aura of fire element and tribulation lightning in this building. Can I cultivate here?\"\nLeo flinched. He was puzzled about how Wu Buyi would cultivate Qi from the system's electricity. As Leo didn't know what to answer, he let Wu Buyi test it.\n\"Suit yourself. Don't get yourself killed.\"\n\"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MASTER!\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, Leo had no idea why Wu Buyi seemed so excited. He left him alone in his new house.\n.\n.\nAfter Leo left the house, Wu Buyi rushed into the house and touched the marble floor tiles. He then inspected the electric outlets and touched the surface of the holes.\nFrom Wu Buyi's perspective, this place was rich in fire essence, which was hidden behind the outlets. He could also sense the electricity, which was milder than the heavenly tribulation lightning bolts that he had experienced in the past.\n\"C-Can I cultivate the mythical Lightning Element here?! Is this even possible?!\"\nWu Buyi smacked his chest, preventing himself from having a stroke. Earlier, he almost had a heart attack twice when Leo built the mystic realm portal and the third alchemy workshop. And when the first and the third workshop's mannequins began working, he vomited blood for the third time.\nAs Wu Buyi was overexcited, he immediately injected his Qi into the electric outlet's holes. Then, the electric current followed the Qi and reached him.\nBZZZ\nThe breaker was immediately switched off, and the house went dark. Wu Buyi got a taste of zappy zap.",

He continued building his little empire.\n<Current Lifespan: 17,231 years…>\n.\nClothing Store\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 6\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nLivestock Shed\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nAside from the roads and the decoration items, two core structures were buildable. However, Leo hesitated if he should invest in them since his lifespan was low again. He contemplated if he should upgrade the general store first or construct these side-job buildings first.\nThe next general store upgrade would cost 7,000 years of lifespan. However, it would unlock the next upgrade and new buildings. On the other hand, Leo didn't want to miss out on the perks of the new structures.\nAs Leo was greedy, he chose to build everything. He put the clothing store building to the west of the general store, designating the area as the shopping district.\nRUMBLE\nA rundown wooden cabin was erected. It looked similar to the general store when it was at level one as it came with a small door and thin showcase glass windows.\nLeo entered the building and looked around. However, he found a blank building with one wooden mannequin, standing creepily in the dark, staring at Leo.\n\"…\"\nLeo ignored the creepy wooden mannequin. Curious about its feature and functions, Leo touched a wall to summon the building menu.\n.\nClothing Store Level 1\nAutomaton Worker (0/5)\nAutomaton Weaver – (1/5)\nWeaver Skills – (0/5)\nStore Quality – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research]\n.\nLeo read through the description and scratched his head. He felt like it was a waste of lifespan since it could only make clothes.\nHowever, the [Research] button reminded him of what the alchemy cauldron could do. He pressed on it, checking its feature and functions.\nDING\n<Please give a clothing design, pattern, or complete sample to the weaver to research.>\n<Please noted. After the item has been researched, the automaton weavers will automatically procure materials and weave the clothes for you.>\n\"…\"\nLeo had a feeling that the building should be called a tailoring factory instead. Still, as it was named \"Store\", he believed that it had a hidden function. Testing things out, Leo upgraded the building to level 7. He put five points to weaver skills and one point to store quality.\n.\nClothing Store Level 7\nAutomaton Worker (0/5)\nAutomaton Weaver – (1/5)\nWeaver Skills – (5/5) MAX\nStore Quality – (1/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research]\n.\nRUMBLE\nThe store's interior space expanded, but it still looked old. Meanwhile, the weaver automaton transformed into a female mannequin, and it wore a modern maid uniform. It even had a frilly cat ear headband and had movable robotic eyebrows.\nThe maid slightly bowed like a noble lady, greeting Leo without saying anything.\nLeo stared at the cat-ear maid for a moment. Then, he frowned at the unusual big knockers.\n\"Fake boobs,\" Leo snorted as he believed that everything was made from wood like her body.\nThe automaton flinched. She turned around and silently sulked in a corner.\nSeeing the mannequin's reaction, Leo was surprised. He thought that they had no feelings, but this weaver doll seemed to be conscious of her surroundings. He coughed and patted her back.\n\"I'm sorry. You're beautiful. I was joking.\"\nThe doll's head turned around 180 degrees like an Asian ghost. Her eye-lens glittered, staring into Leo's eyes. Then, she twisted her body to correct her posture and stand up.\nLeo was taken aback. This doll seemed to be a fan of horror movies. Still, he didn't hate her.\nTesting her functions, Leo asked the doll, \"What can you do for me?\"\nThe doll tilted her head. Then, she pointed at the empty air in front of her.\nDING\nThe store menu appeared in front of Leo. Then, the doll pointed at the research button, gesturing for him to use it.\nLeo pursed his lips. As he had no experience in fashion sense, he had no idea how to procure a fashion design or a pattern.\n\"Ah, right. I can do that.\"\nFortunately, Leo remembered about the online store. He purchased the dress that he used to purchase a couple days ago. At that time, Leo resold them to the girls from Amazonian Sanctuary. He wondered if it could be used as a sample.\nA cardboard box appeared. Leo unpacked it and pulled out a beautiful evening dress and fluttered it in front of the mannequin.\n\"!!!\"\nThe mannequin girl's eyes shone. She carefully received them and flipped them around. Then, she gave Leo a thumbs up.\nDING\n<You have researched a common evening dress.>\n<Your automaton will try to create a better version of this dress.>\n\"Heh. How cheeky,\" Leo found the doll amusing and the system. He believed that they might get along well.I think you should take a look at\nThe next moment, the mannequin did something unbelievable. She transformed her hands into a hundred nails. Her arms also shone and produced a vacuum force, absorbing the air around them.\nThe usual radiating light aura around Leo also got sucked into her arms. Leo stood there, watching what the doll would do with his radiation.\nWHOOSH\nThe arms made a 3D printer noise. The light flickered and glittering white threads slowly came out from her wrists as if she was a spiderwoman. Then, the threads entered the nail holes, and the mannequin skillfully knotted them.\n\"Huh?\"\nA minute later, the mannequin produced ten coils of white silver sewing threads. However, she kept on absorbing Leo's aura and made more threads.\nLeo nodded as he started to understand how the store worked. Instead of procuring threads from nature, this robot absorbed his radiation and 3D-printed the threads. Then, it would use them to make clothes.\nAs Leo understood how the weaver automaton functioned, he left her alone. He exited the store and was about to build the last structure and call it a day.\nCREAK\nHowever, the mannequin followed Leo. She stood behind him, stealing the endless rainbow aura into her arms.\n\"…\"\nLeo turned around and looked at the mannequin girl. He pursed his lips and patted her head.\n\"Well. At least, you don't start screaming PUTA like a creep. If you need my essence, I'll find a way to make some for you.\"\nLeo grinned and purchased a glass cup from the online store.\nKAAAAAAAK-PTUT!\nAs usual, Leo spat into the glass and gave it to the automaton, \"Here, my essence.\"\nThe automaton flinched and took a step back. She repeatedly shook her head, and she squinted her eyebrows in disgust.\n\"What? You don't want it?\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, the mannequin repeatedly shook her head.\n\"Then, what do you want?\"\nThe mannequin was silent for a moment. Then, she stabbed Leo's arm with her nails. Unfortunately, she couldn't penetrate his skin, and one of her nails was broken.\nLeo silently observed her action. From her behavior, it seemed that she wanted something else.\n\"Do you want my blood?\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, the mannequin shook her head. Then, she poked his skin with her nails.\n\"Do you want my skin?\"\n\"…!\"\nThe mannequin's expression was brightened. She repeatedly nodded and waved her hands around, trying to communicate. However, Leo didn't understand what she meant.\nLeo scratched his head. He found the doll weird and creepy. Still, he found her demand understandable since his skin might be the toughest hide in the fallout world. After all, nothing got through his skin for several millennia.\n\"This is gonna hurt. Oh, well.\"\nHe looked at his fingernails and found a small hangnail on his pinky finger. He took several deep breaths, preparing his mind.\n\"HMM!\"\nLeo grabbed the hangnail and pulled it with full force.\nSQUAK\n\"!!!\"\nLeo bit his lower lip, and his voice muffled in his throat.\nThe hangnail came off along with a layer of skin. It extended from the pinky nail to his palm, and it continued down to his wrist, forearm, and elbow. Fortunately, it stopped there. The starting piece was thin in the beginning. Unfortunately, it got bigger the longer he pulled.\nAfter pulling a long piece of his forearm and hand skin, Leo quietly passed it to the mannequin. His mercury-like blood seeped out from the wound, but they instantly regenerated his lost skin.\nJust like that, Leo's wound was gone.\n\"There you go. Don't ask for my skin again. That was damn PAINFUL!\"\nThe mannequin was overjoyed. She happily received the long piece of skin, which endlessly emitted a thick rainbow aura.\nHer right arm suddenly split, showing the sophisticated 3D-printer mechanism inside her. She inserted the skin into her right forearm and closed it.\nWHOOM\nThe same rainbow aura leaked out from the mannequin's forearm. Her printing machine worked faster, and more colorful threads came out from her wrists.\nSeeing how the threads ceaselessly came out, the mannequin returned to the clothing store building and closed the door behind her.\nMeanwhile, Leo watched her leave. She didn't even utter a word of appreciation.\n\"You're welcome.\" Leo chuckled and scratched his forearm. The wound was gone, but it was still itchy.\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 10,231 years…>\nWith only 10,000 years of lifespan left, Leo deeply sighed. Although he made his decision to build every new building first, he hesitated if he should proceed with it.\nAfter thinking it through, Leo chose to postpone the Livestock Shed project. He returned to the general store and upgraded it to level 8 so that he could take a sneak peek at the next batch of buildings.\nLeo touched the external wall of the store. He upgraded it to level 8, spending 7,000 years at once.\n<Humble General Store has been upgraded to Level 8.>\n<New Construction Options!>\nRUMBLE\nThe store transformed again. Instead of a hybrid brick-wood building, it became a two-story brick building. It looked like something from the Renaissance Era instead of a shabby wooden house.\nLeo entered the store and checked the interior. As soon as he entered, he blankly stared at the wide space.\nIt was huge. He could no longer measure the dimension of this place with his eyes anymore.\n\"This is not a HUMBLE general store. This is a freaking SHOPPING MALL!\"\nAside from the wide center area, 20 partitioned rooms occupied the west and east side of the building. Each room consisted of 25 sqm, which was enough for someone to set up a small store there. They also had sufficient electrical outlets and came with a shutter door.\nSecondly, there was a wooden staircase near the entrance. Leo climbed the stairs to the second floor and found 20 partitioned rooms and another wide area.\nLooking at the massive shopping mall space, Leo paused and sat on the stairs. His expression was dark.\n\"I'm going to develop Agoraphobia at this rate. What am I going to do with the wide space?! I can't fill everywhere with shelves and goodies. I can't possibly monitor everything when many guests enter the store at once.\"\nThe development was overwhelming. Leo failed to adapt to the change, and he had a lot of concerns about thieves. After all, he had seen so many shoplifters in shopping malls and supermarkets in the modern world. As a shopkeeper, he feared shoplifters the most.\n\"I need securities…\"\nLeo's eyes gleamed. He thought of the elders of the Life Sword Sect, wondering if he could scam them to work in his store permanently. The more he thought about the elders, the more Leo leaned toward recruiting them.\nA new project came to his mind. Leo looked at the glass windows from the second floor, gazing at the mystic realm portal. He recalled the words of Wu Buyi, Han Hao, and Han Meng when they mentioned the mystic realms.\n\"Quota, is it? Can I permanently hire somebody by offering a ticket to go through my gate? Rather, can I set up a company? No, it should be called a sect or a cult by this world's standards. Should I really make one?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 68 – Officials Confused as Florida Man Draws Alligator Emoticon as His Business Signature\nAs Leo had a lot to think about, he called it a day and rested.\nThe next morning, Leo woke up and came out of the shop to perform his routine, cleaning the store and collecting pills. He totally forgot about Wu Buyi.\nWhen Leo came out, he found Wu Buyi kneeling in front of the store. When their eyes met, the latter's expression brightened.\n\"Master! You've finally come out! I have something to report!\"\n\"…Speak.\" Leo was bemused, wondering what the alchemist had been doing all night.\n\"T-The house… has just lost the Qi source. The lightning element Qi and the fire Qi are gone! I don't know why, but they instantly vanish!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo frowned. He didn't remember that the system house had a Qi source. Still, he strode toward the house to check the mess Wu Buyi had made.\nUpon getting inside, Leo discovered a black electric outlet. From a glance, he could tell that someone short-circuited the electricity as the trace of a small electric shock was obvious as day.\nLeo deeply sighed. He walked toward the circuit breaker at the back of the house and flipped the switch on.\nBINK\nBINK\nThe LED light and the air conditioner were turned on.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi was in a daze. He gazed at the light and the air conditioner. He deeply inhaled the cold air from the machine and smiled.\n\"Master is awesome! How did you restore the Qi source? Please teach me, master!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He pointed at the black outlet, \"See that?\"\n\"Hmm?\" Wu Buyi followed Leo's finger and noticed the black electric outlet, \"What about it?\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"ARE YOU A FREAKING IDIOT SANDWICH?! I TOLD YOU NOT TO STICK YOUR FINGER IN! WHAT ARE YOU, A DONKEY?!\"\nWu Buyi was quick. He covered his ears and circulated his Qi to protect his eardrums. Still, the voice rocked his balance, and he fell to the floor, getting dizzy.\nSeeing Wu Buyi's condition, Leo lowered his voice and squatted next to him. He pointed at the circuit breaker.\n\"Listen here. You wet banana. Next time you ruin your house, check that thing over there. If it lever is down, flip it up, and everything will be fine. But if you do that and everything is still broken, it's on you. Okay?\"\nWu Buyi repeatedly nodded even though he barely understood Leo's instructions. He gazed at the breaker unit and wondered what it was for. He also had some questions regarding Leo's strange vocabulary.\n\"Master, what's a wet banana?\"\n\"An idiot that deserves a thousand slaps to the face for his stupidity.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, continue what you've been doing. I have some work to do.\"\n\"Y-Yes, master.\"\nLeo left Wu Buyi alone in his house and visited the three alchemy workshops behind the store next.\n.\n10 minutes later, Leo stared at the group of mannequins in a daze. He didn't expect to see three workshop mannequins coordinate with the warehouse workers.\n.\nWarehouse Level 7\nWarehouse Automaton Level - (3/5)\nStorage Size Level – (4/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nAs Leo had upgraded the warehouse to level seven, he added two more workers to help sort and collect resources. However, he didn't know that they had other functions.\nThe alchemist bots automatically collected the pills and put them in the warehouse. Afterward, the warehouse workers learned about the pills and coordinated with the workshop mannequin, fetching pill ingredients from the granary for them.\nIn addition, the warehouse mannequins were nimble. They jumped and ran like characters from Naruto, traveling back and forth between the granary, warehouse, workshop, and farms. Leo even noticed that one of the warehouse mannequins helped the farm automaton harvest a potato. Then, it carried the massive unit into the granary.\nIn short, these warehouse workers ran around, providing logistic assistance to the other mannequins.\nLeo's mood was lifted. He was glad that he no longer had to manually collect or make new pills on his own. With this, he could just sleep at home all day and let the mannequin slaves do the daily chore for him.\nUnfortunately, not all good things came without flaws. There was an issue with the alchemist mannequins. As Leo didn't update his instructions, they continued making the same pills over and over again.\nThe first workshop focused on yang flame dans. The second workshop hadn't finished making the Hope and Dream pills. As for the newest workshop, it ceaselessly produced Rejuvenate Tea.\nProducts that required hours to make were not an issue. The ones that took less time to make was the headache-inducing one. As the rejuvenate tea required containers to collect, the mannequins used whatever they could find to store them. As a result, they were in a mess.\nThe earth jar that Leo always used to store freshwater was filled with tea and freshwater. Cat's bucket of mutated water was also used. A massive trash bin, which contained spirit stones and essence stones, was brought out from the warehouse, and they were half-filled with the tea while some of the stones were still inside.\nIn short, the tea was wasted. Only Cat could drink it, but Leo doubted that she would.\n\"Haiya…\"\nLeo regretted that he didn't prepare enough glass bottles or a proper barrel for the juice. He purchased a few empty barrels from the online store. He then ordered the mannequin for the third workshop.\n\"Next time, store the tea in here. Don't bother using another container, okay? If you run out of containers, come find me.\"\nThe mannequin looked at Leo's face for a moment and nodded. It returned its attention to the cauldron, continuing refining the tea.\nAfter giving out his order, Leo gazed at the mess. He carried the bucket of mutated water and brought them to the old outhouse near the Sword Saint Boulder. He poured the content in there. Leo also did the same to the earth jar of freshwater as it couldn't be used anymore. As for the trash bins, Leo spent a long time sorting the essence stones out of the containers. It took him hours to finish cleaning up the mess.\nAt late noon, Leo's stomach grumbled. Leo forgot about breakfast, and he realized that he hadn't eaten anything yet. He stopped what he was doing and returned to the store, hoping to grab some bananas to eat.I think you should take a look at\nStepping into the store and experiencing the distorted space again, Leo flinched. He couldn't get used to the weird space distortion of this place no matter how many times he entered or left the building. Going back to fetch food from the store was also a hurdle as the fridges were still at the center of the building.\nWalking a hundred meters, Leo reached the center of the store, where the fridges and shelves were gathered here. Leo grabbed a few golden sand bananas and ate them as usual.\nWhile eating, Leo gazed at the large empty space. He still couldn't figure out what to do with it. Moreover, the partitioned rooms on the west and east stood out like a sore thumb. By looking at it, Leo wished that he could get someone to open some shops here so that he could collect rent.\nJust as Leo thought of Hua Jiashan and the elders, one of them returned to the store. Tiger Swordsman led the Magpie City's representative and local merchants here to establish a trade deal with Leo.\nTiger Swordsman knocked on the store's front door. Then, he opened it.\n\"Senior Florida Man. As promised, I've brought you… HOLY BUDDHA!!\"\nThe burly cultivator was taken aback when he saw the massive space in the building. He immediately took several steps back to check the two-story building from outside. Then, he shoved his head inside, peeking and checking the interior.\nTiger Swordsman wasn't the only one with this reaction. The merchant representatives were also shocked as they peeked into the store through the windows from outside. They saw how big and wide the building was, and they couldn't help but rub their eyes.\nLeo noticed their reactions. He chuckled and waved his hand, inviting them in. He could have gone out to receive them, but he was too lazy to walk.\nTiger Swordsman noticed the gesture. He invited the people in. Five commoners behind him nodded and followed the cultivator into the building.\nAs Leo was being lazy, he put the usual sacred wood blocks for them to sit on. He could have purchased proper chairs from the online store, but he always forgot about it.\nEverybody got to their seat. They nervously gazed at Leo, who was still chewing a banana in his hand. Tiger Swordsman also noticed that Leo was eating a rare golden sand banana. The corners of his mouth twitched.\nNo sane cultivator ate a raw vegetable or fruit from mystic realms as the residual element Qi in the fruit or vegetable would have killed them from the inside. However, Leo seemed to be unaffected by the food.\n\"My apologies that I can't serve you tea today. One of my workers is too new on the job and he messed up a few gallons of tea.\"\nLeo patted his hand and glanced at the banana peel on his lap. He shrugged and put it in his mouth, eating them as well. After all, every part of mutated fruits and veggies gives him life force.\nThe expressions of the crowd were complicated. The merchants and the city representatives looked at Tiger Swordsman, questioning him with their eyes if the man was sane.\nTiger Swordsman coughed and got to the point.\n\"Ahem. Umm, senior. We would like to discuss the deal we talked about, yesterday. I talked to the locals, and they agree to sell you vegetables and fruits. However, they need an advanced payment since it's a long-term deal.\"\nOne of the merchants stood up and cupped his fist. He added, \"Although our status is inferior to cultivators, we need some insurance that you will not take advantage of us, commoners. I-If we offend you, please forgive us.\"\nLeo nodded. He had seen this type of deal in the modern world before, and advanced payment wasn't something new to him.\n\"How much do you need for the advanced payment?\"\nThe merchants looked at each other. They slightly nodded as they had discussed this before they came here.\n\"Umm, one spirit stone per month per merchant firm, senior. That will be a total of five spirit stones. After we receive the payment, we will deliver our goods here every first day of the week.\"\n\"How much will I get?\" Leo didn't bother looking at them. He stood up and picked another banana from the showcase refrigerator. Then, he ate the tip of it without peeling it.\nThe crowd gulped as they were taken aback by Leo's weird sense of food. The city representative spoke next.\n\"T-Ten stones of vegetables and fruits for me, senior.\"\nAnother merchant nervously stated his offer, \"Seven, no, eight stones for me.\"\n\"Eight for me, too.\"\n\"Ten here, senior.\"\n\"I-I can only do seven.\"\nLeo quietly looked at the people. Then, he gazed at Tiger Swordsman, wanting to ask him how much one stone of fruits was. However, Leo's facial skin wasn't thick, so he didn't reveal that he had no idea what they were talking about.\nSince spirit stones were easy to find, Leo readily agreed.\n\"Alright. Five spirit stones for those. Where do I sign?\"\nThe merchants and the city representative were delighted. They brought out their contract papers for Leo to sign.\nUnfortunately, this world still relied on brushes and ancient ink stones. They started grinding ink stones to make ink for Leo to write. One of them also asked him.\n\"Senior, do you have a seal stamp? We can use stamps, too.\"\n\"… Stamps?\"\n\"Yes, senior. If you have a stamp that can represent your clan or lineage, you can use it instead of signing.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo stroked his beard and frowned. As he was not a noble from the local kingdom, he was already disqualified from using the stamp thingy.\n\"I'll write my name.\"\n\"… Alright, senior.\"\nThe group finished preparing the ink and brushes for Leo. The latter quietly rolled his robe sleeves and gracefully picked a brush. He gently dipped the tip in the ink container.\nMeanwhile, Leo's mind screamed in panic. It was his first time writing his name in Chinese. Even though he had learned the characters from the system, he was still nervous.\nAs Leo's brain was frozen in panic, his muscle memory kicked in. Instead of writing his name properly, his arm and hand automatically moved, treating the paper as if it was something he could draw a picture on.\nLeo skillfully drew a smiling alligator head on the signature area.\nEverybody: \"…\"\nLeo didn't finish there. He then spelled his Daoist Title underneath in Chinese.\nEverybody looked at the characters and pronounced them in unison.\n\"Fu-Luo-Li-Da?\"\n\"It's Florida…\" Leo facepalmed.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 69 – Elderly Men Interested in Florida Man's Balls, Survey Said\nAfter signing the deal, the merchants and the city representatives returned home happy. They got their spirit stones, which could be exchanged for their local currency later.\nTiger Swordsman remained behind as Leo asked him to stay. When the crowd left, Leo proceeded with his agenda. He consulted the elder.\n\"I'm planning to create a new sect. What do I need to do? Is there a custom around here, or do I have to acquire a license somewhere?\"\nTiger Swordsman was astonished. Still, he was glad that Leo consulted with him first. He honestly revealed the process.\n\"Usually, sects and cults are built on top of a cultivation resource or Qi sources, such as the Mt. Claymore of Life Sword Sect. Although the natural Qi is faint, it's enough for others to cultivate and gain strength. If you wish to build a sect, you must secure a place for disciples and elders to cultivate first.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo nodded and rubbed his chin. He got a general idea. While he listened, he glanced at the shop domain menu and looked at the new building list.\n.\nLivestock Shed\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nParking Lot\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 30 x 30\n.\nWarehouse (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nGranary (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nEmployee Apartment\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 50\n.\nDomain Expansion\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nExpansion Range – 100 x 100\n.\nEverything seemed irrelevant to the Qi source as most of the buildings were related to modern structures. Even the parking lot seemed useless.\nFortunately, Wu Buyi used to mention Fire Qi and Lightning Qi in the house. Leo wondered if the modern houses and apartments could be used as a Qi source for disciples and elders to use.\nTesting his theory, Leo invited Tiger Swordsman.\n\"Can you come with me for a moment? I need to show you something.\"\n\"Alright, senior. Lead the way.\"\nBoth men exited the store. Then, Leo guided the elder to the small house, next to Wu Buyi's home. He opened the door and invited the swordsman in.\nTiger Swordsman entered the modern home. He looked around in astonishment as he had never seen a house without an open window. As the air conditioner worked 24/7 there, there was no need to open a window to let the airflow.\n\"It seems stuffy,\" Tiger Swordsman remarked. \"What is this place, senior?\"\n\"A house.\"\n\"A house?! People live here?!\"\n\"Why? Is it inappropriate or unusual?\"\nTiger Swordsman gulped. He deeply inhaled and revealed his thoughts.\n\"I don't think anyone should be living here. This is a place for someone with a high status, such as a sect master or an important guest to stay. I can feel intense Fire Qi and an unknown element Qi here. It feels like Heavenly Tribulation's lightning bolts, so I believe this might be the legendary lightning element Qi!\"\nTiger Swordsman seemed excited. Unlike Wu Buyi, he only glanced at the electrical outlets and the circuit breaker. He didn't seem like he wanted to poke his finger or something into the holes.\nLeo continued to probe for information.\n\"If I let people gather around the house, can they cultivate Fire Qi?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nTiger Swordsman pondered. He exited the house and stood in front of it. A minute later, he shook his head.\n\"It's unfortunate. I don't think anybody can cultivate the Qi from outside.\"\n\"I see.\"\nLeo learned something useful. He believed that the new building \"Apartment\" might also be the same. If that was the case, Leo could solve the Qi source issue, and he could openly solicit people from Life Sword Sect to join him.\nStill, there was one hurdle. Leo was short of lifespan once again.\nAlthough Leo was short on lifespan, he had plenty of ideas on how to make some. He ordered Tiger Swordsman to wait there, and he went to the warehouse to fetch some essence stones. After packing a hundred stones in a leather bag, Leo gave them to Tiger Swordsman.\nThe elder received the leather bag and looked inside. Upon seeing the essence stones, he was shocked.\n\"S-Senior. This…\"\nLeo mischievously grinned and whispered, \"Do me a favor. Bring those essence stones to the royal court or the imperial court whatsoever. I want you to report to the emperor that I'm hoarding countless essence stones with me, and I have a way to procure them. Can you do it?\"\n\"W-WHAT?! BUT WHY?!\"\nTiger Swordsman was taken aback. He was confused about why Leo wanted to provoke the imperial court.I think you should take a look at\n\"Don't ask why. Please do what I said. I need to get their attention. If they are aware of my existence, they might send people to visit my store and become my customers. If they buy my products, you will also get some commission from me. It's a win-win, right?\"\n\"…\"\nTiger Swordsman hesitated. He wasn't convinced that it was the right approach. Still, as Leo seemed to be confident in his abilities and strength, he agreed.\n\"Alright. Please be careful, senior. Those guys are overbearing and arrogant. They might come to extort taxes from you.\"\nLeo brightly smiled, \"That's even better. Let them come.\"\n\"…\"\nThe elder was speechless. He quietly stored the leather bag and excused himself, returning to the sect to spread words. He would also inform the other elders that Leo wished to establish a new sect.\nAfter Tiger Swordsman was gone, Leo turned his attention to his store. He cracked his knuckles.\n\"This is going to be a long day. I'm gonna rearrange the shelves and the fridges into the booths. Right, I should designate one of them as my personal store. As for the rest, I can let my future workers or those elders rent the place. Of course, they will have to pay me with their lifespan. Hehehehe.\"\n.\n.\nIt had been a day since Cheng Yuanzhi and Ouyang Feng escaped from Leo's grasp. They reached Phoenix City. When they arrived, the clansmen spotted them and rushed to help their young lord.\n\"YOUNG MASTER OUYANG?!\"\n\"WHO DID THIS TO YOU?!\"\nOuyang Feng still hadn't recovered from Leo's sound attack. He couldn't even stand on his own even though Cheng Yuanzhi fed him several healing pills. Upon arrival, he fainted.\nCheng Yuanzhi's condition was a lot better as he had a superior cultivation base. Still, he was still dizzy, and he had been suffering from a high fever. As soon as he saw the people of the Ouyang Clan, he collapsed on the ground and passed out.\n.\nHalf a day later, Cheng Yuanzhi recovered. He opened his eyes and saw a ceiling of a wooden building. He rolled his eyes to look around.\n\"Ah, you're up.\"\nCheng Yuanzhi heard an old man's voice. He pushed his body to sit up, but his head was so heavy that he couldn't lift it up. He fell back on the pillow.\n\"Take it easy. I know you're injured.\"\nOuyang Ke had been sitting on a chair next to Cheng Yuanzhi's bed. He turned around and picked a medicinal tea from a table and served it to the elder.\nCheng Yuanzhi gratefully accepted the tea. Upon smelling the pleasant odor, his head felt a lot lighter. He managed to sit up and took a sip of the herbal tea.\n\"Tell me,\" Ouyang Ke deeply sighed. \"What happened to my grandchild? Who did it?\"\nCheng Yuanzhi didn't hide anything. He revealed the incident that they had gone through.\n…\nAfter listening to Cheng Yuanzhi's tale, Ouyang Ke's expression was dark.\n\"I'm afraid you ran into the murderer of Ouyang Long. Obviously, you're not his opponent.\"\n\"W-Who is he, grand elder? He concocted immortal pills and endured green lightning tribulation, yet he was strong enough to take on Situ Clan's killing formation head-on. He must be a famous expert, right?\"\nOuyang Ke snorted, \"Famous, my ass. He's just an upstart rogue cultivator. I bet he's just a quasi-immortal that has just come up from a long seclusion. Since he killed Situ Luan, those undying mummies from the Situ Clan won't leave him alone. In fact, I bet the imperial court must have heard about him by now since the Fatui Cult has a deep connection with the third prince.\"\n\"…\"\nOuyang Ke stood up and looked outside the window. He thought of his rival – Situ Nantian. He wondered why that quasi-immortal had been so quiet.\n\"Say, Yuanzhi.\"\n\"Yes, senior?\"\n\"You saw Situ Luan there, right? Have you seen the other people from the Situ Clan?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nAfter Ouyang Ke reminded him, Cheng Yuanzhi recalled that the people from Situ Clan didn't directly join the siege. Instead, they lurked in the forest and in the Magpie City, hiding under Hua Jishan's nose.\nFrom the perspective of the Ouyang Clan and Situ Clan, the Life Sword Sect was a small sect that wasn't worth mentioning. It was a lot weaker than its rival – The Death Sword Sect, which gathered many soul transformation cultivators on their side. On the other hand, Life Sword Sect only had a dozen nascent soul cultivators and Hua Jiashan, who was the sole soul formation cultivator that had been protecting the sect for centuries.\nA 500-year-old soul formation cultivator was trash and talentless. Everybody branded Hua Jiashan as a weakling!\n\"I spotted a few in the forest, but no one made their move. I think they also retreated.\"\n\"I see. Well, just rest. We'll handle this matter later.\"\nOuyang Ke nodded. He then stood up to leave the room. But before Ouyang Ke left, he remembered something, \"Oh, by the way.\"\n\"Yes, senior?\"\n\"Never attack a stronger cultivator regardless of the situation. A wounded tiger is still a tiger. Haven't you learned that?\"\n\"… I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nOuyang Ke quietly left. Meanwhile, Cheng Yuanzhi was relieved. He continued zipping the herbal tea.\n\"…\"\nIt was delicious, strangely delicious. Cheng Yuanzhi felt like he had never drunk anything like this before. It was also weirdly mellow, and he felt like something inside him slowly vanished.\n\"Hmm? Err, eh?\"\nCheng Yuanzhi's consciousness slowly faded. He felt so sleepy for an unknown reason. A few seconds later, he fell asleep… forever.\n.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm After poisoning Cheng Yuanzhi, Ouyang Ke stood in front of the room, scoffing at the incompetency of Ouyang Feng's master. Although his action might offend the Death Sword Sect, he had a thousand explanations to tell their elders.\nAfter all, who in the right mind brought his treasured grandchild into a dangerous place? If he was stupid enough to allow Ouyang Feng to fight a stronger foe, he should have his intelligence reevaluated.\n\"Damn, idiot. He almost killed Feng'er.\"\nOuyang Ke gestured for his subordinates to clean the corpse. Then, he returned to his residence to visit his grandson.\n.\n.\nThe Ouyang Clan wasn't the only one that had survived the ordeal. Many people of the Situ Clan had also witnessed the fight, and they managed to gauge Leo's strength.\nSitu Clan's spies returned to the clan and reported to their masters. The quasi-immortal Situ Nantian also received intel from the Magpie City that Hua Jiashan had a relationship with the mysterious alchemist.\nIn Situ Nantian's house, the elderly man meditated and pinched his fingers. He mumbled to himself as if he had been communicating with someone far away.\n\"What do you mean by FLORIDA? What is that Dao?\"\n\"You don't know?\"\n\"Huh? An elder of the Life Sword Sect has exchanged an essence core for a high-grade flying sword in the black market?! Where the hell did he get that?! Wait, are you sure?!\"\nSitu Nantian opened his eyes as he received many interesting pieces of information. He wanted to visit Leo right away. However, he couldn't go there as he had to prepare for this season's mystic realm expedition.\n\"Tsk! How annoying. I'll go there myself after the expedition.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 70 – Senators Summons Florida Man for Hearing about His Balls\nMagpie City\nThe city was under the jurisdiction of the Life Sword Sect. Commoners of this city always sent their children to take the sect's aptitude tests, hoping to raise their family status. In addition, the sect had a good reputation among commoners as they never imposed taxes on them. Instead, they accepted requests from commoners and provided protection to the local merchants as their primary job.\nAlthough the sect was popular among commoners, their financial status was inferior to other orthodox sects and unorthodox sects. Because of that, they lacked cultivation resources and pills to employ deacons or invite strong cultivators to join them. With fewer resources, their disciples' progress was also slower than the others in their peers.\nHowever, things changed after Leo appeared. The disciples acquired rare pills while many elders purchased essence cores from Leo. With the new resources, their cultivation progress skyrocketed. Most of the disciples, deacons, and elders shut themselves in their abodes, cultivating in frenzy.\nHua Jiashan, Han Hao, and Han Meng were also the same. They used whatever they got from Leo to cultivate. As such, the number of protectors and patrolling cultivators in the city dwindled.\nThis allowed spies and cultivators from other sects and clans to infiltrate the city. Everybody used their organization's secret artifact to hide their presence and Qi while they lurked in the city.\nIn an alley, a group of three hooded golden core cultivators stood in front of a local middle-aged merchant. They paid him a bag of gold coins for the information.\n\"T-Thank you, sir! C-Can I leave?\"\n\"Go.\" One of the cultivators chased the merchant away.\nThe merchant ran away with the bag of gold coins. He widely grinned as his financial issue would be solved for the rest of his life.\nThe cultivators looked at each other. They were baffled by the intel that they had just gathered.\nThis group belonged to the Fatui Cult. They were the backup forces that came with Situ Luan. However, after their master's death, they lurked in the city, gathering information for their cult.\n\"That Florida Man is commissioning the local to bring him… food?\"\nThe captain of the group corrected his subordinate, \"More like, he is gathering resources. If he needs food, he would have requested meat or live animals.\"\n\"But vegetables and fruits?\"\n\"The spies from Situ Clan said that Florida Man might be a quasi-immortal. If that's the case, it explains everything. Any quasi-immortal can convert regular fruits and vegetables into precious herbs and alchemy materials. Since Florida Man is an alchemist, it makes a lot of sense to me.\"\nEverybody nodded in agreement. They took notes and disappeared into the shadow, leaving the city with the information. Their cult would receive this intelligence at night.\nThese people weren't the only ones with the information. As Leo openly commissioned the merchants, the local farmers and travelers heard of it and spread the rumor.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Although the center of attention was on Leo and his actions, many spies noticed irregular activities of the Life Sword Sect's elders as one of them visited the black market in the slum outside the city wall, north of Magpie City.\nAs the black market ran by money, it was easy for spies to acquire information. Everybody soon realized that someone sold a unique contraband item \"Essence Stone\" to the unauthorized auction house.\nAgents from major sects and clans swarmed the auction house to confirm the information. Then, they learned that an elder from Life Sword Sect sneaked the item here and exchanged an essence stone for a high-grade flying sword, which was publically sold in the market for a hundred million spirit stones!\nThe news traveled fast as cultivators had the means to deliver information to their organizations. Within 24 hours, the news reached the ears of the imperial officials.\n.\n.\nThe Yan Empire had been governing the mainland for 500 years ever since the last Sweet Dream Mushroom Incident. The Yan Clan took over the imperial court after the mushroom zombie apocalypse while the Situ Clan cleaned up their mess.\nAlthough the Yan Empire was the ruler of all cultivators on the mainland, not all families were fond of them. The Situ Clan was one of them as they still held a grudge that the Yan Clan took advantage of their ancestors 500 years ago and usurped the throne.\nCurrently, Yan Xiang was the emperor of Yan. He was a quasi-immortal, and he was famous for his talent in cultivation and combat. Ever since he had advanced to the quasi-immortal stage, he had never been defeated in a fight.\nAt Cauliflower City Palace, Yan Xiang sat on the throne, skimming through the scrolls of his subordinates. They were the daily reports of the imperial court, which informed him of the surrounding events around the mainland.\nYan Xiang wore gold dragon robes and an emperor crown. His throne and tables were made of pure gold, but they ceaselessly emitted Yang Element Essence, which was one of the rare elements that no cultivator could cultivate.\nThe emperor was 650 years old, yet his appearance looked the same as a teenager's as he didn't have a string of beard or mustache. He also wore a pair of eyeglasses even though he could see everything clearly. His spotless white jade skin never touched the sunlight, and his physique was average as if he had never worked out before. His long black hair was hidden under the crown.\nWhile the emperor was busy reading the reports, a thousand soul transformation cultivators and soul formation cultivators, dressing as court officials, stood still and lowered their heads in the wide throne room. They waited for their lord to finish examining their jobs.\nAmong the crowd, representatives of the Jianghu Alliance were present, except the representative from the Ouyang Clan. Three alchemy sects, the World Tree Sect, the Sixth Element Sect, and the Pill Union sent their elders to attend as well. Even Death Sword Sect, Fatui Cult, and all unorthodox sects participated in the meeting as these organizations belonged to Yan Xiang's sons.\nEverybody was quiet. Only the sound of Yan Xiang's movements and his scroll were audible in the hall.\nTwo hours later, Yan Xiang finished reading all of the scrolls. He rolled them and put them on the floor, allowing the eunuchs behind him to tidy the place.\n\"I have a question. Chancellor Tang. What is Florida?\"\nChancellor Tang was a thin elderly man, whose gentle smiling face never faded. He looked like a kind grandpa that every child loved. He had short white hair, white eyebrows, and purple pupils, but no beard.\nThe representatives from the Situ Clan flinched. They were the ones who sent the report about a mysterious figure by the Daoist name \"Florida Man\".\nOne of the Situ clansman stepped out of the crowd and stood in the middle of the throne room, presenting himself on the red carpet. He deeply bowed while he cupped his fist.\n\"It's a new Dao, your majesty. This term appears along with the mysterious rogue cultivator that calls himself Florida Man. He shows up near Magpie City of the Life Sword Sect.\"\n\"Hmm. Alright. Is the representative from the Life Sword Sect present?\"\n\"…\"\nNobody uttered a word as Life Sword Sect never sent their representative here. Rather, they didn't know that the emperor demanded one of them there.\nThe crowd sweated profusely. Most of the sects and clans here excommunicated small and weak sects so that the allocable resources from the imperial court would never reach them. Then, their annual share would be naturally increased as a result as long as they contributed something to the court.I think you should take a look at\nThe emperor leaned back and picked up a cup of tea. Coincidentally, it was also pinnacle-grade rejuvenate tea, which the Tang Clan specially concocted for the emperor.\nAfter sipping the tea, Yan Xiang looked around the room. He frowned, \"You know what's funny? This is the first time I heard about Life Sword Sect. I know about the Sword Saint's deeds, but I thought their successors found the Death Sword Sect. So, tell me, people. Why haven't I heard about this sect before?\"\nEverybody was drenched in sweat, especially the people from the Jianghu Alliance. Some of them clattered their teeth as they were afraid of the punishment for their misdeeds.\nThe emperor glared at them, \"I thought I ordered the Jianghu Alliance to gather every representative from all sects in the mainland here so that we can communicate better. In exchange for their trouble, I'll allocate essence stones and spirit stones to their sects and make an exception about the essence stone contraband. If they aren't here, I can't question them when something happens in their territory, can I? They also can't get their hands on our cultivation resources. So, why aren't their representative here?\"\nBeing pressed on something unspeakable, nobody dared to utter a word.\nYan Xiang was not a pushover. He narrowed his eyes as he saw through his subordinates' political schemes. He purposely intensified his murderous aura.\nFacing the quasi-immortal's killing intent, everybody prostrated to the floor and slammed their foreheads to the ground.\n\"Please quell your anger, your majesty!\"\n\"Anger deteriorates your health, your majesty! Please calm down!\"\nYan Xiang was calm, but he hated hypocrite underlings. He bellowed, \"YOU IMBECILS! I ASKED YOU WHY THEY AREN'T HERE!!\"\nThe thousand people in the hall vomited blood. Fortunately, these officials and representatives were strong, and they managed to endure the emperor's pressure.\nOn the other hand, Chancellor Tang was also a quasi-immortal. He didn't feel anything from the pressure, but he lowered his head to Yan Xiang.\n\"If I remember correctly, the Magpie City is located in the southern region, close to the Fatui Cult and Death Sword Sect. It takes only half a day to travel from Cauliflower City to Magpie City. I think they might be suppressed by the neighbors, and they haven't received any help from us.\"\n\"IT HAS BEEN 500 YEARS!!\"\nYan Xiang stood up and threw his teacup at the representative from the Fatui Cult. The glass broke, and the blood came out from the elder's head. However, the cultist, who no longer wore cone-shaped headwear, didn't raise his head.\n\"500 Years. They have been isolated for 500 years! From the first day that our kingdom was founded, my ancestors stressed that every sect and cult, regardless of practices and culture, must be treated equally! We forbid every cultivator from accessing essence stones so that we can allocate them equally to all clans and sects. Then, you can have healthy competition! The side that outperforms the others can get a high status in the court… AND WHAT IS THIS?!\"\nYan Xiang stomped and raised his hand. One of the Fatui Cult's elders and Death Sword Sect's elders floated in the air as their necks were squeezed and raised by invisible hands.\n\"EXPLAIN! WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD OF THE LIFE SWORD SECT BEFORE?!\"\n\"…UGH.\"\n\"H-HELP!\"\nNobody bothered raising their heads to answer. Even the colleagues of the suffering elders didn't dare to speak.\nHowever, a young man in gold robes in the crowd suddenly stood up. He gazed at his father.\n\"Father, this is my fault. I ordered them not to inform you.\"\n\"You…\"\nThe speaker was the third prince, Yan Zhu. He was known as the patron of the Fatui Cult. This year, he was 150 years old, and his cultivation base was in the soul transformation stage.\nYan Zhu explained to his father, \"These days, pretentious small sects emerge everywhere. Just because they call themselves a sect doesn't mean we should acknowledge them as a cultivator organization. Some of them use the name as a cover to exploit people or take advantage of the commoners. Because of that, I ordered the Fatui Cult and Death Sword Sect not to include small sects in the official sects. Unless they can produce a soul transformation cultivator, their organizations remain unofficial.\"\nYan Xiang wasn't happy with his son. He clicked his tongue, \"And let the big cults and sects monopolize my essence stones? How about I cut the supplies from your sects for 500 years? I bet your cult will instantly be disbanded!\"\nHearing that Yan Xiang would cut the supplies to Fatui Cult, Yan Zhu clapped his hands and dispelled his father's power, allowing the two representatives to fall to the ground and breathe.\nThe two tortured men gave Yan Zhu a grateful look. They coughed and continued lowering their heads as usual.\nYan Zhu tried to convince Yan Xiang with a new report that he hadn't told his father yet.\n\"Father, my stance on the small sects and cults remains unchanged. Besides, do you know that Life Sword Sect has illegally smuggled essence stones from a new source and exploited them?\"\n\"What?\" Yan Xiang raised his brow. He thought that all essence stones on the mainland came from the five mystic realm gates, which belonged to the court. He was surprised to hear about a new source.\n\"Where did they get the essence stones?\"\nYan Zhu smirked. He reminded his father about the primary issue.\n\"Florida Man!\"\n\"… Hmm?\"\n\"Remember what you asked? What Florida is might actually be a place or a Dao that relates to the essence stones. Life Sword Sect might know something about it, but they are keeping it a secret.\"\nYan Xiang still didn't believe in his cunning son. He glared at him, \"What's the proof? What if you just blatantly accuse them to protect your cult?\"\nYan Zhu then volunteered, \"Pass me an order, Father. Allow the Fatui Cult and my personal army to move. We'll pay Magpie City a visit and face the Life Sword Sect head-on. We'll question them personally about where they get the essence stones and who Florida Man really is!\"\nThe emperor snorted. He knew what his son cooked from a mile away. At this rate, Yan Zhu would annihilate the Life Sword Sect and kill Florida Man, making them a scapegoat for the unproved crime.\nTo prevent such an unfair activity, Yan Xiang glanced at the representative of the Pill Union and Chancellor Tang. He ordered them.\n\"You two go along with that brat. Chancellor Tang, I give you permission. Accompany them and investigate everybody thoroughly, and I mean EVERYBODY. You may PUNISH ANYONE, INCLUDING MY KIN IF THEY DESERVE IT! I'm allowing you to use your judgment!\"\nYan Zhu's expression turned dark while Chancellor Tang glanced at the third prince. The latter's smile widened as he bowed, \"By your will, your majesty.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 71 – Greta Enraged as Florida Man Cut 2,000 Trees in Front of Official Agents\nHaving subordinates was convenient. Leo had time to work with the terrain clearing, removing iron pine trees from his domain. He also mutated the surrounding grasses and bushes, making more weird items.\nWhile Leo was working, he spotted a hundred silhouettes of people at a distance. They had been hiding behind trees and shades, staying 200 meters away from Leo's shop domain.\nLeo glanced at these people and pretended that he didn't notice them. He carried the last iron pine tree in his shop domain to the empty lot near the junkyard. Then, he proceeded to remove the barks and branches from the logs.\nThe crowd of stalkers moved closer to the shop domain. However, they remained out of the premise as they had no place to hide – All trees and bushes had been removed, and the trenches were too shallow for them to hide during the daytime.\nWhile Leo worked on the tree barks, he sneaked glances at the stalkers several times. He started to get annoyed as they neither attacked him nor declared their intention.\nAfter finishing the 10th log, Leo paused his work. He let the mannequins do their jobs, bringing the tree bark, leaves, nuts, and other resources to the warehouse. As for him, he had another task to do.\nLeo walked toward the southwest of his shop domain. He stepped on the mystic realm portal platform, but he didn't activate it. He proceeded further and reached the boundary of his shop domain for the first time.\nThe crowd that had been hiding and inspecting the mystic realm portal in secret dispersed. They slipped away in the dark and stayed 200 meters away from Leo. The latter noticed their movements, but he didn't pursue them.\nAfter crossing the boundary, Leo came across a blue forest. This area got contaminated by the iron pine trees' aura, and they turned into something similar to spirit grasses. However, as Leo got closer and touched them, they blackened and evolved into iron pine trees.\nLeo snorted. He quietly uprooted the trees and threw them over the portal platform as if he was a superman quarterback, treating the tree logs as a ball.\n\"…\"\nThe crowd remained silent. They backed away while they continued to observe Leo.\nLeo also noticed their intentions. He kept clearing land, removing every tree he touched. This time, he ignored small bushes as they took too long to remove.\nOne hour later, Leo successfully removed 200 iron pine trees, clearing one-third of an acre's worth of land. He inwardly laughed as he thought of the ancient tree lovers back in the modern days. They would have cried bloody tears if they had seen Leo's deeds that day.\nAs the land was partly cleared, the spies from various clans could no longer hide close to the mystic realm portal. Still, they quietly observed Leo's power and took notes of his actions.\nUnfortunately for them, Leo had another plan in mind. After he rearranged the 200 logs north of the portal platform, the three warehouse mannequins came to survey the area. They masterfully uprooted bushes and immortal grass, piling them nearby. Leo also returned to remove other trees.\nThe crowd started to notice the trend. They clicked their tongues and relocated themselves.\nLeo entered beast mode that day and almost deforested the Sword Saint Forest. When the Sun went down, Leo finished uprooting the 2,000th tree. The logs piled up everywhere in the shop domain, and the workshop mannequins never stopped working.\nWhen Leo stopped working, he admired the scenery around his shop domain by jumping 500 meters into the sky. He looked around and laughed as no tree existed near the boundary of his domain anymore.\nWith fewer places to hide, the stalkers were forced to keep a distance from the shop domain and sensitive structures, such as the farmlands and the mystic realm platform. Still, Leo was not satisfied with the result. He aimed to remove every tree, creating a border surrounding the domain.\nLeo snorted and returned to the store and called it a day. He yawned and threw himself on the bed.\n.\nAt midnight, a wooden mannequin unlocked the front door and entered the store. It looked around for a moment and entered Leo's bedroom. Noticing that Leo was sleeping soundly, it stood next to him and leaned closer to his face.\nAs the mannequin couldn't talk, it stood there, menacingly staring at Leo's sleeping face with two red lenses.\n*SNORE*\n\"…\"\nThe mannequin tilted its head. It gazed at Leo's mouth and poked it with his finger.\nLeo didn't react or move.\n\"…\"\nThe mannequin straightened his back. It quietly walked out of the store and picked up the bucket of Cat's mutated water. Then, it came back with the bucket.\nUpon getting back to the room, the mannequin didn't splash the water on Leo. Instead, it gently poured the mutated water into Leo's mouth, one drop at a time.\nIt continued adding water for the entire night.\n.\n.\nYAWN\nLeo returned from his dream world, and he could feel his real body. He stretched, readying his mind for a new day.\nMLEM-MLEM\nFor an unknown reason, his mouth was strangely moist. His throat wasn't as dry as usual. Moreover, the bitter mint taste got stuck in his mouth.\nLeo squinted his eyebrows as he recognized this scent. It smelled like Cat's saliva. Because of the unusual experience, he opened his eyes.\n*Insert Jojo ambient sound here*\nThe creepy face of the third alchemy workshop's mannequin was two centimeters away from Leo's face. It tilted its head 45 degrees while its red eyes shone.\n\"…\"\nLeo didn't utter a sound as he wasn't afraid of ghosts or monsters. He was simply speechless by the first sight in the morning. After allowing his brain to process information, Leo gently pushed the wooden doll's face away and sat up.\n\"Are you out of containers?\"\nThe mannequin repeatedly nodded.\n\"Fine. I'll get more for you-\"\nCLANK-CLANK\nAs Leo got out of bed while he spoke, his foot accidentally kicked a certain empty bucket. Leo looked down and found the wooden bucket, which was reserved for Cat's drinking water.\nLeo licked the ceiling of his gum. He thought of the nasty smell of Cat's saliva and connected the dots.\n\"…\"\nLeo was not angry at the mannequin. Instead, he thought that Cat pranked him. He facepalmed.\nBOOM-BOOM-BOOM\n\"MEOW!!\"\nMeanwhile, someone had been searching for her water bucket. Cat smacked the front door and the display windows while screaming, calling Leo to come out.\nPFFT\nLeo snickered and picked up the bucket, toothbrush, and toothpaste. He then led the mannequin out of the store.\nAnother slow and peaceful morning continued.\n.\n.\nAt noon, Han Hao traveled from Magpie City to Leo's store on foot. He brought along 20 outer disciples from the sect to help Leo.\nWhen they arrived, they were stunned by the cleared land. The Sword Saint Boulder became a part of Leo's domain as the surrounding trees were gone. It became a landmark, informing them that they were in Leo's territory.\nHan Hao bitterly smiled as he couldn't complain about what Leo had done to the sacred place. He quietly led the young cultivators to the store.\nAlong the way, Han Hao ran into Wu Buyi, who had been concocting pills in front of his house. When their eyes met, Wu Buyi gestured to him with his eyes that he was busy.I think you should take a look at\nHan Hao was an understanding man. He turned around and informed the group, \"Don't disturb the elder. Follow me.\"\nThe disciples gulped and quietly saluted Wu Buyi. Then, they proceeded to the front of the store.\nAmong the crowd, Gao Yan also tagged along. He wanted to greet his mentor, but Wu Buyi didn't bother looking at him. In addition, upon seeing so many buildings and farms, Gao Yan was astonished that he forgot what he should speak to his master.\nThe mannequins still ran around like nothing had happened. The farmer bots struggled to collect potatoes in the farms while three logistic mannequins carried huge logs and potatoes to their perspective storehouses.\nWhile the disciples gawked at the strange buildings and scenery, a mannequin with a yellow jacket and a protection helmet came out from a five-meter-wide road between the store and Wu Buyi's house. It walked past the group and picked up a piece of wooden branch and black iron pine leaves on the ground. Then, it carried them to the back of the store building.\nThe disciples observed them with interest. One of them peeped into the alley road and found alchemy workshop buildings behind the store.\n\"Wow. There's an alchemy section! Gao Yan, you're lucky!\"\nGao Yan followed his friend's gaze and found the first and the second workshop. He widely grinned, \"I guess I have a place to train.\"\n\"Lucky you!\"\nHan Hao coughed, \"Be quiet.\"\n\"…Whoops.\"\nAfter shutting the disciples' mouths, Han Hao deeply sighed and looked around as he couldn't find the monster plant. Instead, he detected several life signatures in the forest in the distance, and they had been observing them.\n'Why are there so many lurkers around here? How many clans dispatched their agents here?'\nHan Hao thought of the previous incident when Leo slaughtered the raiders. He wondered if they were related to the Fatui Cult, Ouyang Clan, or the Situ Clan. Han Hao was also afraid of the potential imperial court's agents.\nAfter shaking his head and getting rid of unnecessary thoughts, Han Hao knocked at the door.\n\"Senior Florida Man, I have brought you helpers.\"\nAs soon as Han Hao made some noise, a certain monster plant came out from the granary, which was located directly behind Wu Buyi's house.\nCat peeked at the crowd while she was in the building. When she spotted someone she knew, Cat came out and immediately extorted them for nom-nom tax.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"… It's you again.\" Han Hao laughed and ejected a dead horse from his spatial ring. He tossed the carcass to her.\nCat caught the corpse with her chomper mouth and grinned. She receded back to the granary and disappeared.\nThe disciples trembled in fear as some of them had never seen such a monster before. Only Gao Yan seemed indifferent to Cat.\n\"G-Grand Elder Han, what in the spirit's mercy is that?!\"\nHan Hao rolled his eyes, \"Senior Florida Man's pet.\"\n\"P-P-PET!? He's keeping a monster as a pet?!\"\n\"Get used to it. Y'all signed up to work here for spirit stones, and you'll soon live here. If you don't wanna get eaten, you'd better learn and follow Senior Florida Man's instructions.\"\nAgain, the disciples gulped. Only Gao Yan inwardly laughed at his colleagues.\nA few minutes later, Leo came out from the store building. Toothbrush foam stained his mouth and beard as he brushed his teeth 8th time today.\n\"Oh, it's you.\"\nLeo looked at the crowd behind Han Hao. Noticing a familiar face, Leo grinned.\n\"Good to see you again, Gao Yan. Have you gotten better?\"\nGao Yan dryly laughed, \"I haven't learned much from my master. He keeps disappearing.\"\n\"Oh, my bad. He has been working here.\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody glanced at Wu Buyi, who was still busy with his cauldron. But while everybody paid attention to him, Wu Buyi finished his batch of pills.\nBOOM\n15 high-grade yang flame dans came out. However, Wu Buyi was not satisfied with his work. He mumbled to himself while he looked at the open scroll on the ground, which he had taken notes from what he had learned from observing the mannequin alchemists.\n\"My essence is lacking. I don't have all the necessary essence like those golems. Also, something isn't right during the merging process. I don't have enough Qi to sustain the other half of the pot. Damn, alchemy is hard!\"\nWu Buyi grumbled and looked up. Then, his eyes met with Gao Yan.\n\"Disciple! You've come at the right time. Come with me! We'll go and learn the new concoction method from a grandmaster golem! Bring your goddamn notes!\"\n\"Eh?\"\nGao Yan couldn't even react. Wu Buyi dragged him to the first alchemy workshop to learn the techniques by observing.\nLeo and Han Hao stared at them and shook their heads in unison. Then, they proceeded with their talk.\n\"So, are they the workers? I don't have to pay them, right?\" Leo seized up the people behind Han Hao. The crowd was embarrassed, and they lowered their heads.\n\"Yes, senior. The sect will provide the salary. But if you can, please provide them basic needs, such as a place to rest or cultivate. If better, please give them some bonuses, such as some of your pills.\"\n\"Eh, I'm not a cheapskate. I have plenty of element grain pills and rejuvenate tea to feed them for a thousand years.\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao was inwardly envious of the disciples. He gulped and whispered, \"T-Then, can I have a few bottles of rejuvenate tea for the trouble?\"\nLeo sneered and walked back to the store. He then came out with four bottles of cold tea.\nHan Hao received them in glee. But when he noticed the quality and the color, he was surprised.\n\"Wait a second, senior. Isn't your tea…THE PINNACLE GRADE?!\"\nLeo puffed his chest, \"Damn straight. My tea is the pinnacle of all tea! Hahahaha!\"\n.\n.\n\"…\"\nStanding in front of the third workshop cauldron was the alchemy mannequin. He overheard the conversation and turned his head 180 degrees. Then, his eyes gleamed as if he wanted to protest Leo that he made them.\n.\nPinnacle Grade Rejuvenate Tea\n- Evolve bone marrow and blood cells.\n- Decrease physical age by 20 years per liter.\n- Increase metabolism by 100% for 480 hours.\n- Remove cancer cells.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 72 – Florida Man Mistakes Emperor Envoy as Ohio Man, Offends the Officials\nLeo guided the disciples and Han Hao to the store's ground floor.\n\"Welcome to Narnia,\" he cackled.\n\"…\"\nThe crowd dropped their jaws as the space in the building was massive, and there was a second floor. They believed that it was as big as the entire cleared land.\nHowever, one thing puzzle them – Aside from a partitioned room, the rest of the store was empty, including the other 19 blank rooms.\n\"Senior, something is wrong with your building. How come it's empty?\" Han Hao couldn't help but ask.\n\"That's because the workers will be very busy here.\"\nLeo looked at the young men behind Han Hao. He counted their heads. Coincidentally, there were 19 of them, which was equal to the number of available partitioned rooms.\n\"See the empty lots?\" Leo pointed at the empty rooms, \"These will be the place for you to stay. Pick one to be your temporary home. I'll build a proper abode for you later. By the way, you have 100 breaths to unload your belongings and pick your place. Gather here when you're done.\"\n\"EH?!\"\nThe disciples were taken aback. They thought that they would have to build their own shelters or live in the forest. Instead, they got a place to sleep under the rooftop.\nBecause of the time limit, the disciples started running around to choose their place. As they wore straw sandals and cloth shoes, they brought a lot of mud and dirt from the forest to the store, dirtying the floor.\nLeo glanced at the floor. Then, his expression was dark. A moment later, he beamed Han Hao with a bright smile as he remembered that he got free henchman.\nHan Hao noticed the creepy smile. He cupped his fist and excused himself, \"Since I've delivered the manpower, I'll be taking my leave.\"\n\"I see. I won't send you off. Be careful on the way back. There are too many eyes around here.\"\n\"… I can tell.\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Han Hao left the building and flew back to the sect.\n.\nAfter the disciples finished picking their places, they gathered in front of Leo. They were ready to work and earn their keep.\nLooking at the young men, Leo summoned their status menu to see their names and lifespan. They also got to see their value for the first time.\n<Remaining Lifespan: 137 Years…>\n<Remaining Lifespan: 171 Years…>\n<Remaining Lifespan: 145 Years…>\nTheir lifespan varied, depending on their cultivation base and talent. As most of them were still Qi Condensation cultivators, none of them surpassed 200.\nLeo thought of Yao Qiqi as that girl who had better potential than these disciples. He wondered how much lifespan she would have if once she reached the pinnacle of her potential.\nPA\nLeo clapped his hands once to remove the thoughts and get the disciples' attention. He briefed them about the nature of this store.\n\"As you can see, everybody has a lifespan, and I can let you see them. My store also uses lifespan as a currency. Oh, don't worry. We accept spirit stones too, but my items are very expensive.\"\nThe disciples dropped their jaws and gawked at the floating system screens in front of them. They also compared their lifespans with their colleagues, and they made fun of each other for having fewer years to live.\n\"AHEM!\"\nThe disciples stopped making fun of their friends and looked at Leo after the cough. Then, Leo resumed the briefing.\n\"For now, I want you to start mobbing the floor. I'll provide you with the tools, of course. Also, next time you enter the store, take off ya goddamn shoes!\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody looked at the floor and found their dirty footprints on the white marble floor. They gulped as the mud and dirt were everywhere.\nMeanwhile, Leo secretly purchased mops and water buckets. Then, he passed them to the disciples.\n\"Start cleaning. I'll be back in a few hours. Oh, if you need water, you can get some in the public toilet next to the storeroom, aka my freaking bedroom. Oh, nobody should be in my room, or you're fired.\"\n\"…\"\nThe public toilet that Leo had longed for appeared along with the new rooms. It came with five unisex toilet stalls and two face-washing basins. A water faucet for utility also existed under the basins, and it provided tap water even though Leo had never installed any water system.\nAs the disciples were confused, Leo led them to the toilet and pointed at the faucet under the basins. He showed an example by pushing the lever.\nZAAA\nClean water came out, and the disciples were shocked.\n\"HUH?!\"\n\"A WATER ARTIFACT?!\"\n\"But I don't sense Qi! HOW?!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes as these country bumpkins had never seen a running water system. He felt like he had time-traveled to the medieval era.\n\"Instead of getting surprised by everything, get your mops wet and start cleaning! DON'T FORGET TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES! THIS AIN'T MURICA HOUSE!\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody wanted to retort that putting shoes on and off was troublesome. Still, they complied with the order and cleaned their feet with the tap water. Then, they started working.\n.\nAfter two hours of cleaning the ground floor and the second floor, Leo gathered the disciples for another task. He taught them the daily routine.\n\"This is the first day, so there won't be a lot of work. Still, I'm gonna teach you what you will be doing every day from now on. First, I want you to look outside the window.\"\nLeo guided the disciples to the display window on the second floor, which had a better view of the farmlands. The disciple followed Leo to the second floor and gazed outside.I think you should take a look at\nOn the farmlands, three mannequins awkwardly harvested giant potatoes from the field. Then, they witnessed the massive crops that the golems pulled from the ground.\n\"I-Is that really a potato?! For real?!\"\nLeo nodded, \"Real potato, damn straight.\"\n\"… Wow.\"\n\"Those wood golems are working non-stop, but they can't harvest everything by themselves. Because of that, helping those golems will be your daily job. Now, put on the boots and follow me outside.\"\nLeo provided them with rubber boots, which he had bought from the online store. The disciples admired the texture of the orange boots and put them on. Some of them laughed as the boots were a lot bigger than their feet.\nThe crowd visited the farmland. Then, Leo ordered them to help the mannequin farmers.\nThe disciples were stronger than average adult men. They dug giant potatoes out, and they carried them to the granary. With their help, Leo managed to clean up the three farms of potatoes, allowing him to plant something else.\nLeo ordered the first golem to continue growing potatoes. The second farm was allocated to grow tomatoes, while the third was assigned to plant chilies.\nAs soon as the mannequin dropped the tomato seeds and chili seeds, the timer came out.\n23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 57 Seconds…\nStrangely, both types of crops had the same timer. Leo was relieved that it took a long time to grow as his granary was almost full even though Cat was there to sabotage his food reserve.\nAfter the potatoes were dealt with, Leo allowed the disciples to have their free time to wander around. However, he refrained from getting out of the domain boundary as the stalkers were still lurking in the woods.\nThe disciples cheered and rushed toward the alchemy workshops behind the store.\n.\n.\nThe lurking stalkers from the Ouyang Clan stared at the disciples while they smirked. They believed they had found Leo's weaknesses.\nOne of them suggested to their colleagues, \"Let's take a few of them to the clan and blackmail that alchemist.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nEverybody let out a long sigh as they could finally go home after this mission.\nThe Ouyang's spies weren't the only ones with this idea. The Fatui cultists among the lurkers also had an eye on the disciples and Gao Yan. They also communicated with their superior officers in the Cauliflower City.\n\"We've discovered Florida Man's weaknesses. We shall take some of his disciples back to the cult.\"\nOn the other hand, the Situ Clan's agents were wary of Leo. They consulted with their people for hours before Situ Nantian gave them an order. One of them relayed the instruction to his colleague.\n\"Grand Elder has given us a decree. Do not touch the disciples. Let the foolish people from the Ouyang Clan and the Fatui Cult take the brunt. Once they're gone, we will try to form an amicable relationship with the alchemist and get on his good side. If that doesn't work, we'll think of another approach.\"\nAlthough Situ Clan had a close tie with the Fatui Cult, they weren't friendly allies. Situ Nantian made a clear stance that they were simply a group of customers to their clan, and they didn't need to avenge their comrades.\nThe Situ Clan's agents received the order and withdrew from the area.\n.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nWhile the lurkers from three major organizations made their moves, another group of underlings arrived at the Sword Saint Forest. They rushed toward the cleared area and hid at the border.\nThey were the agents of the imperial court. Moreover, they brought big shots along with them. Among the nascent soul cultivators, two of them were absurdly stronger than the others.\nOne of them was the aide of Yan Zhu, the third prince. He went by the name Ye Tianxie, and he was a soul transformation cultivator. Another one was none other than the Imperial Chancellor Tang Xuan, the quasi-immortal.\nThey had one purpose – investigating the new source of essence stones.\nChancellor Tang didn't bother hiding. He took a long stride and walked out from the shades, approaching the store. His followers hesitated for a moment, but they also came out. Everybody ignored the spirit grasses around them and enter the store domain.\n.\n.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo stopped watching over the disciples. He noticed a large group of people coming out from the South, and they had fancy clothes.\nThe kind-looking old man in front of the group reminded him of his uncle from Ohio. They used to visit a shooting range together and got banned because his uncle accidentally shot the ceiling by mistake. In addition, one of them had a similar rainbow aura to him.\n\"A comrade?\" Leo brightly smiled. \"Or dumbass morons? Either way, welcome!\"\nLeo turned toward the new guests and waited for them to get closer. The crowd crossed the farmland field and arrived in front of the store unhindered.\nChancellor Tang gazed at Leo for a moment. Then, he announced and brought out a golden scroll from his spatial ring.\n\"Accept the emperor's decree!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo was confused. He stood still, waiting for the old man to finish his sentence.\nHe didn't know. According to the custom, he was supposed to kneel as the scroll represented the emperor's presence. Not bowing to the decree was equivalent to an insult to the monarchy.\nThe crowd behind Chancellor Tang was enraged as Leo didn't show them courtesy. They unsheathed their swords and pointed at Leo's face.\n\"KNEEL, PEASANT!\"\n\"KNOW YOUR PLACE!\"\nLeo widened his eyes in astonishment. A few seconds later, it turned into a bashful smile.\n\"Well, well, well. This is going to be exciting again. Welcome. Please continue.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 73 – Florida Man Trainee Murders Police Officer Using Pokemon\nChancellor Tang Xuan and Ye Tianxie gave Leo a meaningful look. As the latter didn't kneel, they took it as a clear sign that Leo had no intention to submit to the Yan Empire.\nYe Tianxie was enraged, but his expression was emotionless. He calmly warned Leo.\n\"Please show respect to the emperor's presence and his decree. Otherwise, we will take you as a rebel, and we will apprehend you, sir.\"\nHearing the warning, Leo was overjoyed. He laughed, \"Come and apprehend me. I won't bow my head to a stupid paper!\"\n\"…\"\nYe Tianxie deeply sighed. He wished he could kill Leo right now, but his cultivation base was lower than the quasi-immortal stage. He swallowed his frustration and glanced at the Chancellor.\nChancellor Tang noticed the glance. He slightly shook his head as he had no intention of provoking the mysterious expert. He continued reading the decree even though Leo refused to kneel.\n\"Hear the decree. The emperor has noticed that you are in possession of contraband items \"Essence Stones\". By the imperial laws, section 29, all sources of essence stones belong to the imperial court, and all cultivators and citizens must hand over their essence stones to the imperial court officials if they acquire them from an unauthorized source. If refused to comply, the carriers of essence stones will be treated and prosecuted as a rebel, and their seven generations will be executed.\"\n\"Oh, cool. What a nice empire. Picking up a stone from a roadside can get your seven generations killed. Superb!\"\nLeo slowly clapped and snickered in a good mood. Because of his interruption, the officials and agents behind Chancellor Tang and Ye Tianxie gnashed their teeth and circulated their Qi, preparing to strike Leo.\nChancellor Tang deeply sighed and raised one hand to stop them. His other hand still held the paper as he continued reading.\n\"Still, because Life Sword Sect has never attended any annual meeting in the imperial palace, any related crime committed by the local cultivators in the Life Sword Sect's territory will not be prosecuted. Instead, the emperor wishes to invite you and representatives from Life Sword Sect to the imperial palace so that he can issue you a permit to possess essence stones!\"\nYe Tianxie and the others were stunned as they had never heard of this before. When they were in the throne room, the emperor didn't mention anything about the exception.\nNoticing the people's expressions, Chancellor Tang sneered at them. He smiled at Leo.\n\"Secondly, as Death Sword Sect and the Fatui Cult have been secretly and indirectly suppressing the Life Sword Sect, the emperor believes that the sect has a legitimate reason to request compensation. Therefore, the emperor temporarily grants the Life Sword Sect and Cultivator Florida Man the permit to possess unauthorized essence stones for one year, and they are allowed to monopolize the new sources of essence stones until the next annual meeting. This condition persists until further changes. And that's the end of the decree. Please receive the edict.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nYe Tianxie was frustrated. He couldn't believe that the emperor's edict was real as the emperor's order back then was different. He snatched the scroll from Chancellor Tang's hand and reread everything.\nUnfortunately, everything in the scroll was exactly as Chancellor Tang had read. No word was exaggerated.\n\"How can this be?! I thought the emperor ordered us to kill him and seize his essence stones!\" Ye Tianxie protested.\nChancellor Tang scoffed, \"Are you questioning the emperor?\"\n\"N-No…\" Ye Tianxie wasn't Chancellor Tang's opponent. He receded and lowered his head. Still, as he worked for the third prince, he was dissatisfied with this decree.\nMeanwhile, someone else was also unhappy. Leo's expression was dark as the guests over here came in peace instead of trying to be a cliché bully. He deeply sighed.\n\"I'm disappointed,\" Leo complained.\n\"Hmm? Why are you disappointed, fellow Daoist?\" Chancellor Tang didn't understand Leo. He tried his best to protect the Life Sword Sect and give them a way out of the political strife, yet Leo didn't play along.\nLeo waved his hand, \"Forget it. I ain't going to the imperial court whatsoever. My essence stones belong to me, and I won't hand them over. The same for the essence stones in the Life Sword Sect, you can't have them.\"\nChancellor Tang grinned and reminded Leo, \"The emperor won't force you. In fact, he has no intention to antagonize you. He simply sends me here to investigate the new source of essence stones. But if you're unhappy with the imperial court's laws, you can always share your opinion with me, and I can report back to the emperor. In fact, if I want to, I can even change the laws.\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nThis annoyed Leo more. He wished these guests would attack him so that he could steal their lifespan. But judging from how the old man behaved and his tone, the plan was impossible.\nOn the other hand, the crowd was raring to attack Leo at any moment. Their red faces, squinted brows, and bulging blood vessels on their faces said it all.\nLeo stared at the angry crowd and the friendly old man. Looking at the polarized expressions, he suddenly had an idea. He mischievously grinned and summoned lifespan status menus for them to see. Leo also verified their identities.\nDING\nStatus menu screens appeared in front of the angry visitors. Chancellor Tang and Ye Tianxie could finally see their remaining life.\n.\nName: Tang Xuan\nAge: 1,209\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,720 years, 10 Months, 12 Days, 9 Hours, 37 Minutes\n.\nName: Ye Tianxie\nAge: 211\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,789 Years, 9 Months, 15 Days, 12 Hours, 21 Minutes\n.\nLooking at their ages and their lifespan, Leo was surprised and amused. His respect toward the thin old man was raised to another level as this person managed to live a thousand years. As for Ye Tianxie, Leo didn't think much about him other than a fat pig waiting to be slaughtered.\nThe cultivators behind Ye Tianxie and Chancellor Tang were flabbergasted. They looked at their remaining time ticking down while they tried to touch the hologram screens.\nOn the other hand, Tang Xuan revealed a faint smile and deeply exhaled. He laughed and uttered, \"Wow. My secret is exposed. This is quite a useful technique. I wish my clan and the imperial court could use this ability 1,000 years ago. This would have made our lives a lot easier during the war.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo heard something interesting again. Although he wished to ask Tang Xuan what happened 1,000 years ago, he didn't bother asking as it was not the time to learn about their backstories and history. He coughed to get their attention.\n\"Well, let me introduce myself. My Daoist name is FLORIDA MAN, and I run a lifespan general store. We trade rare herbs, essence stones, and rare items for lifespan. I hope you understand what I'm doing here.\"\nFinally getting Leo's introduction, Tang Xuan merrily laughed and saluted, \"Friend Florida Man. Likewise, I hope we can have an amicable relationship. The imperial court is not your enemy, and we will never harm you.\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, Leo inwardly cursed Tang Xuan for trying to pacify the situation. Still, Leo baited them into attacking him by revealing one of his bestselling items. He pulled out an essence stone from his pants pocket.\n\"!!!\"\nThe crowd glared at Leo when the essence stone came out. Unlike the essence stones in the palace or their clan, which passed through many hands and contained thin energy, Leo's stone was brimmed with elemental essence as if its energy had never been extracted. Even Tang Xuan was stunned to see such a fresh stone.\nLeo threw a bomb at them, \"I'm selling this stone for ten years of lifespan. Anybody wants to buy it?\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nLeo burst into laughter in his mind as he added one zero to the price tag. Since these guys ruined Leo's mood, he returned the favor by ruining their opportunity to get his cheap items.\nHe didn't realize that it was still too cheap for the local's standards.\nYe Tianxie drooled as he was tempted to buy the stone. Still, he and his followers were disciplined, and they instantly suppressed their desire. The former secretly communicated with the crowd.I think you should take a look at\n'Do not purchase the item or we might fall into his trap. The stone is still illegal. If we buy them, he will blackmail us later that we also possess illegal items.'\nEverybody except Tang Xuan nodded. The latter glanced at his colleagues and shook his head in disappointment. He signed and continued conversing with Leo.\n\"I assume this stone is from the new source of essence stones, correct?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Probably.\"\n\"Then, could you tell me which mystic realm you got the stones from? I don't sense a spirit mine or a quarry around here.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's lips twitched. His inner self yearned to flex these guys by converting a spirit stone into an essence stone in front of them. However, his logical thoughts prevented Leo from showing off and doing something stupid.\nAs Leo remained silent, Tang Xuan teased him.\n\"If I have to guess, did you, by chance, discover a way to successfully convert spirit stones into essence stones? I heard Celestial Stage Immortals could use every element in the world and could magically terraform wasteland into lush forests. Are you one of them?\"\n\"…\"\nBullseye\nLeo maintained his pokerface, but his hands were already sweaty.\nSeeing that Leo didn't react, Tang Xuan laughed and changed the subject to decrease the tension, \"Do you have any other items to sell, Friend Florida Man?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo gestured and invited them into the building. Tang Xuan brightly smiled and followed Leo, entering the general store.\n.\nAlthough Leo and Tang Xuan already entered the building, the others still lingered in front of the store. Ye Tianxie and his men were still reluctant to compromise.\n\"Look at this!\"\n\"Wow. This is so cool!\"\nWhile they were standing idly in front of the store, they heard loud noises from the disciples in the alley. Ye Tianxie and his men gazed in their direction and found several disciples and mannequin golems in the field, chatting and holding thorn vines that they picked up from the junkyard.\nAs soon as they noticed the thorn vines, the men's eyes gleamed. They sensed raw Qi from the items in their hands, and they seemed to be raw materials for good weapons.\n\"Hey, aren't those low-grade treasures?\"\n\"Probably. I used to see that in a wood-type mystic realm. An elder from Amazonian Sanctuary turned it into a high-graded weapon. Many clans tried to buy it off her hand and offered her a hundred million spirit stones, but she refused.\"\n\"Really? Then, aren't those 100 million spirit stones in front of our eyes?\"\n\"Yeah, I think so.\"\nThe crowd smirked. Ye Tianxie also sneered at the disciples as they could take advantage of them.\nWithout hesitation, Ye Tianxie strode toward the group of disciples. He flared the badge of an imperial official and shouted.\n\"YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR POSSESSING A CONTRABAND ITEM! SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY, OR YOUR THREE GENERATIONS WILL BE EXECUTED!\"\n\"W-What?!\"\nThe disciples took several steps backward in shock and stared at Ye Tianxie in confusion. They looked at each other as they couldn't understand.\nAs Ye Tianxie took the lead, his men laughed and kicked the ground. They surrounded the group of disciples and snatched the thorn vines from their hands.\n\"GIVE THEM HERE!\"\n\"NOOO!!\"\nThe men kicked the young disciples away and admired the stolen materials. The adults got 10 thorn vines, and they immediately stored them in their spatial rings.\nThe commotion was loud enough for another adult to notice. Wu Buyi, who was in the middle of teaching Gao Yan about the workshop, heard the noise and came over. Then, he saw the scene of adults stealing items from kids.\n\"HEY!\"\nEven though Wu Buyi was just a nascent soul cultivator, he wasn't afraid of the crowd of cultivators with the same cultivation stage. He stood in front of the disciples and ejected a cauldron from his spatial ring, preparing for combat.\n\"RETURN THE KIDS' WEAPONS, OR ELSE!\"\nYe Tianxie found Wu Buyi amusing. The group of nascent soul cultivators also sneered and mocked Wu Buyi.\n\"What are you going to do about it? Throwing the cauldron at me?\"\n\"Hahaha! Don't say that. We're not supposed to offend the alchemist. It's common sense that we can't provoke them… unless it's self-defense.\"\n\"Heh. Right. Come on, alchemist. Attack me! Try it! We'd love to SELF-DEFENSE and ACCIDENTALLY kill you! After we're done with you, we'll sell those kids as slaves since they offend the imperial officials!\"\nHearing the crowd's obnoxious taunt, Wu Buyi was enraged. He glanced at the granary and noticed that a certain plant had been eavesdropping on the conversation. Their eyes met.\nWu Buyi's mouth curved up. He looked at the imperial agents.\nSuddenly, Wu Buyi shouted.\n\"NOM-NOM TIME, PLANT! THESE MEN ARE YOUR FOOD!\"\nBOOM\nAs soon as Wu Buyi declared, Cat jumped out from the granary and rushed Ye Tianxie's men.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!!\"\nCHOMP!\nCat was faster than before. In a blink of an eye, the upper torso of the guy near the granary disappeared into Cat's mouth, leaving only a bloody lower torso and legs.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nCat gleefully chewed the cultivator and killed him in one bite. Her skin absorbed the lifespan of the victim, and her strength soared.\n\"Nom-Nom?\"\nLooking at the crowd, Cat maliciously grinned. Wu Buyi also jumped and stood on Cat's head, pointing his finger at the hostile visitors.\n\"NOM-NOM TIME, PLANT! LET'S EAT!\"\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!!\"",

Because of their reflex and common sense, they evaluated Cat's strength first. Ye Tianxie was the same.\nEverybody soon discovered Cat's cultivation base.\n\"Fourth stage monster?! Be careful! This monster is as strong as a nascent soul cultivator!\"\nAlthough a nascent soul cultivator was considered a 5th stage cultivator, they could only defeat 4th stage monsters or weaker as a monster's standard was stronger than cultivators by one tier - Monsters were physically stronger than humans by nature, and they could defeat cultivators with a higher cultivation base.\nFacing the huge monster, they stopped mocking Wu Buyi. They brought out their treasures and artifacts. Floating spears, talismans, jade emblems, daggers, mirrors, and dishes orbited around their masters.\nHad Leo seen them, he would have questioned their sense and weapon choice as some of them brought DISHES to battle. He would have been confused that they had come here to beg for food.\nUnfortunately, Wu Buyi didn't have Florida Man's mentality. As a local cultivator, he knew exactly what those flying dishes could do.\n\"Shameless bastards! Bringing out artifacts while ganging on us?! Dishes of Flame Negation on a plant monster? They won't work!\"\nHearing Wu Buyi, the crowd laughed at him, \"Who said that we brought the Flame Negation Dishes to suppress the monster? They're for you!\"\nFive of the cultivators formed a hand incantation and pointed at Wu Buyi. All dishes faced him and emitted a blue Chinese character \"Water\". The floating character then shone and fired a blue beam at Wu Buyi.\nWu Buyi narrowed his eyes as he prepared to dodge. However, Cat suddenly jumped and opened her mouth.\nZAAAA\nThe beam entered her chomper mouth and was transformed into freshwater as she converted the water element Qi into physical water. She swallowed them and burped. The next second, her skin became glossy and moist.\n\"…\"\nThe nascent soul cultivators blankly stared at Cat as they didn't think this through. They forgot that water element attacks benefited plant-based monsters. Therefore, using water-based artifacts on Cat was the same as watering a tree.\n\"Fool! Use fire artifacts and dao avatars on the monster!\" Ye Tianxie commanded the men.\n\"B-But alchemists are fire masters! That man will steal our Qi if we do!\"\nThe agents had the experience of dealing with alchemists in combat. As they primarily cultivated Fire Element Qi to use in alchemy, they were considered the strongest when they faced fire attacks. Some of the alchemist masters even had a domineering Daoist title, such as Phoenix Flame or Inferno Master as no fire attacks could harm them.\n\"… Tsk!\"\nAnnoyed by his men's incompetency, Ye Tianxie pushed the crowd aside and faced Cat and Wu Buyi himself. He unsheathed his sword and pointed at them.\n\"Kneel and hand over everything in your possession. If you beg for forgiveness right now, I'll give you a quick death!\"\n\"Ah, yes. The usual threat. This is why I decline the imperial court's invitation,\"\nWu Buyi sneered and summoned his dao avatar. A spirit of a moss-cladded hand and a fire wisp appeared behind him. Then, they entered his cauldron, transforming it into a burning hand in green flame.\nCat's human part looked up as she hated fire.\n\"…Meow.\"\nWu Buyi laughed at Cat, \"Don't worry, kid. My green flame has both flame and wood attributes. It can't harm any tree or plant. Instead, it will only make you stronger!\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat cheered as she was relieved. She focused and utilized her dao avatar.\nThe infant spirit returned to her body and merged with her. Then, the rainbow aura and radiation of Leo that she had been collecting emanated from her eyes.\nAt the same time, Wu Buyi poured the green flame into Cat, enhancing her power and her cultivation base!\nFeeling the surge of new energy, Cat rode the momentum and unleashed her trump card.\n\"MYAAAAA!!\"\nRUMBLE\nThe attached humanoid torso on the chomper's head grew up. She became as tall as a 6-year-old little girl, but Cat only had an upper humanoid torso.\nMeanwhile, Cat's chomper head, vines, and roots grew larger. She got 10 meters taller while a new eye above her mouth emerged. It slowly opened and glared at the crowd below.\nShe became a colossus monster, and her true cultivation base was revealed. Her strength jumped from the 4th stage to the 6th stage, which was equivalent to the soul formation stage!\nIn addition, she still retained her monster's physique. She was capable of fighting soul transformation cultivators! A soul transformation stage cultivator might not even be her opponent.\nWu Buyi laughed. He had expected that Cat had been hiding her true strength. However, instead of being impressed by her potential, he praised Leo.\n\"Such insight. Lord Florida Man must have known about your potential. That's why he has been raising you and giving you everything. Wow.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat puffed her chest for a moment, but she soon realized that Wu Buyi didn't praise her. She pouted and crossed her arms.\nMeanwhile, the crowd below panicked.\n\"W-WHAT?! A-A-A SIXTH STAGE MONSTER?! NOT THE FOURTH STAGE?!\"\nEven Ye Tianxie was shocked. Because of this miscalculation, his whole battalion was in danger. Had Cat attacked them with her full strength, everybody except Tang Xuan and Ye Tianxie would have died instantly.\nInstead of maintaining composure and commanding his men, Ye Tianxie pushed the crowd ahead of him and hid among the nascent soul cultivators. He also yelled.\n\"SOMEBODY GO AND CALL CHANCELLOR TANG!!\"I think you should take a look at\n\"…\"\nThe subordinates had no time to swear or curse their cowardly leader. Two of the people rushed toward the store building and tried to enter.\nUnfortunately, the door was locked.\n\"!!!\"\nThe cultivators slammed on the door and window, trying to break inside. However, their fists hit a transparent barrier a millimeter away from the door and windows.\nAs they couldn't force their way inside, they shouted, trying to get Tang Xuan's attention.\n\"CHANCELLOR! HELP US!!\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo and Tang Xuan were alone in the store. As the former entered the store after Tang Xuan, he locked the door behind him, isolating the old man inside. He didn't want 200 people to stroll into his empty mall and dirty the clean floor with their dirty shoes.\nChancellor Tang admired the space inside the store. His reaction was modest even though his back and palms were already sweaty. Nobody knew what he had been thinking.\n\"Spatial Formation? I see. You're very impressive, Friend Florida Man.\"\nLeo raised his brow, \"You don't look surprised.\"\n\"This is not the first time I've seen a spatial distortion array at work. The imperial palace's treasury also has one. But I have to admit. Ours is a bit smaller.\"\n\"… I see.\"\n\"Mhm… Hmm?!\"\nTang Xuan ignored the empty space and walked toward the shelves and showcase refrigerators. He walked straight toward the grain pill shelf and picked up a box of poison grain pills.\nUpon picking up the box and noticing the pills inside, Tang Xuan widely smiled, \"I didn't expect to see another poison element cultivator. How long have you been making these? Oh, I should change the question. When did you make these?\"\nLeo didn't think much. He said honestly as it was common sense for merchants to reveal the food's production dates and expiry dates.\n\"Roughly two weeks ago? What's wrong? Have they gone bad?\"\nTang Xuan laughed, \"How could it be? Poison pills are better the older they are. They age like wine!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan injected his Qi into the box and made it float. Then, he continued shopping, checking the items in the fridges and the shelves. Aside from the poison grain pills, he also picked a bundle of immortal grass.\n\"How much are the immoral grasses?\"\n\"50 years of lifespan per blade. Please be mindful of how much you take.\"\n\"Can I pay with spirit stones or essence stones?\"\n\"I only take spirit stones. Also, the price is 500,000 spirit stones per blade.\"\n\"… 10,000 spirit stones instead of a year of lifespan, I see. That's fair.\"\nTang Xuan's smiling face twitched for a moment. However, his white teeth shone like a flashbang. His eyes also flickered with purple light, but Leo couldn't tell what the old man was thinking.\nA few seconds later, Tang Xuan shocked Leo. The elder suddenly pointed at the showcase refrigerator and asked him.\n\"I'll take every immortal grass in the showcase. I'll pay with spirit stones.\"\n\"…Huh?\"\n\"I count the blades just now. There are 520 blades in there, so that comes to 260 million spirit stones, is that correct?\"\n\"Wait, wait, wait.\" Leo was taken aback, \"Are you sure? That's a lot of spirit stones.\"\nTang Xuan shrugged, \"I'm rich, and I'm also an alchemist, so why not?\"\n\"…\"\nSeeing Leo's speechless expression, Tang Xuan snickered and stored the items that he had chosen in his spatial ring. Then, he flickered a ring, full of spirit stones, toward Leo. The latter caught it with one hand.\n\"Consider it the price of my sincerity. I really wish to be your friend, not an enemy. We, quasi-immortals, are few. We should be on a friendly terms instead of trying to go after each other's jugular, am I right? We can't have too many friends, but one enemy is too many.\"\nFor once, Leo discovered a smart and sensible local man. He nodded as he respected the elder.\n\"I guess you don't live a thousand years for nothing.\"\n\"Compared to you, I'm far inferior. I don't have the guts to provoke the imperial court, you know?\"\nAgain, Tang Xuan's grin was so creepy that Leo had goosebumps. Leo had a bad feeling about the guy.\nHe knew too much.\nBANG-BANG\nWhile Tang Xuan enjoyed shopping, the people outside banged on the door and windows, trying to get in. Their muffled voice was audible.\n\"CHANCELLOR! HELP US!!\"\n\"Hmm?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 75 – Hundred Police Officers Brutally Attacking Florida Man's Pet Faces Retribution\nTang Xuan had been vigilant ever since the start of this journey. As a quasi-immortal, he could see many things that other cultivators couldn't. Thus, he had been on edge.\nAs soon as he arrived at Florida Man's domain, he noticed a faint energy aura, which drew a square around the store and other buildings. Tang Xuan recognized the pattern right away as he had seen this boundary aura in many mystic realms and his ancestors, who had ascended to the immortal realms, had taught Tang Xuan once.\nBoundary Lines were the indicators of a domain, which only immortals and celestial beings could use. In addition, Domains enforced unique laws, and the people inside had to comply. For example, if the domain laws dictated that one must dance before they talk, everybody would be forced to dance according to the domain laws. Otherwise, they would be either kicked out or killed by the domain.\nThe Tang Clan's subordinate sect, the Sixth Element Sect, which was also one of the three alchemy powerhouse organizations, also had a similar domain. It generated faint poisonous element Qi in a small area, allowing the descendants of the Tang Clan to cultivate them. However, it would instantly kill outsiders and unauthorized cultivators.\nTang Xuan also used to cultivate in the poison element domain, and it slingshotted his status from a regular elder of the sect to an official in the imperial court – He became the strongest poison user and a master alchemist, which earned the respect of his quasi-immortal peers and the emperor.\nAlthough Chancellor Tang had a high status in the clan, sect, and imperial court, he had never seen such as large and expansive domain boundary before. He was in awe and was afraid of the owner of this domain at the same time.\nUpon meeting Leo, Tang Xuan had doubts. He couldn't detect Leo's dao avatar or measure his Qi. Instead, his body produced strange air, which caused his instinct to react. It constantly warned him to either run away from this domain or never touch him.\nAfter witnessing the hidden evidence, Tang Xuan came up with a hypothesis. He suspected that Leo might be a celestial stage cultivator, who had been suppressing his strength to prolong his stay in a mortal world.\nSo far, Tang Xuan had been trying his best to de-escalate the tension to get on Leo's good side. He was ready for every situation, and he was willing to throw away his wealth to befriend Leo.\nUnfortunately, someone screwed him over.\nBANG-BANG\n\"CHANCELLOR! HELP US!!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan hid his sweaty hands under his long sleeves. He inwardly cursed Ye Tianxie and his goons.\n'What the hell are they doing?! Are they stupid?! Can't they tell that they are in an immortal's domain? Right, they can't! They can't possibly see the immortal's boundary. Dammit. I should have warned them.'\nThere were only two pains that men could choose to swallow – The pain of discipline or the pain of regrets. But in this situation, Tang Xuan regretted that he failed to notify Ye Tianxie about Leo's true strength.\n\"Those idiots.\" Tang Xuan maintained his smiling face and walked toward the door. He tried to open it.\nCLICK\nUnfortunately, it was locked.\n\"Friend Florida Man, could you please?\"\nAs Tang Xuan had no idea how a modern door worked, he turned around and gazed at Leo.\nBetraying Tang Xuan's expectation, Leo stared at the space in front of him in a daze. His wicked smile terrified the chancellor.\n.\n.\n'Oh, yeah. That's right.'\nLeo almost couldn't contain his laughter when he received an update from the domain system.\nDING\n<Your employee, Cat, has been attacked.>\n<Self-Defense Mechanism is enabled. Would you like to punish the assailants?>\nLeo was overjoyed. He looked at the mini-map, hoping to steal everybody's lifespan with a thought. However, the blinking red dots on the screen were few as not everybody had attacked Cat or Wu Buyi yet.\nHis smiling face was frozen. He started dissing the assailants in his mind.\n'Why don't you just launch a simultaneous attack?! Why are you sending a few people to attack at a time? Oh, wait. They would have died. Never mind. I can't let my precious free laborer and lifespan slave get themselves killed.'\nLeo sighed and mumbled.\n\"Execute Order 66, system. The compensation is their lifespan.\"\n<Affirmative.>\nCHING-CHING-CHING\nLeo's lifespan was increased, and five blinking red dots in the mini-map disappeared. As this wasn't Leo's first rodeo, he closed his system menu and smiled at Tang Xuan, feigning ignorance.\n\"It appears that your subordinates cause a scene. Let's go out and find them.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan opened a way for Leo. The latter unlocked the door and got out. As soon as he and Tang Xuan left the store, they noticed the massive shadow of a certain plant monster.\nLeo ignored the crowd and looked up. Then, he found the massive chomper. For a moment, he thought that he was looking at the Pumpkin King from a certain card game as Cat's new big eye resembled it.\n\"Wut da hail is she doing?\"\nHe pursed his lips while he inspected Cat's large roots and vines, checking if she was sick. Fortunately, there was no sign of a strange mutation other than her black roots, trunk, and vines.I think you should take a look at\nTang Xuan followed Leo outside and looked up as well. He was slightly taken aback when he noticed Cat's cultivation base.\n\"Friend Florida Man, what's happening here?\" Asked Tang Xuan.\nLeo shifted his gaze toward the troublemaking group. He stared at Ye Tianxie, \"You should ask them, not me.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan paused for a moment. He turned toward Ye Tianxie. As soon as he turned around, his smiling face vanished from his face. He glared at the henchmen of Yan Zhu.\n\"What did you do, Ye Tianxie?!\"\nYe Tianxie's face was pale. He rushed to Tang Xuan's side and clung to his arm, \"S-Senior! Please help! The monster and the alchemist are attacking us! That thing ate one of us at first. But then, but then, five of our men suddenly dry up and turn into ash! T-This is sorcery! We don't know what hit us!!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan remained silent, but his back was drenched in sweat. It was confirmed that Leo was an immortal, and he had just used his domain power to kill the men.\nThe chancellor deeply inhaled and exhaled three times. He had predicted this, but he didn't expect that they would have provoked an immortal and his comrades so soon. By the time Tang Xuan successfully controlled his heart rate, Leo already took several steps back and stood in the middle of a farm.\n\"Hmm?\"\nTang Xuan was confused about why Leo retreated. From his perspective, Leo had nothing to worry about since his pet was as strong as Ye Tianxie. Also, Tang Xuan had no intention of helping these men, so Leo had nothing to be feared.\nLittle did he know what was about to happen. Leo had faced so many giant monsters before, and his fighting experience compelled him to keep a distance from every monster that could emit a rainbow aura. After all, these monsters were capable of bypassing his defense and wounding him.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!!\"\nCat went berserk. She whipped down her thorn vine and smacked the alley between Wu Buyi and the general store.\nBOOM\nThe nascent soul cultivators leaped away from the thick vine and dodged the strike. They bellowed and summoned their dao avatars to unleash their skills. Colorful beams, sword Qi, energy spears, flying daggers, and invisible bullets flew. Everything hit Cat's giant head and her vines as she couldn't dodge.\n\"HAH!\"\nFive of the cultivators merged with their dao avatars and transformed into 5-meter-tall giants. Their clothes were destroyed in the process, but they leaped toward Cat and threw their punches.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\nCat opened her mouth and shot out her long tongue. As if her tongue worked the same way as a frog, she caught one of the giants and pulled him into her mouth. Then, she chewed him alive.\nBOOM-BOOM\nThe four punches of the remaining giants hit the chomper's body. It caused a slight dent, but she didn't flinch.\n\"NOM-NOM MYAAA!!\"\nCat swung her two thorn whips and hit all four giants. They were knocked flying, but they landed at the border of Leo's domain to the west.\nThe giant cultivators gritted their teeth as the thorn whip grazed their stomachs and left behind deep wounds. They patted their wounds and circulated their Qi to heal.\nIn just two moves, everybody realized the disparity of their strength. Ye Tianxie also panicked as he didn't want to fight a monster that could potentially kill him. He shook Tang Xuan's clothes.\n\"Chancellor Tang! Please help me!\"\nTang Xuan frowned and looked at Ye Tianxie with cold eyes. Then, he looked up and took a few steps back, breaking Cat's line of sight. Then, he scolded the henchman.\n\"You did this upon yourself. Why did you provoke that thing? You should have learned about Daoist Florida Man's pet from your spies.\"\n\"B-But they said it was just a 4th-stage monster.\"\n\"So, you're trying to take advantage of it and escalate the situation?!\"\n\"I-I didn't know!\"\n\"…You fool.\"\nTang Xuan deeply sighed. He had the urge to grab this guy and poison him to death. However, he was aware of the life brand on him. Had Tang Xuan killed him, the third prince would have learned of it and used the information to kill him or damage his Tang Clan.\nThe third prince couldn't be trusted, so Tang Xuan didn't let his guard down. Minimizing their losses was the only thing he could do at the moment.\nBut as Tang Xuan was getting ready to join the fight, he noticed a movement from the corner of his eyes.\nLeo had been observing the situation from the farmland. He nonchalantly helped a farmer mannequin pull out a giant potato, and he started eating it raw.\n\"191? Well, it got what I want. Good job enduring that, Cat.\"\nLeo raised his hand and snapped his fingers. He uttered a word, which would give Tang Xuan PTSD for the rest of his life.\n\"To cinder.\"\n*SNAP*",

Oh, no.\"\nAs soon as Leo uttered the words and snapped his fingers, Tang Xuan realized the crisis. He gulped and didn't utter another word as he sensed the tremendous pressure coming from the domain.\nPOOF\nPOOF\nPOOF\nTang Xuan witnessed everything - Ye Tianxie's underlings were disintegrated one after another. Life force energy left their bodies and gathered in Leo's chest.\n'Those life force, lifespan, domain… could it be?!'\nThe chancellor figured out the secret of Leo's domain. It forcefully extracted the life force of dead people to its master – the Florida Man. Secondly, as the domain was related to life force, the master could also manipulate other cultivators' lifespan, thus explaining the existence of the store and his weird currency.\nUnderstanding the purposes of the domain, Tang Xuan got enough information to report to the emperor. He compiled the information in his mind.\n'This man is too dangerous. The empire and my clan can't afford to provoke him. We must get on his good side to survive! Only fools will charge head-first here to rob his artifacts and rare herbs. Well, this works in my favor. I can manipulate Yan Zhu to launch a full-scale attack on this immortal and get him killed. That way, the Fatui Cult will be disbanded, and one less unorthodox sect will continue to exist.'\nTang Xuan glanced at Leo, who seemed to be in a daze again. Using this opportunity, he kicked the ground and vanished. The next moment, he traveled 10 kilometers away.\nAfter getting out of the domain, Tang Xuan looked at his hands. They were as sweaty as his face and his drenched back. He felt like he was one step away from death.\nIt took him a few hours to settle down. Tang Xuan quietly returned to the capital by himself, leaving behind Yan Zhu and his men in the forest.\n.\n.\nPOOF\nPOOF\nLeo watched how the 190ish nascent soul cultivators turned into ash. He opened his lifespan menu and checked his income in real-time.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 716 Years…>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 852 Years…>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 827 Years…>\nNothing was sweeter than free lifespan from intruders. Leo couldn't stop smiling.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi blankly stared at the carnage from the top of Cat's chomper head. He looked down from above and noticed that everybody turned into ash.\nHe nodded in approval, \"Yup. That's Lord Florida Man for you. Only fools would pick a fight with him.\"\nWu Buyi sat and patted Cat's human head. She was surprised for a moment and swatted his hand off. Then, she tried to bite him with her humanoid mouth.\n\"HISS!\"\nThe alchemist snickered and toyed with Cat, \"What? Can't I pat your head, little girl?\"\n\"MEOW!!\"\n\"What do you mean I didn't do anything? Because of me, they fired a water Qi beam at you. Didn't you get a mouthful of precious water Qi?\"\n\"MEOW-MEOW! NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\n\"What?! It doesn't count as food? Look, Missy. You'd better be considerate to your seniors. I know that you're stronger than me, but you need to show some respect to elders-\"\nPA!\nCat's vine came from above and swatted Wu Buyi away from her head. Her body soon shrank and reduced to the usual size. Her cultivation base also reverted to the 4th-stage. She yawned and retreated into the granary, where her food haven awaited.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi was knocked down from the sky and landed on the ground. He only sensed a light impact, but he wasn't hurt. Still, he noticed that a thin layer of blue grid barrier blinked in front of him and vanished after he had gotten on the ground.\nWu Buyi patted his clothes to get rid of dust. He snorted and turned his attention to the survivors and the disciples. Upon looking around, he noticed that all disciples gathered in the warehouse next to the junkyard. Gao Yan was also there with them.\nSeeing that the disciples were safe, Wu Buyi was relieved. He turned his attention to the remnant next. However, only one cultivator remained.\nYe Tianxie was left behind. As for the chancellor, he was no longer there.\n.\n.\nYe Tianxie was shocked. When he realized that he wasn't the monster's opponent, he used Tian Xuan as a shield, begging him to do something about the monster. But suddenly, the situation turned for the worse.\nAll good men, who served Ye Tianxie for decades, got disintegrated into dust for no reason. He was speechless and confused at the same time.\nA few seconds later after his subordinates were all killed, Tang Xuan kicked the ground and retreated from this place, leaving Ye Tianxie alone.\nYe Tianxie was vexed. He clenched his fist.\n'Damn coward! You're a quasi-immortal, but you don't even have the guts to fight a 6th-stage monster! You don't deserve the chancellor title!'I think you should take a look at\nYe Tianxie swallowed his anger and continued hiding from the giant monster's line of sight. While hiding, he found Leo on the farm, poking something invisible in front of him.\nThe cultivator swallowed his saliva. As Ye Tianxie was aware of his position and the strength gap between the quasi-immortal stage and the soul transformation stage, he chose not to provoke Leo. He looked around, searching for the gap in their defense and an escape route.\nBOOM\nWhile looking, Wu Buyi fell from Cat's head and landed not far away from a mysterious west building. Their eyes accidentally met.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and Ye Tianxie gave each other a meaningful look. As Ye Tianxie was two realms higher than Wu Buyi, the former wasn't afraid. However, he was wary of Leo and the plant monster.\n'Tsk. Just you wait. Once I report this to his highness, you people will be reduced to dust! I won't forget this humiliation!'\nYe Tianxie grudgingly stomped the ground and flew east, fleeing from this place and avoiding Leo, Wu Buyi, and Cat. Along the way, he noticed a dozen agents in the forest, who also sneered at him.\nBecause of the spectators, Ye Tianxie's mind was filled with anger. He swore that he would raze this place to the ground one day. As such, he made a detour around the place and escaped to Magpie City, where Yan Zhu and others had been waiting for him.\n.\n.\nSeeing that the customers were gone, Leo began picking the loot. As so many people died, rings, weapons, artifacts, armor, and clothes were everywhere.\nThe warehouse mannequins also knew their queue. They came out from hiding and began collecting rings and random weapons As the mannequins moved, the disciples also came out from hiding.\n\"Is it over?\" Gao Yan looked around. He could no longer see Cat in her giant form.\n\"Probably?\" A disciple dryly laughed. They didn't want to get into the crossfire between super experts as Qi condensation cultivators like them could instantly die because of their sneeze.\nThe group came out and walked toward the workshop, which was their gathering place. As they proceeded further, their feet stepped on the clothes of the dead cultivators. Two of them also noticed a glowing dish on the ground.\n\"A shining dish?\"\nEverybody huddled to see the strange thing. One of them tried to pick it up.\nBZZZ\nThe dish rejected the disciple. As if he was hit by a lightning bolt, he was sent flying. Fortunately, a transparent wall blocked the attack and decreased the impact force for the guy.\n\"OW!\"\nThe disciple landed on his butt and got up in frustration. He didn't notice that the shop domain had saved his life, \"What was that for?!\"\nGao Yan and others were relieved that the guy was unharmed. They laughed at their friend's misfortune, \"Because you suck!\"\n\"You…\"\nAs their friend failed, Gao Yan tried next. He grabbed the dish.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm BZZZ\nThe residual water element Qi hit him. However, as Gao Yan's primary Qi was wood, his water attribute resistance was high. It only staggered him until he let go of the treasure.\nGao Yan dropped the plate. However, it didn't break when it hit the solid ground. He fluttered his hand in pain.\n\"Yeah, it stings. I sense water Qi in this thing. I think it's an artifact that boosts the owner's water element Qi.\"\nHearing that it was an actual artifact, the disciples were astonished. Some of them ran around, trying to search for other items. Then, they found the remains of another dead cultivator near the junkyard.\n\"There's another one. I found a red mirror!\"\nAnother disciple also found a pair of white daggers on top of the clothing store's building, \"I see daggers on the roof.\"\nEverybody had fun playing a treasure hunt game. However, none of them could touch the artifacts and treasures as they once had an owner. Only nascent soul cultivators or stronger seniors could tame them.\nHowever, a certain group of mannequins ignored the rules. They nonchalantly picked up the dishes, daggers, mirrors, and dangerous items. Then, they carried them to the warehouse as if they did nothing to them.\nBZZZ\nBZZZ\nBZZZ\nQi attacks from the artifacts hit the warehouse mannequins, but they were unfazed. In five minutes, they collected a hundred artifacts and put them in a trash bin inside the warehouse.\nThe disciples followed the mannequins around as these guys seemed to know where the items were. They hoped to get some souvenirs or leftover items that they could use.\nThe disciples weren't the only ones with the thoughts. The vultures that had been hiding in the forest also had an eye on the artifacts. Thus, they crept closer to the store and plotted to raid the warehouse tonight.\nBecause of their greed, their killing intent leaked. Wu Buyi immediately picked up their Qi signature and looked around. He soon noticed their movements.\n\"Oh, boy. I guess I can't concoct any pill tonight.\"",

Fortunately, Leo was busy calculating his lifespan and planning his next expansion. He still stood in the middle of the first farm plot.\n\"Lord Florida Man, sir.\" Wu Buyi humbly approached Leo and called for him, \"My lord, the lurkers around here will probably attack us tonight. Should I go out and hunt them down?\"\nHearing that the store would be attacking soon, Leo snapped back to his senses. He then beamed Wu Buyi with a bright smile.\n\"Let them come.\"\n\"Is that a good idea?\"\nWu Buyi doubted it was the right action. After all, the disciples were fragile. The golden core and the nascent soul cultivators around here could easily crush them by just waving hands.\n\"Nah, they'll be fine as long as they stay in-door after sunset. Tell them to get inside the store when the sun goes down. Remember this. Never go outside when the sun goes down. If they're going to raid the store, let them attack first. I'll deal with them later.\"\n\"…If you say so, my lord.\"\nWu Buyi disagreed with this decision, but he obeyed the order. He called every disciple over and told them to rush into the store when before sunset.\n.\n.\n\"And that's the order. Remember, never wander out at night! Lord Florida Man stresses that! This place is not Life Sword Sect. There are beasts and monsters lurking in the forest, and they sometimes wander around the stream.\"\nGao Yan and others listened to Wu Buyi and nodded. Still, the teenagers and the kids were still immature - The more warning, the more temptation. Everybody was curious about what would happen at night.\nSeeing the sparkling pupils of the disciples, Wu Buyi narrowed his eyes as he could see through their thoughts. He threatened them.\n\"Also, I've spotted multiple nascent soul and golden core cultivators in the forest, and they have been watching this place for days. I believe they will raid this place tonight. Therefore, if you don't wanna die, DON'T. YOU. FREAKING. GO. OUTSIDE!!\"\n\"…\"\nThe threat worked like magic. The mischievous smiles vanished from the disciples' faces. Even Gao Yan, who was the strongest among the bunch, broke a cold sweat.\nNoticing that the threat was effective, Wu Buyi taught them about today's event.\n\"Listen. Just now, we've been attacked by 200 nascent soul cultivators. We're lucky that Lord Florida Man and his pet are around. Now that those lurkers have seen their strength, they will aim for their weaknesses next. Do you know what their weaknesses are?\"\n\"What are they, sir?\"\n\"You!\"\n\"E-Eh?\"\nWu Buyi paced back and forth as these disciples were too naïve and clueless about the cultivation world's dark side. This was a world of anarchy where the strong devoured the weak. They were bullied and almost lost their lives, but they didn't learn.\n\"Brat. Do you remember what they did to you?\" Wu Buyi reminded them.\n\"T-They stole our artifacts.\"\n\"Those were the treasures of Lord Florida man. They're not yours to begin with.\"\n\"…\"\nThe disciples sulked as they couldn't get back the fancy thorn whips. They wished that they could have an artifact like the adults.\nWu Buyi read them like a book. He snickered at them, \"You will get one eventually. For now, you're not strong enough to use a strong artifact. Once you reach where I am, you will be swimming in a pool of spirit stones and artifacts! Just focus on getting stronger!\"\nHearing Wu Buyi's encouragement, they felt better. Everybody agreed to work hard in cultivation. Being motivated, they returned to the store building to rest and get used to their new living quarters.\nAfter the disciples were herded into the building, Wu Buyi was relieved. He also entered his house and entered temporary seclusion, waiting for the upcoming night. He prayed that the invaders wouldn't be too strong.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo rubbed his hands while he stood on the mystic realm platform. He couldn't stop laughing.\n<Current Lifespan: 178,072 Years, 6 Months, 27 Days, 9 Hours, 57 Minutes.>\nStealing lifespan from strong cultivators was the best. He managed to gather a lot in less than a day!\n\"Dear Lord. Please send more my way. I LOVE IT!\"\nLeo opened the domain menu and checked the available structures.\n.\nLivestock Shed\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 7\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 10 x 10\n.\nParking Lot\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 30 x 30\n.\nWarehouse (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8I think you should take a look at\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nGranary (2)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nEmployee Apartment\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 50\n.\nDomain Expansion\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nExpansion Range – 100 x 100\n.\nAlthough Leo barely used 10% of the available area, he needed more territory for his future buildings and other expansion projects. After all, there were many useless areas that Leo couldn't touch, such as streams and shallow rivers.\nDomain Expansion was what Leo desired the most. However, the system's offer seemed lackluster as it could only expand the domain by 10,000 square meters. Comparing it to the domain of one square kilometer, it was insignificant.\nStill, it was necessary and useful as Leo could designate the entire area as an empty yard. He could also erect a parking lot there, turning it into an airstrip for the local cultivators from afar to park there.\nAs Leo planned to purchase the expansion, he studied the item and pressed on it, checking the preview.\nDING\nThe mini-map zoomed out. Instead of showing the 1000x1000 grids, it had another display mode. It showed 3x3 grids while Leo's domain was at the center. The west grid, southeast grid, and northeast grid were marked with red stripes, which disallowed Leo to expand toward the directions.\nIn the map, all major geographical landmarks were highlighted. In the center, the Sword Saint Boulder and a blue home icon marked the area as Leo's home base.\nIn the West, Magpie City and Life Sword Sect were the closest neighbors. They were only 10 kilometers away, and their landmarks appeared at the edge of the mini-map. A portion of the area was highlighted in red, which indicated that Leo couldn't expand his domain to that area.\nAs for the East, Leo could see the stream that Leo had been using as a water source. It flowed down from the north, and it headed southeast. However, the mini-map didn't show the stream's destination. At the southeast edge of the map, an icon of a black cone and three red swords was noticeable as the city was 10 times bigger than Life Sword Sect and Magpie City. It also came with a label.\nFatui Cult, Frozen Fire City\nLeo finally understood why those KKK wannabe guys came from the South. Their headquarters was there.\nFatui Cult wasn't the only new hostile neighbor. Directly to the north, a skull and a black sword image icon were directly north of Leo's domain. Furthermore, the territory's borders were connected to the Magpie City's area of influence.\nDeath Sword Sect and its town, the Mantis Dragon City, expanded from east to west. On the map, Leo could only see the urban town, but he couldn't see the full layout of the city.\nSword Saint Forest was also highlighted, but it only covered the west of Magpie City. One-third of the forest already became an empty field as Leo had removed them.\nLooking at the geography, terrain, and map, the expandable area seemed so tiny. He was disappointed in the system.\n\"Cheapskate system. This is too small.\"\nAs Leo was worried about the farm and the mystic realm platform, he expanded toward the south. Then, the system allowed Leo to pick the location.\nHowever, it didn't allow Leo to freely pick an area. It showed 10 locked blocks, which were attached to the southern territory of his domain. When Leo pressed it, the system warned him.\n<Will you unlock this area? Cost – 10,000 Years of Lifespan.>\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows and pressed an adjacent block in curiosity. When he touched the button, the system asked Leo again.\n<Will you unlock this area? Cost – 10,000 Years of Lifespan.>\nWith that information, Leo understood how the system was playing with him. He muttered.\n\"This is a waste of lifespan. I should wait for more useful facilities. I'll only build it when I don't have a space to build anymore.\"\nLeo canceled the purchase. But as soon as he closed it, the domain system gave him a hint.\n<Tips: You can acquire Domain Expansion Tickets by completing a mystic realm exploration. The number you can acquire depends on the difficulty.>\n<Tips: Domain Expansion Tickets can be used to unlock more land.>\n\"…HMM?!\"\nLeo almost cursed out loud as the system was toying with him.\n\"System, what do you mean?! Can I get the expansion for FREE?!\"\nThe system didn't answer, but Leo already got enough hints. His widened eyes locked on the mystic realm portal platform as if he had found a fully grown marijuana plant in the wild.\nLeo stuck out his tongue. He panted like a perverted old man on crack. He rubbed his hands to get his dry palm wet.\n\"Well, well, well. I see what the system is trying to do. Encouraging me, eh?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 78 – Florida Man Digs New River for Local Alligators, Neighbor Complains\nLeo sensed a déjà vu as the \"Free Tickets\" reminded him of so many ancient mobile games before the nuclear fallout age. It was similar to base-building games and gacha games, which sometimes gave away gacha tickets for players.\nBut in this case, the \"Free Tickets\" came in the form of an exchangeable token. It guaranteed that Leo could use it to expand his domain territory instead of spending 10,000 years of lifespan. However, to get them, he had to work for it.\n\"So, you finally give me a quest after fifty freaking thousand years! Aside from the online shopping system, you didn't even help me or advise me. But now, you are giving me a lot of free tips and quests?!\"\nLeo was frustrated. He wished the system could have helped him when he needed it the most. Back then, Leo relied on himself and limited information from the ring to survive the harsh environment. He felt like he was a newborn character from a Fromsoft Game, which he could have been killed in one or two hits from monsters.\nAfter complaining to the system, it went quiet. Leo deeply sighed as it was pointless to pick a fight with the weird system. He sat on the mystic realm portal platform and gazed at the rotating ring at the center.\n\"I guess I have to upgrade you. You're damn expensive, do you know that?\"\nWHOOM\nThe ring frame of the portal hummed. It was unknown if it responded to Leo's word or if it was a coincidence.\nAs Leo had nothing to lose but his lifespan, he upgraded the portal platform to level 8, investing 70,000 years of lifespan in one go.\nRUMBLE\nThe platform shook. Then, changes occurred. The entire structure lifted itself into the air and started floating higher. Its size also expanded, getting wider and larger. Within three seconds, it transformed from a 400-square-meter platform to a 10,000-square-meter flying island.\nThe four scorpion obelisk pillars at the edge also grew 100 meters taller. No longer showing only a scorpion tail obelisk, the platform created four statues with scorpion tails.\nAt the top left corner, a 50-meter-tall red wolf with four feather wings sat still, glaring at the top right statue while baring its fangs. The obelisk and the statue were painted red, and the floor around it had the outline of spilling blood. At the bottom of the statue's feet, there was a label [Unfortunate evil overlord who will find a happy marriage life through fateful encounters].\nAt the top right corner, a massive ball-like creature statue innocently gazed at the portal. It had eight chubby octopus tentacles. Its eyes and mouth looked like something from Japanese anime as it was too cute. However, the obelisk extended from its tail, and everything was painted green. The label indicated [Unfortunate evil overlord who will find true endings through his companions].\nAt the bottom left corner, a black-winged angel sat on a throne and smirked at the bottom right statue. Three naked women crawled around him as if they were his servants or concubines. In addition, it was the only statue where the scorpion tail was connected to his throne, not his body. Its represented color was black and the label was the strange [Unfortunate evil overlord who will find endless pleasure through hero's ordeals].\nAnd lastly, at the bottom right, a gigantic elderly man sitting and smiling at the portal situated there. His hands held a fishing rod, and he wore a t-shirt, shorts, rubber boots, and a straw hat. No matter how Leo looked at the statue, it looked exactly like an ordinary fisherman in the modern world, except for the scorpion tail that extended from his back. This was also the only statue without a color. However, the label said something else – [Unfortunate evil overlord who will find true happiness through his family].\nLeo had no idea what the statues represented. If they showed up as an azure dragon, phoenix, black tortoise, and white tiger, they would have been relatable. However, these statues were too strange.\n\"Evil overlords? What the hell?\"\nUnable to decipher the clues, Leo gave up thinking for now. He turned his attention to the floating platform as it started moving.\nIt had become a flying island!\nThe island maintained its altitude at 1,000 meters above Leo's store, casting a shadow upon the land below. Then, it stopped moving, stabilizing its location.\nPHOOSH\nBOOM\nLeo sensed that something was shot down from the platform and hit the top of the store. He rushed to the edge of the platform and jumped down to see what the flying platform had done.\nThere was a long glass tube extending from the bottom of the platform. Judging from the shape and size, Leo could somewhat guess what it was.\n\"An elevator? The heck?\"\nLeo entered his store and discovered that an elevator appeared in the middle of the store. He approached it and discovered that it was also functional.\nCurious, Leo got inside the elevator and examined the buttons. However, there were only three buttons – Ground Floor, Second Floor, and the Heaven Icon.\nLeo shrugged and pressed the heaven icon, which appeared as a building on a white cloud.\nDING\nThe elevator door was closed. Then, it began ascending. Leo turned around and looked through the glass walls, and he noticed that Wu Buyi and the disciples were still in shock.\nLeo held back his laughter and looked up, waiting for the elevator to send him to the top floor. It only took him a few minutes to get there.\nDING\nThe elevator door was reopened. Leo walked out and found himself outside the right foot of the wolf statue.\n\"Oh.\" Leo looked up and smiled at the wolf statue, \"How nice. I don't have to calculate my jump. I can just take the elevator!\"\nLeo was happy with the new changes. At least, he wouldn't need to worry about intruders messing with the platform or stealing its entrance quota.I think you should take a look at\nThinking of the quota, Leo managed the status of the mystic realm portal platform, allocating some points to the facility.\n.\nMystic Realm Portal – Level 8\nEntry Limit (Person) – (3/10)\nPortal Cooldown Reduction – (0/5)\nPortal Duration – (5/5)\nNext Destination: Unknown Low-Mid Plane\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nStatus: Ready to Open\n.\n\"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Safety first.\"\nMaintaining the portal activation was the key here. As Leo had never been to the rumor mystic realms, he made sure that he would have enough time to return. With five points to the portal duration, Leo would have 35 days to finish his first exploration.\nAs for the entry limit, Leo didn't care. It could be used as a bonus for good-behaving workers or a reward for Wu Buyi.\nAfter setting up the mystic realm portal, Leo jumped down and returned to the place, where the platform used to be. Upon arrival, he found a large square hole.\nLooking at the remains, Leo dryly laughed. He wondered what he should do to the empty land.\n\"Should I just make a fish pond here or what?\"\nLeo thought of the fisherman statue and got inspiration. He wondered what would happen if he kept some fish in the pond without the system's help.\nPutting his thought to practice, Leo went to visit the recycling center mannequins.\nThe yellow-jacket mannequins were so busy that Leo felt bad for them. Everybody had been collecting leaves, branches, and random junk and placing them in the junkyard, waiting for Leo to filter or sort them.\nEvery mannequin had no \"Exhaustion\" or \"Tired\" in their dictionary. They worked like madmen, running around and competing with each other. They also never dropped their yellow helmets even though they sometimes stumbled on a rock and fell.\n\"Alright. That's enough for now.\"\nHearing Leo's order, they put their last items in the junkyard and stood in front of Leo, waiting for the next instructions.\nLooking at their attentive attitude, Leo loved them more. He tried asking them something irrelevant to the recycling center.\n\"Say, can you help me dig a fishing pond? You can use that area. The layout is already there.\"\nThe mannequins turned right in unison and started running. In seconds, they reached the place where the mystic realm platform once was. Upon finding the place, three of them turned around and rushed to the granary. They picked up farming tools and carried them to their colleagues. After passing the tools around, they started digging.\nLeo came to check on them later. When he noticed that they were capable of using hoes and shovels, Leo was relieved.\n\"You guys are smart. Alright, keep working! I'll be back to check on you later.\"\nThe mannequin didn't respond to Leo's words. They ignored him and continued digging and plowing the soil.\nThat day was the trigger of something irreversible. Leo failed to tell them when to stop. He also forgot to give them the dimension of the fishing pond.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, the spies and lurkers looked at the flying island with round eyes. None of them could find the right words to describe what they saw.\nBecause of Leo's activities, they quickly reported it to their headquarters. The Ouyang Clan, Situ Clan, Fatui Cult, and Death Sword Sect received the new intel. As the situation changed, they received a new order.\nThey wanted hostages! With hostages, they could force Leo to work for them!\nThis coincided with the spies' intentions. Everybody lay low and get ready for the night raid.\nTheir targets – The disciples!",

He also built a new warehouse and a granary, expanding his storage, and spending additional 27,500 years of lifespan.\nWith a clothing store, a recycling center, three alchemy workshops, three farm plots, three houses, two warehouses, two granaries, a general store, and a mystic realm portal, Leo got 17 facilities in his domain. Although upgrading cost was cheap, leveling everything was costly.\n<Current Lifespan: 80,572 Years…>\nLeo had a heartache. In a flash, he lost 97,500 years to the system. However, Leo hadn't had enough. He eyed the new building.\n.\nEmployee Apartment\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 50\n.\nThis was necessary. It cost a lot, and it took a lot of space. However, Leo needed a place for his workers to live as he couldn't let them sleep in the general store for too long. It was a place for business, not a hotel.\nLeo swallowed his saliva. He was afraid that the apartment upgrades might cost him 10,000 YOL per level. If that were the case, he would need to spend 80,000 YOL.\n*YOL = Years of Lifespan*\nAs this was a big project, Leo contemplated the pros and cons for a long time. He sat on the edge of the flying island, looking at the sunset and the scenery.\nThe sun escaped, and the night arrived. Leo's glowing green pupils scanned the forest below and spotted the heat signature of a hundred lurkers around his domain.\n'Hmm?'\nStrangely, they were too close to the domain boundary. They crept into bushes, crawling while hiding from plain sight.\nLeo smirked as he found their actions amusing. He took a long leap from the platform and glided toward the back of the junkyard, where the two vulnerable warehouses and the recycling center were.\nWhile gliding, Leo calculated how he would bait them to attack him first. He had a general idea of what he should do.\n.\n.\nAs soon as the sky turned dark, 20 spies crawled out of the forest, approaching the junkyard. As their uniforms were black and they wore masks, they had no issue with their disguise.\nThey were golden core cultivators from the Death Sword Sect. They were weaker than the previous group as they were the supporting team. However, their current mission was not to fight - They only needed to snatch one or two of Life Sword Sect's disciples from here so that they could use them to blackmail Florida Man and enslave him in the process.\nTheir group was the first to cross the boundary, and everybody jumped out of the bushes. They sprinted toward the recycling center. As the mannequins in yellow jackets were busy, none of them patrolled the facility, making it easy for the spies to infiltrate this area.\nNext to the recycling center's junkyard, two warehouse buildings stood next to each other. Five of the spies stopped and looked at the front entrances of these storehouses. One of them whispered to his colleague.\n\"Let's grab some treasures.\"\nThe other spy shook his head, \"Let's not. We need to complete our missions first. We're infiltrating the nest of a quasi-immortal and a 6th-stage monster plant. There's also a nascent soul alchemist in the area. We have to hurry.\"\n\"Shame.\"\nThe spies looked at the warehouse buildings in pity. They looked away and sneaked closer to the back of the west alchemy workshop.\nBOOM\nWhile they sneaked to the back of the first alchemy workshop, they heard something loud from the North of Sword Saint Forest, where they had come from. Everybody looked back as they had concerns.\nThe location of the noise was their operation headquarters. At the camp, they left behind golden core cultivators to act as a messenger and a logistic officer. They were in charge of handling their escape routes.\n\"Is someone attacking our camp?\" One of them muttered.\n\"…\"\nEveryone was shaken. Thus, their captain ordered them, \"Three of you, go back and check our camp. If something happens, abort the mission and retreat.\"\n\"Yes, boss.\"\nThree of the spies rushed back to their base. As for the rest, they proceeded toward the back of the general store.\n.\n.\nThe Death Sword Sect's agents weren't the only ones who managed to reach the store building, the Fatui Cult's agents and Ouyang Clan's cultivators dispatched 100 men and surrounded the building as well. However, they came from the south and the east.\nThe Fatui Cult's agents brazenly waltzed from the front, ignoring the mannequin workers who had been working on the farms and the fish pond. They gathered in front of the general store, where the disciples were hiding inside.\nThe team warily looked at the nearby house, five meters away from the store. Similar to the Death Sword Sect's agents, they were not confident that they could take on the alchemist and the plant monster.\nAs they didn't want to waste time, one of them tried to open the front door to get inside.\nCLICK\nIt was locked from the inside.\nThe team of 70 agents looked at each other. One of them drew a sword and swung at the glass windows.\nCLANK\nThe sword was broken in one hit.\nThe cultivator frowned as he didn't notice the 1mm thin transparent wall in front of the glass windows. He didn't understand why his steel sword broke because of the fragile-looking glasses.I think you should take a look at\nThe other agents also tried. They inserted their Qi into the door, trying to break whatever array that sealed the door. However, as the door was never locked by an array, their Qi injection failed.\nA smarter agent had keener eyes. They noticed the keyhole under the door handle. Thus, he injected his Qi into the hole, trying to figure out the mechanism behind the lock.\nCLICK\nModern locks were no match for psychics and cultivators. He safely unlocked it and opened the door.\nEverybody sneered. They believed that this raid would be a walk in the park.\nBut as soon as the lockpicker pulled the door open, he found a layer of red curtain wall. He couldn't see through the red light.\n\"What's this?\"\nThe cultivators stood in front of the energy curtain. They looked at each other as if they were afraid of trap arrays. As everybody didn't dare to make a move, they asked their colleagues if anybody was trained in arrays and formations.\nSoon, the agents from the Ouyang Family caught up and discovered the Fatui's group. The Death Sword Sect's spies also gathered in front of the store and found everybody.\nThey were on guard at first. But since they came here for the same goal, the leaders of each team negotiated their terms and came to an agreement – They would cooperate and try to snatch Florida Man's people. As for the blackmail scheme, they would leave it to their bosses to decide.\nAs the Ouyang Clan's agents were well-versed in formations and arrays, their people inspected the red curtain energy behind the front door. The agent was one of the few nascent soul cultivators alive. He scanned the energy curtain with his Qi.\nA few seconds later, the agent informed them of the good news.\n\"This is not a trap or a killing array. It's just there to remove infectious germs from the visitors.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, there is no mistake.\"\nThe crowd let out a sigh of relief. They sneered and waited for the Ouyang Clan's agents to get in first.\nThe Ouyang agents took responsibility and got in first. After crossing the red energy curtain, they found a new world inside. The interior of this building was larger than the outside, but they couldn't get to see everything.\nThere was another hurdle they had to get through.\nBeyond the front door, there was a glass room. They were surrounded by glass walls and glass doors with white metal frames. However, there was no door knob or a handle. In addition, behind the glass doors and the walls, another layer of shutter curtains blocked the entrance.\nOne cultivator entered the small room one after another, but they couldn't open the weird glass doors.\nThe Ouyang agents tried to pry open the door, but they didn't budge. The nascent soul cultivator earlier tried to use brute force and Qi. However, they stood firm like a mountain. The cultivators behind the nascent soul array master were confused.\n\"What now?\" The agents were baffled.\n\"Let's just hurry and destroy the walls.\"\nThe cultivators could see the movement inside behind the shutters. The lights were on, and the disciples were still touring the empty mall.\nAs the intruders came from the front door, the disciples already noticed them. They started shouting and warning the others. Then, they started running toward the second floor.\n\"They've noticed us. We have to hurry!\"\nThey sent their strongest men in and kicked the weaker guys out. Then, they started attacking the glass walls and the doors.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nPunches and kicks ended up hurting the assailants. Some of them brought out hammers. However, they bounced back upon impact.\n\"SHIT! ATTACK HARDER! THEIR MASTER WILL COME SOON!\"\nThe crowd panicked as they were afraid of Leo and the monster plant. Everybody began channeling their Qi and attacked the store from the front.\nBeams, energy balls, flying weapons, and energy spirits hit the glass walls, causing explosions and sparks everywhere.\n.\n.\nDING\n<Warning! The humble general store is under attack!>\n<You may use the emergency defensive order to eliminate the intruders.>\nLeo stood in the middle of a small camp. His right foot stepped on a half-dead golden core cultivator from the Death Sword Sect. As for the others, they were squirming, twisting, and turning as their skins and bodies swelled. Their blood blackened while their guts replaced their outer skin.\nHe looked back at his domain. At the moment, he was outside the boundary, and he couldn't execute order 66.\n\"I didn't expect those fools to attack my store. Hey, system. Can the store be destroyed?\"\n<As long as the humble general store is level 9 or lower, the buildings cannot be destroyed.>\n\"Wait. Does that mean, if I raise the store level to 10, my buildings can be destroyed?! What the hell?!\"\nLeo learned something scary from the system when he least expected it. Because of the revelation, he had concerns.\n\"Dammit. Does that mean I have to stockpile lifespan before I raise the shop to level 10? Am I playing a freaking city-building game or something?!\"\nLeo spat on the injured cultivator under him. Then, he kicked the ground, heading back to the general store.\nThe saliva landed on the injured golden core cultivator's face. His entire face instantly turned brown as his blood turned black. Blood vessels swelled, and his eyes were ejected from the eye sockets. Like the others, he squirmed in agony as the cancer cells rapidly grew and expanded.\nNobody could hear his scream or understand their pain. He stopped moving 10 seconds later. However, the soil under him soon turned black. The weeds, bushes, and trees nearby slowly mutated, just like the trees and plants in Leo's domain.\nThe mutation slowly spread toward the north.",

They looked at each other in confusion.\n\"What's the noise?\"\n\"As much as you know, I don't know!\"\n\"…\"\nBOOM-BOOM\nThey heard them again. It got louder and more frequent.\nThe disciples were never afraid of ghosts. However, they were afraid of the unexplainable phenomenon during the night.

He narrowed his eyes and noticed that a thin layer of energy wall bounced back the attacks.\n\"That's…\"\nGao Yan wasn't sure, but he was certain that a mysterious power was at work, and senior Florida Man might be responsible for the unknown protection array.\nAfter coming up with the hypothesis, Gao Yan was relieved. He regained his composure, and he began controlling the crowd.\n\"Relax, people! They can't get inside! Senior Florida Man and Senior Wu will protect us!\"\nHearing Gao Yan, everybody stopped running around. Still, their faces were as pale as a sheet.\n\"Are you sure, Gao Yan?\"\n\"I'm sure. Look carefully. Do you think regular glasses are stronger than hammers and Qi blades?\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody realized the anomaly. They narrowed their eyes and observed the cultivators in front of the store. As Gao Yan had said, they attacked the glass windows several times, but their weapons broke. Some even tried using Qi attacks on it, but they failed to harm or damage the glasses.\nRealizing the strange development, everybody stopped making noise although they were still nervous.\nCLICK\nSuddenly, the wooden door that served as a disguise was unlocked. The intruders opened the door!\n\"SHIT!\"\n\"It's opened!\"\n\"We're screwed!\"\nGao Yan broke a sweat. He gritted his teeth and was about to tell his friends to run to the back of the mall and hide.\nRUMBLE\nCLANK-CLANK\nAs soon as the door was unlocked, modern shutter doors slid down from the ceiling, barricading the outsiders from getting in. Lockpads appeared along with the shutter doors, and they automatically locked them to the floor.\nRUMBLE\nA new air curtain room was also erected, and they were automatically locked from the inside.\nNormally, air curtain rooms were usually served as a filter to eliminate foul air, insects, and contamination from the outside from getting into the building. But in this situation, it was used for security, blocking the intruders from getting in.\nGao Yan and the disciples were astonished and relieved that the senior's building magically protected them. Unfortunately, their mental strength was lacking, so they couldn't stand still. Everybody paced around the mall, waiting and praying for their seniors to come and help them.\nWhile they were waiting and praying, the intruders got inside the air curtain room. The cultivators started banging the glass doors and the walls. Noises from the entrance got louder, and the disciples could sense their killing intent directed toward them.\n\"This isn't good!\" Gao Yan couldn't stand still anymore. For the sake of everybody's safety, he reacted first. \"TO THE SECOND FLOOR! MOVE!!\"\nHearing the order of Gao Yan, everybody rushed to the staircase and headed to the second floor, leaving unnecessary belongings behind. When everybody reached the empty second floor, they looked around as if they had never got up before. Similar to the first floor, there was nothing here but 20 partitioned rooms and an elevator.\nOne of the disciples approached the elevator. As he had seen how Leo operated it, he wondered if they could get out through this device.\n\"Can we use this to leave?\"\nGao Yan and others followed the disciple and gathered in front of the elevator. They looked at the arrow buttons, but they had no idea what they were for. Nobody dared to touch them.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe loud bang sounds from the first floor were audible on the second floor. Everybody trembled in fear.\nGao Yan bit his lower lip and pressed both buttons. Then, they lit up.\n\"Gao Yan! What are you doing?!\" The disciples panicked as they were afraid that he might ruin the mysterious protection array in the building.\nGao Yan yelled, \"There's no time to hesitate! We saw Senior Florida Man travels up through this shaft. Maybe, there's a way to escape from here!\"\n\"B-But Elder Wu said we should stay indoors!\"\n\"Then, will you wait?\"\n\"…\"\nThe disciple couldn't answer. He, too, wanted to get out of there. The others were also quiet as they were too young and inexperienced in this situation.\nDING\nWhile the disciples were silent, the elevator came down from the portal platform. The door was opened.\nGao Yan took a deep breath and ordered everybody, \"Get in there! Quick!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe disciples rushed into the elevator. However, the small elevator was too small for everybody to enter.\nBZZZ\nIn addition, there was a weight limit. The elevator revealed a red light, and a female voice came out from a speaker.\n\"Elevator Overburdened. Please mind the weight limit.\"I think you should take a look at\n\"…\"\nThe disciples were confused at first, but it took them a few seconds to figure out the hints. They looked at each other as none of them wanted to leave the elevator.\nGao Yan, on the other hand, hadn't entered the elevator yet. He heard the voice, and he understood the general idea. He pulled three people out.\n\"Gao Yan! Let go of me!\" One of them protested.\nGao Yan ignored him, \"Not all of us can go. One of you, get out. You can go on the next trip.\"\nHearing the keyword \"Next Trip\", the crowd was relieved. One of them sacrificed his spot and got out of the elevator.\nDING\nThe red light was gone, and the elevator was closed. However, it didn't move anywhere as the crowd inside hadn't pressed any buttons.\nAs the elevator didn't move, the crowd panicked. They started banging on the metal door, trying to get out.\n\"GAO YAN, HELP!\"\n\"DAMMIT! I SHOULD HAVE STAYED!\"\nGao Yan heard their voices, and he frowned. He pressed the arrow button again, and the elevator door was opened. As soon as the people inside could leave, they rushed out of the small place.\nEverybody panted and broke a sweat. They thought that they would have been trapped in there forever.\n\"I ain't going back in! Y'all can go!\" One of them pointed his finger at Gao Yan's face.\nGao Yan shook his head. He waved his hand and invited the people that didn't get in earlier.\nThe left-behind group looked at each other and followed Gao Yan inside. As there were only seven of them, the elevator door was soon closed.\nGao Yan was observant. He noticed the three buttons in the elevator – [1] button, [2] button, and a cloud palace button.\n\"What are these?\"\nThe others also noticed them, but they weren't courageous enough to press them. On the other hand, Gao Yan already figured out the logic of this elevator. He pressed the cloud icon button.\nWHOOM\nThe elevator slowly moved up.\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"\n\"WHOA!\"\nThe six disciples fell on their butts as if it was their first time riding a modern elevator. As for Gao Yan, he grabbed a rail and managed to maintain his balance.\nSoon, the elevator left the second floor, leaving the group of selfish disciples earlier. The people dropped their jaws as they couldn't comprehend how Gao Yan could operate the elevator but they couldn't.\nAs the elevator exited the building through the absurdly long shaft, the people inside could see through the glass walls and saw the crowd below. They could also see the other buildings from above.\nStunned by the scenery, Gao Yan and everybody forgot about the looming danger. They admired the night view.\nAlchemy workshops, clothing store, recycling center, warehouses, granaries, and the three small houses were still bright. LED lights from the facilities were always on during the night. Only the farm plots were in the dark.\n.\n.\nWHOOM\nWhile attacking the store, the cultivators noticed movements from the elevator shaft. One of them climbed the roof to inspect the long glass tube, which connected to the flying platform.\nTwo of the golden core cultivators tried to attack it. They brought out their low-grade axes and hacked at the shaft.\nCLANK\nThe axe shafts were broken in half upon impact. As for the glasses, they didn't even have a scratch on them.\n\"How strong is this thing?!\"\nThe cultivators got desperate. They stomped the roof tiles and tried to get in from above. Again, they only hurt their feet and legs.\nWHOOM\nAn elevator moved down from the flying platform and entered the building below. The two golden core cultivators were surprised and took several steps back from the shaft.\n\"What the hell?!\"\n\"Hey! Something is weird here!\"\nAlthough they had been stalking Leo, they didn't understand the logic behind this elevator. They also didn't notice that Leo had once used it to move up to the mystic realm portal platform.\nAs the two made noise, 30 people that had nothing to do climbed the building and surrounded the shaft.\n\"What the hell is this?\"\n\"Who cares? Let's crush this thing and get inside. We're wasting too much time!\"\n30 grown men started hitting the glass walls with their fists and Qi.\nBOOM\nAgain, all attacks were repelled and blocked by weird energy. Everybody hurt themselves in the process.\nThe agent from the Ouyang Clan had a bad feeling about this. He sent a voice transmission message to his colleagues and talked through their minds.\n'Hey, let's retreat. We can't get in!'\nHearing their comrade's voice in their minds, the others also agreed.\n'Yeah, it's like a fortress. We should report this to the clan and let the elders handle this. There's no need to risk our lives for achievements.'\n'True. We're up against a nascent soul cultivator, a 6th stage monster, and a quasi-immortal. This is not our battlefield.'\nAfter coming to the conclusion, 30 cultivators slipped out of the crowd and began to retreat west, heading to Magpie City. They boldly ran on the road across Wu Buyi's house.\nThey had no idea that behind the house, a terrifying glutton monster always lurked there. She usually went out at night to find some games in the forest as she was bored of potatoes.\nAs the Ouyang Clan's agents ran in the dark, they didn't see very far. A few seconds later, their feet hit something large, and they stumbled.\nThe leader of the group warned his subordinates, \"Be careful. There are still logs and trees in the area.\"\nThe cultivators grumbled and kicked the ground, planning to fly instead.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nAs they started flying, 30 thorn vines were shot out from the roof of a house. They coiled around the legs of the Ouyang agents.\n\"WHAT?! NOOO!!\"\nThey realized it instantly as a pair of glowing red eyes below belonged to a nasty plant monster.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 81 – Teens Mimics Parkour Video Game and Climb Florida Man House, Get Shot and Arrested\n\"NOM-NOM!!\"\n\"DAMMIT!!\"\nCat emerged from the dark and pulled 30 cultivators to the ground. Using the newly grown thorn vines, she slammed them to the ground.\nGetting hit by the absurd dryad, the cultivators stopped being discreet and pulled out their weapons.\n\"It's do or die! KILL!\"\n\"We're not afraid of you! DIE!!\"\nThe Ouyang clansmen unleashed their elemental attacks. As they were from the intelligence unit, they came prepared. Fire beams, fireballs, fire lances, and flame swords appeared and rained upon Cat.\nThe chomper dryad giggled and pulled 10 of the cultivators toward her. Her speed surpassed their attack speed, causing the 10 men to reach her first. Then, Cat threw them at the incoming projectiles.\n\"NOOO!!\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe people turned into her human shield, and they exploded into pieces. The flame also cooked their meat, releasing an unpleasant aroma. But for Cat, it was the most delicious scent.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\n\"T-This stupid plant!\"\nThe remaining survivors realized their strength gap. They turned their attention to the thorn vines on their legs and stabbed them with their swords.\nCLANK\nRegular iron swords and steel swords failed to cut through the vines. In addition, Cat could sense the attack, and she squeezed their legs in retaliation.\nCRACK\nKRUK\nThe bone-shattering sounds stunned the cultivators. The next second, they screamed in pain and fell to the ground. Moreover, the thorns cut through their flesh and injected something into their blood circulation.\n.\n.\nThe commotion distracted the 70 agents in the building. They stopped working on the doors and walls and rushed out of the building.\nThe scream was their signal to retreat. They believed that the quasi-immortal started catching the intruders.\n\"Mission failed. We're retreating,\"\n\"Time's over! We have to leave! GO! GO! GO!\"\nDeath Sword Sect's agents whistled to notify everybody. They systematically retreated, flying straight north. On the other hand, The Fatui cultists grudgingly scrambled in every direction. As they had planned, they would rendezvous at the designated location, 10 kilometers from here.\nWHOOSH\nBut as they were dispersing, a certain daddy landed on the rooftop of his store. He hopped forward and got down, reaching the front yard.\n.\nAfter the safety landing, Leo reopened the system's mini-map. Then, he noticed that the number of intruders decreased from 100 to 90. He frowned and looked at the brightest place in front of the three houses.\n\"That damn cat is stealing my prey again. This is why I can't play around.\"\nNot allowing Cat to eat all of his prey, Leo ordered the system.\n*SNAP*\nDING\n<Collecting compensation from assailants…>\nPOOF\nPOOF\n90 red dots in the mini-map instantly vanished. Then, a series of notification messages pleased him.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 548 years…>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 512 years…>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 470 years…>\n<Your lifespan…>\nThe gain was a lot less than before as the opponents this time were weak. Leo deeply sighed and counted his fingers, calculating how much he might get from this clean-up.\n\"90 x 500. Probably 45,000ish or slightly higher, I think. Man, I wish they send more people. Do I need to start hitting some cities and enraging some people? No, no, no. What was I thinking? I'm a peace-loving man and a good seminarian. I ain't a bloodthirsty warmonger or a psychopath murderer. Yeah, maybe I killed so many people before, but self-defense doesn't count. Yeah, that's right. That doesn't count!\"\nLeo mumbled to himself as his mental health was sometimes unstable whenever he hunted. It was a side effect of living alone in a dangerous environment for too long, and he was prone to self-talking instead of thinking silently. Fortunately, the symptom went away when he was happy.\nDING\n<Current Lifespan: 129,133 Years…>\nLeo got a little more than he had estimated. He had enough for the apartment project and the parking lot. Still, he wasn't satisfied – He was still mad about the earlier system warning.\nEvery facility would be vulnerable when the humble general store reached level 10. This wouldn't bond well as any cultivator in this world could make his hard-earned investment disappear.\nLeo pondered hard. He thought of the Life Sword Sect, wondering if they could merge their sect with his and create a new organization together. That way, Leo could use them to protect his empire.\nStill, Leo couldn't relax. He thought of Tang Xuan and Ye Tianxie. As those guys seemed stronger than Hua Jiashan, these guys might not be enough to defend his shop in the future.\nLeo turned his attention to Cat, who was busy nom-noming the corpses of 10 men.\nCat didn't waste her precious food. Her roots dug into the ground, absorbing their spilled blood. Her vines collected militated pieces of meat and gathered them in her chomper mouth. As for their clothes, spatial rings, and belongings, she tossed them away.\nAs the situation was under control, Leo turned his attention to the store building. As usual, it was unscratched even though the front door was wide open. Noticing the opened door, Leo walked in and found the air containment section, which never existed before.\nThe air conditioner blew cold air from the inside. Leo deeply inhaled and sighed. Then, he approached the automatic glass doors.\nCLICKI think you should take a look at\nWHOOSH\nThey were opened and the shutter doors ascended, allowing Leo to enter the store. He turned around and closed the wooden door. Afterward, he entered the store to check on the disciples.\n\"Hmm?\"\nStrangely, none of them were on the first floor.\n\"Are they playing somewhere?\"\nCurious, Leo looked up and sniffed. He caught the scent of the disciples' bodily odor from above. Following the disciples, Leo walked up the stairs to see everybody. Upon reaching the second floor, he found a group of disciples in front of the elevator.\n\"What are y'all doing here?\" Leo walked to the elevator.\n\"S-Senior! W-We…\"\nThe disciples were relieved and astonished. They didn't sense his presence or heard his footsteps. Moreover, they were confused about how Leo got inside when the outside was swarmed by hostile cultivators.\nOne of them mustered his courage and asked Leo, \"Senior. W-What happen to the intruders outside?\"\n\"Dead.\"\n\"E-EH?!\"\n\"10 becomes cat food. The rest turns to ash. Satisfied?\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody looked at each other and cheered. They were elated and grateful that Leo protected them.\nMeanwhile, Leo counted their heads. He noticed that not everybody was present.\n\"Where are the rest of you? I only see 13 people here.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nThe disciples' faces changed color. They glanced at the elevator, afraid that they had touched something that they shouldn't have. One of them confessed, avoiding trouble.\n\"G-Gao Yan and others used this… artifact… to leave the building, elder. We were trying to flee from here when those men appeared.\"\nLeo frowned, \"Didn't I tell Wu Buyi to tell you not to leave the building at night. What the hell?\"\nThe disciples lowered their heads. They had no excuse as they were afraid of punishment.\nLeo didn't scold them. He pressed the up button to call the elevator over as he needed the people up there to come down. After all, the mystic realm portal platform was too high from the ground, and the wind was strong there.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan and his friends reached the hidden floor. They found themselves on a massive platform with four gigantic statues.\nRUMBLE\nIt was windy on the platform. As soon as everybody came out, no one managed to stand firm. They crawled on all four as they didn't want to be blown off from the sky.\n\"T-This, what is this place?!\"\nUnable to walk, they huddled behind the wolf statue, using it as a shelter from the wind. Fortunately, the statue was tall and big. The disciples managed to get their bearings.\nAfter stabilizing themselves, Gao Yan looked around. He found the floating ring, which rotated and collected Qi at the center.\nGao Yan had never seen a mystic realm portal before, so he couldn't tell by just a look. In addition, the obelisks and the statues seemed to hint at something. The disciples also forgot about the intruders – They read the label next to the wolf statue and wondered what they were.\n\"Evil Overlord?\"\nOne of them was attracted to the round creature with an anime cat face. As he had never seen such a weird creature, he walked toward it and touched the statue's surface.\n\"An evil overlord? Unfortunate evil overlord who will find a happy marriage life through fateful encounters? What is this, a prophecy?\"\nWHOOM\nSuddenly, the wolf statue's eyes moved. It looked at the disciple and glared at them while the scorpion tail obelisk emitted red light. However, the disciples didn't notice it.\nWhile everybody was mesmerized by the statues and the platform, the elevator moved down. The wolf statue's expression twitched, and the obelisk light dimmed.\nDING\nA minute later, the elevator door opened, and Leo walked out. As soon as he came out, he shouted at Gao Yan and others.\n\"Brats! What are you doing over here? This place is off-limits!\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir!\"\nGao Yan and his crew were overjoyed. If Leo was here, the assailants would no longer be a threat.\nLeo chased them back to the elevator as this place might be too dangerous. While he was at it, he opened his domain system and assigned them as employees.\nWHOOM\nGao Yan and Leo never noticed the movements of the statues. Their eyes gleamed as they watched them in silence. The wolf statue's eyes no longer emitted any light. As for the strange anima-face creature with a pair of cat ears, it smiled.\nMunya\n\"Hmm?\"\nWhile Gao Yan and others frantically rushed into the elevator, Leo heard a strange noise. He couldn't tell where it came from, but it sounded like a cat making a strange noise.\nLeo turned around and looked at the round cat-octopus monster statue. He frowned and gazed into its eyes. For some reason, Leo felt like its expression was different from when it was first built.\n\"Odd.\"\nLeo ignored the changes and ordered the disciples to head down first. He avoided the risk of directly touching them and killing them by accident.\nDING\nThe elevator moved down. As for Leo, he nonchalantly walked toward the edge of the platform and jumped down as he was immune to fall damage.\n.\nAfter Leo had left, the eyes of the four statues shifted. They gazed at the elevator for a moment. However, the cat-octopus creature giggled.\nMUNYA",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 82 – Philanthropist \"Mr. Florida Man\" Builds Apartment for Homeless People, Sued by Locals\nAfter sending the disciples back to the store, Leo resumed working at night. He walked toward the east and picked a large area near the three small houses.\nLeo opened the domain shop menu and browsed the decoration section.\n.\nStone Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 1 Year of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nAsphalt Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 3 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nConcrete Road\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 4\nPrice – 5 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 1 x 1\n.\nThere was no point in building stone roads or asphalt roads. Leo picked the best option, the concrete road. Even though he might waste a lot of lifespans, he didn't care.\nLeo began drawing, drafting a layout of a short road. He created a ten meters wide and 100 meters long concrete road, cutting between the general store and the farmlands. It headed from west to east, but it didn't connect to other roads.\n5 x 10 x 100 = 5,000 years of lifespan. It was a small price to pay as the system would automatically repair and evenly level the ground. This would serve as a walking street. Since no car existed in the cultivation world, there was no need to consider building a sidewalk. Just a plain road was enough.\nMoreover, it was more pleasant to look at, and it would somewhat get rid of the wet mud and the dirty soil. In the future, when the disciples or customers would enter and leave the store, their shoes wouldn't be so dirty.\nLeo left the road alone for now. He turned his attention to the big project – The apartment.\n.\nEmployee Apartment\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 20 x 50\n.\nIt would take a lot of space. Leo looked at the grid map while he counted his footsteps as he walked. For three hours, he surveyed the east section of his domain, designing and deciding how he should build it.\nAfter a long contemplating and calculating, Leo chose to build it five meters away from the third small house. The apartment faced toward the south so that the residents would get enough Vitamin D from sunlight all day long. Although a few residents would find it annoying, it was none of Leo's business.\nRUMBLE\nAfter choosing the place and pressing the confirm button, a two-story tall apartment was erected.\nLeo looked at it and frowned. It looked too shabby to be called an apartment. Instead, they should be called a slum motel. The rusty zinc roof, rotten wood walls, half-broken doors, windows without a cover, and dusty doorknobs looked so nasty that even homeless dudes in California might find it repulsive to live in.\nHe counted the wooden doors on the first floor and discovered that the building came with 10 rooms. Including the second floor, this motel building featured 20 rooms. However, the entire building was only 50 meters long, so the rooms seemed to be too small for a human.\nStill, Leo was optimistic. He remembered that he hadn't upgraded it yet. He touched one of the nasty walls to open the building menu.\nDING\n.\nEmployee Apartment Level 1\nApartment Size – (1/10)\nApartment Quality – (0/10)\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nLooking at the upgrade cost, Leo almost demolished the entire building. He had the urge to punch the creator of his system as the upgrade cost was too expensive.\nStill, Leo wanted his employees to have the best living condition and hygiene. He spent 70,000 years of lifespan, raising the apartment to level 8. Then, he put some points to apartment quality, increasing it to level 5. As for the rest of the points, they went to the size.\nDING\n.\nEmployee Apartment Level 8\nApartment Size – (3/10)\nApartment Quality – (5/10)\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThe building transformed. Instead of a slum-like flat, the building had two more floors, expanding the capacity to 40 rooms instead of 20. In addition, the windows, walls, doors, flooring, and the roof were no longer disgusting.\nThe walls were default brown planks. Judging from the texture, it hadn't been sanded yet. However, it looked new. As for the doors, they were made from metal and plastic. It looked fragile, but it was aesthetic enough for country bumpkins. The glass windows were barred, preventing thieves from getting inside. As for the floor, it was covered by a low-grade linoleum, protecting the hard floor from stains. However, it came in plain white color, so it looked weird.\nLeo inspected each room and found out that the rooms were bigger than they appeared on the outside. Once again, the system played with the space to fool outsiders. As for the toilets, they were still a primitive squat toilets without a bidet.\nAfter seeing the toilet, Leo facepalmed. He left the disciples to their fate if they needed to take the number two. After all, there was no tissue in this world.\n\"Do I need to teach them the three-seashell method? Meh, I don't need to. They're probably better than me.\"\nLeo stopped inspecting the toilet and checked the rooms next. Unfortunately, the apartment had only two electrical outlets, and no air conditioner or heater existed. The disciples might find this place very cold in the winter.\nAs there was nothing that Leo could do, he left the apartment building and called it a night. He would tell the disciples to move there tomorrow.\n.\n.\n3 AM, the same nightI think you should take a look at\nYe Tianxie finally arrived at Magpie City after a long detour. He slipped into Magpie City and reached the tavern. He mustered his courage and approached the second floor, where Yan Zhu had been staying.\nUpon walking up the stairs, two bodyguards of the soul transformation stage raised their hands, preventing Ye Tianxie from getting closer. They wore high-graded artifact armor, which emitted a different color.\nThe guy on the right had red armor while the other's was green. Strong fire element essence came out from the red man. As for the green guy, he was cladded in wood essence. Despite staying under a roof, they wore a metal mask and battle helmets, covering their faces.\n\"Ye Tianxie, the prince is resting. If you have anything to say, come back in the morning.\"\nYe Tianxie looked at the two bodyguards. They were the vice generals of Yan Zhu's army, and both used to be sword saints' disciples. They could use swordsmanship techniques from the Life Sword Sect and the Death Sword Sect.\nFacing the two scary swordsmen, Ye Tianxie didn't dare to provoke them. Moreover, there were four others, and they were the master of Earth, Water, Metal, and Wind Elements.\n\"Alright. Please tell His Highness that I have an urgent report.\"\nThe red general snorted, \"Just report it to me. I'll tell him.\"\n\"…\"\nYe Tianxie gave the red general a meaningful look. He turned around and walked away while he confessed his failure.\n\"The negotiation fails. The scouts are dead. Tang Xuan abandoned me and fled back to the capital.\"\nThe two generals were surprised. They rushed down the stairs and stopped Ye Tianxie from leaving. The green general grabbed the man's shoulder.\n\"Wait. What about the essence stones? What about the secret mine?\"\nYe Tianxie snorted, \"I'll report to his highness in the morning.\"\n\"You…\"\nYe Tianxie pushed the green general's hand away. Then, he picked a table to sit and meditate, waiting for the sunrise.\nThe generals didn't bother him. The red general turned around and went to the prince's room to make the report. He entered the room and discovered the prince and his four mistresses on a king-size bed.\nThe concubines were none other than the water general, wind general, metal general, and earth general. During the daytime, they served as the prince's vice generals. But during the night, they were his wives.\nThe prince and his four wives were naked, but a thick curtain blocked the general's view. The latter could only see their naked silhouettes.\nThe red general lowered his head and ignored the usual scene. He reported, \"Ye Tianxie has returned, your highness. It seems that Tang Xuan and Ye Tianxie have failed. His unit is wiped out.\"\nYan Zhu stopped playing with his wives. He sat up and talked through the curtain.\n\"What about Tang Xuan? Has that geezer died yet?\"\n\"I'm afraid not. Ye Tianxie said that he fled to the capital and abandoned him.\"\n\"That fool… Well, if that geezer fails, that only means one thing. Are we dealing with another quasi-immortal?\"\n\"That… I don't know.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe prince jumped out of the bed and pushed the curtain aside. He walked toward the red general and glared at him, \"Where is Ye Tianxie?\"\n\"He's downstairs, your highness.\"\n\"Bring me to him.\"\n\"… Yes, your highness.\"\nThe prince put on his robes and left the room. He walked to the first floor and found Ye Tianxie waiting for him at a tavern table. However, as it was nighttime, no servant came out to serve him food.\nYan Zhu calmly sat at the same table. The green general went to the kitchen and brought the prince a large wine jar full of premium wine. Then, he gently poured a cup for the prince.\nYe Tianxie also noticed the prince's arrival. He opened his eyes and knelt, \"Long live, your highness. Ye Tianxie has returned to make a report.\"\n\"Tell me,\" Yan Zhu drank the cup of wine and slammed it on the table.\nBOOM\nThe wooden table was broken in half.\n\"Ye Tianxie, where are the essence stones and the mine? Who is Florida Man? How strong is he? Also, why did Tang Xuan retreat? What happened to your unit? Tell me everything!\"\nFacing the bombardment of questions, Ye Tianxie sweated profusely. He slowly looked up and answered one question at a time.\n\"W-We face a sixth-stage plant monster. As for my unit, they…\"\nFor hours, Ye Tianxie narrated the events that he had gone through.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan reached the Cauliflower City unharmed. He rushed to the imperial palace to inform the emperor about his findings.\nAs Tang Xuan took several long strides into the palace, another quasi-immortal suddenly appeared behind him. Fortunately, the person had no intention of harming him.\nWithout looking back, Tang Xuan could tell that the quasi-immortal behind him was a thin and short elderly man from the Situ Clan. He stopped walking and asked the elder.\n\"What are you doing here, Situ Nantian?\"\nSitu Nantian snickered and took off his straw hat, \"Why? Can't I visit the emperor? I was the chancellor before you took the title from me. Also, I have every right to visit my disciple.\"\n\"The emperor doesn't need your guidance anymore, Senior Situ. Please retire quietly and let me do the job.\"\n\"Hehe. Can't I even visit my disciple? You have quite a black heart, little Tang?\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan didn't banter with his rival. He continued walking toward the emperor's palace.\nSeeing that Tang Xuan ignored him, Situ Nantian followed him to the emperor's palace. He also complained about Tang Xuan's relative.\n\"Hey, brat. It has been a while, but I have an issue with your clan's grand elder. Can you tell him not to come after me whenever I'm fishing? I'm not in the mood to make talismans when I'm enjoying my hobby.\"\n\"Tell him yourself.\"\n\"But he's your son. He will listen to you.\"\n\"He's already 800. He's an adult. He can do whatever he wants.\"\n\"Tsk. You're an irresponsible parent. No wonder your clan is in decline during these 500 years.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan remained patient. He kept walking until he reached the entrance to the throne room. There was no guard there, and the doors were wide open as if the emperor was waiting for their arrival.\nBoth old men entered the throne room and found the emperor sitting on the throne by himself. No attendant or guards remained behind as it was 3 AM.\n\"You're back early, Chancellor Tang. Also, welcome back, master.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 83 – Florida Man Teaches Children How to Brush Teeth, Eats Toothpaste and Get Hospitalized\n4 AM, Imperial Palace\nAfter listening to Tang Xuan's report, Situ Nantian looked at the chancellor in solemn. The emperor also massaged his temples as he had never expected it.\n\"An emerging celestial being, I see. This is indeed an issue.\"\nSitu Nantian suggested, \"Should we contact our ancestors and inform them?\"\nYan Xiang shook his head, \"No, we can't. He isn't breaking any mortal world's law. He suppresses his strength to the quasi-immortal stage, and he hasn't committed any taboo.\"\n\"But he killed junior cultivators?\" Situ Nantian frowned.\nTang Xuan had another opinion, \"Everything was self-defense. Daoist Florida Man never attacked anybody first. The incident yesterday occurred because the third prince's henchmen picked a fight with his pet.\"\nAs Tang Xuan chatted with Leo, he learned a bit about his personality. From his point of view, Leo wasn't a bad immortal. He seemed fair and friendly to talk to.\nIn order to prevent a mishap, Tang Xuan was determined to convince the emperor not to provoke Leo. After all, he might be the miracle that his Sixth Element Sect and the Tang Clan had been searching for.\nSitu Nantian narrowed his eyes as he saw through Tang Xuan's stance. However, as this matter was beyond his power, he shut his mouth and calculated his actions.\nAlthough Situ Nantian couldn't do anything to a celestial being, that didn't mean he would stay idle and do nothing about the matter. He secretly pulled out a communication talisman under his sleeve. When it came out, it turned to ash. However, it delivered Situ Nantian's messages to a higher realm, where his ancestors resided. After sending a cultivator's SMS, he continued observing the emperor and Tang Xuan.\nThe emperor shifted his gaze between the two seniors. He asked them for advice, \"Then, what do you think we should do?\"\nTang Xuan took the initiative, \"It's simple, actually. First, we should issue him a permanent permit to possess essence stones, so none of the princes or clans will seek trouble with him. Secondly, our status is lower than his. We should be the ones visiting him and showing him respect. That way, we can avoid unnecessary conflict and be on good terms with Celestial Florida Man. And lastly, he cultivates life force and he is selling rare herbs for lifespan. I suggest we form a trade agreement with him so that we can gather precious herbs, artifacts, and rare materials while we get on his good side. Once Celestial Florida Man becomes our friend, our kingdom will benefit from his presence, protection, and his goods.\"\nThe emperor nodded as the reason was sounding. He looked at his mentor next, \"What about you, master? Any thoughts?\"\nSitu Nantian smirked. He had another idea.\n\"Your Majesty, the laws of our mortal world are sacred. Even though Daoist Florida Man suppresses his cultivation base to be in our world, that doesn't mean that he can prolong his stay. I recommend we inform our ancestors so that they can dispatch the Heavenly Court Army to apprehend him. No celestial being should be on a mortal world!\"\nTang Xuan was stunned. Situ Nantian's words were the same as a declaration of war, and it might put countless lives in the world in danger.\n\"Are you insane?! Informing the Heavenly Court?! If they come here, not only regular people will be affected, half of the cultivators will be purged because of their overwhelming aura! Many people will die!\"\nThe emperor agreed with Tang Xuan. He had seen how terrifying his father was when he ascended, and he didn't want to feel that terrifying pressure again.\n\"He's right, master. Celestial beings are terrifying. They only need to look at us, and we will all die from their aura and presence. There's a reason why immortals create the convention laws and prevent others from descending to a mortal world.\"\nSitu Nantian was disappointed. He snorted, \"Your Majesty, I taught you once, remember? Celestial beings that don't stay in their immortal realms are scums. Cowards from those worlds always hide in a mortal world because they can't compete with their peers. They are the losers that should be removed.\"\n\"They are stronger and more talented than us, though,\" Tang Xuan rolled his eyes and mocked Situ Nantian. As the latter was older than him but they had the same cultivation base, it could be said that Situ Nantian was one of the talentless mortals, who failed to become a celestial being.\n\"…\"\nSitu Nantian closed his mouth and glared at Tang Xuan. He smacked his lips and stomped. Then, he vanished from the palace.\nNoticing that Situ Nantian left, Tang Xuan scoffed, \"Talk about cowards, there's one right there. Well, he has escaped because he can't win a debate.\"\nEmperor Yan Xiang shook his head, \"Leave it be, Chancellor Tang. By the way, is it true that immortals and celestial beings can convert vegetables and food into rare herbs? Can they turn normal spirit stones into essence stones too?\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. There is no mistake. Celestial beings condense a great amount of elemental essence in their bodies. Some of them even transform their dantians into a pocket universe to store extra essence. When one reaches the celestial stage, they can start using \"Domain Laws\", and those abilities are necessary to survive the immortal realms.\"\n\"Is that so…\"\nYan Xiang was already aware of this, but he asked Tang Xuan to make sure. He, too, had seen his father using a domain ability, and it was terrifying.\n\"Anyway,\" Yan Xiang changed the subject. \"Now that we know, there's no point investigating Magpie City and Celestial Florida Man. I'll issue an edict to summon Yan Zhu back, and I'll propose your idea in the next meeting. Also, the mystic realm portals will be open in two days. We should be ready for the expedition.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\nTang Xuan was relieved that the emperor listened to him. For now, the imperial court wouldn't end up becoming an enemy of the mysterious immortal.\n.I think you should take a look at\n.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm 6 AM, Leo's Domain\n\"HEEEOOOW.\"\nGao Yan opened his mouth wide and yawned. Last night, he barely slept as too many things happened yesterday. Moreover, he slept on the hard floor, and his back was aching.\nThe others were still asleep. Their expressions were terrible as they also struggled to rest on the hard and flat floor. Everybody was used to straw beds, so the store's cold hard floor was uncomfortable for them.\n\"Ow. Dammit. Today, I need to build my bed. Otherwise, it will be painful at night again.\"\nGao Yan stretched, and his back let out a loud crack. He gasped as he felt weird, but his back got better. After tilting his neck hard and adjusting his bones, Gao Yan was ready for the new day. But unlike modern people, he didn't brush his teeth or take a morning bath.\nWhen Gao Yan walked out of his room, he looked at the elevator. He wanted to check the strange place in the sky again as he hadn't toured enough.\nUnfortunately, as soon as he came out, he found Leo, who didn't sleep all night. The latter dragged his feet to his bedroom, and their eyes accidentally met.\n\"Oh, you,\" Leo waved his hand, calling Gao Yan over.\n\"Y-Yes, senior?\"\n\"When the others wake up, tell them to move their belongings to the new home. I built it last night.\"\n\"E-EH?!\"\nGao Yan was stunned. Last night, not only Leo took care of the intruders, but he also built their new home? He was moved.\nThe alchemy disciple was overjoyed. He saluted Leo, \"Thank you, senior! I'll go wake up the others now.\"\nGao Yan turned around and was about to drag his friends out. However, Leo tossed something light and hard to the back of his head. He stopped and turned around, scratching the back of his head.\n\"S-Senior?\"\nLeo pointed at the ground, where he had thrown a package of toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soaps on Gao Yan.\n\"Y'all stink. Go brush your teeth and take a bath in the toilet. Don't come out to work until you're clean.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan looked at the modern packages of soaps and toothpaste. In his world, the local commoners used ginger and herbs instead of liquid toothpaste. As for cultivators, they cleaned their teeth and bodies with their Qi.\nSeeing the bars of soap and toothpaste, Gao Yan was confused. He picked them up and flipped them around like a chimpanzee checking a new toy.\nLeo saw Gao Yan's reactions, and he sighed. He strode toward Gao Yan and picked up a toothbrush and a toothpaste tube. Leo unsealed the package and demonstrated how to use them.\n\"Look here. This is how you brush your teeth. Squeeze it a little, and the toothpaste will come out. Put this thing on the toothbrush. Put a bit of water on it. Then, you put it on your teeth and start brushing it. Also, don't brush them too hard. You only need to gently swipe this thing between your teeth and allow the foam to cover your mouth, not freaking SANDING it. I've seen many fools using toothbrushes as if it was toilet brush, and they leave scratch marks on their teeth. Human teeth are fragile, and they can dent! Be gentle, alright?\"\n\"…\"\nOnly half of the instruction entered Gao Yan's ears. The latter wryly smiled as he didn't understand why Leo said so much. Still, he understood the first part of the instructions.\nLeo sighed and gave up on Gao Yan. He returned to his room, \"I'mma go to sleep. Do whatever you want today after you move to the new building. Oh, you can pick any room you want.\"\nLeo entered his bedroom and locked the door.\n\"…\"\nGao Yan looked at the soap bars, toothbrushes, and toothpaste tubes. Then, he snickered, \"Okay?\"\n.\nLater that morning, there was an incident. One of the disciples mistook a tube of mint toothpaste for a treat. He swallowed the entire tube's worth of modern toothpaste and got a severe stomach ache.\nWu Buyi healed the idiot disciple and scolded him for eating strange things without asking Leo and him. Still, that disciple would have a constipation issue for weeks to come.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 84 – 20 Corpses Found Near Florida Man's Farm, \"Munch-Munch, Nom-Nom Meow\" Said the Murderer\nLate afternoon, Leo woke up and came out to check on the disciples, hoping that nobody messed up anything. When he came out, the first thing he saw was a dried stain of puke and discarded packages of toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap bars. However, no disciple was in sight.\n\"Ah, I forget to put a public trash bin in here. My fault.\"\nAs Leo was a reasonable man, he rarely blamed others or got angry at the messes someone made. He collected the junk and picked up a mop to clean the floor.\nAfter cleaning up the stains and the trash, it was time for some investigation. He needed to know who caused the messes.\nLeo went out and looked at the farmlands. Then, he flinched.\nEach farm plot was supposed to be only 100 square meters, and three farmlands shouldn't occupy a lot of lands. However, in front of Leo, each farm plot expanded to 900 square meters.\nThe first farm plot was directly opposite the general store. As Leo had ordered the farmer mannequin, it was used to grow potatoes. The second and third farm was originally next to the first farm plot. However, it was moved 10 meters away.\nLeo paused for a moment to think. Then, he smacked his forehead.\n\"Right. I moved them last night. Silly me.\"\n.\nBasic Farmland Level 8\nAutomaton Farmer – (1/1) MAX\nGrowth Speed Level – (0/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5) MAX\nProduction Quantity Level – (2/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSize: 30x30\n.\nAfter Leo upgraded the farmland to level 8, they unlocked a new feature. Instead of sticking to the 10x10 area, Leo was allowed to expand them, just like how the domain expansion worked.\nLeo spent 1,000 YOL to move a structure in the domain. Afterward, he increased the size of each farm to 30x30, allowing the mannequins and the disciples to have more work to do.\nThree 900 square-meter farmlands grew three different crops as planned. The chilies and tomatoes grew up nicely, and they were stored in the second granary.\nWhile Leo admired the farms, he noticed a few disciples in the tomato field. He went to see them and check the newly grown crops.\nJust like what had happened to the potatoes, the tomato plants were huge. Their height reach five meters, and each tomato came out in a basketball size.\nThe sizes were not the only strange thing there. The fully grown tomatoes were dark blue, and they emanated cold air. The plants and leaves were also covered by a thin layer of glacial, and the temperature on the farm was in the minus.\nStanding on the giant farm, Leo wryly smiled. He remembered why he moved them far apart.\n\"Damn farms. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you so big?! Fine. I'll check the chili farm later.\"\nLeo picked up a fresh blue tomato and carried it to the alchemy workshop. When he arrived, he found ten disciples, Gao Yan, and Wu Buyi, staring and learning the concoction method from the third workshop.\nLeo ignored them and went to the first workshop. He ordered the neck-twisting mannequin to stop making rejuvenate tea.\nThe mannequin rotated its neck to look behind. Upon finding Leo, its eyes blinked. Then, it resumed its work. A few minutes later, it completed another batch of tea. As usual, it came out as pinnacle grade, and there were two liters in the cauldron.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 8\nActive Cauldrons: (1/5)\nAlchemist Automaton (1/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5)\nProduction Quantity Level – [1/5]\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research New Ingredient]\n[Pill Making]\n.\nInvestment in the workshop was always a good thing as it kept surprising him. By just one point in the quantity level, each successful batch was doubled. The other workshop also produced 60 yang flame pills every time it completed one batch.\n'Next time, I'll add more quantity level. Once I max it, I should start mass-producing those immortal pills. I wonder how many years of lifespan the pinnacle-grade immortal pills can give me.'\nAs the cauldron was free, Leo tossed the huge tomato in the cauldron and researched it.\nIt had been a while since Leo last researched new material. He hoped that the new crop was different from the Fiery Yang Tomato in the granary.\n.\nArctic Yin Tomato\nCan only be found in a mystic realm in a freezing climate. It contains a thick amount of Water Essence, and it can be refined into water-type cultivation pills. As yin tomatoes are freezing cold, it is not recommended to use it for food as it can freeze one's blood upon consumption.\n[Pill Recipe – Yin Ice Dan]\nOne Arctic Yin Tomato\nOne Yin Catalyst\nWater Element Catalyst\nWater Essence\n.\nIt was the counterpart of the Fiery Yang Tomatoes. Leo raised his eyebrows as he was happy with this discovery. He already had too many yang flame dans, and he needed something different.I think you should take a look at\n\"Good timing. But do I have yin catalysts?\"\nLeo went to check both granaries to see if he had a yin catalyst for the recipe. Then, he checked a chest refrigerator, which he placed there to preserve rare ingredients.\nFenrir's livers, hearts, and a portion of blood were still in there. Fortunately, the fridge was locked, and Cat didn't steal them.\n\"Right. Can I substitute the yin catalyst with yin liquid? Come to think of it, I haven't collected those mutated guys yet.\"\nLeo thought of the cultivators in the northern camp that he had maimed. At first, he interrogated them about why they invaded his store, but they all died and mutated before they could confess.\nHe wondered if their blood turned into yin liquid yet. He kicked the ground, leaped over buildings, and headed north.\nWHOOSH\nIn less than a minute, Leo traveled three kilometers. He landed at the former campsite of the Death Sword Sect's agents.\nThe area was easy to spot as it was pitch black. All trees around the camp turned black, and the grasses mutated into immortal grasses. Thick Qi in the area formed a faint fog, covering the camp area.\nLeo found 20 corpses of the agents. Their flesh was already dark, and none of them no longer looked like a mammal creature anymore.\nNonchalantly but skillfully, Leo carried three of the giant corpses back to the domain. As for the others, Leo left them there so that he could come back to pick them up later. He didn't notice that the wind blew toward the north, carrying the radiation toward the Death Sword Sect.\n.\nUpon coming back, Leo put the corpses behind the junkyard. Then, he began butchering the corpses with his fingernails.\nThe grotesques bulking meat, purple fat, swelling black muscle fibers, intestine-like blood vessels, and squirming parasites came out from the cut wound. Black blood got on his hands and fingers.\nLeo smacked his lips and licked the tips of his fingers because of a habit. It tasted like rotten pork.\nQuietly, Leo hung the corpse upside down, using the recycling center's building frame as a tool. He stored the body's black blood in an empty bucket.\nPurple fat and mutated parasites came out from the wound and fell into the bucket along with the black blood. Leo rolled his eyes and grabbed one of the worms.\nThe black parasite had no eyes, but it came with a thousand legs like a centipede. Its shape and length were the same as a python, but its vicious hook mouth and blade-like tail were nightmare-inducing. Leo could tell that the disciples would have squealed like a blond in a horror movie had they seen them.\nLeo hurled the parasite into the giant hot pool of the recycling center.\nPLOP\nThe parasite fell into the acid liquid. It screeched for a moment before it vanished into atoms.\nKLUK-KLUK\nA new spirit stone came out from the recycling machine. Leo left it there and proceeded to remove other useless worms. Because nobody could do this job, Leo sat there, getting rid of the annoying pests.\n.\n.\nA day passed by quickly. Leo looked at the sky, but it was already dark. However, he hadn't finished draining the 20th body's blood and removing the parasites.\n\"All-nighter, it seems.\"\nLeo shrugged and carried the 19th bucket of black blood to the first granary. He stored them in a new upgraded chest fridge. Then, he locked it.\nCat was there when Leo brought in a new bucket of blood. She salivated and licked Leo, begging to get a dib.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"You ate a lot already. These are my alchemy materials. You can't have it.\"\n\"No Nom?\"\n\"No. No nom-nom.\"\n\"…\"\nCat pouted. She stomped out of the building and sprinted toward the north. It was unknown what she was thinking.\nLeo followed after it as he was worried about the last corpse. Unfortunately, Leo was too late. Cat snatched the wet corpse and started eating it.\n\"DAMMIT, DAMN CAT! That's mine!\"\n\"MUNCH-MUNCH NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\nCat chewed it in front of Leo to mock him. She smirked and picked up the bucket of black blood and parasites. She sipped it like tea and chewed the worms inside.\n\"Oi, that's unhealthy. Those are parasites. They probably have a billion eggs in them, and they will grow inside you. Do you want those worms to eat you from the inside?\"\n\"Nyaha, Meow!\"\n\"You can deal with them? Yeah, right. Keep that attitude, and you will get in trouble. Do you know what the people in my world always said? Around, you fuck. Find out, you will!\"\n\"Meow, Meow?\"\n\"Hah?! Who told you that?\"\n\"Munya Meow <3\"\n\"What do you mean, Great Cathulhu?\"\nCat explained to Leo that she had received a revelation from a mysterious voice after Leo had created the flying island. Also, Cat bragged that she would officially challenge the heavenly tribulation and become a proper 7th-stage monster tomorrow morning.\nLeo frowned as he found Cat's story unbelievable. He took a mental note that he would check the portal later.\n.\n.\nOn the mystic realm portal platform, the four statues remained the same. As usual, the round creature with cat ears and octopus tentacles sang in a voice that no one but Cat could hear.\nMunya",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 85 – Florida Man Goes to Picnic, Forgets Hungry Alligator at Home\nAfter losing one of his war trophies, Leo stopped collecting yin fluid. He brought the liquid to the first alchemy workshop and began a new project. He assigned the workshop mannequin to make Yin Ice Dan instead of rejuvenate tea.\nAfter assembling the ingredients, the workshop automatically began the work. The usual timer appeared.\n2 Hours, 59 Minutes, 58 Seconds…\nSimilar to Yang Flame Dans, its counterpart also required three hours to make.\nRUMBLE\nPurple aura leaked cold air from the cauldron. Soon, the area around the workshop was as chilly as the winter wind. In contrast, the second workshop was still as hot as ever as the yang flame dans increased the temperature around the building.\nWhen the heat and cold air collided, it produced clouds. Under the flying platform, rain clouds gathered.\nWu Buyi quickly noticed the changes. He looked up and found rain clouds under the flying island. Moreover, he sensed thick water and fire element in there. He gulped, unable to imagine what the rain would be like. He wondered if he should wait outside and cultivate.\nUnable to contain his curiosity, Wu Buyi approached Leo to ask him.\n\"Lord Florida Man, sir.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Umm, what have you been doing? A-And, what are the pills that you're making?\"\n\"Yin Ice Dans.\"\n\"Y-Yin pills?!\"\nWu Buyi was astonished. He was aware that Leo had mastered many elements, but he didn't expect him to be good at Yin Element too.\nYin Element was exclusive to demon races, monsters, and women. In this world, only women and a few talented cultivators could cultivate them. However, if a man carelessly took in too much Yin Qi, he would mutate into monster. To maintain one's physical balance, male cultivators usually took supplements or cultivate yang element to suppress the rampaging yin Qi.\nSeeing that Leo could create both Yin and Yang pills, Wu Buyi trembled in excitement. He couldn't wait to learn Leo's cultivation techniques and secrets by observing him up close.\nWhile Wu Buyi was awestruck, Leo remembered that he hadn't used the mystic realm portal yet. He asked the alchemist.\n\"If I remember correctly, you once said something about the mystic realm expedition. What's an expedition?\"\nWu Buyi's eyes sparkled. He thought that Leo would join Life Sword Sect's expedition team.\n\"Yes, yes! I'll explain. You see, every three months, all mystic realm portals on the mainland automatically open, and we can send 10 people in per gate. Every sect and clan is allowed to control one portal, and Life Sword Sect has one. You see, the mystic realms are rich with element Qi and natural resources, so every cultivator competes to earn a spot to join the expedition. When we enter the mystic realms, we have about 10-15 days to finish exploring, cultivating, and gathering whatever resources we can find. But there's always an issue since there are monster beasts, demons, and unknown creatures in every mystic realm. Sometimes, we ran into immortals, and we were forced to abort the expedition. Well, a lot of stuff happens, and things can go south very quickly.\"\n\"And you lunatics compete to get in?\"\n\"... Yes.\"\nWu Buyi's pupils expanded and glittered as he seemed excited. Leo listened to him and pursed his lips as he still couldn't imagine what it would be like.\n\"Say, Wu Buyi.\"\n\"Y-Yes, my lord?\"\n\"Will you join the Life Sword Sect's expedition team you talked about?\"\nWu Buyi sulked as he thought of Han Hao and the sect. He confessed, \"I'm afraid I can't. I missed the sect's meetings, and they've already chosen the expedition members. I'm going to sit out this season.\"\nLeo nodded. He wiggled his finger, gesturing for Wu Buyi to follow him. The latter walked after Leo like a puppy following his owner.\nBoth men entered the store and reached the elevator. Leo put on the hazmat suit and helmet, preventing him from directly touching Wu Buyi by accident. Then, he got in the elevator.\n\"Come in.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi nervously entered the small glass room, and the metal doors were closed behind him. Leo pressed the cloud button, and the lift transformed both men to the mystic realm portal platform.\n\"EH?! WHAT?!\"\nIt was Wu Buyi's first time riding an elevator. Unlike the young disciples, he managed to maintain his balance, but he still panicked.\nDING\nAfter the elevator reached the top floor, the doors were open. Leo led the alchemist to the center of the platform.\nWu Buyi gulped and followed Leo to the massive ring. He also looked at the four statues, which seemed to be staring down at him. Although Wu Buyi had seen the mystic realm portal of this place before, it used to be a lot smaller than this. He was shocked when he saw the massive changes.\nLeo pointed at the rotating ring, \"This is my mystic realm portal, and I'm planning to activate it tomorrow.\"\n\"!!!\" Wu Buyi's round eyes were so large that they rivaled Japanese anime characters. He prayed that Leo would invite him to join him, \"D-Does that mean…?\"\n\"I can bring two people with me. Wanna come along?\"\n\"YES, PLEASE!! YES!! YES!! YES-YES-YES-YES-YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!! WOOOOOO!!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi jumped around like SpongeBob yes meme. Saliva and drool came out from his mouth while he was in tears.\nUnable to look at Wu Buyi's unsightly state, Leo facepalmed and rolled his eyes. He waited for the crazy old man to get back to his senses.\nTwo minutes later, Wu Buyi panted and clenched his chest. Like a weak and sick elder, he looked like he was having a heart attack after a light workout.\n\"Oh, god. My heart. Please forgive me, my lord…\"\nLeo nodded in understanding. He had been in a similar condition before when he was a human, \"Don't worry. We're all old. I know how that feels.\"\nWu Buyi sat down and paced his breathing. Leo tossed him a water canteen, filled with pinnacle rejuvenate tea. The former caught it and drank everything in glee.\nThe alchemist didn't notice it, but he drastically grew younger. Instead of looking like a 70-year-old mummy, he looked like a well-built man in his 50s. He also grew a fullbeard.\nCurious, Leo checked Wu Buyi's status again.I think you should take a look at\n.\nName: Wu Buyi\nAge: 108\nRemaining Lifespan: 1,045 Years, 3 Months, 26 Days, 10 Hours\n.\nLeo frowned. The last time he checked, Wu Buyi only had 400ish years to live. It seemed that he had been working hard or making progress in cultivation.\n\"Tell me, Wu Buyi.\"\n\"Yes, master?\"\n\"How many pills have you eaten since the last time you received the commission.\"\nWu Buyi pondered. He counted his fingers and looked up, \"Probably 20ish. I usually eat the best pills I concoct while I give the rest to the sect or my customers. Why?\"\nThat was scummy, Leo thought.\n\"Won't the sect or the customers cuss you that you stole the pills?\"\n\"Even if they know, they can't do anything, master. This is the perk of our occupation. We usually made more than 10 pills per batch so why not eat one or two and tell them we made 8? If they complain about it, we just eat them all and tell the customers that we failed. What are they gonna do if we eat the pills we were supposed to give to the customers? They can't do crap! If they want us to make pills, we get dictate how many pills they will get! Simple!\"\nLeo gapsed in shock.\n\"You sick bastard. How could you take advantage of your precious customers? You dirty dog is so dispicaple that I have no word to describe you, Wu Buyi. You're a freaking genius! I love that idea and what you did! Amazing!\"\n\"Hehehe, thank you, master!\"\nHe found Wu Buyi's idea ingenious and nodded at him in approval. Still, Leo suspected that Wu Buyi already made them since he had immortal grass. He ignored the unethical behavior of Wu Buyi and continued asking.\n\"By the way, did you make longevity pills or something?\"\n\"Of course not, master. How could I? Those pills take years to make, and I need a heart of a 9th-grade monster. I'm planning to get that from the imperial court's auction house after this season's expedition.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had a bad feeling about this. If the longevity pills took years to make, would the workshop take months to finish one batch? He shook off the thoughts and prevented his ADHD to act up. Then, he went back to the main topic.\n\"This portal is still new, and it only allows three people to get in at a time. Including you and me, there's one more spot. Go pick one of your disciples here and tell him to get ready by tomorrow morning. Finish everything you need to do.\"\n\"YES, MY LORD!\"\nWu Buyi laughed and ran toward the edge of the platform. Before Leo could say anything, the guy jumped down and flew toward his house.\n\"…\"\nLeo was speechless. He wondered if Wu Buyi had a hysterical issue or if he was infected by the Florida Man's disease.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo prepared for the expedition, the other sects also prepared theirs. The Life Sword Sect already briefed the expedition members about what to bring along and what not to do inside.\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan returned to his pavilion and rested on a chair. He let out a long sigh and emptied his mind.\nBZZ\nUnfortunately, someone contacted him via telepathy. A voice transmission rang in his mind, and the voice belonged to his son, Tang Ting. The message echoed.\n'Father, will you return home and join us in this season's expedition? I've peeked into the crack, and I think we're going to a forest type next.'\nTang Xuan waved his hand even though Tang Ting couldn't see him.\n\"Nah, I'm exhausted. You and the Sixth Element's elders can go. Also, don't forget to pick five disciples with you. Our clan has 10 seats, and the sect has 10 seats, right? Allocate five for the disciples in the sect, and give five to the clan's children. As for the rest, share them among the elders.\"\n'If you say so, Father. Well, take care of yourself. You've been working so hard lately. I can't even go and see you.'\n\"Worry about yourself, you damn brat. You're 800, but you're acting like you're 16. Think of your image as the Clan Leader!\"\n'Hehe. Sorry, father. Old habit.'\nHis son hung up the call. Tang Xuan rubbed his temples and leaned back. He then thought about what he had done so far.\n\"Because of those idiots, we provoked that immortal. This is troublesome…\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Sixth Element Sect gathered five promising disciples in front of their mystic realm portal. One of the elders looked at the winners of their sect's internal tournament for a moment before he shifted his gaze toward a young alchemist.\nThe alchemist used to have pimples everywhere when he was just a Qi condensation stage. But now, he became a refined young man, and many female commoners admired him.\nThe elder called the champion of the recent tournament, \"Jin Yong! You will be the captain of the disciple team! As you're the strongest alchemist here, make sure you protect the others!\"\n\"Yes, senior!\"\nJin Yong, a former customer of Leo, smiled at the elder. He once bought poison grain pills from Leo, and he raised his cultivation base to the first rank of the golden core stage by consuming those pills.\nHe had recently been promoted to a core disciple of the Sixth Element Sect after that tournament. Many elders competed to take him in as their direct disciples, but he coudln't accept them as a master yet. After all, a certain Tang Clan member had an eye on him.\n\"Go pack your belongings and come back here tomorrow morning. Make sure that you have enough grain pills, healing pills, and life-saving talismans. We're not going on a picnic! Don't forget about the danger, especially you, Jin Yong! Even if Senior Tang Ting favors you, you can always screw up and get yourself killed in there!\"\n\"… Yes, senior.\" Jin Yong pouted.\n\"You're dismissed! Don't be late!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 86 – Florida Man Travels Abroad for a Month and Leaves His Infant Daughter Home\nAfter sending Wu Buyi away, Leo visited the clothing store. He wondered what the weird mannequin was doing after he had assigned her a job.\nUpon getting into the clothing store, Leo dropped his jaw. He thought that he entered a woman's fashion store – Glittering evening dresses lined up in rows and stacked into a wall. After a rough counting, there were at least 200 or so.\nThe cat-eared mannequin tilted her head when she saw Leo, but her thousand small needle arms never stopped weaving a new dress.\nLeo picked one of them up. It was a one-piece dress that Hollywood actresses loved to wear as it revealed a lot of skin. However, there was something special. As Leo touched the dress, the clothing store menu appeared and revealed the attributes of the cloth.\n.\nEvening Dress of Virgin Yin Yang\nMade from the skin of a supreme being. Grant physical attack immunity effects to the wearer. Cannot be destroyed by Qi attacks or physical attacks. Automatically provide yin and yang element essence to the wearer.\nYou're not planning to wear this, are you?\n.\n\"…\"\nLeo frowned as the system mocked him. He facepalmed and looked at the cat-ear mannequin.\n\"Alright. I guess it's time for you to try something new.\"\nLeo explored the online shopping system and purchased something he always wanted to have – a pair of shorts! The temperature never went over 70 Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) at noon, and it dropped to 50 (10 Celsius) at night. However, as someone who had lived 50,000 years in a freezing cold world, this world's temperature was uncomfortable. He always had the urge to take off his robes and roll with his trusty shorts.\nHe bought the softest shorts that beach-goers loved. Then, he passed it to the maid mannequin.\n\"Make this instead. I need five of these for my daily wear. I'm tired of wearing loose robes.\"\n\"…\"\nThe cat ear maid took the shorts and inspected them. She nodded several times and resumed making the last evening dress. This time, she didn't bother asking for Leo's skin as if she still had plenty of energy to make more threads.\nDING\n<You have researched swim shorts.>\n<Your automaton will try to create a better version of swim shorts.>\nLeo left the worker alone. While he was at it, he updated the clothing store's status.\n.\nClothing Store Level 8\nAutomaton Worker (0/5)\nAutomaton Weaver – (1/5)\nWeaver Skills – (5/5) MAX\nStore Quality – (2/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Research]\n.\nLeo thought about adding more workers, but the quality was a must. Currently, the clothing store still required a lot of improvement as the interior was too small, compared to the other buildings. 90% of the interior was made of wood, which didn't suit the atmosphere of a clothing store.\n'Before those women return, I should get this store ready. There are a lot of things to buy – display mannequins, cloth hangers, cloth displays, and changing rooms. Hell, I don't think level 3 or 4 in a quality store is enough. I need to max that, but I might need to upgrade the general store to level 11. Then… the store will be vulnerable… DAMMIT!'\nLeo scratched his head, having a headache. He couldn't figure out how he could improve the security in his shop domain in a week as Hua Jiashan and his subordinates were too weak.\nHe required a more useful underling.\n'Haiya. I wish this world was like one of those Chinese novels. I wish a protagonist or heaven's chosen one would visit my store and serve me or something. I need a super strong guy, goddammit!'\n.\n.\n\"ACHOOO!!\"\nGao Yan sneezed while he listened to Wu Buyi's instructions. He rubbed his nose in confusion, wondering how a cultivator like him got sick.\nWu Buyi smirked at Gao Yan, \"What? Are you nervous that I choose you?\"\nAfter Leo entrusted Wu Buyi to select someone to come along, the latter went directly to his core disciple, Gao Yan. He was in the middle of teaching his disciple survival skills.\nBefore Wu Buyi could finish lecturing, Gao Yan sneezed and interrupted him. The former was amused.\n\"Seriously, cultivators like us rarely get sick, but you actually sneeze? It appears that you haven't solidified your foundation enough. A foundation establishment stage cultivator should be immune to common diseases and illnesses, except external poison. Well, it's different if you cultivate poison element.\"\nGao Yan tilted his head and showed his master a spirit stone, which Leo had distributed to every disciple as compensation for the previous incident. As it came directly from the recycling center, it contained all types of element Qi.\n\"Actually, master. I think I'll be able to cultivate a new element soon. I can somewhat manipulate fire and water now, thanks to Senior Florida Man's spirit stone.\"\n\"YOU WHAT?!\"\nWu Buyi almost vomited blood when he noticed the quality of the spirit stone. It was a hundred times better than spirit stones in the market as its Qi was fresh and thick. Even Wu Buyi was jealous that Gao Yan had it.\nGao Yan also dropped a light bomb, revealing his little secret.\n\"Also, master. When I went up to the flying island, I had a thought. What if I cultivate all elements at the same time and harmonize them this way? Will that work? Also, I sensed that on the island, there's a lot of an unknown element Qi. I think it's related to wind or storm? Master, what do you think?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi widened his eyes and looked at Gao Yan in disbelief. He pressed his finger on Gao Yan's left wrist to feel his pulse and his internal Qi. Then, he sensed multiple elemental Qi inside him.\nFire Qi, Water Qi, Earth Qi, Metal Qi, Wind Qi, Poison Qi, and Wood Qi swirled inside him. Moreover, his virgin blood produced thick yang Qi, maintaining his bodily balance.\n\"You… are you really my disciple?\" Wu Buyi was speechless.\n\"Of course, I am. Why?\"I think you should take a look at\nWu Buyi suddenly burst into laughter. He thought that he had hit the jackpot.\nGao Yan was not just talented, but he might be a genius that every major sect craved for. If Wu Buyi managed to nurture Gao Yan well, the latter might grow up into a supreme expert, surpassing every quasi-immortal in this world.\n\"I'm glad I chose you, Gao Yan! Very well, I'll make you the strongest alchemist in Yan Empire!\"\n\"…Okay?\"\n\"Be more enthusiastic, damn brat! Recite what I taught you earlier! What will you do if you encounter a stronger monster beast in the mystic realm?!\"\n\"Err… Oh, right. Toss meat at it and slowly walk backward while staring at the monster!\"\n\"Good. What about multiple beasts?\"\n\"Throw a pheromone potion and a blood pack at one of them. Then, run.\"\n\"Good. What about a weaker monster?\"\n\"Catch it ASAP!\"\n\"YOU FOOL!\"\nBONK!\nWu Buyi smacked Gao Yan's head and scolded him, \"You can't tame monster beasts! Only soul-formation cultivators or stronger cultivators like Lord Florida Man can tame them!\"\nThe lecture continued…\n.\n.\nThe next day morning, Leo and Wu Buyi instructed the disciples to resume their routines and cultivate diligently as they would leave the domain for at least two weeks.\nThe disciples weren't stupid. They had seen the mystic realm portal platform, and they figured that Wu Buyi and Leo would join the seasonal expedition. Thus, they looked at Gao Yan in envy.\n\"Lucky you.\"\n\"Damn ass kisser.\"\n\"Hey, he's Elder Wu's disciple for a reason.\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nNot everybody was happy with Gao Yan, who was chosen behind the scene.\nSeeing their expressions, Leo figured out how they felt. He came up with a solution.\n\"Because of my absence, your work might be more difficult. Therefore, I'll give everybody here a bonus. For every day you do your job perfectly, I'll give you one spirit stone. Don't be sad, okay?\"\nHearing that they would get one spirit stone per day, the disciples were delighted. Nobody was mad anymore.\nAfter calming the angry crowd, Leo led Wu Buyi and Gao Yan to the elevator. They then ascended to the flying platform while the disciples sent them off.\nUpon getting back to the portal, Leo rechecked Gao Yan and Wu Buyi's status and belongings. As usual, they didn't carry anything on them except a few rings. On the other hand, Leo came with a backpack, full of water supply and a box of grain pills and water element grain pills for emergency.\nAs everybody was ready, Leo activated the portal. The flying ring stopped spinning. It began consuming Qi and created a three-meter diameter oval portal.\nDING\n<You have activated the Mystic Realm Portal. The destination is [Planet Rabbit Trent A-3].>\n<Generating information and objectives.>\n.\nPlanet Rabbit Trent A-3\nLocal beasts are the lords of this unexplored world. As it is thick in wood and earth Qi, the local monsters excel in defense and self-regeneration. However, due to the recent infestation of Sweet Dream Mushroom, a portion of this world is not suitable for weak cultivators to explore. Please thread with caution.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 – Kill Rabbit Trent King.\n2 – Absorb Gnosis of Rabbit Trent King.\nSecondary Objective:\n1 – Locate Entity Fate Crystal in Sweet Dream Mushroom Forest\n2 – Absorb Entity Fate Crystal.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Exploration Rewards: 3 Free Tickets, Ownership of Planet Rabbit Trent A-3\nSecondary Rewards: 1 Lucky Draw\n.\n<The portal will close in 34 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 57 seconds. Good luck.>\nFor once, the system finally gave Leo some quests. He was excited to see something different.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi and Gao Yan couldn't see the quest panel or the system screen. They gazed at the portal and gulped, waiting for Leo to take the lead.\nWHOOSH\nThe wind on the platform got stronger, and Gao Yan fell to his knees as he couldn't maintain his balance. Wu Buyi immediately grabbed his disciple's collar and dragged him to the portal first.\nAfter seeing the two eager cultivators crossing the gate, Leo followed them. But before he went in, he glanced at the four statues.\nFor an unknown reason, Leo felt like they were laughing at him. He wondered what they were. He ignored them and entered the portal.\nAs soon as Leo crossed the gate into another world, the ball-like cat statue let out a sound again.\nMunya",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 87 – Florida Man Bitten by Amazon Crocodile While Catching Wild Chickens for Dinner\nEntering the portal, Leo found himself in a dense jungle. In front of him was a series of mangroves and a large transparent river. Tropical trees packed together, forming a natural wall. The bushes and plants covered the entire ground that Leo, Gao Yan, and Wu Buyi couldn't see anything underneath.\nThe greenish smell hit their noses, and Gao Yan coughed. He shut his eyes and sat on the ground, meditating and circulating his Qi right away.\nWu Buyi also narrowed his eyes. He summoned his flame spirit avatar and created a flame dome around them. A few seconds later, the scent vanished, replaced with fresh air.\nLeo raised his eyebrows and observed the two. He had no idea what they were doing and why they were doing so. From his perspective, nothing was unusual, and the air was fresh. However, these guys seemed to be worrying about something.\n\"What's up? Can't handle fresh air?\" Leo grinned.\nWu Buyi wryly smiled. He wanted to complain that this mystic realm's wood element essence was too thick, and it was suffocating. He had to create a fire dome to filter out wood essence from getting in. Otherwise, Gao Yan would have died from Qi deviation.\n\"Please don't mind us, my lord. We can remain here and guard the portal. You can go and explore the mystic realm. Also, if you find anything good, please don't forget a souvenir.\"\n\"I'm surprised you know that word. Anyway, there's no hurry. The portal will remain open for 34 days, so I'm going to help you set up a camp here first.\"\n\"Wait, what?! 34 DAYS?!\"\nWu Buyi was stunned. Normally, gates automatically closed after 10-14 days, depending on the difficulty of each realm. But here, Leo nonchalantly said that the portal would stay for a month.\nHe was excited. With over 30 days, there were many things they could do. For example, the regular plants and trees around here were rich in wood essence. Just by inhaling a mouthful of air, he already gained one year's worth of Qi.\nLeo didn't wait for Wu Buyi to react. He walked toward a palm tree with a barbed red trunk. Similar to the pine trees near the Magpie City, this palm tree was over five meters in diameter. No matter how Leo looked at it, it was abnormally large.\nIgnoring the pointy surface and the sharp needles, Leo grabbed it and pulled it up.\nRUMBLE\nThe massive palm tree was uprooted.\nWu Buyi dropped his jaw as he gazed at the giant tree being lifted with one arm. Although he used to work out and lift logs before, he had never seen anybody uproot a tree with one arm. But what came next shocked Wu Buyi.\nLeo turned around and threw the massive palm tree into the portal like a javelin!\n\"!!!\"\nWu Buyi gasped and dodged the flying tree. A sharp root grazed his head, cutting a few strands of hair.\nWHOOSH\nThe tree disappeared into the portal, leaving Wu Buyi stunned. He had never seen someone transferring a natural resource through a portal this way as most cultivators simply stored their items in their spatial rings.\nLeo didn't stop there. He looked below and grabbed a snake-like Aloe Vera. He uprooted the entire plant and hurled it to the portal. Then, he turned around and began pulling weeds and tropical plants in the area.\nWu Buyi gulped and wanted to tell Leo to entrust this task to him. However, he couldn't utter a word as he noticed something. As soon as Leo's hand touched the dark green plants, everything turned black, and the characteristic of the plants drastically changed.\nThe alchemist widened his eyes. He finally witnessed how Leo turned regular fruits and plants into fine treasures.\n\"This… This must be why! This is his power all along!\"\nWu Buyi was elated. He believed he had made the right choice following Leo. At the same time, he regretted that his friends didn't get to see it.\n'Han Hao, you're a fool! You should have sworn allegiance to Lord Florida Man when you had a chance! Now, I'm going to monopolize everything! Hehehehe!'\nWu Buyi rubbed his hands while he filtered and dilute the wood essence in the air so that both he and Gao Yan wouldn't die from Qi deviation.\nFor a whole day, Leo did nothing fancy. He uprooted everything and threw them into the portal, collecting every resource he found.\n.\nAt night, changes occurred to Gan Yan. Green aura burst out from his body, followed by a rainbow light. It was faint, but his aura was similar to Leo's.\nFire, water, wind, earth, wood, and metal Qi gathered in Gao Yan's dantian and muscle fibers. As soon as wood essence in the air touched his skin, it got stuck on him, and they were slowly absorbed into his pores.\nRUMBLE\nThe presence of Gao Yan and his cultivation base changed. He reached the golden core stage, aka the 4th stage. His dantian volume expanded, and his dantian began refining a gold core inside him.\nWu Buyi quietly watched over his disciple with a bright smile. He was proud of him, and he was excited for his future.\n\"Less than a month ago, you're just a weak Qi condensation stage cultivator. Look at you. You've advanced two major realms within a month!\"\nWhile solidifying his cultivation base, body, and dantian, Gao Yan looked at his mentor, \"It's thanks to you and Senior Florida Man.\"\n\"Of course! Now, take your time and absorb as many drops of wood essence as you can.\"\nWu Buyi was relieved that Gao Yan was no longer in danger. He sat cross-legged and began meditating, cultivating the surrounding essence as well.\nWHOOSH\nBoth men ignored the whizzed sound of flying logs, plants, and random objects. Soon, their mind entered a trance, and they stopped hearing the noises.I think you should take a look at\nMeanwhile, Leo cleared the land and created an elevated area, which was suitable to build a campsite. He lit up a campfire, giving everybody a source of light and heat.\nAfter setting up a place for Wu Buyi and Gao Yan to rest, Leo looked around, scanning the area. As he paid more attention, he noticed that over 300 lifeforms had been lurking and watching his every movement. More than half came from the mangrove river nearby.\nLeo's infrared eyes followed their life signature and looked up. Then, he found a dozen lion-sized chickens, standing on the top of mangrove trees. Their red eyes glowed in the dark, but they maintained a distance from him.\nAfter seeing the weird chickens, Leo salivated. He missed the good-old fried chickens.\n\"…Chickens. Oh, right. I haven't built the goddamn livestock shed. Can I capture these mofos and bring them home?\"\nLeo chortled like a villain. He kicked the ground and vanished from where he stood. Less than a second later, he stood behind the horde of chickens.\nUpon getting a closer look, Leo discovered that they were not ordinary chickens. Each chicken had three snake tails, and they had four legs. In addition, their eyes emitted something that made Leo recall the ancient legends.\nCRACK\nAs soon as his eyes met with the chickens' red pupils, Leo's skin hardened. His muscles became rigid as if they were turning into a stone.\nDespite being on the verge of being petrified, Leo shrugged.\n\"I finally remember. Those yellow lightning bolts back in the day also petrified me as you did. Those days were hell. I even lost two legs when I first got hit by those. Well, thanks to that, my body learns how to regenerate lost body parts and repair my DNA.\"\nBOOM\nA thick layer of petrified arm skin came off. Then, Leo's eyes reddened.\n\"POKOK?!\"\nThe cockatrices were confused about how Leo hadn't been turned into stone yet. They kept staring at him, waiting for him to become a stone statue, so they could feed on him.\nHowever, as soon as Leo's eye color changed, he was no longer affected by the petrification stare. He seized the necks of two cockatrices with bare hands.\n\"First off, let's see how your meat will taste after I mutate you. If you suck, I'll just put on gloves and put you in a cage!\"\n\"POKOK!!!\"\nThe two cockatrices squirmed in pain. Their feathers and hairs fell off while the sharp claws of their legs scratched Leo's face and chest. However, they failed to leave a scratch wound on him. Two seconds later, their skin turned yellow-brown as if someone had painted them with turmeric. After three additional seconds, they ceased resisting.\n\"Five seconds. Welp, I don't have to remove your feathers. Thanks a lot.\"\nLeo ignored the remaining cockatrices on the tree and returned to the campsite. He tossed the two lion-sized chickens there and looked at Wu Buyi.\n\"Wu Buyi, I have a job for you. Can you cook these while I'm hunting?\"\nWu Buyi wanted to retort that he had to cultivate. He reopened his eyes and was about to refuse. But then, his eyes noticed the two large carcasses of chickens.\nAs a veteran, Wu Buyi recognized them right away.\n\"E-Earth Cockatrices?! Aren't those 6th-stage cockatrices, my lord?!\"\n\"6th stage, 7th stage, I don't care. Just cook these damn chickens. It's unfortunate that we don't have vegetable oil here or I would have deep fried these. Oh, well, just BBQ them, boil them, or sashimi them. I don't care which. I just want some good damn chickens!\"\n\"…\"\nAfter entrusting a troublesome job to Wu Buyi, Leo vanished. He reappeared on the same mangrove tree, where the herd of cockatrice chickens were.\n\"Alright, which one of you wants to be my livestock? If you resist, I'll kill you. If you surrender, I'll spare you for now, but I'll kill you later. Any smart ass that wishes for the third option, I'll deep fry you alive. Now, make your pick.\"\n\"…POKOK?!\"\nThe cockatrices seemed to understand a human language. They were fumed with rage, and they swarmed Leo. They pecked, clawed, and bit his arms and legs.\nLeo burst into laughter as they did something stupid. Five seconds later, all chickens lost all their feathers, and they fell from the tree one by one.\nFlorida Man collected his findings and tossed them toward the campsite. However, he failed to catch one of them, and it fell into the river.\nPLOP\nRainbow color, the radiation contamination, spread from the corpse. It slowly spread along with a calm wave and turned colorless.\nLeo ignored the contamination process as he didn't need to be considerate of the local humans. He got down from the tree and shoved his arm into the river, trying to get the chicken back. He managed to grab one of the chicken's legs.\nBut as Leo was about to pull it out of the river, something tickled him.\nCHOMP\n\"…\"\nLeo looked into the river. When he discovered what it was, his eyes sparkled as if he was a child looking at his favorite toy.\nThere was a black glossy caiman crocodile in the river.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 88 – Florida Man Practices Entomophagy While Touring Amazon Jungle, Gets Bitten by Amazonian Wasps, Tarantula, Black Caiman, and Snakes\nBefore the fallout apocalypse, alligators were one of many exotic pets that Floridians could own. Leo also used to have a license for keeping a few alligators in his backyard. He loved feeding and toying with these guys as he found them cute regardless of their sizes.\nCaimans were different from Florida alligators. Their perky eyes were higher, and their jaws were broader but shorter than alligators. Because of their smaller mouth, their bite strength was incomparable to crocodiles and alligators.\nHowever, black caimans were another story. They were the biggest water monsters among all caimans, which could grow longer than four meters.\nMoreover, the guy in the river doubled that size. It had four eyes and a forehead horn as if it cosplayed a unicorn. The sharp fangs and strong jaws also managed to dent Leo's skin by half a centimeter.\nZAAAAA\nThe caiman's hunting method was similar to other alligators and crocodiles. As soon as it caught Leo's arm, it tried to pull him into the river. However, it failed to move the old man.\nRealizing that it failed its first attempt, the black caiman initiated the barrel-roll maneuver, trying to twist Leo's arm off.\nCRACK\nUnfortunately, what came off was a few of its teeth. Its other fangs also slipped off, and it let go of his arm.\n\"…\"\nLeo watched how the cute guy try to eat him. He shook his head and glanced at the contaminated water. Then, he deeply sighed.\n\"Shame. I wish I could catch you alive. Well, RIP ecology. This entire river is doomed.\"\nLeo pulled up the last cockatrice and threw it to Wu Buyi. He then took off his clothes and jumped into the river to fetch the croc.\nThe water was clear and transparent. Leo opened his eyes underwater and gazed at the caiman, who seemed indifferent after touching Leo's skin. He crossed his arms and waited for it to mutate.\nBetraying Leo's expectation, the caiman regrew its fangs. Moreover, instead of dying because of his radiation, the caiman's scales seemed bigger, and its horn shone. Its four eyes reddened, and they began gathering element essence in the water.\nPU-PU\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo looked at his arms as something small and sharp hit his arms again. However, upon looking at the arms, Leo saw nothing but traces of bullets in the water.\n\"Oh?\"\nHe finally realized that the caiman hit him with invisible water bullets, but they caused no damage.\nThe attack didn't stop there. The caiman screeched underwater. Then, the horn emitted a strong electric blast and zapped Leo.\nBZZZ\nSmall branches of yellowish static electricity and flashing light around the caiman caused the water to ripple into a small circle wave. The shockwave directly hit Leo and numbed his skin. His hair was also slightly curled because of the electric shock.\nThe corner of Leo's mouth curved down. Not only this caiman resisted the mutation, but it also benefited from the radiation. It reminded Leo of the monsters on Earth, which became so strong because of the nuclear fallout and natural radiation.\nMoreover, the electric shock earlier had the same strength as the yellow lightning bolts that Leo had experienced during his fourth mutation. Because of it, Leo suffered through countless curses and status ailments until his cancer cells became immune to every condition.\nAs the caiman reminded him of something unpleasant, Leo stopped messing around. He lightly snorted and leaned his body forward. The next second, he jetted through the water at Mach 5, ramming the caiman.\nBOOM\nThe river exploded, and the caiman was sent flying from the river to the sky.\nBOOM\nLeo also jumped out and caught the caiman's leg. Floating in the sky, he delivered a normal punch to its chest.\nBOOM\nThe punch instantly blasted the caiman's thick skin and the innards through the back, leaving a gaping hole. However, the hole was too large. It separated the head and the lower torso of the caiman.\nBecause of the momentum, Leo ended up leaping several kilometers away from the river. He used this opportunity to look around him to scout the geography of this place.\nTo the north, there was a pyramid in the middle of the jungle. To the east, a town of skyscraping pagodas stood out from the rest. In the south, there was nothing worthwhile except the massive river that flowed to the sea. As for the west, a series of dildo-like mountains stood tall, penetrating the clouds in the sky.\nAlthough many landmarks attracted Leo, they were at least 100 kilometers away. Leo could barely see them on the horizon.\nWHOOSH\nLeo soon descended and landed on the soft ground. The caiman's lower abdomen carcass also fell nearby. Not wasting his food, Leo rushed to pick up his game.\nSSSSAAK\nLeo had no idea what he had stepped on, but he sensed several small mouths on his legs. He looked down and found five colorful snakes latching on his ankles and shins. As they could do nothing to him, he shrugged and ignored them.\nEvery step Leo took turned the lush green jungle black. Plants, grass, bushes, trees, and small animals received his blessing and mutated at a rapid rate.\nAfter 10 seconds of pushing through the high bushes, Leo found the caiman's corpse. He picked it up and carried it on his shoulder.\nDOK-DOK\nSomething fell from the wound of the caiman. A hard ball landed on the tip of his right foot's fingers, and Leo flinched. The object was hard. Although it caused him no damage, it reminded him of the greatest pain when he was a human.\nLeo crouched and looked at the object. He found a red orb, which was the same size as an apple. He picked it up and brought it with him, hoping that Wu Buyi could identify it.\nBOOM\nOnce again, Leo kicked the ground and leaped to the sky. His destination was the previously cleared land. Unfortunately, he used too much strength, and he flew over the campsite.\nWhile flying in the sky, Leo shouted at Wu Buyi.\n\"WU BUYI, CATCH!\"\nLeo threw the caiman's corpse and the apple-sized orb to the ground. Then, he waved his hand at the alchemist.I think you should take a look at\nWu Buyi looked up in confusion. When the corpse smashed to the ground five meters away from him, his brain finally registered the instruction. He widened his eyes and inspected the monster's carcass.\nAs soon as Wu Buyi noticed the orb, he rushed toward it and measured its strength. He was soon stunned.\n\"A 9th-stage monster core?! I-Isn't this monster comparable to immortals?!\"\n.\nAfter handing the corpse to Wu Buyi, Leo looked forward and calculated his landing. He also gazed at the mysterious pyramid from a distance.\n'Should I head there now? But there are so many beasts and fast food in the jungle. I can't just leave that precious food alone.'\nAs greedy as he was, Leo postponed the Indiana Jones project to another date. He landed two kilometers north of his campsite. Then, he turned around, scanning through the jungle for life signatures of mammal creatures and big monsters.\nAs usual, Leo picked up a hundred life signatures of wild cockatrices. He also found over a thousand 1-meter tall wasps as there was a massive hive 100 meters away.\nLeo rubbed his hands as he found them not challenging. He turned his attention to the wasps first as it was always fun to poke a wasp nest. When Leo was on Earth, he destroyed six mutated hornet nests for fun, and he got over a million years of lifespan from eating their nests and the hornets.\nHe skipped and danced while he mutated the surrounding ecology as usual. A minute later, he reached the three-meter-tall wasp nest.\nLooking at the Nope-Hill, Leo wondered how many sane humans would summon Hans after seeing such a large natural architecture and long-legged stingers.\nBUZZ\nAs if the wasps noticed Leo's presence, they rushed out of the nest and swarmed him. Their barbed long legs latched on him while a dozen long needles came for his face, neck, chest, and back.\n\"…\"\nThe stingers failed to penetrate into his skin. Leo widely grinned and grabbed one of them. Without batting an eye, he shoved its head into his mouth!\nCHOMP\nCRUNCH\nOzzy would be proud of him. Leo tore the wasp's head in one bite, and he started chewing it in glee. He didn't even wait for them to mutate.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years…>\nIt was worth every bite. In just one mouthful of the wasp's nasty head, Leo gained 10 years of lifespan.\nLooking at the system message, Leo nodded in approval. He commented, \"Bugs, bees, and insects are rich in protein, indeed. Now, where's the queen? I should domesticate it so that it can breed more wasps for me to eat.\"\nThe wasps looked confused as they thought that Leo was supposed to be their food. However, he nonchalantly ate one of them, and he was unaffected by the stingers. The male wasps also looked at their tail and found that their stingers failed to penetrate Leo's skin. As a result, they worked harder, poking and ramming their butt against him.\nThe trend continued for one hour. Leo managed to finish the first wasp and burped. Although the taste was disgusting, Leo gained 500 years of lifespan by eating one.\nThat was not all. Leo found another apple-sized red orb. This time, he ate it and discovered something pleasantly surprising.\n<You have eaten a 7th-stage monster core.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 500 years…>\n\"HOLY ALLIGATOR! I'll freaking do it again!\"\nGetting 1,000 years of lifespan by just eating a wasp was too good to be true. Leo grabbed another wasp and twisted it in half, planning to eat more.\nCRACK\n\"Hmm?\"\nStrangely, Leo didn't feel any resistance feedback from the insect. Confused, Leo checked the swarm.\nPLOP\nThe wasps turned stiff and stopped moving. Their former yellowish skin turned black, and murky fluid came out from their butts.\nLeo pursed his lips and shrugged. He assumed that the wasps got their DNA modified, and they died because of failed mutation. Since these creatures died too soon, Leo picked the NOPE creatures on his shoulder as he planned to bring them back to the camp.\nWhile Leo was busy stacking the corpses on his shoulder, several trees behind him fell. Then, a two-meter-tall eight-leg creature jumped out of the shade and bit Leo's neck.\nBehind Leo, a black hairy tarantula spat green liquid on him. It also injected yellowish Qi into his body.\nLeo sensed the weird energy flow entering his body. He slightly shook his head as he recognized it.\n\"Another yellow lightning user? You know, you've ruined the mood.\"\nLeo raised his arms and grabbed the long fangs of the giant tarantula. He twisted them and pulled the fangs out.\nSCREECH!\nThe tarantula screeched in pain. The next second, she regenerated her lost teeth and ran away.\nLeo turned around and frowned. He started counting time in his mind.\n'Two… three…four…'\nAfter ten seconds, Leo rescanned the perimeter, checking the life signature of the tarantula earlier – It was still moving, and it sprinted toward the north at Mach speed.\n\"So, some creatures are immune to my radiation. Now, this is interesting.\"\nAlthough disappointed, Leo learned something new. He began to have fun as this mystic realm reminded him a lot of the nuclear fallout world – All creatures were immune to radiation, but they provided a lot of lifespans if Leo could eat them.\n\"Which cookbook should I buy? I doubt Gordon Ramsey knows how to cook spiders and wasps. I should check the Southeast Asia culinary books. They eat grasshoppers and centipedes, so they should know how to cook those, right?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 89 – Florida Man Pays His Employee's Wage with Cooked Wasps\n50 kilometers north of the mysterious pyramid, five portals brought 50 cultivators to the same world as Leo. Yan Xiang led nine imperial bodyguards with him and formed one team. Tang Xuan brought nine people from the Tang Clan while his son, Tang Ting, led the elders and disciples from the Sixth Element Sect. As for the other two teams, they belonged to the first prince and the second prince, who came with their close aides.\nYan Xiang looked at everybody. When he noticed that the portals of the Tang Clan and the Sixth Element Sect were nearby, he let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"I'm glad you're here with me, Chancellor.\"\nTang Xuan was slightly taken aback as he had expected to be separated from the imperial family. Unfortunately, he got stuck with the emperor again.\n\"I guess this is fate,\" Tang Xuan humbly bowed.\n\"Well, the bigger the crowd, the better,\" Yan Xiang laughed and looked at the juniors of the Tang Clan and the disciples of the Sixth Element Sect. He ignored the subordinates of his two sons as he didn't think highly of them.\nThe emperor swept his eyes through the golden core and foundation establishment cultivators for a moment before his gaze stopped at a certain disciple of Tang Tian. He looked at the master.\nDespite being 800 years old, Tang Tian looked like he was in his early 20s. His pale delicate skin was spotless and smooth as if he was a young maiden. His beautiful face and silky long hair could make any adult man gay as he was too attractive to be a man. Had anybody looked at Tang Tian from behind, they would have always mistaken him for a lady.\nFortunately, Tang Tian was not a member of the LGBT. He was a man through and thorough, but his face and appearance came from the exceptional genes of Tang Xuan and Tang Tian's personal Dao. For the sake of making himself more masculine, he tied his hair into a ponytail and wore green dragon plate armor. His wooden fox mask also covered his face, and nobody could see his true appearance.\nYan Xiang had keen eyes. He saw through the mask, but he immediately disabled his x-ray vision ability when he saw Tang Tian. He coughed to hide his embarrassment.\n\"Ahem. Tang Tian, I see that you have found exceptional talented disciples yet again.\"\nTang Tian saluted, \"We were just lucky to have your support. Without the imperial family, our sect and our clan wouldn't have been this prosperous. More good men join us because of your prestige, your majesty.\"\n\"Stop with the flattery. Anyway…\" Yan Xiang got to the point as he had an eye on somebody among the Sixth Element Sect's disciples. He pointed his finger at one of the young men.\nIt was Jin Yong, whose cultivation base was the highest among the disciple group. In addition, his poison element Qi was the thickest among the disciples.\n\"What's his name?\"\n\"Oh, him?\" Tang Tian narrowed his eyes as he didn't want to let the emperor poach his trophy. \"He's Jin Yong, my core disciple.\"\n\"Ohoh? Core disciple?\"\nYan Xiang sneered as he had already predicted it. Still, he was amused, \"Are you sure he's not an illegitimate child of the Tang Clan? How come his poison element Qi is so thick? I think he must have already attained poison element essence.\"\n\"You jest, your majesty. If a golden core cultivator managed to condense any element essence, he would have been heaven's chosen child. That type of genius can only exist in 10,000 years.\"\nYan Xiang scoffed as he had already seen through why Tang Tian avoided praising the disciple. As a quasi-immortal, he could see things that regular mortals couldn't see. Moreover, he also believed that a soul transformation cultivator like Tang Tian should have already noticed Jin Yong's talent.\nFloating behind Jin Yong was a Dao Spirit, aka an incomplete dao avatar. Normally, only nascent soul cultivators or soul formation cultivators had them as they were related to Dao, yet Jin Yong got one when he was only a golden core cultivator.\nThis was proof of Jin Yong's talent. Yan Xiang couldn't help but want this young man to work for him.\n\"Ah, shame. Indeed. What a shame.\"\nYan Xiang lamented. He wished that he could find Jin Yong earlier than Tang Tian. That man would have been a fine asset to his imperial assassination squad or agent.\nAfter a brief chat, Yan Xiang didn't continue bothering the Tang Clan and their people. He took flight and scanned the realm. The nine bodyguards also followed the emperor. As for the two princes, they detached from the group, heading west and east respectively.\nYan Xiang looked around him for a long time before he made his decision. He pointed at the pyramid in the south and ordered his bodyguards.\n\"We'll explore that structure and search for treasures. Cultivation and Qi gathering can be done later. We must secure whatever treasures in that thing before the others take them!\"\nAfter delivering his order, his unit rushed south.\nMeanwhile, the Tang Clan and the Sixth Element Sect's people remained at the starting place. They scanned the area to secure their exit portals. Then, they began setting up their camps and barricades to ward off beasts.\nWeak disciples could do nothing to contribute. They sat on the ground and started cultivating wood Qi and earth Qi in the air. Even Jin Yong got stuck there as the dense Qi of this world suppressed his movements.\nThe elders of the Tang Clan and the sect were the only ones moving. As they had numbers, they erected tents and cut down strange trees in a flash. An hour later, their camp and tents were operational.\nTang Tian and Tang Xuan's subordinates took their time. They began collecting plants, fruits, tree leaves, and herbs from the jungle. Then, they offered them to Tang Tian to appraise them.\nTang Tian inspected the palm leaves, aloe, moss, and raw coconuts. Then, he started marking them if they were usable. As for Tang Xuan, he explored the camp and made sure that they were secured enough. When he was certain that their defensive arrays were firm and active, he vanished from the camp.\nWHOOSH\nTang Xuan traveled 500 meters south. He directly appeared in front of a cockatrice horde.\nIn front of Tang Xuan, 20 cockatrices minded their businesses, pecking and eating a dead caiman. Strangely, small yellowish mushrooms pierced out from its scales, and the dead monster seemed to bloat.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Tang Xuan narrowed his eyes. He had a feeling that he had seen the mushrooms somewhere before, but he couldn't remember. As he came here to remove the monsters, he stopped thinking and got to work.\nA green dao spirit emerged from the ground. It had the appearance of his younger self, but it had green skin. In addition, poisonous green gas emanated from its body.\n\"SQUAK?\"\n\"POKOK?\"\nThe cockatrices looked at the green spirits in confusion. Because of their reflex, their eyes shone as they tried to petrify the floating humanoid mist.\nPOOF\nThe dao spirit exploded, but the green mist expanded. The cockatrices inhaled them, but none of them reacted.\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan took several steps back and hid under a bush. Even though he was a quasi-immortal, he didn't let his guard down around a pack of 7th-stage monsters.\nThese guys had the same strength as him! Fighting them in the open was suicide.\nThe cockatrices ignored the gas and returned their attention to their prey. They continued enjoying their little buffet.I think you should take a look at\nAn hour later, they finished eating. The caiman was left with nothing but white bones. Even its monster core was eaten.\nTang Xuan continued to observe the chickens. As he noticed that the group had just finished eating a 9th-stage monster's carcass and its monster core, he let out a sigh of pity.\n'What a waste. That's a precious 9th-rank monster core. I could have used that to make longevity pills. Well, it doesn't matter. One of them swallowed it whole. I can just cut open its stomach and get my hands on it.'\nAfter coming up with a solution, Tang Xuan waited for his poison to work.\nFive hours later, the chickens started flapping their wings while their heads twitched. Some of them had a seizure while a few rammed their heads against trees.\nTang Xuan frowned. He remembered that his poison dao spirit could only disable one's blood from reaching the brain. However, it didn't have this effect.\n\"POKOK!\"\n\"SQUAK!!\"\nThe next moment, they started fighting each other. One of them bit the neck of their comrade and tore the latter's flesh.\n\"Hmm!?\"\nSomething wasn't right with these cockatrices. This symptom reminded him of a nightmarish incident of the ancient past 500 years ago.\nTang Xuan sensed a chill running down his spine as the old memory finally resurfaced. The flashback events when he and Situ Nantian fended off hordes of cultivator zombies and humanoid monsters came back to haunt him.\n'The mushroom… SWEET DREAM MUSHROOM?!'\nTang Xuan finally remembered that the cockatrices ate the mushrooms on the caiman's mutated corpse. He connected the dots, and he was horrified.\n\"SHIT!!\"\nThe chancellor kicked the ground and returned to the campsite. As soon as he returned, he ordered everybody.\n\"RETREAT! THIS REALM HAS SWEET DREAM MUSHROOMS! WE MUSTN'T LINGER OUR STAY!!\"\n.\n.\nThe Tang Clan's group was lucky as their portal was opened outside of the mushroom's influence. On the other hand, some sects didn't have that luxury.\nSitu Nantian and his Situ Clan controlled two portals. Aside from Situ Nantian, 20 people from their city and clan entered the green realm. However, their portals didn't appear near each other.\nTheir clan's portal was located on top of a straight mountain, 2,000 meters above sea level. As for the other, it was opened directly on top of the pyramid building.\nThe cultivators from the pyramid portal were stunned when they found their portals floating high in the sky. They brought out their flying swords to stand on and save their internal Qi.\nEverybody looked down. Then, they noticed that the pyramid was covered by yellowish mushrooms. At the foot of the pyramid, all trees were replaced by tall mushrooms of various sizes, and they didn't belong in this Amazon-like jungle and this climate.\nNobody noticed the militated and compressed objects that had fallen on the ground in front of the pyramid entrance. Among them, a distorted and broken spatial ring of a former mountain bandit became one with the mushrooms while its ejected content was hidden under the sea of fungi.\nThe Situ's clansmen and elders were under 500 years old, and they had never seen the mushrooms. They soon descended to inspect the new specimen. It only took them less than five minutes - they inhaled THEM.\n.\n.\nWhile some people had a mushroom party, Leo carried 20 mutated corpses of giant wasps back to his base. He calmly dropped them on a cleared plain in front of the camp.\nWu Buyi sweated profusely when he noticed the monsters. As they hadn't been butchered yet, he managed to evaluate their strength by injecting his Qi into their monster cores.\nLeo ordered Wu Buyi, \"Do me a favor. Throw these guys into the portal for me. I'm gonna eat them later.\"\n\"…Are you gonna eat those?!\"\nWu Buyi couldn't believe his ears, but his face remained expressionless. He started to get used to Leo's weirdness.\nLeo didn't hang around or respond to Wu Buyi. He vanished into the forest. A few seconds later, he returned with more giant wasps.\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi silently stared at the pile of wasps. Those were 7th-stage monsters, and their strength was comparable to a quasi-immortal. However, Leo took care of them without leaving a wound.\nAs Wu Buyi couldn't think straight, he let his body act on its own. Like a robot, he collected all corpses into his spatial ring and pointed the ring at the portal. Then, he commanded the ring to eject the wasps.\nHe was efficient. The wasps crossed the portal to the other side.\nUnfortunately, Wu Buyi's hard work was underappreciated. When he finished sending 40 wasps to the other side, Leo already piled 40 more on the ground, and the latter didn't stop teleporting.\nWu Buyi turned around and scratched his head. He had a feeling that Leo pranked him.\n\"Can't he just use his spatial ring to collect everything? This is harassment!\"\nAgain, Wu Buyi collected the wasps and threw them into the portal. However, this time, he kept one in his ring. Secretly, he used his Qi to cut a piece of their leg and brought it out.\nInspired by the Florida Man, Wu Buyi put the small piece into his mouth and chewed it.\nIt was disgusting. It tasted worse than anything that Wu Buyi had eaten. However, he sensed something from the insect's leg – It had a similar energy as immortal grass!\n\"Isn't this… life force?!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 90 – PETA Protests as Florida Man Murders Two Amazon Caimans and Seduces Unicorn\nAlthough many sects were sent to the same mystic realm as Leo, not everyone could get this privilege. Yan Zhu's people, the Fatui Cult, the Death Sword Sect, and other major sects were sent to other planets.\nMeanwhile, two organizations that Leo knew were in the same realm as his. At the east of Leo's current location was the skyscraper pagoda. At the foot of the structure, Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and six disciples gathered at looked at the structure in awe. Their mystic realm portal was also behind them.\nA hundred meters away, another portal brought the women from the Amazonian Sanctuary there. They also admired the tall building as they had never seen anything like this.\nHua Jiashan noticed the elders from the sanctuary. As he led a smaller sect, he went to greet them to give face. He went to the leader of the group, who was a thin woman in a wooden wheelchair.\nDespite sitting in a wheelchair, the grand elder of the Amazonian Sanctuary, Dongfang Mei, was a soul transformation cultivator, a realm higher than Hua Jiashan. Her age was the same as his, but Hua Jiashan had to show respect to this woman.\nDongfang Mei had short white hair, sunken cheeks, and wilted skin. Her hunchback and her condition made her look like a 100-year-old grandma that needed her children's support.\nThe grand elder gazed at the approaching man and recognized him. After all, he was like her little brother.\n\"Little Jiashan, you're here, too.\"\n\"Senior Dongfang, it's good to see you again. You're still healthy, I see.\"\n\"Kekeke, I won't die that easily. I managed to snag a bottle of rejuvenate tea from my disciple! Do you know that I'm looking 10 years younger?\"\nHua Jiashan didn't know what to answer as Dongfang Mei still looked the same to him. He changed the subject, \"So, are you going to explore this building?\"\n\"Hmm. We don't have a place for my girls to stay and cultivate. We might as well take shelter in that building. Oh, your group should come along. Just be mindful of the distance since my disciples are inexperienced with men.\"\n\"… We'll be mindful. I'll warn them.\"\nThe two groups came to an agreement that they would explore this place together. However, their disciples couldn't interact as they were too young and inexperienced. In short, romantic relationship between disciples was strictly forbidden.\nThe elders of the two sects protected their disciples with their arrays and sent them to the pagoda. All 20 explorers entered the building. But as soon as everybody got inside, steel bars slammed down and locked everybody in.\nBOOM\n\"!!!\"\nHan Hao and Han Meng rushed to the entrance, but the exit was blocked by the steel bars. They brought out their swords and attempted to slice it.\nDONG\nA semi-transparent energy wall appeared and bounced the swords back. The two swordsmen took two steps backward and stared at the energy wall in shock.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei looked around. Then, they sighed.\n\"As usual, a cage trap.\"\n\"Yes. It seems this place is either a test site or a ritual temple.\"\n\"Probably the former. No sentry is here, and no sign of Qi torrent is around.\"\n\"True.\"\nIt was not the first time that Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei encountered this situation. They had seen similar traps and mechanisms in the other mystic realms before, and they deemed that this trap wasn't dangerous.\nSeeing that their seniors were calm and collected, the disciples and their subordinates didn't make noise. Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei also ordered the people to start cultivating and resting for the day.\n.\n.\nWu Buyi sweated profusely. After eating the wasp's leg, he sensed a strange life force energy, and he could feel that his foundation was strengthened. However, he couldn't take another bite.\nHis stomach growled. Because he had never eaten anything solid other than grain pills all his life, his stomach rejected solid food. He felt nauseous and dizzy.\n\"BLECH!!\"\nA minute later, Wu Buyi vomited the food out. Some of the life force energy left him, but he managed to absorb a small amount.\nWhile Wu Buyi was vomiting his food, Leo returned and dropped more wasps on the ground. Then, he noticed the condition of his employee.\n\"Ah, you ate it, didn't you?\"\nWu Buyi bitterly looked at his master. He nodded, \"Y-Yes, my lord.\"\nLeo shrugged, \"This is why you shouldn't be overly dependent on grain pills. Your stomach is very weak right now. If you haven't eaten anything solid for years, you should start off with light food, such as soup or something easy to digest. Chewy stuff is a no-go.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi wanted to argue that it was against common sense here as hard food was toxic to cultivators. Meat, vegetables, fruits, and other mortal's processed food carried a lot of impurities, and it would take a long time to remove them.\nStill, Wu Buyi remembered that Leo had been eating strange stuff. He saw Leo eat immortal grass and golden sand banana before, but he didn't seem to have an issue with impurity.\nFortunately, as an alchemist, Wu Buyi had the mindset of a scientist. Because of Leo's example, he had new inspiration and a theory regarding hard food.\n'What if our cultivation method and traditions are wrong all along? What if Lord Florida Man is using a more efficient cultivation method?'\nBeing inspired, Wu Buyi got rid of his ego. He accepted and learned new things as if he was an empty glass.\n\"I'll keep that in mind, my lord.\"\nSeeing how obedient Wu Buyi was, Leo felt bad for the guy. He thought of a way to improve Wu Buyi's health and came up with a simple solution – the online store.\nLeo opened his system menu, browsing the medicine section in the store. He wondered if the modern antiseptic or any drug for underfeeding or excessive fasting.\nHowever, the drug section was overpriced, just like the food section. Each pallet had a price tag of 10,000 YOL or higher.\nAs Leo couldn't rely on modern meds or food, he could only come up with local ones. He looked around to see if there was any useful food ingredient for a malnourished man. He looked around the campsite.\nWhile looking, his eyes met with a lurking cockatrice's, who warily stared at Leo 200 meters away.I think you should take a look at\n\"Right. Chicken soup!\"\nNot wasting time, Leo put on his gloves and vanished. Two seconds later, he returned as if he teleported back, but his hands twisted the neck of the poor cockatrice.\n\"I have an idea, Wu Buyi. Let's train your stomach with light soup first. I'll cook chicken soup for you. Oh, I'll cook for Gao Yan too.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi blankly looked at Leo. Although he heard that unorthodox sects refined monster meat into grain pills, he had never thought of eating monster meat as real food.\nMeanwhile, Leo had no idea what Wu Buyi had been through. He hummed and plucked the chicken's feathers without mutating them. After the task, Leo paused for a moment and looked at Wu Buyi.\n\"Do you have a knife? A sharp one?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi silently handed over his treasure short sword that he kept for protection. It could also be used as a lighter or a flame thrower.\nLeo received the red knife and inspected it. Upon seeing the fancy carving on the blades, he pursed his lips and flipped the knife around. After getting the hang of it, Leo chopped off the cockatrice's head and the three snake tails.\nPOK-POK\nSkillfully and nimbly, Leo split open the chicken's stomach, removing its innards and blood. A red orb fell off its body and landed on the mushy intestines.\nLeo noticed it. He picked it up and looked at Wu Buyi for a moment.\n\"Catch.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nLeo tossed the monster core to the alchemist. Then, he bragged, \"I already ate too many. You keep that. When your stomach gets better, try eating it. It gives you 500 years of lifespan.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\" Wu Buyi forgot about his stomach pain and dizziness. His eyes brightened as he learned something absurd and astonishing, \"Really, my lord?!\"\n\"Why should I lie to you? I already ate a dozen wasp balls… Whoops, no pun intended. Anyway, I can't let my employee live a short life. What do you think will happen if I show your lifespan status to future customers and find out that you have a shorter lifespan than the others? That's gonna embarrass us. So, as the face of my store, I need you to live a very long life, okay?\"\nLeo didn't tell Wu Buyi that he was full. As Leo only had one mouth to eat, he believed that having more mouths to eat this good food would earn him extra YOL income. Thus, he planned to mutate Wu Buyi's stomach and enabled him to earn some YOL the same way Leo had done in the past. Once Wu Buyi could eat random things and gain lifespan, Leo could scam Wu Buyi by selling him some random products or essence stones later.\nIn short, Leo was a witch, and Wu Buyi was either Hansel or Gretel. The former wanted the latter fat, so he could eat him later.\nOn the other hand, Wu Buyi was moved to tears. He couldn't believe that Leo was so nice to him. He soon wailed, \"My lord! I swear with my dao oath! I'll follow you to the end of the world!\"\n\"Yes, yes. You should.\"\nLeo brightly smiled while he hang the chicken upside down, draining more blood from the meat. He also glanced at the large river behind Gao Yan and Wu Buyi as he noticed a horn of another caiman in the water.\nFor the sake of their safety, Leo tossed the innards into the river. As soon as the bloody intestines and heart entered the water, two caimans jumped out and competed to get the food.\nWu Buyi snapped back to his senses and looked at the river. When he noticed that two 9th-stage monsters appeared, he shrieked in fright and crawled toward Leo.\n\"Seriously, you… don't you have any pride?\" Leo frowned at Wu Buyi.\n\"B-But they're 9th-stage…\"\n\"Haiya…\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He walked closer to the river and raised his right foot. Then, he stomped the ground.\nBOOM\nThe river was split in half, but the two caimans were shot up to the sky because of the pressure. Meanwhile, Leo threw the red knife at one of them.\nPU!\nIt pierced through the first caiman's head.\nPU\nAfter going through the first caiman's head, the knife stabbed the forehead of the second caiman. Both monsters widened their eyes in shock before their consciousness faded to black.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBoth gigantic monsters fell into the river. Leo snorted and dove into the river and dragged the two monsters to the river bank. When he returned, the river's surface was painted in rainbow color, and the two caimans started to turn blacker.\nLeo pulled out the red knife. But as he was about to reuse it for cooking, it broke.\n\"…\"\nLeo felt bad for Wu Buyi. He returned the broken treasure knife to the guy, \"I'll find you a new one. My bad.\"\nWu Buyi quietly received the knife and looked at the two 9th-stage monsters. He had no words to explain the roller-coaster emotions.\n'T-Two immortal beasts go down… just like that? With my low-grade treasure sword? B-But does that mean Lord Florida Man will get two extra 9th-grade monster cores?! Oh, dear lord…'\n.\n.\nAt 10 kilometers south of Leo's location, a white horse with a long straight horn gazed at Leo from the opposite side of the river. The unicorn neighed and trotted in excitement as if it had found something precious.\nThe unicorn ran in a circle for a minute. After it had warmed up, silver light glowed on its hooves. Then, it started walking toward the river.\nInstead of falling into the river, it walked on the surface. Then, it picked up the pace, charging toward Leo's group at full speed.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 91 – Florida Man Tames Unicorn by Smashing\nWu Buyi no longer had time to cultivate as Leo gave him a lot of work to do. Still, he was happy that he served a strong master, and he got boons from it.\nAfter storing the monster corpses in his spatial ring, Wu Buyi had some questions in his mind. He wondered why Leo never used his spatial ring.\n\"Senior. I have a question. Could you enlighten me?\"\n\"What is it?\"\nWhile listening to Wu Buyi, Leo vanished as he suddenly kicked the ground and went somewhere. Two seconds later, he returned with two more living cockatrices in his hands. He broke their necks and pulled their beaks from their heads. Then, he used the beaks to cut open their stomachs and behead them to drain their blood.\nGuts and blood fell to the ground and messed up some of their feathers. Leo ignored the dirty blood and plucked their feathers. As usual, their monster cores fell from their bodies.\nWu Buyi gulped as he kept getting surprised by Leo's antics and weirdness. He mustered his courage and asked.\n\"My lord. Why don't you use your spatial ring to store the beasts or the treasures? It's faster to store the carcasses into your ring than running around and bringing them to me.\"\nLeo deeply sighed. He wanted to use it too, but he always broke the ring whenever he rubbed them. Since he hated lying and pretending, Leo spoke the truth.\n\"Truth be told, I can't use the rings.\"\n\"Huh?!\" Wu Buyi was shocked, \"Why? What happened to you, my lord?! You're an immortal, so using a simple spatial ring shouldn't be an issue.\"\nLeo paused from work. He rested his hands on his waists and deeply sighed.\n\"You see, Wu Buyi. This world's rings are too fragile. Whenever I tried to use them, they broke.\"\n\"…\"\n\"The last time I tried, all items burst out and flooded my store. It took me a day to clean everything.\"\nAgain, Wu Buyi was astonished. He believed he figured out Leo's trouble.\n'I see. Because his Qi is too strong, any mortal spatial ring will break upon touch. No mortal-made spatial rings can handle his power! This must be it!'\nWu Buyi brightly smiled, \"I understand, my lord. Our world's spatial rings are indeed too weak for someone with your status. Since you can't use them, I'll help you sort and collect your items!\"\nThe alchemist had an ulterior motive. If he could act as Leo's spatial ring carrier, he could snoop on Leo's precious items and rare collections.\nWhile Wu Buyi fantasized about his sweet future, a rare water sound came from behind. It sounded like someone had been scooping and slashing water. He turned around to see.\n\"Hmm?\"\nA three-meter-tall white unicorn was charging toward them. It neighed and showed its teeth.\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"\nWu Buyi panicked. He grabbed Gao Yan and leaped out of the horse's way.\nThe massive unicorn glanced at both men and ignored them. It turned its attention to Leo, who hadn't noticed its arrival yet. The horse smiled and lowered its head, charging toward him.\n\"MY LORD, WATCH OUT!\" Wu Buyi screamed.\n\"Ah?\"\nLeo only heard the voice of Wu Buyi. Then, a large shadow loomed, blocking the ray of sunlight. He turned around and found a white unicorn, raising its front hooves and waving them.\nBOOM\nThe horse slammed its front hooves on the ground. Then, it leaned its head forward to nudge Leo's chest. It sniffed him and raised its head to lick his face.\nGetting a surprised lick by a weird pony, Leo was taken aback, \"Wut da hail?\"\nLeo looked up and found the long horn and a massive horse. He frowned for a moment as he wondered if he should get rid of the horse. However, as the horse did nothing but lick his face, Leo rolled his eyes.\n\"Wu Buyi.\"\n\"Yes, my lord?\"\n\"What the hell is this… stupid donkey?\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"Donkey?!\"\nWu Buyi awkwardly smiled as Leo wrongly nicknamed a mythical creature a donkey. The horse also stopped licking Leo to stare at his face.\nLeo looked into the unicorn's eyes. He waited for the beast to mutate and die. However, after 10 seconds, it didn't show any symptom of mutation.\n\"Well? What is this donkey, Wu Buyi?\"\nWu Buy came back to his senses and coughed. He glanced at Gao Yan, who sweated profusely after the commotion. Because Wu Buyi interrupted his cultivation midway, his Qi was on a rampage, and he needed help.\nBecause of the chaos, Wu Buyi half-heartedly answered while he rushed to help Gao Yan stabilize his Qi.\n\"That's a unicorn, my lord. It's a mythical beast.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"I know. I want to know why it is licking me. I don't remember raising a goddamn pony!\"\nWu Buyi didn't answer as he no longer listened to Leo. He poured his Qi into Gao Yan's back and drove away bad wood element Qi inside his disciple's body.\nNoticing that Wu Buyi got busy, Leo smacked his lips and stared at the troublemaking animal.\n\"You. What are you?\"I think you should take a look at\n*NEIGH*\n.\n.\nEast of Leo's Location, the Mysterious Pagoda\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei left the crowd and climbed the tower together. As they went up, they discovered that the Qi pressure on each floor got heavier.\n\"Ah, the Qi compatibility trial. This brings me back,\" Dongfang Mei giggled.\nHua Jiashan nodded, \"Indeed. I miss the days when our world still has one of these towers. It's a shame that the Myriad Pagoda got destroyed because of Situ Nantian's heavenly tribulation back then.\"\n\"It can't be helped. He forcefully broke through and drew the heavenly lightning bolts toward the Sweet Dream Mushroom's lair. Without his lightning bolts, the mainland would have been overrun by those Jiangshis.\"\nHua Jiashan bitterly smiled. He continued to push Dongfang Mei's wheelchair to the upper floors.\nAfter 20 minutes of climbing, they reached the 50 floor. However, instead of finding a blank floor with nothing but a staircase on the other side of the room, they found a large unicorn statue.\n\"A unicorn?\" Dongfang Mei raised her eyebrows in amusement.\n\"This is going to be bad for your disciples, isn't it?\"\n\"That depends,\" Dongfang Mei almost burst into laughter. She remembered an event when she was young, \"Say, do you remember Elder Tang Tian when we were outer disciples of the old sword saint Sect?\"\n\"Elder Tang? Oh right!\" Hua Jiashan laughed as he recalled the weird incident when they were on the same team during a mystic realm expedition.\nThere was a hilarious moment when they first encountered a unicorn for the first time. At that time, the 9th stage got attached to Tang Tian and followed him around. At first, they had no idea why the beast was attracted to him.\nBut when Situ Nantian, Yan Xiang, and the other elders found them, everybody learned a weird fact about unicorns.\nFemale unicorns hated everything. Usually, they attacked everything that wasn't a part of their species. Male unicorns were a lot more docile, but they always avoided cultivators. However, there was an exception.\nUnicorns loved virgin cultivators, especially the old cultivators. As virgin cultivators either gathered a lot of virgin yin or virgin yang element essence in their bodies, the unicorns, who primarily cultivated the energy, were naturally attracted to them.\nFemale unicorns went for male cultivators. Vice versa, male unicorns loved virgin women. Sometimes, male unicorns got attached to male cultivators, causing multiple hilarious scenarios. One of them was when Tang Tian got pushed down by a horny horse.\nRemembering the scenes, both Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei could no longer hold their mouth. They cackled and cried laughing.\n\"Oh, dear. That was funny back then. I thought I would have died from laughter when Elder Situ revealed the nature of the unicorns.\"\n\"Me, too. Elder Tang Tian went into seclusion for a year after the incident. I can't just forget that.\"\nThe duo continued climbing the pagoda while they chatted, reminiscing the past when they were young. They mimicked the obnoxious unicorn that Tang Tian had tamed.\n\"SMASH!\"\n\"Hahaha! That's right. Smash!\"\n.\n.\nOne hour after the encounter, Leo stared at the obnoxious male horse, who was smiling and showing his teeth. Leo complained as he remembered a scene from a movie.\n\"Wu Buyi, are you available yet?\"\nWu Buyi glanced at Leo while he continued to pour his Qi into Gao Yan's body. As Gao Yan got better, he looked up, \"Yes, my lord?\"\n\"Say, are unicorns attracted to virgins?\"\n\"Ah, that. I don't know. I've never studied deeply about monster beasts or mythical creatures. Why?\"\n\"Never mind.\"\nLeo facepalmed. A movie scene dialogue echoed in his mind.\n'Unicorns are drawn to children and those who are of pure of body… untouched by women.'\nThe dialogue repeated as if it was mocking him. He was mad and offended.\nBecause of his bad mood, Leo pushed the horse's face away. He lightly jumped and sat on the unicorn's back.\n\"Fine. If you like me that much, I'll ride you. Now, I'm a very busy man, and I don't like useless subordinates. If you want to follow me, you must follow my orders from now on, alright?\"\n*NEIGH*\nThe unicorn shook his head and smiled again. Although smiling was nice and wholesome, a horse's smile could be creepy.\nAgain, Leo gave up on the horse. He slapped the back of the unicorn's neck, \"At least you neigh like a horse, unlike that damn plant. Anyway, I can tell that you're smart. Can you speak a human language?\"\nIt wasn't hurt to ask. He tested the horse if it could speak.\nThe unicorn paused for a moment. His throat moved slightly as he mimicked a human's language. However, he could only speak one word.\n\"SMASH!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and Leo blankly stared at the horse. They had a bad premonition about this.",

As for Wu Buyi and Gao Yan, they no longer paid attention to Leo and the unicorn.\nAfter getting a weird pet, Leo looked at white horsey. He wondered what he should feed it.\n\"Say, Taxi. What do you usually eat? Carrots? Apples? Grass?\"\n\"Smash!!\"\nAs if Taxi understood Leo, it looked at the mutated plants and immortal grass nearby. It lowered its head and showed Leo how to eat them.\nSeeing that Taxi could eat grass, Leo was relieved. He patted its head and hopped off its back.\n\"Alright. I'm gonna go back to work. If you want to follow me home, stay here and guard those two. I know you're strong. Can you do it?\"\n\"Smash?\"\nLeo frowned as he couldn't understand Taxi's smash language. It was different from Cat, whose meowing voice had a distinctive sound frequency, and it was easier to decipher. Moreover, Cat's air was similar to Leo's when he was a weak mutant as she grew up eating his radiation since birth.\n\"Do I have to waste my YOL for your damn smash language skill?\" He complained and shook his head.\nNot bothering with Taxi, Leo resumed his work. He leaped forward, traveling one kilometer in one leap. Upon landing, he turned around and lightly jogged back. A hundred afterimages of Leo were left behind as he moved in a zigzag. Every time he turned, he caught a wandering cockatrice or a venomous snake.\n10 seconds later, Leo returned to the camp. Then, he dropped 30 cockatrice corpses and 70 fat snakes in front of Taxi. Then, he leaped back into the jungle.\n\"…\"\nTaxi looked at the dead cockatrices and snakes. Its eyes gleamed as if it got inspiration from Leo's actions. It raised its head and started neighing out loud. Moreover, it screamed.\n\"SMAAAAASSSSH!!\"\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\n\"Hmm?\"\nYan Xiang and his entourage arrived at the pyramid. However, none of them had the courage to get inside the structure as the mushrooms and the fog below were the bane of their existence.\nThe emperor recognized these mushrooms. He waved his hand, pointing everybody to stay away from the area.\n\"Sweet Dream Mushrooms. We can't go inside. Withdraw.\"\nOne of their bodyguards circulated his Qi into his eyes to see through the pink fog. Then, he noticed that a team of cultivators was already on the ground. However, they acted weird as their arms, fingers, and back curled while their heads uncontrollably twitched.\n\"Y-Your Majesty. I think Situ Clan's people are below…\"\nYan Xiang shook his head, \"It's too late to save them. Don't breathe in the fog if you don't want to be like them. They're no longer humans.\"\n\"W-What are they, your majesty?\"\n\"Jiangshi.\"\n\"…\"\nHearing the keyword, the bodyguards closed their mouths as they understood everything. They quietly followed their emperor north, heading back to the portal.\nThis season's expedition was too dangerous. As the risk was too high, it was better to remain near the exit and cultivate the local element Qi.\nThe group looked around, imprinting the scenery to their mind so that they would have a story to tell their peers that couldn't join them. The emperor also scanned the surroundings, hoping to find hidden treasures that others overlooked.\nWhile everybody took their time, far south of the pyramid, a thousand birds suddenly flew up and caused a commotion. Then, a strange sound wave echoed, and Yan Xiang's company could clearly hear them.\nSMAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!!\nSMAAASSSSHHHH\nSMAASHH\nSMASH\nSM…\n\"…\"\nThe warcry of a certain horse made 15 of the bodyguards flinch. Their Qi stopped responding to their commands, and they could no longer maintain the altitude. Slowly, they glided toward the ground.\n\"Dammit! That's a male unicorn's summoning cry. There are Thunder Unicorns in this realm! Take the regeneration pill and cover your ears! Their voices are harmful to cultivators!\"\nHearing that the unicorn's voice was harmful to cultivators, the bodyguards gulped. Still, four of them seemed fine, and they could still circulate their Qi normally.\n\"Wait, how are they fine?\" An injured bodyguard looked at their colleague in the sky.\nYan Xiang wryly smiled and explained, \"They're virgins. Virgin men and women are naturally immune to unicorns' thunder warcry. Rather, I think those guys will benefit from the voice.\"\n\"W-What?\"\nEverybody raised their eyebrows and looked at their virgin friends. The four elderly men in the sky gave them a weird look while they purposely descended to match their colleagues' flight altitude. Upon getting close, the injured cultivators noticed that the four men were cladded in electric statics.\n\"Isn't that lightning element Qi?\"\nYan Xiang looked back while he digested the regeneration pill in his stomach. He looked at the four bodyguards and nodded in approval.\n\"Yes. Those are lightning element Qi. If they manage to master it, they won't be afraid of the future heavenly tribulation lightning.\"\n\"…Wow.\"\nThe bodyguards looked at their friends in envy. At the same time, they mocked the lucky elders.\n\"Yeah, it's good to be virgins, huh? Too bad, you get no bitches.\"\nThe four celibates sneered at their colleagues, \"We have virgin yang, but you don't. We have the potential to become immortals, but not you. If you lose your virgin yang, your cultivation path is stuck in the mortal realm. Well, sucks to be you.\"\n\"You really…\"\nThe group laughed while the emperor shook his head. The group slowly recovered, and they managed to get back their abilities.\nRUMBLE\nAfter the warcry, dust and brown mist appeared everywhere as something big was moving toward the source of the noise. Their destination was the south of the pyramid.\n\"Your majesty, should we check that?\" One of the bodyguards pointed at the dust that a hundred unicorns kicked up.\n\"No. Leave them be. All unicorns are born as 7th-stage monsters. Adult ones are 9th stage. We're not equipped to hunt thunder unicorns.\"\nEverybody sighed in pity. They looked away from the unicorns and headed back to the portal.\n.\n.\nBOOM\n\"SMASH!\"\nBOOM-BOOMI think you should take a look at\n\"SMASH!!\"\nA hundred three-meter-tall white ponies bit off cockatrices' heads and stomped on small creatures as they ran. Lightning bolts were shot out from their horns, shooting down flying creatures and insects in the area. The stampede knocked down trees and plants along the way and their paths were paved with blood and corpses of other animals.\nBy the time Leo returned with 50 chickens, three unicorns of the same size as Fake Taxi were already in front of their friend. They neighed as if they were chatting.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows when he discovered that Taxi multiplied into four. He was amused.\n\"I just got a random zap from nowhere, and you multiplied like an amoeba? Wut da hail is goin' on here?\"\nThe four horses looked at Leo in unison. The newcomer noticed Leo's aura and jumped in joy. Like the predecessor, they rushed toward him and sniffed his armpits and his mouth. Then, they licked his face and his ears.\nBeing violated by three unicorns, Leo was annoyed.\n\"Oi, Taxi. Care to explain?\"\nTaxi widely grinned.\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"Don't you heart-emoticon me? What's with your friends over here?\"\n\"Smash!\"\n\"…\"\nUnable to understand the unicorn, Leo facepalmed. He then looked at the ponies, who seemed to be immune to his radiation.\n\"Fine. Bring over your friends, but I ain't gonna feed everybody. Find your own meal, but you can't eat my underlings.\"\n\"… Smash.\"\nThe four horses glanced at Wu Buyi and Gao Yan. One of them approached the latter. As soon as it was one meter apart, the curious unicorn sniffed Gao Yan's face.\nGao Yan slowly opened his eyes as he felt a bit better after getting Wu Buyi's help. However, his first sight was the big face and the scary teeth of a massive white horse.\n\"#$%@!\"\nLike a human being, Gao Yan shrieked as he got jump-scared. He stood up and took several steps away.\nUnfortunately, the pony chased after Gao Yan. Then, it snorted at his face and licked his mouth.\n\"…\"\nLeo watched it happen. He laughed at Gao Yan.\n\"Congratulations. You've been kissed by a pervert pony. If that is your first kiss, then my condolence. Welcome to the maidenless club, tarnished warrior.\"\nRUMBLE\nIt was too soon for them to rejoice. A few seconds later, more unicorns showed up and surrounded the group.\nLeo, Wu Buyi, and Gao Yan silently looked at the crowd of massive unicorns. Their expressions were blank.\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"SMASH!!\"\nThe obnoxious unicorns began chatting, using their native tongue. Nobody could tell what they were scheming or partying about.\nRUMBLE\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Soon, the portal was surrounded by a hundred giant unicorns. They all stared at Leo with sparkling eyes.\n\"Oh, my lord. There's more,\" Leo started praying to Jesus. He now understood how a certain tiktoker felt when he was ambushed by a kitten army in the wild.\nTaxi walked toward Leo. Then, it whispered.\n\"Smash?\"\nAgain, Leo had no idea what Taxi wanted. He patted its head and deeply sighed.\n\"I haven't built a barn or a stable for you yet, but I'll do so later. For now, protect my two employees, okay? After everything is over, you can do whatever you want. If you want to follow me to my world, fine. If you want to stay, that's good too. If you want to be my tour guide, I'd be happy to take the offer. So, what do you want to do?\"\n\"SMASH XD\"\n\"Don't' XD me, you damn donkey!\"\nLeo gave up on the horses.\nWhile Leo was at a loss, Taxi looked at its friends and the large portal. Then, it took the lead.\n\"SMASH!!\"\nThe other 99 unicorns neighed in unison. Then, they charged into the portal. Only Taxi remained behind.\n\"What the hell?\"\nWu Buyi, Gao Yan, and Leo had no idea what they had just done. These mythical creatures just crossed the portals to their home world for no reason.\nTaxi smiled at Leo. Then, it crouched, inviting Leo to saddle it.\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and Gao Yan looked at Leo in admiration. Judging from Taxi's reaction, Leo had just tamed 100 9th-grade thunder unicorns and brought them to his store.\nTeasing Leo, Wu Buyi laughed, \"Just smash it, my lord.\"\n\"Smash your ass, damn baldy!\"\n\"Hehehehe!\"\nLeo had a headache. He just wanted to stockpile new food and new alchemy ingredients. However, he accidentally tamed 100 unicorns without even trying, and they invaded his store domain.\nHe wondered if he should return to manage things or if he should focus on the quests first.\nWorrying about his store, Leo walked toward the portal, planning to check the newcomers. However, the system warned him.\n<Warning, returning home will abandon the missions. You will not get rewards, and the missions will be canceled.>\nIt was not easy after all. If Leo wanted the mysterious rewards from the system, he had to stay and completed the two missions. Without a choice, Leo deeply sighed and got on the horse's back.\n\"Fine. Now, Taxi. Bring me to Rabbit Trent King. I need to get this over with.\"\nTaxi neighed and stood up. It turned east. Then, it charged toward the tall pagoda at a distance.\n.\nSeeing that Leo had left them to explore the mystic realm, Wu Buyi and Gao Yan gazed at them in envy. They wished that they were strong enough to withstand the local wood element essence's pressure.\n\"One day, I'll be like him – Live free and unfettered!\"\nWu Buyi rolled his eyes, \"Before that, reach the nascent soul stage first, and you can daydream about that. Golden Core cultivators can't do anything here. You need to reach my stage to contribute something to the sect or contest against other cultivators. If better, be an immortal like Lord Florida Man!\"\n\"I'll try my best, master!\"\nGao Yan was motivated. He closed his eyes and resumed cultivating.",

Horse Racing Associations Invalid the Race as Florida Man Used Firearms\nAfter the pony stampede, cockatrices and other harmful beasts fled from the area. Gao Yan and Wu Buyi no longer sensed any hostile entity around them.\nLeo was also relieved. He rode Taxi east, heading to the tall pagoda on the horizon.\nBecause Taxi was a big horse, Leo found it difficult to saddle him properly. Thus, he stood on Taxi's back, using him as a living skateboard. It was bumpy and hard to balance at first, but Leo quickly adapted to the rhythm.\nTaxi was wild. He always charged directly toward trees and rammed them down. Tall plants fell upon impact while some broke in half. Because of the debris and broken trees, Leo deflected random pieces of wood that came his way.\nAlthough Taxi was fast, Leo was disappointed in the pony's speed. Compared to his sprint and leap, the horse was a lot slower than him. Had Leo seriously traveled toward the pagoda, he could have arrived in a few seconds. However, Taxi charged through the woods for a minute, but they were just halfway there.\n\"You're slow,\" Leo complained.\n\"Smash?!\"\nTaxi widened his eyes as he was offended. Then, he snorted and began allocating lightning Qi into the hooves.\nBOOM\nA second later, Taxi ascended and ran in midair. His speed tripled and left behind sonic boom shockwaves.\nLeo sighed and lowered his stance as the wind almost blew him backward. Although Taxi tried, The pony was still below his standard.\n\"If you want to show off, make sure you surpass this speed. Remember this well.\"\nLeo decided to show him what the real speed looked like. He jumped off the horseback and landed in the jungle below.\nFeeling lightened, Taxi turned around and looked at Leo, wondering what his virgin yang Qi factory was doing.\nBOOM\nIn one kick, Leo shuttled at 20 degrees angle, flying like a cannonball being shot from Death Star. His entire being transformed into a streak of light, surpassing the speed of light.\n\"SMASH!?\"\nBecause of the sudden acceleration, Taxi was caught off guard. He was knocked back by the blasting shockwaves from Leo's kicking power. Moreover, the place where Leo had landed earlier exploded, and a large crater was left behind.\nWhile standing in midair, the unicorn stared at the crater in shock. Then, he looked at Leo in a new light.\nAmong unicorns, there was a tradition. Among male unicorns, their social status was determined by their muscle and their speed. Whoever ran the fastest got to reproduce while the slower ones would never find mates.\nTaxi was considered one of the strongest and fastest unicorns among the herd. Female unicorns usually offered themselves to him, and everybody called him the herd's alpha. But after witnessing Leo's serious speed, Taxi got humbled.\n\"SMASH!\"\nUnicorns were simple creatures. Aside from their weird fetishes and obsession with virgins, they were quick to bow down their heads to the strong. Taxi acknowledged Leo as the new alpha of the herd, and he chased after him.\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nA few seconds later, Leo traveled 500 kilometers and flew over the town of a hundred tall pagodas. Because Leo couldn't fly, he couldn't change the flight course. His head smashed against one of the buildings and broke it in half.\nBecause of the collision, Leo managed to slow down and landed in the middle of the town. Upon landing on a stone road, he caused a small crater.\nRUMBLE\nLeo didn't get a chance to admire the city. The broken pagoda earlier fell upon him as if it wanted revenge.\nBOOM\nBrown and black metals, planks, lumber, and random objects filled the stone road, burying Leo alive. The deafening impact caused the ground to shake, and many buildings trembled.\nTwo minutes later, Taxi arrived at the crash site. It followed Leo's scent and landed on the pile of debris.\n\"Smash?'\nUsing his front hooves, Taxi stomped the mountain of debris. Then, a thundercloud was formed at the bottom of the debris and launched a reverse lightning bolt, shooting into the sky.\nBOOM\nEverything in the 100-meter-diameter was sent to the sky because of Taxi's stomp. Even a portion of the stone road and its foundation erupted. Taxi then looked up, searching for Leo. He quickly found the old man among the broken bricks and burning pieces of wood.\n\"That wasn't necessary. I was chilling and playing with some weird metal plate.\"\nFloating in the sky because of Taxi's reverse lightning bolt was Leo. He was holding a round green gong with a rain dragon carving, which had fallen from the broken pagoda tower. Surrendering to gravity, Leo descended and landed on two feet while his back was straightened. Again, he created another small crater upon landing.\nLeo put the gong on top of his head. A few seconds later, debris that Taxi blasted upward earlier rained upon them.\nGONG\nGONG\nHard objects hit the gong, echoing a vibrating sound wave. However, it was not a normal sound wave.\nLeo raised his eyebrows while Taxi flinched. The sound waves disturbed their bodily balance. Taxi's internal Qi temporarily stopped responding to his will. As for Leo, he was slightly annoyed as the sound tickled his eardrums. He picked his ears and scooped out a small piece of earwax. As usual, he inspected it up close, sniffed it, and put it in his mouth.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\nWhen civilization is lost, be a monke – Leo.\nWhen everything was over, Leo lowered his gong and patted off the dust. He then turned around and looked at Taxi, who was still shaken by the gong's sound.\nNoticing Taxi's condition, Leo snickered, \"I guess I score a rare item or something. If you are in that state, this thing might be too dangerous for humans.\"I think you should take a look at\nTaxi repeatedly nodded as it hated the sound. He even got dizzy after hearing the noise.\nLeo stopped chatting with Taxi and checked the other pagodas. There were small and big ones, but most of them were at least 20 stories high. As being surrounded by tall buildings blocked their vision range, Leo jumped and landed on the rooftop of a building to expand his view.\nWhen Leo got on top of a 50-story pagoda, the building zapped him with a purple lightning bolt. He grinned and welcomed the attack with open arms.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 256 years…>\n\"Thanks for the bonus.\"\nAfter zapping Leo once, the tower stopped attacking him. Leo pursed his lips in disappointment. Then, he turned his attention to the pagoda town.\nAside from the building that he stood on, there were other taller towers. The tallest structure shot up to the sky and penetrated the clouds. Moreover, it was wider and larger than the rest as its foundation was larger than a NASCAR stadium.\n\"Smash!\"\nTaxi also came up and looked at the tallest building. He pointed to the tower, hinting to Leo that the Rabbit Trent was in the tower.\nNoticing the gesture, Leo made his decision.\n\"Okay. Let's climb the tower.\"\n\"SMASH!\"\nBoth man and unicorn leaped from the building, flying toward the tower.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were still inside the tallest pagoda. They reached the 100th floor, but they hadn't reached the top yet. Moreover, they panted as they found it hard to move forward.\nHua Jiashan gave in to the suppressive force of the tower first. He sat at the foot of a unicorn statue on the 100th floor, catching his breaths and recuperating. As for Dongfang Mei, she sighed and rested in her wheelchair.\n\"I guess this is our limit,\" Dongfang Mei lamented.\n\"Probably. This floor depletes our physical strength and suppresses fire, water, wind, earth, metal, and wood element Qi. Unless we master the lightning element Qi, we can't proceed.\"\nHua Jiashan gazed at the floor tiles, which emitted electric currents. It kept zapping them, but they weren't in danger as the voltage was mild.\nAs they couldn't go further, they decided to cultivate the lightning element Qi in the tower. Both Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei closed their eyes and meditated.\nMeditation sometimes made one forget about time. They lost count of how long they meditated in the tower.\nBOOM\nFortunately, one loud noise woke them up from their trance. They stood up and looked at each other.\n\"What's the noise?\"\n\"Let's take a look.\"\nHua Jiashan pushed the wheelchair to the west window of the tower. Then, they noticed that one of the pagodas below crumbled. They gazed at the collapsed building in confusion.\n\"Are test towers supposed to be fragile?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\n\"A 20-floor tower is as strong as a soul formation cultivator's physique. You can't simply destroy it without being retaliated by the killing arrays or protective arrays of the tower.\"\n\"Yeah, that's what I thought. But…\"\nThey continued to observe the collapsed tower. Two minutes later, another loud boom surprised them. After the thunderous noise, a reverse lightning bolt shot up to the sky, carrying debris and burning wood high.\nAmong the debris, there was a person.\n\"Hmm?!\"\nHua Jiashan had good eyesight. He noticed a man that he knew.\n\"Daoist Florida Man?!\"\nDongfang Mei was surprised, \"Someone you know?\"\n\"Yes,\" Hua Jiashan broke a sweat. He didn't expect to see the rumored immortal here, \"He's a quasi-immortal that I talked about. He has been helping my sect and took in some of my disciples under his wings.\"\n\"Oh?\" Dongfang Mei was interested. She wondered what kind of senior Leo was.\nWhile listening to Hua Jiashan, Leo already descended and safely landed. A moment later, a vibrating sound wave hit both of them.\nUpon hearing the sound wave, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei instantly lost consciousness. As for the elders and disciples on the first floor, they also fainted.\nNobody got to witness that Leo would soon climb the tower.\n.\n.\nA minute later, Leo arrived at the foot of the tallest pagoda. He looked up, wondering if he should take a shortcut and jump to the top.\n\"Smash-Smash?\"\nTaxi pointed at the entrance. The steel bars slowly parted, opening a way for them to enter the tower.\nLeo shrugged. He didn't think much.\n\"Mortal Kombat style tower climbing? Well, why not?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 94 – Florida Man Proved Innocence after Karen Neighbor Accused Him of Having Intercourse with Horse, Her Husband Did\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Smash?\"\nLeo and Taxi gazed at the unconscious people on the first floor. He noticed several familiar faces in the crowd. Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and a few young maidens were defenseless. Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and disciples of the Life Sword Sect collapsed on the floor and their mouths foamed.\n\"Haiya.\"\nLeo put on rubber gloves and adjusted their sleeping posture. He let them sleep on their sides so that they could breathe easier. In addition, he sacrificed a few years of lifespan to purchase soft pillows for them.\nAfter helping the sick people, Leo proceeded forward. He walked toward the staircase, which was located at the north of the hall.\nAs Leo took a few steps closer to the stairs, his skin got somewhat itchy. He felt like some sort of mold tried to grow on his skin. Because of the itchiness, Leo brought back his hazmat suit and a gas mask. After putting them on, Leo got more confident.\nTaxi tilted his head as he couldn't understand why Leo put on clothes. He believed that it would be better for Leo to be naked so that it would be easier for Taxi to leech on Leo's virgin yang Qi.\n\"Smash?\"\nLeo patted his suit to check if there was no leak. When Leo was ready, he walked up the stairs and got to the second floor. Taxi also followed him even though the small staircase was not made for a horse.\nThe second floor, third floor, and the following floors contained nothing. However, the stairs of every floor were located on the opposite side of the hall. Thus, Leo and Taxi had to walk across the halls every time he headed to the next level.\nAfter walking through five floors, Leo got annoyed. He lightly jogged and picked up the pace. Taxi saw it as a challenge. He neighed and charged ahead, accelerating through the halls and stairs.\nIgnoring the insignificant pressure from the pagoda, both man and horse proceeded through the first 49 floors in minutes. However, when they reached the 50th floor, Taxi and Leo stopped racing.\nThey stood in front of a large unicorn statue. The figure raised its front two legs high as if it was about to leap across a ravine or an obstacle. The hind legs and its body were more muscular and larger than Taxi. However, the majestic icon of every unicorn was half broken as the statue's horn was missing.\nLeo admired the art and walked around its foundation. While he was at it, he stroked the smooth surface of the silver-like metal that was used as a square foundation for the figure.\nOn the other hand, Taxi gazed at the statue in a daze. It brightly smiled and neighed.\n\"SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!!!\"\nLeo frowned and looked at the weird unicorn, \"Wut da hail? Are you insane? This is a statue, not a sex doll. You cannot smash a rock statue's ass, or your PP will be scratched, Haiya.\"\n\"SMAAAAASSSHH!!\"\n\"…\"\nFor some reason, Taxi got overexcited. Leo frowned and looked at the statue's face, wondering what the weird horse liked about it.\nThen, Leo understood why – The horse statue's eyes moved, and it stared at him.\nCRACK\nThe stone horse statue changed its posture. Instead of raising its two front hooves, it stood firm and faced directly at Leo.\n\"Surprise boss fight?\" Leo smirked. He expected some action as he was bored running.\nBOOM\nBetraying Leo's expectation, the statue imploded, condensing into a white marble ball the size of a thumb. Then, it floated in front of Leo.\n\"Hah?!\" Leo's disappointment was immeasurable, and his day was ruined. He turned to Taxi, asking him about the marble, \"Hey. Do you know what this is?\"\nTaxi widely grinned, \"Smash!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Smash!!\"\nLeo rubbed his temples. He wondered if Taxi literally meant it, so he brought it closer to his eyes to take a closer look. Leo pulled off his mask and helmet so that they wouldn't get in the way.\nPLOP\nAs soon as the marble got close to Leo, it dissipated into gas. Then, the gas directly entered Leo's nostrils and mouth, becoming one with his body.\nLeo snorted and licked the ceiling of his mouth. The gas tasted like low-quality cocaine he used to have when he was young. It brought him bad memories and reminded him of the darkest era of his life.\n\"Haiya. I'm glad I died and quit those. I was so stupid back then. I even snorted MSG when I was drunk. What was I thinking?\"\nWhile Leo's ADHD kicked in and made him absentminded, the system gave him a notification message.\n<You acquired the linguistic knowledge of the Thunderous Smasher Tribe.>\n\"…\"\nLeo dully stared at the name. Then, he glanced at Taxi. The latter brightly smiled and showed Leo his teeth.\n\"Smash? XD\"\nLeo pursed his lips and deeply sighed. At long last, he finally understood its language.\n\"No, Taxi. I ain't gonna rub it on your back or your crack. Get your mind out of the gutter, damn horse!\"\n\"… Smash. D:\"\n\"And no. You can't rub it on me either. That's gay and wrong AF.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes as he gave up on Taxi's perversion. He proceeded to the next floor. However, as he got minor emotional damage from the language, Leo was no longer enthusiastic about speed-running the pagoda anymore.\n.I think you should take a look at\n.\nThe tower climbing process was slow after Leo stopped running. He took his time, walking across one hall after another. A few hours later, Leo and Taxi reached the 100th floor.\nOnce again, Leo and Taxi found another unicorn statue. They also spotted two cultivators there, resting and meditating under the statue.\nAs Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei noticed Leo's presence, they opened their eyes and gazed at the newcomer. But upon seeing a 9th-stage unicorn next to Leo, they were surprised.\n\"Isn't that… Thunder Unicorn?! How is it here?!\" Dongfang Mei stood up from her wheelchair, but she got lightheaded. The elder fell back on her chair and rubbed her forehead.\nHua Jiashan stood in front of Dongfang Mei. He confronted Leo.\n\"Sir Florida Man, I don't know that you'd be here, too. But why are you with that Thunder Unicorn? Do you know that Thunder Unicorns are dangerous species? They always leech one's virgin yin or yang until they die! They will never leave until either you lose your virginity or deplete your Qi first.\"\nHearing that Taxi would go away if he lose his virginity, Leo's expression turned dark. He coughed and feigned ignorant.\n\"You don't have to worry about that. I… have some experience.\"\n\"Is it?\" Hua Jiashan narrowed his eyes, not believing in Leo.\n\"It is. You get the wrong idea.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nHua Jiashan looked back and forth between Taxi and Leo. He didn't think that was the case there as Taxi didn't seem hostile to either Leo or them. Moreover, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei used to have a lover, and they weren't pure. Therefore, the unicorn could kill them at any moment.\n\"Smash?\" Taxi sneered at Hua Jiashan as it sensed the hostility in the latter's eyes.\nOnce again, Leo rolled his eyes, \"No, you cannot put it in his virgin crack.\"\n\"Smash! XD\"\n\"Also, no. I will never join your twisted orgy! Jesus Christ, you need help!\"\nLeo facepalmed. He was ashamed of his new pet's behavior, and he didn't know what to say to Hua Jiashan and the elder lady stranger.\nMeanwhile, Hua Jiashan was sharp. He noticed Leo's familiar tone and his ability to communicate with the unicorn. Seeing that Leo had it under control, Hua Jiashan was relieved.\n\"I see that you've managed to tame the thunder unicorn. Congratulations,\" Hua Jiashan saluted.\n\"Tame him? More like he's a stalker. This mofo wants nothing but beastially actions.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were taken aback by Leo's openness on this topic. In the cultivation world, the locals were similar to traditional Asians - Commoners and cultivators were more usually reserved in this matter, and they rarely discussed it in public.\nHearing Leo mention the topic made them uncomfortable. Still, they pretended that they didn't hear it as they were afraid of Leo and the horse.\nDongfang Mei saluted and introduced herself, \"Hello, sir. My name is Dongfang Mei. You must be Immortal Florida Man that I heard about. Thank you very much for taking care of Xu Nuan and her disciples.\"\n\"Don't mention it,\" Leo waved his hand as he didn't want to chat. He looked at the statue behind them.\nAgain, the statue's eyes fixated on Leo for an unknown reason. Leo looked back and briefly competed in a staring contest.\nRUMBLE\nA few seconds later, the statue moved.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei turned around and realized that the statue moved. The former pushed the wheelchair away from the marble horse.\nBOOM\nThe statue imploded, reducing to a small marble. Once again, it floated in front of Leo, waiting for him to take it.\nAs Leo had one before, he didn't hesitate to accept it. He put it closer to his nose, wondering if it would turn into cocaine again.\nPOOF\nLeo wasn't disappointed. It vanished into gas, and he inhaled everything. This time, it tasted and smelled like wasabi. The smell hit his brain and his eyes. He shut the eyelids and massaged his nose, resisting the exploding spiciness.\nThe torture continued for five minutes. However, it was worth the trouble.\nDING\n<You have unlocked a unique building – Thunder Wasabi Farm.>\n<Tips: Thunder Wasabi Farm can produce Thunder Unicorn's favorite food – Thunder Wasabi.>\n\"… This is convenient.\"\nLeo wondered if the tower was made for a unicorn owner. He turned to Taxi and hopped on him. Then, he slapped its butt.\n\"I'm too lazy to walk. Bring me to the next statue or the top floor, whatever comes first.\"\n\"SMASH! XD\"\nTaxi laughed and charged toward the stairs to the next floor, leaving Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei behind. Meanwhile, the two elders looked at them leave in astonishment.\nDongfang Mei wiped the sweat on her forehead. She looked at Hua Jiashan, \"You have an eccentric neighbor, Hua Jiashan.\"\n\"… Nah. He's just… unique.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 95 – Florida Man Robs Chinese Temple With Unicorn, Steals Only Apple Juice\nTaxi was efficient when he didn't need to follow Leo's pace. He charged through the floors as if he was a rapid train on crack. Within five minutes, Taxi and Leo reached the 150th floor.\nUnfortunately, there was no statue this time. Instead, they found a fountain of green water.\nTaxi stopped running. It trotted toward the fountain in a trance. Leo also got down from Taxi's back and inspected the weird water. He looked at it.\n\"Hmm?\"\nHe had seen them before. The smell, the texture, and the bubbles looked the same.\nAs Leo got closer to the fountain, the system identified the liquid for him.\n.\nPinnacle Grade Yin Poison Potion\n- Increase Yin Element Qi by 10 years' worth of cultivation (10cc)\n- Grant immunity to all poison.\n- Increase Poison Element Qi by 20 years' worth of cultivation (10cc)\n- Add poison to blood.\n.\nThe detail was a lot different from the lesser yin poison potion that he had sold to Jin Yong. Leo thought about it and bitterly laughed as he hadn't made this potion for a long time.\n\"I guess this is a checkpoint or something. But isn't this realm supposed to be specialized in wood and earth Qi? Why the hell is the poison potion here?\"\nWhile Leo mumbled to himself, Taxi drank the potion in glee. He slurped and splashed the potion everywhere with his long tongue.\nLeo rolled his eyes and shook his head. He put down his backpack and brought out a water canteen. Then, he drank the leftover high-grade rejuvenate tea. He drank everything in the canteen.\nAfter rejuvenating himself with a soft drink, Leo used the same canteen to store the poison potion. He also drank a mouthful of it.\nIt tasted like apple juice, and it was freezing cold.\nGetting addicted to the apple juice, Leo brightly grinned. He purchased an empty water tank from the online shopping system and stored more poison potions in the container. Although Leo could have made them by using the alchemy workshop, he couldn't resist the free stuff.\nIn the end, Leo filled half of the 1500-gallon tank and emptied the fountain. Taxi pouted and looked at Leo in frustration.\n\"…Smash.\"\nLeo laughed at Taxi, \"Don't be mad. This is our backup water supply while we're climbing the tower. Don't you wanna drink it when we're going up? Because the fountain is here, we can't climb the tower while we're enjoying such a quality beverage at the same time, right? Therefore, we store the water there, and we bring it along our journey!\"\n\"SMASH! O_O\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"That's right. I'm a genius.\"\nBoth man and horse laughed. Still, they forgot about one issue. As the massive water tank was as tall as Taxi, someone had to carry it.\nThe troublesome task fell to Leo as Taxi had no saddle or tools to carry the water tank. Leo sighed and lifted the tank. Then, he put it on his shoulder vertically, maintaining its balance. With the tank on his shoulder, Leo strode with a quick pace, dashing and leading Taxi to the next floor.\n.\nBecause of the water tank, it took Leo 10 minutes to reach the 200th floor. Upon reaching this level, Leo and Taxi encountered another weird checkpoint – They found a 5-meter-tall rabbit statue. It stood on two hind legs while its four arms held a sword, a wand, a spear, and a shield. The rabbit's face was heinous as it had six eyes and a wide mouth that reached its ears. The cute teeth were replaced with sharp fangs that resembled shark fangs.\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he remembered that the boss of this realm was the Rabbit Trent King. He believed that the statue represented something related to the boss.\n\"SMASH!!\"\nFor the first time, Taxi bore his teeth. His unicorn horn emanated visible static electricity, charging his lightning Qi and getting ready for a fight.\nThe statue on this floor represented a rabbit trent. Rabbit Trents and Thunder Unicorns were sworn enemies. They vied to take control of this realm for centuries. So far, the war was in the rabbit trent's favor as the rabbit trents had an advantage over the unicorns. Although the unicorns' firepower was superior to the trents, the tree monsters were not easy to kill. Rabbit Trents specialized in physical defense and regenerative abilities, making them impossible to kill in one or two strikes. Moreover, it could leech life force from its prey, and it could easily overpower any unicorn in a prolonged battle.\nSeeing Taxi's reaction, Leo widely grinned. He put his backpack and water tank down.\n\"Finally, a warm-up exercise?\"\nLeo approached the statue, hoping to trigger something. As he got closer, the rabbit statue moved and looked at Leo.\nRUMBLE\nThe stone statue transformed into a wood statue. The rabbit stretched its arms and widened its mouth.\nWIGGLE\nA hundred wood vines came out from the rabbit's mouth as if they were carnivorous parasites. They thrust toward Leo with their sharp tips.\n\"Oh, so this is why you're called \"Trent\".\"\nLeo took a side step to the left and avoided the vine thrust.\nBOOM\nThe vines punctured through the floor.\nSCREECH\nThe rabbit turned its head right and swing the vines toward Leo. The vines dug out a portion of the floor tiles and came toward Leo.\nWHOOSH\nThe swing went through the afterimage of Leo. He was no longer there.\nThe rabbit rotated its eyes, searching for the prey. However, it could only see the unicorn, who was busy charging its horn's energy. As the rabbit could no longer see Leo, its attention focused on Taxi.\n\"SMASH!!\"\nTaxi roared and unleashed a yellow railgun beam toward the rabbit's chest.I think you should take a look at\nBANG\nThe beam connected, charring the rabbit's chest. However, it was not enough to kill the monster. The rabbit detached the vines from its mouth, and its arms extended.\nThe two arms with a sword and a spear swung its weapon at Taxi!\nPLOP\nUnfortunately, the extended arms suddenly fell off and withered. Not only the two arms, the rabbit's body, legs, and the other two arms rapidly shrunk.\nOn the rabbit's head, Leo sat there while his hands held the rabbit trent's ears. A stain of his spit was inside its right earhole.\nThe rabbit was confused. It slowly collapsed and lost all its strength, withering like a dead flower.\nLeo jumped down from the rabbit's head. He looked back and patted his clothes. Then, he put on his gloves. Meanwhile, Taxi widened his eyes and stared at Leo in astonishment. He couldn't believe that its sworn enemy died so easily.\n\"Smash!?\"\nTaxi questioned Leo about how he managed to kill the rabbit trent so easily. The trent had the same cultivation base as Taxi, but he had never been able to take down a rabbit trent in one attack before.\n\"Ah, that?\" Leo scratched his head. He paused for a while before he came up with an explanation. \"I have a dryad pet, so I know how to deal with plant monsters. That's all.\"\n\"Smash?\"\n\"Yes, a dryad.\"\n\"Smash?\"\n\"And yes, she's a virgin female monster… Hold up.\"\n\"SMASH? XD\"\n\"HELL NO! She's a child, for god's sake! You need Jesus!\"\n\"Smash. D:\"\n\"What the hell?! Who do you think I am? She's like my freaking daughter, you freak. Of course not, you cannot date her or procreate with her!\"\n\"…Smash. T-T\"\nLeo and Taxi bickered for a while as Taxi never stopped inquiring about the mysterious dryad pet that Leo kept at home. In the end, Leo was mentally exhausted and took a break on this floor, calling it a night.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo and Taxi had fun in the tallest pagoda tower, Situ Nantian's explored the mysterious mountains. Inside a small cave of the tallest mountain, they found a treasure trove of a predecessor, who got stuck in this realm.\nSitu Nantian and Situ clansmen inspected the wall and the bones of the former resident here. The former read the texts, written with the blood.\n\"I've failed to steal the gnosis of this world. I managed to sneak into the triangle building and got a few pieces of artifacts from that place, but it got poisoned because of those rabbit trents. If anybody is reading this, be careful of that building. There are several 9th-rank rabbit trents in there. The forest is also dangerous. I saw a few 9th-stage thunder unicorns and unicorn caimans in the river. Avoid them if you can't defeat them. I hope my advice can save your life, and my good karma is enough for me to reincarnate.\"\nSitu Nantian frowned and gazed at the dried blood. He closed his eyes and asked his subordinates.\n\"Do you know who the dead person is?\"\nOne of the clansmen placed a white talisman on the skeleton's forehead, and it shone. A white wisp of energy flowed from the corpse to the clansman's head, transferring a portion of the memory of the dead person.\nAfter digesting the information, the subordinate reported.\n\"This man was a celestial physique stage cultivator. I can't learn of his name, but he's one of many bottom feeders of a nameless immortal world.\"\n\"Celestial Physique Stage?\"\n\"Umm, it's the first stage of the immortal ranks, sir. From this man's memory, there are nine immortal stages. I managed to learn only one stage.\"\nSitu Nantian nodded as the memory extraction talisman was difficult to use. Moreover, the dead cultivator died a long time ago, and his soul was no longer there. Getting this much information was already a miracle.\nEverybody waited for Situ Nantian's order. They wondered if they should follow the immortal's advice and avoid the mysterious triangle structure.\nThe grand elder deeply sighed. If an immortal like this person couldn't make it, they wouldn't have a chance. Since they couldn't explore the pyramid, Situ Nantian could only search for another place to gather treasures and artifacts.\n\"Is there another record beside the wall?\"\nThe clansmen searched the corpse and found three spatial rings. They were locked, and they couldn't forcefully unlock them as they were too weak. The rings were presented to Situ Nantian.\nSeeing the rings, Situ Nantian was satisfied. Even if he couldn't unlock them now, they could extract whatever items inside later once they studied the rings enough.\n\"We found a book, grand elder!\"\nThat was not all. One of the clansmen stripped the skeleton's clothes and found a book. He brought it to Situ Nantian to gain some credits.\nSitu Nantian picked up the book and flipped it. He read a few words and narrowed his eyes.\n\"Power of Gnosis?\"\nHe had never heard of the word \"Gnosis\" before. His interest was piqued, and he kept on reading. Then, he flipped over to read the title of the book.\nDao of Overlord\n\"…\"\nA faint smile appeared on Situ Nantian's face. As he finally found a way to ascend and become an immortal.\nAccording to the book, anyone who managed to acquire the gnosis of the mystic realm's overlord would gain permanent access to the realm. In addition, all Qi in the realm would be transferred to the new overlord, allowing the person to get stronger.\nGreed overwhelmed Situ Nantian. His passion was ignited.\n\"Say, does anybody here know anything about gnosis and the rabbit trents?\"",

They sat up at the same time the morning sunlight shone through the windows.\nEverybody was dizzy. The young disciples had a high fever while the elders only had a mild headache.\nYao Qiqi was among them. She sat up and wobbled.\nThe six-year-old girl looked different from before. After she drank several mouthfuls of rejuvenate tea, her physique age regressed three years, reverting her body to a three-year-old child. No matter how everybody looked at her, she was just a little child that shouldn't be here.\nHowever, her cultivation base was no joke. Despite looking like a kindergarten child, she entered the mystic realm as a foundation establishment cultivator. Moreover, after she woke up, her Qi volume surpassed that of a peak golden core cultivator even though her cultivation base remained the same.\nYao Qiqi yawned. She looked around and found Xu Nuan, who was her current mentor and new mother.\n\"…Good morning, mama.\"\nXu Nuan turned toward her adopted child and carried her in her arms. She brightly smiled, \"Are you okay? Did you get hurt?\"\n\"Just a little dizzy. What was that noise, mama?\" Yao Qiqi hugged her foster mother and smiled. She loved being spoiled.\n\"I don't know either.\"\nXu Nuan bitterly smiled and gazed at Han Hao and Han Meng. Their conditions were as bad as hers as their faces were as pale as a sheet.\nWhile everybody checked on their disciples and their colleagues, Xu Nuan heard the voice transmissions of Dongfang Mei.\n'Is everybody alright?'\nXu Nuan closed her eyes and replied in her mind, 'Yes, senior. Everybody has recovered.'\n'What about Qiqi?'\n'She's doing fine. Actually, this might be a fortuitous encounter for her. I think her Qi volume has tripled'\n'…Keep on protecting her. She's our hope and dream.'\n'Understood.'\nXu Nuan wasn't the only one who got to talk to their team leader. Han Hao also heard the voice of Hua Jiashan.\n'Is there any casualty?'\nHan Hao deeply sighed and muttered, \"No, sect master. Everybody survives. Only minor injuries.\"\n'Very well. Everybody has five days to cultivate. After that, send all disciples back, and we will begin collecting as many herbs and fruits from this mystic realm.'\nHearing that they would get to spend a couple days treasure-hunting, Han Hao was overjoyed, \"Yes, sect master! We'll do our best.\"\n'Oh, by the way.'\n\"Yes?\"\n'While you're unconscious, Daoist Florida Man entered the pagoda. He has gone ahead of me and Dongfang Mei. I don't know which floor he is on, but he should be at the top by now. If something weird happens again, ignore my orders and evacuate everybody out of this mystic realm.'\n\"Huh?\"\n'Just so you know, Daoist Florida Man comes here with a thunder unicorn. I think it's his new mount or pet.'\n\"…\"\nHan Hao's eyes turned into two small dots as he didn't know how to react to Leo's deeds. His action reminded him of Wu Buyi, who semi-betrayed Life Sword Sect to bootlick Leo. He wondered what the alchemist friend was doing.\n\"Sect master, which mystic realm portal is Daoist Florida Man using? How did he come here?\"\n'Have you forgotten about his portal platform? He made one for himself, no?'\n\"…\"\nHan Hao smacked his forehead with his palm. He saw that platform, but he didn't pay attention to it. Finally, he understood why Wu Buyi volunteered to be by Leo's side.\n\"If Florida Man is here, that damn fox should be here too. You're a damn shameless, Wu Buyi! How could you leech that quasi-immortal by yourself?! You should have told me!\"\nIt was too late to regret.\n.\n.\nWhile everybody was ready for a new day of exploration and cultivation, Leo picked up a 9th-rank monster core of the dead rabbit trent and put it in his pocket. He wanted to eat it, but he needed them for the longevity pills that he hadn't made yet. Then, they resumed their journey to the top of the pagoda.\nFortunately, they simply needed to walk across every floor and climb every stair inside the pagoda building. They didn't have to parkour or jump over small platforms like a certain popular game that required players to climb random objects until they reached the space.\nAs both Taxi and Leo had experience, they rushed through the next 50 floors, hoping to find another boss or a checkpoint.\nOn the 250th floor, they found what they wanted. Two rabbit trents stood tall, blocking the path to the next level. As soon as Leo and Taxi showed up, they hissed and attacked him.\nLeo grinned. This time, he didn't let Taxi fight. He charged toward the rabbit trents.\n\"Nom-Nom mother-trucker! Gimme your lifespan and your monster cores!!\"\n.\nA minute later, Leo got his hands on two more monster cores. As he had more than one, he bit one of the apple-sized monster cores to see how much he would get.\nAfter eating the entire monster core, Leo got the result.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 2,000 years.>\nLeo pursed his lips. It was not bad. However, he wondered if the longevity pills would give him more than 2,000 YOL. As such, he kept the second rabbit trent's core in his pocket.\nThe climbing resumed.\nOn the 251st floor, things changed. Instead of finding a blank floor with a strong Qi pressure as usual, they found three rabbit trents, standing guard in front of the stairs to the next level.\n\"Hohoh?\"\nLeo licked his lips. He loved this pattern.\n\"I guess we have more monster cores in the menu. But the real question is, how can I transport them home?\"I think you should take a look at\nHe crossed his arms and approached the three rabbit trent monsters, looking at the cute creatures.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo was busy climbing the pagoda, Situ Nantian departed from the heaven-piercing mountains. They traveled east, heading toward the pagoda town that Leo was in.\nSitu Nantian never stopped reading the book after he got his hands on it. He learned so much that he wanted to know more. While he read it, he also taught the other clansmen.\n\"Gnosis is the core of a celestial being. It contains the solidified dao and karma of the cultivator. Whoever digests the gnosis of a celestial being, will obtain the power of gnosis, attaining the same strength as the former gnosis owner. This is a shortcut to reach the immortal stage!\"\nEverybody was astonished. They were grateful that Situ Nantian shared this knowledge with them.\n\"But that's not the end. Gnosis is just a replica of something grand. In the book, it mentions \"Fate Crystal\". It says that fate crystals are created along with a lucky newborn baby chosen by heaven. The fate owner has a tremendous amount of luck, and their talent defies all logic. Every person with fate crystal can be considered as the protagonist of the era.\"\n\"Wow.\"\n\"This is funny, though. Our ancestors also mentioned it a long time ago.\"\nSitu Nantian remembered the teaching of his grandfather, who had ascended long ago. He always warned Situ Nantian not to antagonize the fate crystal bearer no matter what.\n\"Protagonists of the era… Hehehe.\"\nAlthough his grandfather had warned him, Situ Nantian had another idea. According to the book of the mysterious immortal, it mentioned how one could become heaven's favorite child by stealing the fate crystal from the chosen one. Moreover, it also listed the quality of the crystals.\nThe lowest quality was named Heavenly Fate Crystal. The drawn image in the book showed a fist-sized crystal, and the book described that it enabled the bearer to create a new universe in their dantian.\nThe standard fate crystal, on the other hand, was called \"Entity Fate Crystal\". It came in various sizes, and the biggest one was rumored to be at least 500 meters in diameter. The book highlighted that these crystals used to be heavenly fate crystals, but the crystals absorbed their owners' luck enough to evolve.\nSmaller Entity Fate Crystals could only be found among overlords of a realm, a planet, or a mystic realm. As for the bigger ones, nobody knew where they could be found.\nAfter learning about the unique artifacts, Situ Nantian couldn't sit still. He desired those fate crystals and the power of gnosis.\nHe wanted absolute power!\nBecause of the enthusiasm and excitement, Situ Nantian flew past Leo's camping site, where Wu Buyi and Gao Yan had been staying in. The clansmen noticed them, but they ignored the two as their cultivation bases were too weak.\nThe group flew for six hours. At 1 PM, they finally reached the pagoda town.\nSitu Nantian ignored the small pagodas. He gazed at the tallest one, which streaked through the clouds. Judging from his eyes, there should be about 300 to 400 floors.\n\"According to the book and that immortal, this place should be the lair of rabbit trent king. He should be the owner of this mystic realm.\"\nSitu Nantian's subordinates got nervous. As the dead immortal didn't have a chance against the mystic realm overlord, they doubted that Situ Nantian could defeat it.\n\"G-Grand elder. Do you have a plan? How do we defeat it?\"\nSitu Nantian smirked, \"Who do you think I am? I am SITU NANTIAN, THE HEAVEN'S SCRIBE! All my talismans are capable enough to kill weak immortals!\"\n\"But sir… that dead immortal also-\"\nSitu Nantian glared at his subordinate, \"You, shut up! You don't understand anything! This is our golden opportunity to obtain godly knowledge from the immortal realms! If we can acquire either a fate crystal or the power of gnosis, our clan will be the strongest, and we won't have to bow down to the Imperial Family anymore!\"\n\"…\"\nThe followers still doubted their grand elder. They looked at each other, wanting to bail from this mission.\nWhile the crowd was reluctant to follow Situ Nantian's order or follow his lead, a loud boom came from the sky. Everybody looked up and noticed that the clouds around the top of the pagoda dispersed.\n\"Hmm?\"\nSitu Nantian narrowed his eyes as he could see through walls and objects. He noticed an aura of an old man, whose cultivation base couldn't be measured. Behind the old man, there was a 9th-stage thunder unicorn.\nHowever, in front of the man and the horse, there was a terrifying aura of a monster.\nSitu Nantian flinched in fear. The aura of the monster belonged to the being that surpassed the 9th stage. It could also be considered a sacred beast as its presence was similar to an immortal.\n\"Immortal beast?!\"\nThat was the nickname of a 10th-stage monster beast or stronger beast. Usually, they rarely appeared in a mystic realm that was connected to a mortal world. However, they sometimes appeared as a guardian, protecting the most important place of a mystic realm.\nSitu Nantian laughed. He flew up, planning to take advantage of their fight and steal whatever artifacts from the tower. He instantly hovered over the 400th floor, the top floor.\nBOOM\nBefore Situ Nantian could do anything, a loud gong sound echoed. He flinched for a moment as he couldn't control his Qi. A few seconds later, he free-fell from the sky.\nSitu Nantian didn't notice what the old man did to the 10th-stage monster.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, at the 400th floor, Leo bit his lower lip as he gazed at the broken gong.\n\"Why did you have to do that?! This is my favorite gong! I was planning to use it as my alarm bell!\"\nIn front of Leo, a 10-meter-tall rabbit trent sat on his throne, staring down at Leo and Taxi. He scoffed after he destroyed the gong with a flying sword.\n\"You puny human is too loud. Your life, your treasures, and your meat will be the fertilizer for my kin-\"\nBOOM\nLeo suddenly launched and counter-punch from a distance. The wind, caused by the fist, punctured through the rabbit trent king's chest, leaving a large hole.\n\"???\"\nThe rabbit trent king looked down in confusion. He didn't understand what had hit him.\nLeo stomped toward rabbit trent king. He jumped and landed on the king's lap and snatched the dangling red orb from the monster.\n\"Ain't nobody got time for that! Gimme your damn monster core. I need to finish my goddamn quest so that I can start farming my lifespan!\"\n\"…\"\nThe rabbit trent king's consciousness slowly faded. He had a thousand questions and rebukes to say, but Leo shut down his hope.\nJust like that, Leo skipped the boss fight and went straight for the quest reward.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 97 – Vegan Cops Stalk Florida Man for Eating Meat at Home\nAfter making a quick work on the rabbit trent king, Leo butchered the corpse, searching for the quest item that the system mentioned. However, he couldn't find it anywhere. The only thing that came out from the corpse was the 10th-grade monster core.\n\"Where is the gnosis thingy?\"\nLeo grumbled while he looked at the quest menu.\n.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 – Kill Rabbit Trent King.\n2 – Absorb Gnosis of Rabbit Trent King.\nSecondary Objective:\n1 – Locate Entity Fate Crystal in Sweet Dream Mushroom Forest\n2 – Absorb Entity Fate Crystal.\nExploration Rewards: 3 Free Tickets, Ownership of Planet Rabbit Trent A-3\nSecondary Rewards: 1 Lucky Draw\n.\nAfter rereading the description, Leo got new inspiration. As the quest wanted him to absorb the gnosis, he might as well eat the entire corpse of this monster.\n\"Oh well. Nom-Nom mother-trucker!\"\nLeo started by taking a bite of the withered vines. He sat there, eating every piece that he could get. As for Taxi, he stood there, gazing at Leo in astonishment and respect.\n\"… Smash?\"\nTaxi lowered its head, wanting to take a piece, too. However, as it licked the mutated blood of the rabbit trent king, he flinched.\nLeo glanced at the horse and warned him, \"Be careful about that. Mutated blood is full of cancer cells. You're going to get cancer if you eat that.\"\n\"Smash?! D:\"\n\"Of course not. That ain't your food. It's mine. Only I can eat it.\"\nTaxi backed away from the corpse. It looked around if there was anything else he could do. Then, it found the pile of rabbit trent king's collections, piling into a mountain.\nMost of them were fruits. At a glance, they looked similar to dragon fruits, which were common in Southeast Asia in the modern world. However, it was Taxi's first time seeing these edible goodies.\nLeo also sneaked glances at the white dragon fruits. They were bigger than apples, but their skin looked like flower petals, looking majestic and unique. They glittered in white light, emitting strong yang Qi.\nUpon looking carefully, Leo and Taxi noticed a tall plant with droopy long leaves, similar to aloe vera leaves. It stood in the middle of dragon fruits. Similar to its offspring, the leaves were white, and they were full of yang Qi. However, from the perspective of Leo, the leaves looked like LED lights.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nDragon fruits kept coming out from the plant. Every minute, a new fruit was born and fell off the plant. However, the old fruits never withered as they gathered Qi from the environment to sustain and prolong their life.\nLeo ate the corpse while he frowned at the weird plant and the fruits. He asked Taxi.\n\"Do you know what those are?\"\n\"…Smash. :(\"\n\"So, you don't know too?\"\n\"Smash? :D\"\n\"Fine. Eat them if you can.\"\n\"SMASH! XD\"\nTaxi dashed toward the piles of fruits. He took one in his mouth and chewed it whole. As soon as his teeth cut through the skin, his taste buds perceived the sweet and jelly-like soft texture of the white seed.\nIt was delicious!\nHowever, there was something wrong with the fruit. Taxi swallowed half of it and spat the remaining out. He neighed and collapsed on the floor.\nLeo stopped eating the withered branch of rabbit trent king. He smirked at Taxi, \"You got smashed, it seems. How was it, donkey?\"\nTaxi didn't answer. He gestured to Leo with his eyes, challenging his new boss to eat it himself.\nLeo shrugged and slapped his bare hand on the pony's belly. He wasn't afraid that Taxi would mutate as his skin already touched this guy several times when he was riding him – Taxi was immune to Leo's radiation.\nPicking up one of the fruits, Leo flipped it around and inspected it. He vaguely remembered that the normal version of these fruit cost about 6-7 USD each during the pre-nuclear war. He also read on the internet somewhere that farmers who grew those fruits in Asia only sold them for less than a dollar per kg.\nThinking of the past, Leo had a complicated feeling. He somewhat wished that the war would have happened, but the other side of him was grateful that he survived and lived until this day.\n\"Cheers. For humanity. For immortality, and for me.\"\nLeo looked up and raised the fruit, paying homage to eight billion souls that died in the past. Then, without peeling it, he took a bite.\n\"…\"\nNothing happened. Leo kept eating it without spitting the black seeds out. Moreover, the fruit didn't mutate even though it touched his skin and his saliva.\nAfter swallowing everything, Leo cleaned his hands by swiping them with his hazmat pants. He looked at Taxi in confusion.\n\"You're weak, donkey. I don't feel anything.\"\n\"…Smash?!\"\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"Yeah, I don't have a stomach ache like you.\"\nLeo scoffed and glanced at his system menu, wondering what kind of perk he got from the fruit.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\nThe reward was insignificant. He would rather eat raw monster meat or rotten rabbit trent as they offered more per bite.\nTaxi noticed that Leo disregarded the fruits, and he slowly got back up. Although he had stomach pain, he still wanted to eat more.\nUnbeknownst to Leo, Taxi gained so much Yang Qi from the fruit. He believed that he got about 10 years' worth of cultivation after eating half of the white dragon fruit. However, his dantian and monster core couldn't handle the flood of energy, causing his stomach to repel some of the yang Qi out.\nNot wanting to lose to Leo, Taxi mustered his strength to eat the remaining fruit that he had spat earlier.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo and Taxi took their time on the top of the pagoda, Situ Nantian regained his bearing. He flew back to the top of the pagoda to see who interfered with him.\nFloating 10 meters away from the top floor's window, Situ Nantian looked at the people inside. Then, he spotted a 9th-stage monster, a thunder unicorn. Next to the monster was an old man with a rainbow aura.\nSitu Nantian narrowed his eyes for a moment. As he couldn't find Leo's dao avatar, he was on guard.\n'Where is his dao avatar? Who is he? Why haven't I seen him before? I know all quasi-immortal and soul transformation cultivators in the main continent and those west barbarians. How come I haven't seen this guy before? He seems like another quasi-immortal…\"I think you should take a look at\nHe contemplated for a moment before he recalled some of the reports regarding a certain Florida Man.\nRemembering the reports, Situ Nantian figured out the identity of the person in the pagoda tower. He smirked.\n'I see. This is the rumored immortal of the Magpie City. Well, I respect you. I vaguely sensed the presence of an immortal beast, but you managed to kill it. I won't find trouble with you. However, it's another story if you find the gnosis and the fate crystal!'\nSitu Nantian continued to lurk in the sky, waiting for Leo to find the right item. As for his subordinates, they quickly caught up with their grand elder and waited for new instructions.\n\"You stay out of this. I'll handle it myself. Be prepared to leave on a signal.\"\n\"…Yes, grand elder.\"\n.\nOne hour later, nothing changed. Leo kept on eating the monster's corpse. As for the unicorn, it lay on the floor, taking a nap after food. It snored and clattered its teeth.\nSitu Nantian frowned as he found Leo and Taxi obnoxious. Still, he waited for them to find the fate crystal and the gnosis.\nAnother hour passed, yet, Leo hadn't finished eating the monster. 80% of the massive corpse remained, and Leo couldn't eat anymore. He sat down and patted his bloated belly. Then, he closed his eyes, taking a short nap.\n\"…\"\nSitu Nantian was annoyed. He had the urge to enter the building through the window. However, he was afraid of Leo's hidden strength. Moreover, he didn't know if the pagoda had a defensive mechanism that could prevent outsiders from entering the tower from the sky.\nFour hours later, Leo stretched and yawned. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head.\n\"Aw, that was a good nap. Alright. Time to nom-nom again.\"\nHearing Leo's words, Situ Nantian flinched. Blood veins under his facial skin swelled, and his face reddened in anger. He took a deep breath to calm down.\n'Just be done with the corpse, Florida Man! Stop wasting my time!'\nDespite being angry, Situ Nantian held it in and waited patiently. Unfortunately, he underestimated Leo's endurance and greediness.\n.\n.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\nLeo hummed as he enjoyed eating the rabbit trent king's withered corpse. Each bite netted him 10 years of lifespan, which was a lot better than golden sand bananas or white dragon fruits. Although the taste was disgusting, Leo loved nutritious food.\nWhile eating, Leo rubbed his nose and closed his eyes. He already sensed a group of people floating outside the windows. However, he didn't bother attacking them as he couldn't gain lifespan from other humans in this place.\n\"Just keep watching, you dum-dum wet bananas. Anyway, time for… the disgusting part.\"\nLeo looked at the innards of the rabbit trent king. He thought that its body was made of wood, but it had innards and organs, made of wood!\nHe picked up a long intestine, which looked like withered vines. He broke it into a small piece and put it in his mouth.\nAs Leo had guessed, it literally tasted like rotten moldy seaweed.\n\"Yuck. Jesus Christ. What did you eat to smell like this?!\"\nTaxi smirked and gestured with his head, looking at the pile of dragon fruits. Leo noticed the horse's reaction and stared at the plant and useless fruits.\n\"Meh. A vegan, I see. You were malnourished, you dum-dum rabbit!\"\nLeo kept eating the intestine vines. Then, he glanced at the notification message window.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\nHe felt a bit better. Seeing the number, Leo was encouraged to keep going. He raised his arms and shouted.\n\"LET'S DO THIS! I'LL FINISH THIS THING WITHIN TOMORROW!\"\n.\n.\nOutside the pagoda, Situ Nantian almost fell from the sky. He covered his face and gritted his teeth.\n'HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING TO WASTE YOUR TIME!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHY ARE YOU EATING A DISGUSTING MONSTER CORPSE!?'\nSitu Nantian was so infuriated that he wanted to kill somebody. He clenched his fist, getting ready to launch a surprise attack on Leo.\nKLUK-KLUK\nBut then, Situ Nantian's eyes found a rolling red ball, which fell off Leo's pocket.\n\"Hmm?\"\nThat was the monster core of an immortal beast, a 10th-stage monster core!\nSitu Nantian narrowed his eyes. He wondered if it was related to the fate crystal that was mentioned in the book. His eyes followed the orb.\nKLUK-KLUK\nThe clear red orb rolled toward the pile of white dragon fruits. As soon as the orb touched them, the fruits vanished into the orb.\n\"!!!\"\nSitu Nantian widened his eyes in astonishment. He had never seen a weird monster core like that before.\n'What is that thing?'\nCurious, Situ Nantian approached one of the windows, close to the white dragon fruit plant. As he got closer, he found a mysterious orb, which was dangling behind the white plant, hiding among the dragon fruits.\nAt a glance, it looked like an eyeball. However, its surface was similar to smooth shining glass.\nThe glass eyeball looked at Situ Nantian. Then, it looked left and right.\nPLOP\nThe eyeball detached from the plant. Then, it vanished into a pile of dragon fruits.\nSitu Nantian paused for a moment before he widely grinned. He reopened the book to compare the image.\nIt looked different. The heavenly fate crystal in the book was a clear marble ball the size of a grain or a thumb. However, the eyeball earlier was as big as a fist.\n\"…\"\nSitu Nantian narrowed his eyes.\nHe wanted that eyeball. Even though it might not be the fate crystal that he wanted, he still wanted the eyeball to experiment on it.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 98 – Gunfire Exchanged during a High-Speed Chase after Cops Stole Florida Man's Poke Ball\nFor three days, Leo and Taxi remained on the pagoda's top floor, eating everything they could. As for Situ Nantian and his men, they waited for an opportunity to steal the 10th-grade monster core and the eyeball.\nFinally, Leo finished his food. However, Leo was frustrated. He ate everything, but the quest hadn't ended yet.\n\"What is GNOSIS?!\"\nAfter shouting, Leo paced around the room, wondering what he did wrong. Taxi glanced at Leo and scoffed.\n\"Smash?\"\n\"Huh? Isn't that the rabbit trent king?\"\n\"S-Smash?\"\n\"What you do mean, there might be other kings?! Are you saying that we killed the wrong guy?\"\n\"Smash… D:\"\nHearing Taxi's suggestions, Leo's mood was ruined. He scratched his head and looked at the pile of dragon fruits. Although he already ate a lot, he picked one up and ate it without peeling the skin.\nIt was so-so. At least, the fruit was a thousand times better than rotten wood.\nWhile eating, Leo patted his pant pocket. He noticed that his pocket was strangely light. Then, he remembered that he hadn't eaten the rabbit trent king's monster core yet.\n\"Right. Is that the case? Hey, Taxi. Help me look for the monster core. I think I dropped it somewhere around here.\"\nTaxi nodded and helped Leo search for the monster core. He scanned the room with his Qi. A few seconds later, he found it under a pile of dragon fruits.\n\"Smash!\"\n\"Oh, you've found it? Good job!\"\nLeo laughed and slapped Taxi's robust stomach. Then, he approached the pile of dragon fruits that Taxi looked at. Pushing everything to the side, Leo dug the small mountain of edible alien-like balls.\nAt the bottom of the pile, Leo finally found the red ball that he had lost. However, something was hugging it.\nThere was a white eyeball creature with small tentacle arms and legs. It already half-absorbed the monster core.\n\"Oi, you. That's mine!\"\nLeo reached out to grab the parasite. However, it carried the monster core and ran toward the dragon fruit plant.\nThe plant also reacted to the eyeball. It split itself in half as if it created a new mouth. Then, the eyeball entered the plant along with the monster core.\n\"HEY!!\"\nLeo didn't expect the little parasite to steal his monster core. He stomped toward the plant, planning to tear it to pieces.\n\"NOW!\"\nAt that moment, a certain lurker suddenly charged into the building through a window. He touched the plant, and it vanished into his spatial ring!\nSitu Nantian made his move!\nLeo's eyes and Situ Nantian's eyes met. The former was enraged while the latter sneered.\nSitu Nantian let out a short snort. His body transformed into smoke, and it dissipated everywhere!\n\"SMASH!!\"\nTaxi reacted first. He roared and released a yellow lightning blast. The electric shockwave hit everything in the hall, including Leo.\nZAP!\nThe lightning blast hit Situ Nantian's invisible body before he could leave the building through the window. His body stiffened as his entire body was inflicted with the petrification curse of the yellow lightning tribulation.\nMeanwhile, Leo took a firm step. A split second later, he appeared in front of Situ Nantian. With his bare hand, he reached out to seize his neck.\nPOOF\nUnfortunately, Situ Nantian vanished again before Leo could touch him.\nLeo's pupils reddened. Without relying on Taxi's help, he swept his eyes around. Instantly, he stopped to look at the northwest direction.\nOne kilometer away from the pagoda tower, Situ Nantian's real body reappeared in the sky. The grand elder sweated profusely, and he shouted, ordering his subordinates.\n\"STOP HIM! ATTACK HIM WITH WHATEVER YOU HAVE!!\"\nThe nine underlings of Situ Nantian shouted and summoned their 10-meter-tall dao avatars. Nine giant figures of ogres holding talismans appeared, and they surrounded the pagoda building.\nNine 50 meters long talismans emanated a red aura, linking all talismans together like chains. Then, they unleashed flame beams toward Leo and Taxi.\n\"SMASH!\"\nTaxi was offended. He roared and released his dao avatar as well.\nA hundred-meter-tall muscular man with a horse face and silver skin appeared. He looked down upon the smaller avatars of the cultivators. At the same time, the same yellowish shockwave transformed into a dome barrier, protecting Taxi's real body from the flame beams.\nBOOM\nThe laser beams hit the dome barrier. However, because of the extreme heat, all dragon fruits melted away.\n\"SMASH!! D:<\"\nTaxi was enraged. With the Hulk's physique, his dao avatar punched one of the floating talismans.\nBOOM\nThe talisman array was broken, and the fire beams vanished.\n\"PPFFFF!!\"\nAll nine cultivators spat several mouthfuls of blood as the backlash hit them. They fell from the sky with an internal injury.\nMeanwhile, Leo was no longer inside the building. When the laser beams came toward him, he lightly kicked the floor and jetted one-kilometer northwest, pursuing Situ Nantian.\nInstantly, Leo caught up! He was five meters away from Situ Nantian!\nThe grand elder was shocked to see Leo there. He gritted his teeth and vanished once more.\nLeo narrowed his eyes and scanned around him. Then, he found Situ Nantian North, 10 kilometers away.\nAlthough Leo couldn't fly freely like cultivators, it didn't mean that he couldn't change his flight trajectory in midair. He gathered strength in his quads, shins, and lower abdomen.\nAfter making a slight adjustment, he flipped his body and folded his legs. Then, he thrust them with his full force.\nBOOM\nLeo's legs suddenly generated extreme heat. His hazmat suit melted, and a layer of his leg skins fell off. However, the heat and the pressure from the legs propelled him north and changed the flight course.\nIn less than a second, Leo's skinless legs were healed. However, he was still a lot slower than Situ Nantian's teleportation speed.\nAfter flying five kilometers in a second, Leo succumbed to gravity and landed on the ground. While he fell, he marked Situ Nantian's location.\n50 kilometers away, northwest.I think you should take a look at\nLeo exhaled through his teeth. As soon as his legs touched the ground, he kicked with his full force once more.\nBOOM\nTwo seconds later, Leo traveled 50 kilometers northwest, reaching the location where Situ Nantian had been earlier. However, the thief changed his flight course and went north. Their distance was five kilometers away.\n\"…\"\nLeo's red pupils glowed brighter. He deeply inhaled and calmly checked his lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 198,107 Years…>\nRandom food during the past few days was worth the effort and investment. However, Leo had no need to collect them now as he needed to do something drastic. He operated his online shopping menu and browsed the weaponry section.\nLeo tested his theory. He picked the cheapest 9mm handgun, costing him 5,000 years of lifespan.\nWhile shuttling through the sky and flying away from Situ Nantian, a CZ model manifested into his hands. Leo lightly grab it as the modern gun was too fragile for his standard.\n\"System, can you upgrade my handgun?\"\nThat was Leo's theory. As he could upgrade modern refrigerators in the past, he wondered if he could do it with modern weapons too.\nDING\n<Upgrading CZ75 to level 2 will consume 5,000 years of lifespan. Will you upgrade it?>\n\"How many times can I upgrade it?\"\n<Equal to the level of the humble general store.>\nLeo nodded. He flipped his body, pointing his feet forward as he was about to crash land again. While descending at a frightening speed, Leo shouted.\n\"Upgrade to level 8!\"\nDING\n<Upgrading CZ75 to level 8 will consume 35,000 years of lifespan. Will you upgrade it?>\n\"YES!\"\n<This weapon requires upgraded ammunition. One magazine (20 rounds) of Level 8 CZ75 costs 40,000 years of lifespan. Are you sure you wish to upgrade this weapon?>\n\"Just do it! Buy me that mag, too!\"\nLeo's eyes were bloody. He spent 80,000 years of his lifespan without thinking.\nThe magazine appeared in Leo's hands. As Leo's muscle memory kicked in, he loaded the magazine like it was a natural thing in his life.\nBOOM\nLeo looked up and locked on to Situ Nantian's aura. Because of a few seconds of distraction, the thief was already 30 kilometers away.\n\"Tsk!\"\nLeo descended and landed. Once again, without touching the ground twice, his swelled quads and shins pushed his legs straight and kicked himself northeast, charging toward the zigzagging old man.\nWHOOSH\nA second later, Leo caught up again. Faster than a bullet, Leo flew past Situ Nantian.\nThe two men were instantly 50 meters apart.\nBoth men could move at a light speed, their perception and their reaction speed were also the same. From their perspective, the time of this world moved at a snail's speed.\nSitu Nantian bellowed and summoned his dao avatar. A flying fish appeared, and it fired a crescent water cutter at Leo. It directly hit him, but it only cut through his hazmat suit.\nAfter tanking the hit, Leo flipped his body while he flew ahead of Situ Nantian. He aimed his handgun at Situ Nantian's chest.\nSeeing the muzzle and sensing Leo's killing intent, he bellowed and took 90 degrees sharp turn.\nLeo's eyes and hands followed Situ Nantian's quick movement. He also pulled the trigger.\nThe sound and the trigger were a lot slower than Leo had expected. However, the recoil of the handgun surprised him.\nBANG\nLeo's strong grip slightly moved. He raised an eyebrow as the recoil force had the same power as the cockatrices.\n\"Tsk. What a waste of lifespan. This is trash.\"\nLeo complained as he watched the distance increase. Once again, he overshot his leap, and he flew further than he had calculated.\nPU\nMeanwhile, the upgraded bullet didn't do anything fancy, except the speed. Unlike regular bullets, the level 8 shell traveled faster than light. It pierced through the back of Situ Nantian.\n\"!!!\"\nSitu Nantian felt the hot metal, piercing through the back and exiting his right chest. Because of the powerful force, his lung and several arteries ruptured. Six of his ribcages fractured, and his stomach churned.\n\"T-This power!\"\nIt felt the same as a full-force strike of a fellow quasi-immortal.\nThe grand elder's speed drastically dropped because of the pain and shock. As he got a severe injury, he looked at the ground, searching for a place to hide.\nAs Situ Nantian looked around, he noticed that he was directly above the pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid, the nasty sweet dream mushrooms occupied the forest.\n\"S-Sweet dream mushrooms?! Why is it here?!\"\nSitu Nantian was at a loss. As he couldn't hide in the forest of zombie mushrooms, he could only go forward. He started to regret provoking Leo.\nWhile Situ Nantian looked around, Leo already landed and jetted toward him again. This time, his aura was filled with killing intent.\nBut as Situ Nantian was desperate, he noticed that one of his clan's portals was directly above the pyramid. He rejoiced.\n\"Hahaha! Heaven doesn't abandon me! Too bad, Immortal Florida Man! This is my win!\"\nSitu Nantian mustered the last bit of his strength, retreating to the portal as fast as possible.\nHowever, Leo, who flew back toward the pyramid, had no intention of letting Situ Nantian run away with his quest item. He carefully aimed his gun, targeting the hand with the most rings.\nBANG\nAnother shot was fired. It intercepted Situ Nantian's flight path.\n\"!!!\"\nSitu Nantian noticed it too late. The bullet directly hit his left hand, shattering it. The left hand's five fingers and the rings on them scattered everywhere. Among them, the ring that stored the dragon fruit plant was there.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nSitu Nantian turned around, hoping to collect his rings and his fingers to reattach them. However, Leo flipped his body again and pointed the muzzle at Situ Nantian's head.\nFearing death, Situ Nantian grudgingly retreated. He jumped into the portal, leaving his rings behind.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 99 – Florida Man on Shrooms Lights Himself on Fire, Damage the Pyramid, and Steal Pharaoh's Golden Chocolate\nSeeing how the thief escape through his grasp, Leo was frustrated. While shooting through the sky, he looked at the handgun.\nIt failed him. 80,000 years of lifespan investment wasn't worth it. His punch and kick were a lot stronger than this peashooter.\n\"I wasted my money. Hah…\"\nLeo sighed and landed 10 kilometers away from the pyramid. He turned around and softly kicked the ground, leaving a 100-meter-diameter crater behind – He leaped toward the pyramid, where Situ Nantian's fingers and ring fell.\nAfter landing at the foot of the pyramid, the first thing he noticed was the pink mushroom forest.\nLeo recognized it well. They were sweet dream mushrooms!\nAs soon as Leo stepped on one of them, a thousand mushrooms erupted, spreading their spores toward him. He covered his mouth and nose. Then, he put the gun away.\n\"Dammit. Not again.\"\nLeo quietly purchased a can of spray paint and a lighter. Then, he started razing the terrorizing mushrooms.\nThe mushrooms caught fire. The small ones stopped spilling spores and withered. However, the large mushrooms began to show some resistance by splitting themselves into smaller pieces, flying away from the fire.\nAt a glance, the mushrooms died at a rapid rate. In reality, the detached pieces of mushrooms devoured the Qi in the environment and regrew back to the previous form – They self-healed and multiplied.\nNoticing that the resiliency of the mushrooms, Leo purchased a canteen of gasoline and poured the content on himself. Then, he lit himself on fire.\nAfter turning himself into Ifrit, the spores that had been attached to his skin rapidly died. The pink mist around him also failed to get close to Leo.\nSeeing that the trick worked, Leo calmly purchased a package of cigars from the system. Opening the package, Leo picked up one of the cigars and threw the package away before it caught fire. He cut the head of the cigar and lit it on fire. Then, he puffed a smoke.\n*COUGH*\nLeo coughed and spat. It had been too long since he last smoked, and his lungs rejected it. Still, it was enough to quell his pending anger and frustration.\n\"Dammit. I remember that geezer's face. He won't survive next time.\"\nAfter complaining while keeping the cigar in his mouth, Leo looked around, scanning the burning mushrooms and searching for Situ Nantian's fingers and rings.\nWIGGLE\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm It was not hard to locate all five of them. Several overgrown mushrooms shamelessly generated small thin branches, slithering toward the rings. As many mushrooms had the same goal, they concentrated their extensions on the rings, turning their branches into inter-connected balls.\nLeo walked toward one of the mushroom balls. He grabbed it while his hands were still aflame, burning the mushroom ball. He also rubbed the cigar's tip on it as he smoked enough.\nThe mushroom ball resisted the flame. It regenerated back the burnt part, not wanting to part with the spatial ring and the finger inside.\nLeo dug into the ball with his fingers. With a slight force, the mushroom ball was split in half, revealing the content inside.\nA middle finger and a spatial ring were in there. Leo pulled the ring out and left the finger alone.\nAfter leaving the finger alone, the mushrooms restored themselves, returning its shape into a ball and covering the finger, resuming eating it.\nLeo rubbed the newly acquired spatial ring on his burning skin, removing the remnant mushroom spores on it. Then, he put it on and continued working with the other four mushroom balls.\n.\nA few minutes later, Leo secured all five rings. However, he kept the gasoline fire burning. It couldn't hurt him or kill him anyway.\nAfter securing the rings, Leo planned to unload the content. However, the mushroom forest was not an ideal place. He looked around and searched for a better place.\nBut then, Leo gazed at the pyramid.\n\"Welp. Since I'm here, how about a little exploration? Nothing can go wrong if I open a few sarcophagi in there, right?\"\nLeo laughed and strolled around the pyramid, looking for an entrance.\n.\n.\nAn hour later, Leo finally found an entrance. He climbed the stone stairs as the cell gate was located at the middle section of the pyramid, where a small shrine was.\nLeo approached the shrine and found a sacrificial table, covered by sweet dream mushrooms and molds. He ignored it and walked toward the cell gate. With a pull, the cell gate broke, revealing a small hole to enter.\nAs Leo was not into a claustrophobic fetish, he decided to expand the passageway. He grabbed a large slab of light yellow stone on the ceiling and pulled it.\nRUMBLE\nThe stone came out like a Jenga game piece. Leo looked at the cube stone and weighed it with his feeling. Then, he tossed it toward the ground.\nBOOM\nThe 10-ton stone smashed the mushrooms below.\nLeo cracked his fingers and started doing the same with the other pieces. For the sake of safety, Leo climbed to the apex of the pyramid and removed the top piece. Then, he worked his way down.\n.\n.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nA few minutes later, Leo removed over 500 blocks of stones. However, he couldn't see any room or passageway yet.\nWhile Leo took his time, a certain horse followed his scent there. Taxi galloped in the sky. From under his feet, thunder cracked, and lightning bolts struck random trees and mushrooms on the ground.\nWhen Taxi found Leo, he neighed.\n\"SMASH <3\"\n\"Oh.\"\nLeo turned around and found Taxi. Upon noticing that the pony was standing in midair, Leo was jealous.\n\"Dammit, Taxi. I thought you were like me. I didn't know you could fly!\"\n\"Smash UwU\"I think you should take a look at\n\"What do you mean it's easy?! I can't even fly!\"\n\"Smash :P\"\n\"No, you suck! I'm faster than you even though I can't fly!\"\n\"…Smash? :D\"\n\"Huh? You're going to teach me?\"\n\"Smash XD\"\n\"Noice! But dude, aren't you stinky? You want me to give you food four times a day? That ain't funny.\"\n\"SMASH >:D\"\n\"You…\"\nLeo facepalmed.\nFrom the conversation, Taxi offered a costly deal – He wanted four meals of immortal grass for 100 years. In exchange, he would teach Leo how to fly like him.\nAs Taxi's technique didn't have a name, he simply called it \"Horse Steps\".\nAlthough Leo hesitated, he thought of Wu Buyi and the cultivators back home. He imagined their reactions when they learned that he couldn't fly. Also, Leo couldn't forget the aerial chase earlier.\n\"Fine. How many immortal grasses do you want per meal?\"\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"Dammit, 200? I can't feed you too many! Your buddies are invading my house right now, and they might have already taken over my farms. I can't guarantee that many. How about 50?\"\n\"Smash! D:\"\n\"70!\"\n\"SMASH!! D:<\"\n\"Ugh, fine. 100, deal!\"\n\"Smash! XD\"\nWhile settling a deal, Leo's hands never stopped moving. He removed pyramid jenga stones one after another.\nTaxi observed Leo's action. He tilted his head, wondering why Leo was lit on fire. Also, he looked down and noticed the pink mushroom forest.\nUpon noticing the sweet dream mushrooms, Taxi shrieked in fright. It started running in a circle as if it was walking up a circular staircase. A minute later, he was three kilometers above the ground.\nLeo looked up and frowned.\n\"You are overreacting. Those mushrooms can't reach us here.\"\n\"S-S-Smash…\"\nTaxi shook his head, refusing to come down.\nLeo sighed. He resumed working, removing the pyramid's blocks.\n.\nAfter removing the 2,000th piece, Leo finally found a hollowed area inside. When Leo found out that he could finally get inside, he laughed.\n\"Yup. This is the way. Just remove everything!\"\nLeo jumped into the only hole, which led him to a hollowed area inside the pyramid. He landed in the middle of a dark hall, supported by stone pillars.\nHis eyes changed from red to green, adapting to the darkness in the pyramid's chamber. As soon as his eyes adapted to the dark, he found a gold statue of a rabbit trent pharaoh, sitting on a gold throne.\nLeo grinned, \"Is this the real rabbit trent king? Is this why the quest doesn't end after I ate everything?\"\nBelieving that the pharaoh was the quest target, Leo leaped toward the statue and threw and straight punch at its face.\nBOOM\nThe gold statue exploded, scattering gold stones everywhere.\n\"…\"\nLeo wryly smiled. Judging from the impact feedback, he realized that he punched a gold statue, not a creature. Moreover, the statue was hollowed inside.\nHe looked into the hole in the statue's neck. Then, Leo found gold coins with the face of a rabbit. They all emitted gold radiation.\nSeeing the gold coins inside, Leo peeled the statue's skin.\nCLANK\nAfter pulling the neck and the shoulder parts out, it was as Leo had guessed. Inside the pharaoh statue was a stash of countless gold coins.\n\"Meh, trash.\"\nLeo picked one of the gold coins and took a bite. Unlike the cartoon meme, Leo's teeth snapped the gold coin in half. Then, he chewed it as if it was chocolate.\nIt tasted like 100% chocolate. The bitterness made Leo stick out his tongue and shut his eyes.\n\"Ew. Dammit. What kind of rotten gold is this?\"\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by five years.>\nLeo paused for a minute, staring at the system message window. He stiffly turned around and threw the other half into his mouth. Then, his attitude turned 180 degrees.\n\"This is the best food I ever have! Original chocolate FTW!!\"\nBecause of his good mood, Leo's brain efficiency rose. He got an idea.\nLeo looked up and shouted at Taxi, offering him a new deal.\n\"HEY, TAXI! IF YOU TEACH ME HOW TO USE QI AND MY SPATIAL RINGS, I'LL ADD 100 BLADES OF IMMORTAL GRASS TO THE TOP OF THE PREVIOUS DEAL! HOW ABOUT IT?!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 100 – Florida Man Cleans His Internal Organ Using High-Pressure Water, Suffers Brain Damage\nTaxi faintly heard Leo's shout. Although he was interested in an easy job, he was reluctant to get close to the nasty sweet dream mushroom forest.\n\"Smash D:\"\nLeo didn't hear the pony's voice, but he took it as a yes. He looked up and calculated his jump. Then, he parkoured out of the hallowed hall and jumped three kilometers.\nA second later, Leo appeared in front of Taxi. He grabbed the horn and swung his body on the horseback.\n\"Whew. I finally get the hang of it. Vertical jump is a lot easier than Spiderman jumps.\"\nHowever, Leo forgot about one fact. First, his clothes were all burnt, and he was naked. Secondly, his entire body was on fire.\nTaxi sensed something warm on his back. Although the gasoline fire was nothing to Taxi, he still got annoyed.\n\"Smash!\"\n\"Yeah, I know. I know. Sorry about the fire. I'll put that out.\"\nLeo patted his head, arms, and legs. As he put his mind to it, a layer of his slightly tanned skin came off, and a fresh skin layer was regenerated. Still, one part was on fire.\nHe looked down and found his dangling shlong in super saiyan mode. Seeing the burning chicken, Leo laughed and patted the fire. After it was doused, Leo left a slightly darkened \"olo\" mark on Taxi's back.\n\"Hoh, boy. I wish I could show my old friends on Earth. I wish I had a phone to take that picture. It would have been viral on the internet.\"\nLeo laughed as he thought of opening an OnlyFan account to post his videos and pics, such as his thing on fire, on a hot grill, under burning charcoal, and wild stuff. He wondered if those would sell.\n\"…Smash? >_>\"\nTaxi's voice woke Leo from his silly daydream. He sighed and stood up. Then, he purchased a new set of clothes so that he wouldn't get rammed by this perverted horse.\nAfter putting on his clothes, Leo asked Taxi again.\n\"Before you teach me how to fly, teach me how to use Qi and use the spatial rings in my hand first.\"\nTaxi scoffed, thinking that Leo was joking.\n\"…Smash?\"\n\"I ain't trolling you. I'm serious.\"\n\"Smash?\"\n\"Yes, I can't use Qi or essence whatsoever.\"\n\"SMASH?! D:<\"\nTaxi was confused. He was certain that Leo was at least an immortal or a deity. However, hearing that Leo couldn't use Qi or essence, his mind was blown.\nLeo's existence didn't make sense. If he could use Qi, then what was the aura around him and his absurd physical strength?\n\"Screw me? No, screw you! I really don't know how to use Qi! Just teach me. I'll give you more immortal grass!\"\n\"…\"\nTaxi solemnly looked into his eyes. Upon seeing that Leo was serious, he firmly nodded.\n\"Smash!\"\n\"Good. Very well, Sifu, what should I do first?\"\nTaxi snorted and explained in his language.\n\"Smash, smash-smash smash. Smash!\"\n\"Ah, yes. I know that cultivators meditate to gather invisible energy. But how?\"\n\"SMASH!\"\nLeo nodded twice, \"I see, I see. So… smash?\"\n\"SMASH!\"\n\"Smash, smash?\"\n\"SMASHHH >:D\"\n\"I see.\"\nTheir conversation also didn't make any sense, but they understood each other. Leo took a deep breath and sat cross-legged on Taxi's back. Then, he paced his breaths and closed his eyes.\nTaxi respected Leo. He remained quiet and stood still, allowing Leo to meditate and feel the body and the world around him with the sixth sense.\n.\n\"Hmm.\"\nFive minutes later, Leo opened his eyes. He tilted his head in confusion and looked at his fingertip.\nFrom Taxi's instruction, he simply needed to feel the energy flow inside his body, aka the mild electricity in his body first. Then, he could start manipulating them.\nThis method always increased one's metabolism and burned one's excess fat. However, it also exhausted the cultivator as it depleted the person's calories at a rapid rate.\nHowever, Leo's physique was different from ordinary humans and cultivators. He was a living embodiment of evolved cancer cells. Each singular cell in his body collected a vast amount of element essence that surpassed what a quasi-immortal could do.\nLeo raised his index finger up and commanded his cancer cells to send the smallest amount of their Qi to his fingertip.\nPIKII think you should take a look at\nAn electric spark came out from Leo's fingertip. However, unexpected things happened.\nVROOM\nA fiery flame shot out from Leo's fingertip. Then, water splashed came out. When the fire and water met, they evaporated each other, causing a thick white smoke. The index finger also hardened as a rock while his fingernail transformed into a metal plate, growing and extending one meter at once. Leaves and tree branches also grew from the metal fingernail and released poison gas from the leaves.\nLooking at the chaos, Leo deeply sighed. It was difficult to adjust the power output as his blood cells had a mind of their own. He felt like he was trying to order feral cats to give him a paw.\n\"I guess I have to COMMUNICATE with my damn cancer cells. Haiya. My life is so complicated. My blood cells don't really listen to me.\"\nLeo pulled the metal nail off his finger. Then, he tried again. This time, he ordered the blood cells not to release any element Qi or essence. Instead, he wanted them to use their unwanted Qi or impure Qi.\nThe decision was a mistake.\nRUMBLE\nLeo's aura turned black. He began sweating, releasing dark fluid from his orifices and pores.\n\"SMASH?!!\"\nTaxi was shocked. He shook his back and kicked Leo away from him. His hind legs smacked Leo's face and chest.\nLeo was unharmed. The panicking kick of a 9th-rank monster was harmless to him.\nWhile being covered in black fluid from his body, Leo sniffed his armpits. His face distorted in disgust as the smell was worse than wet rotten corpses.\n\"What the hell?\"\nHis cancer cells didn't stop releasing the black Qi and the impurity in his body. His overall muscle mass decreased by 10%, and he lost a lot of fluid in his body.\nBOOM\nLeo safely landed on the ground after a long fall. He grumbled and pointed his finger into his mouth.\n\"Cancer cells, create me some water. I'm thirsty as hell.\"\n*SPLASH*\nBecause of the excessive water essence and power, Leo ended up creating a high-pressure water jet. The strong force of water sent a bullet-like stream into his mouth.\nLeo pointed his finger away and coughed. Some of the water got into his lungs and got pushed back to his nostrils, burning his nasal passages.\nThe body instantly digested the water and washed his blood cells. Leo's muscles were slightly bloated, reverting back to his usual size. A few seconds later, they shrunk as the cancer cells continued to remove the impurity from his body.\nLeo gritted his teeth and ordered his finger to decrease the water pressure. He then pointed his fingertip at his mouth, drinking more water.\nAs if Leo was cleaning himself with a water pressure machine, small streams of dark water came out from a thousand of his arms, legs, torso, and even his ears.\nAfter circulating enough water, the dirty fluid got lighter, and his aura brightened.\nLeo stopped drinking water as overdrinking made him dizzy. He had a headache as too much water entered his brain. He rubbed his forehead and sat on the wet mud. Then, he looked at the mushroom forest around him.\nSIZZLE\nStrangely, the mushrooms around Leo turned black and died. When the black fluid of Leo entered the soil and touched the underground roots of the other mushrooms, they also withered and died.\nIn seconds, all mushrooms in a square kilometer turned black and stopped multiplying.\nLeo quietly looked at the carnage that he had caused. He scratched his head.\n\"Welp. I guess my damn sweat is too toxic for zombie mushrooms. But damn! My sweat smells!\"\nLeo sighed and removed the dirty wet clothes. Since it cost only 3 years of lifespan, Leo didn't mind discarding them. He purchased a clean towel to clean himself.\nAfter drying his body, Leo reattempted the cultivation method. He tried again.\n\"Use less force, my cells. No, only one cell should be using your force. No one else interferes or joins in! USE THE TINIEST AMOUNT IF YOU CAN!\"\nOne of Leo's cancer cells reacted while the others were busy absorbing fresh Qi from the environment around him that the mushrooms had released.\nThis time, Leo sensed a strand of invisible energy, running through the palm of his left hand to his index finger. The energy exited his finger through the nail and came out, but the string was still attached to the body.\nLeo moved his finger around. He felt like he had a parasite worm coming out from his fingertip, but he couldn't see it. However, he knew it was there.\n\"Is this Qi that those cultivators work so hard to get?\"\nLeo was amused. He opened his right hand, where he had kept five spatial rings of Situ Nantian. Then, he tried injecting the Qi string into one of the rings.\nAs soon as the Qi string entered the ring's jewel, Leo received feedback from the energy string. He vaguely sensed a maze, made from water. It shot water energy at his Qi string.\nWhen the Qi string was soaked in the water, it devoured them as it still had the characteristics of Leo's cancer cells. The thread got bigger, and it transferred some of the energy back to Leo's body.\nSensing the energy entering his body, Leo raised his eyebrows.\n\"Oh, is this how they cultivate? Do cultivators absorb Qi like this?\"\nObviously, cultivators never attempted this method. Taxi also never practiced this. Only Leo's cancer cells could do it.\nCLICK\nWhen the water Qi in the ring was emptied, it was unlocked. The Qi string Leo got inside the massive cubic room of the spatial ring, and Leo could vaguely sense countless objects in the cube.\n\"OOOOHHH!! THIS IS IT!\"\nFinally, Leo managed to access a spatial ring for the first time.\nOne small step for a cultivator, one giant leap for Florida Man!",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 101 – Florida Man Accused of Sending Children to Lithium Mine 20 Hours a Day\n\"Wow.\"\nEven though Leo couldn't visually see the content in the ring, he could vividly sense everything. His Qi string wiggled around to explore the space in the ring.\nAfter moving around for a while, Leo's Qi picked up an object. He ordered his Qi to pull it out.\nWHOOSH\nA red flying sword was ejected from the ring and fell to the ground.\nLeo was amused. He put all rings on his fingers and picked up the red sword. He tried to inject his Qi string into the weapon.\nHowever, the red sword sucked in Leo's Qi string and began draining his energy from his blood cells.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo felt like he was electrocuted. He couldn't let go of the sword. Fortunately, it took a second for the flying sword to fully charge.\nThe flying sword moved by itself. It lined itself horizontally and floated in front of Leo. The latter raised his eyebrows and smiled.\n\"Is this sword actually a flying surfboard? Nice!\"\nLeo hopped on the sword and stood on it. He moved his feet and adjusted his position for a moment as he wasn't used to standing on a wobbling flying sword.\nHaving fun, Leo experimented on it, ordering the blood cells in his feet to create a string of Qi. After injecting it with a new string of Qi, the sword became the extension of his legs. In addition, Leo learned of its functions.\n\"You can do that? Alright. Go!\"\nWHOOSH\nThe flying sword jetted forward as Leo had commanded. However, as it was Leo's first time driving, the sword plunged into a giant withered mushroom, ramming Leo's face into it.\n\"…\"\nLeo pulled himself off the dead sweet dream mushroom. He rolled his eyes and pulled the sword out. He took a mental note that he would practice riding it later. As for the sword, he carried it around along with his handgun.\nFor now, he had something else to do. He still remembered why he wanted to learn how to use Qi – It was to access the spatial rings and use them to store the gold coins in the pharaoh's statue.\nLeo jumped back to the pyramid and entered through the hole he created. Upon getting inside, Leo picked up a gold coin and shoved it into his ring.\nIt didn't automatically go in for some reason.\n\"Hmm. This is going to take a while.\"\nAlthough Leo was annoyed, he didn't hate learning new things. He sat there, using his Qi to wrap around the flying sword, his handgun, and the gold coin. Then, he tried to move them into the ring with his Qi instead.\nUnfortunately, it didn't work.\n\"What the hell? How about this?\"\nInstead of trying to shove an object into the ring, Leo injected his Qi into the ring, activating it.\nThis time, the technique worked. After the ring was activated, Leo felt the connection between his psyche and the ring. With a thought, the ring sucked the three objects inside its pocket space.\n\"Oh? It's that simple?\"\nLeo was surprised and proud of himself. Finally, he learned the trick that Gao Yan and others had been using. At long last, Leo learned how to use a spatial ring!\nTesting his new skill, Leo pointed his ring at the broken statue and the gold coins. He commanded the ring.\n\"Store everything!\"\nWHOOSH\nIn a flash, the huge statue and the gold coins inside the piggy bank container vanished into Leo's ring.\n\"Hot damn! Had I learned this before, storing those corpses and chickens would have been a lot easier! Man, I was stupid.\"\nHaving an inventory space or a pocket dimension to store items was convenient. After robbing the gold statue, Leo proceeded to the next room.\nThere, three sarcophagi were the only things in the room. Leo smirked as he finally found the tombs he could raid. Without hesitation, Leo kicked one of the covers open, revealing the inside.\nGreen fume and brown dust erupted from inside the coffin. Leo snorted and took a few steps back as the smell was as nasty as his impurity liquid. After the toxin gas dispersed, Leo checked the person in there.\nIn the sarcophagus was a mummified corpse of a weird creature. It had the face of a dog, but it had a human body. However, that was not Leo's goal.\nIn the coffin, trinkets, gold coins, a colorful cane, and a large marble stone buried the corpse. Leo giggled and ordered his ring to store everything, including the dead body. After all, he could give it to Cat as a souvenir.\nThinking of Cat, Leo felt bad for her. He wished that he could have increased the portal platform's level to 9 and brought her along. The trip would have been chaotic, crazy, and fun.\nCould have, should have, would have, didn't happen – Leo could only regret his decisions. He wondered what she was doing now.\n.\n.\n= Leo's Domain, Mystic Realm Platform =\nAfter the unicorns entered this realm, they didn't go anywhere. They huddled together around the portal, trying to go back inside. They looked at the four guardian statues in fear.\nThe wolf statue glared at the newcomers as usual. It didn't move other than giving them a menacing cold look and emanating a dark aura.\nThe slime-cat-octopus statue was a lot nicer. It gave the unicorns a friendly smile. However, its words contained multiple meanings.\nNom-Nom Munya?\nHearing the catopus' voice, the unicorns tried to go back to their world. However, the portal rejected them, pushing them back.\nAs nobody could go back, some of the unicorns also tried to flee from there by flying away. But as they took flight, the fisherman statue released an invisible fishing net, wrapping them and pulling them back to the platform.\nOne of the strongest male unicorns retaliated. It delivered a yellow lightning bolt at the fisherman statue.I think you should take a look at\nDING\nAn array of red walls appeared, blocking the attack and trapping everybody inside. Then, the devil statue slowly stood up and looked down at the crowd. He uttered.\n\"Stay there until your master comes back. Do not leave this domain or your head will roll.\"\nThe ponies trembled in fear as they sensed a terrifying aura of a high-ranking immortal from the black-winged devil statue. They responded.\n\"…S-Smash.\"\nThe devil nodded and sat on his throne, resuming his previous pose. The female statues around him also looked at the unicorns for a moment and giggled. Then, they went back to their original location.\nA strong gale came, but no wind managed to get through the red cube array. As a result, the dead mutated wasps, tree logs, and some leftover cockatrices remained there.\nWHOOSH\nThe catopus statue extended its tentacle and collected the wasps and chickens. He pulled them out of the array, then he threw everything to the land below. After dumping the corpses and food, he didn't forget to call his kin.\n\"Nom-Nom Munya!\"\nAlthough the voice was soft and quiet, the statue could hear the reply from a certain plant monster on the ground.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\n.\n.\nWhile everything happened, another issue brewed in the store domain. As Leo forgot to tell his mannequin workers when to stop digging a pond, they never stopped working.\nAt the southwest corner of Leo's territory, the mannequins created a massive mine pit, which extended toward the south of his territory. Fortunately, it was only three kilometers deep.\nThe soil, rocks, and materials that the mannequins had dug were piled in the junkyard of Leo's recycling center. Some of the dirt was thrown into the acid pit, turning them into spirit stones. As for rare minerals, the mannequins left them there.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nCorpses rained from the sky and fell into the pit. A few seconds later, Cat dashed from her granary home and jumped into the hole.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!!\"\nThe mannequins in the pit looked up. Upon noticing Cat's arrival, they nimbly climbed the wall and moved on to the shallower area, expanding the area.\nBOOM\nCat landed on the bottom of the pit. As soon as she noticed the dead insects, she was overjoyed. She put one in her mouth and tasted it.\nKRUK-KRUK\nAfter chewing a giant wasp for a while, Cat's mouth curved up, and her expression brightened. The wasp was strangely nutritious and delicious for her.\nWanting more, Cat picked up a new corpse and ate it.\nLeo would scold her later for stealing his snacks. However, that was a story for another time.\n.\n.\nAfter looting the first sarcophagus, Leo did the same to the other two. Fortunately, no mummy or zombie was awakened during the process.\nChecking his loot, Leo pulled out a clear orb that never stopped emitting strange energy. For an unknown reason, Leo was attracted to it.\n\"What are you? Why am I feeling nice when you're close to me?\"\nAs if Leo was high on catnip, Leo rubbed his face on the basketball-sized orb and licked it. The orb's surface was still coated with the poison gas from the mummy coffin, but Leo didn't care.\nAfter rubbing and clinging to the orb for a while, Leo couldn't stop his impulse. He opened his mouth and bite it.\nCHOMP\nHis teeth cut the orb's hard and smooth surface. He chewed on it and discovered that it tasted like pineapple pizza with extra cheese. Addicted to the taste, Leo devoured it in a minute.\nWhen Leo was done, he came back to his sense. He also forgot what he had been doing.\n\"What was I doing earlier?\" Leo scratched his head and looked at his hands. Then, he looked around.\nWhile Leo was confused, the system's notification sound woke him from a trance. It also informed him of a strange development.\nDING\n<Congratulations. You have completed the secondary objective!>\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo widened his eyes and paused to think. He didn't understand what he had just done. Thus, he rechecked the mystic realm missions again.\n.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 – Kill Rabbit Trent King. (CLEARED)\n2 – Absorb Gnosis of Rabbit Trent King.\nSecondary Objective:\n1 – Locate Entity Fate Crystal in Sweet Dream Mushroom Forest (CLEARED)\n2 – Absorb Entity Fate Crystal. (CLEARED)",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 102 – Florida Man Traveling to China to Join Shaolin Temple Discovers Rare Pokemon\n\"Since when have I cleared the secondary objective?\"\nLeo thought of the orb that he ate earlier. He wondered if it was really the entity fate crystal that the system mentioned. If so, he was curious about what it could do.\nSo far, Leo didn't feel the changes. He was still him, and the cancer cells remained the same, except they seemed cleaner.\n\"System, what is entity fate crystal? What can it do?\" Leo asked the system as he was curious.\nUnfortunately, the system reverted back to silent mode. He got no answer or response.\nLeo clicked his tongue. He grumbled and kicked the wall, which was fully carved with ancient texts and images. The wall broke, and a portion of the pyramid blocks fell from the structure outside the building.\nBecause of the new window, the wind blew into the room and removed the stagnate air inside. Leo welcomed the fresh oxygen, and his mood got better.\nAs Leo's mood improved, his brain functioned better. He remembered that he hadn't found the gnosis thingy or recovered the 10th-rank monster core yet.\nPutting his thought to work, Leo created four strings of Qi and injected them into the four remaining spatial rings of Situ Nantian.\nCLICK\nCLICK\nEvery array in the rings was removed as Leo's Qi drained all their energy. He could finally access all the rings. Without hesitation, Leo searched for the item that Situ Nantian had stolen.\nIt was inside a plain iron ring with weird carved texts on it. Moreover, the space inside was as tiny as four cubic meters. Fortunately, it stored the entire dragon fruit plant there.\nThe plant was also alive. When Leo sent his Qi in, it tried to pull his Qi string and devour it.\nLeo was amused. He ejected the entire dragon fruit plant.\nWHOOSH\nThe plant manifested from the ring and fell to the floor. Its branches and roots wiggled, trying to get back up.\nLeo seized its roots and stomped its stem. Using his fingernail, he sliced the plant vertically, looking for the 10th-rank monster core that it ate.\nIt wasn't difficult to find it as the tentacle eyeball earlier was still hiding in the plant's stem. When Leo cut the plant open, it was right before his eyes.\nLeo sneered at the eyeball. He grabbed it and picked it up.\n*WIGGLE*\nThe eyeball tried to flee, but it couldn't get out of Leo's hand. Moreover, it sensed a dreadful aura and cancerous cells, which tried to enter its eye.\nThe eyeball monster wept. Without saying anything, it pleaded, begging for its life.\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply frowned. Although he could be ruthless against thieves and aggressive animals, he was weak when he dealt with cute animals or monsters.\nHe deeply sighed. Since the eyeball cried and begged for its life, it deserved a second chance.\n\"You know what? You can have that. But I have a condition.\"\nThe eyeball tentacle monster widened its eye. Then, it nodded, eager to fulfill the condition.\n\"I need to absorb the gnosis of rabbit trent king, but I don't know what it is or what it looks like. If you can bring me that stupid gnosis, I'll let you have that monster core, and I'll set you free.\"\nThe eyeball paused for a long while. It then turned around and looked at the plant, hesitated. The monster closed its eye and shed a tear. After making its decision, it turned around to face Leo.\nThe monster pointed its tentacle at the dragon fruit plant.\nLeo raised his eyebrows in confusion for a moment before his brain registered the hint. He was astonished.\n\"So, the plant is the gnosis?\"\nThe eyeball nodded. Still, it looked sad as the plant had been its home for centuries. It didn't want to part from it. Moreover, it was born from one of the dragon fruits. Therefore, the plant was akin to its mother.\nLooking at the eyeball, Leo felt bad. He wondered if he could absorb the gnosis without eating the plant.\n\"Gnosis is the plant? But gnosis means the teaching of a god or knowledge… knowledge?\"\nLeo's eyes gleamed. If gnosis was knowledge, the gnosis of rabbit trent king could be the king's knowledge. However, as it was related to the dragon fruit plant, it might refer to something else.\n\"Is gnosis… a dao? A dao that connects to this plant?\"\nThe monster suddenly widened its eye. It repeatedly nodded and jumped around.\nLeo continued contemplating, \"So, if the gnosis is a dao and I have to absorb the gnosis, all I have to do is to learn that freaking dao, then the quest is completed?\"\nHe gave the eyeball a meaningful look. He slowly nodded.\n\"Alright. Let's give this crap a try. Let's try not to harm that plant for now. I need to learn what it can do and what I can learn from it.\"\nSCREECH!\nThe eyeball was overjoyed. It lapped around Leo and hopped on his shoulder, unafraid of his intruding cancer cells.\nAs soon as the eyeball monster touched Leo's skin, the radiation and cancer cells latched onto its body. However, all cells and radiation disappeared into its fluid, becoming its food.\nNobody noticed – the eyeball monster's tentacle got slightly longer when it digested Leo's dead cancer cells and radiation.I think you should take a look at\nMeanwhile, Leo deeply sighed and facepalmed, \"Why am I getting soft whenever I see crying monsters or animals. Oh, wait. Those chickens cried too, but I still killed them. Oh, right. They're food. That doesn't count.\"\nSometimes, Leo laughed at his illogical self for having a double standard. This was one of those times.\nAgain, whenever Leo was in a good mood, his brain's efficiency rose. He raised the plant up and brought out spirit stones that he found from Situ Nantian's rings. He got an idea of how to connect to the plant.\nThe white plant's wound was already healed. Moreover, it didn't mutate after Leo had touched it.\nImpressed by the plant, Leo put the spirit stones in his hands. A few seconds later, they transformed into essence stones. He put them next to the dragon fruit plant's roots.\nThe roots crept toward the essence stones as Leo had predicted. The roots coiled around the stones and digested their energy and essence.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nAs the plant digested the element energy from the stones, it produced new fruits. It only took the fruits one minute to fall from the plant as they already ripened.\nLeo picked up the dragon fruit and looked at it. When he touched it, the white fruit darkened, unlike the plant.\n\"Hmm. This is difficult. What can I learn from this tree and its fruits? What is the dao or gnosis that I need to learn?\"\nThe eyeball monster looked back and forth between the plant and Leo for a moment. It suddenly got an idea and jumped down from Leo's shoulder. Then, it ran toward the plant and merged into it.\nA few seconds later, the eyeball appeared on the plant's stem. Its tentacle also emerged from the plant's skin, transforming into small vines. They pointed at one of the white fruits and gestured for Leo to plant the dragon fruit tree and the fruits.\nLeo deeply frowned. He understood its gesture, but he wondered why he needed to plant them. Still, for the sake of uncovering this mystery, Leo accepted the monster's suggestion.\nAfter putting a new pair of rubber gloves on, Leo stored the newly created fruits in the plain iron ring's storage space. He then carried the plant and jumped out of the pyramid.\nWhen Leo looked down, he saw nothing but mutated soil and dead mushrooms. His expression was dark.\n\"I guess I shouldn't plant you here. This place is too dirty for you, right?\"\nThe eyeball nodded. It then pointed at the west.\n\"You want me to bring you there?\"\nThe monster moved its eye up and down, answering the question.\n\"I take that as a yes. Alright.\"\nLeo looked up and noticed that Taxi was still waiting for him. He took aim, wiggling his butt as if he was a cat, preparing to attack somebody's foot.\nWHOOSH\nLeo vertically jumped while carrying the dragon fruit plant. Accurately, he reached the pervert unicorn and landed on his back.\n\"Alright, Taxi. Next station, the west! Let's go!\"\nTaxi looked back at Leo and noticed that he carried the plant with his favorite fruits. The horse widely smiled and showed the eyeball monster his ugly teeth.\nThe eyeball shivered in fear. It closed its eyes and wept again.\nSeeing the trembling plant, Leo lightly patted Taxi's head. However, his \"Light\" pat was a hard slap from Taxi's perspective.\nAfter getting a hard slap to the back of his head, Taxi protested.\n\"SMASH?! D:\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"You're an elder. Don't bully a kid.\"\n\"Smash?! Smash!\"\n\"Huh? You're only a thousand years old but this eyeball guy is over 3,000? That's the more reason you shouldn't be disrespectful to an elder! You damn donkey!\"\n\"Smash… T-T\"\nNo matter how old the eyeball monster was, Taxi got scolded anyway. The unicorn whined while it jetted toward the west at his full speed.\n10 minutes later, they flew past the campsite of Wu Buyi and Gao Yan. Not long after, they reached the tall mountain area of the west zone, where only absurdly slim and tall mountains existed.\nTaxi panted and landed on one of the mountain tops. Strangely, on top of every mountain, a small tea pavilion and a small courtyard occupied the flat peak. It seemed that cultivators deliberately built these buildings here for some reason.\nLeo got down from the horseback and looked around. Upon seeing that many plants already existed in the mountaintop courtyard, Leo decided that he would grow the dragon fruit plant here.\n\"How about here, eyeball? Is this place good?\"\nThe eyeball repeatedly looked up and down. It also came out of the plant and ran around the courtyard.\nNext to the courtyard, there was a small pond, full of transparent liquid. The eyeball monster immediately jumped into it.\nDONG\nUnfortunately, the water surface was frozen. The eyeball tentacle failed to soak itself in the water.\nLeo hadn't noticed the quality of the strange pond yet. He quietly dug into the rocky soil on the mountain and put the plant's roots in there. After he covered the roots, he stood up and looked around.\n\"I guess I should use this place to study. Should I say… cultivating instead of studying?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 103 – Florida Man Proclaims Himself as Messiah and Found New Religion to Become True Atheist\nWhile Leo enjoyed himself, many cultivators retreated to their world as they deemed that this place was too dangerous for them.\nYan Xiang swallowed his shame and returned home first. As for his subordinates, he left the decision to them if they wanted to risk their lives and stayed there. Some of them stayed behind to collect plants and rare herbs, but the majority of them followed the emperor.\nMeanwhile, Situ Nantian was in bad shape. He had a hole inside him, and he needed to recuperate. Upon returning home, Situ Nantian used the clan's treasures and rare pills to save his life. Then, he cooped in his manor, recuperating.\nSitu Nantian was angry. He was on the verge of bringing the legendary gnosis home. Had he gotten his hand on it, he could have consumed it. Then, he would have had a chance to ascend and become an immortal.\nThe dream was no longer possible. He lost his hand, and his internal organs were in a mess. It would take a few months to heal and a few years to recover his lost organs\nStill, Situ Nantian wouldn't let Leo scotch free after what he had done - The old man secretly contacted his ancestor, who had already ascended.\n.\n.\n= Death Sword Sect =\nThe yellow energy portal of the Death Sword Sect was kept in the underground dungeon. The room that housed the portal was concealed by three layers of protective arrays, preventing outsiders from entering this place accidentally.\nThe dungeon was made of mud bricks, painted with ox blood. The damp environment and stale air made the returnees uncomfortable, but they endured it.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nAt the mystic realm portal of the Death Sword Sect, a few disciples returned with rare materials in their hands. Some of the elders also returned, but their faces were pale.\nThis group of elders and disciples went to a different mystic realm. They didn't find the pyramid, pagoda town, or the Amazon jungle. Instead, they went to a desert.\nOne of the elders staggered a few steps and collapsed on the ground. However, his smile never disappeared from his face. In his spatial rings, he scored a bunch of golden sand bananas. In that package, there were about 40 bananas, which could be used for alchemy ingredients or grain pills.\nThe golden sand bananas contained the thick earth element Qi. He was excited that he could ask an alchemist to turn them into cultivation pills. Then, once he consumed them, he would gain earth element!\nOuyang Feng, who failed to join this expedition, looked at the returnees in envy. He hadn't recovered from the previous incident yet, and he couldn't even walk. At the moment, he still relied on a wheelchair to go around.\nBehind Ouyang Feng, a deacon of the death sword sect looked at the poor disciple and sighed. He felt bad for the guy.\nNews spread that Cheng Yuanzhi committed suicide out of shame after he saw Ouyang Feng's condition. However, everybody knew that Ouyang Zi killed him, but they didn't utter a word. They held their grudge and retaliated against the Ouyang Clan by ignoring Ouyang Feng.\nThe deacon and many disciples glanced at Ouyang Feng with cold eyes, but no one talked to him.\nOuyang Feng also realized his position. He grudgingly asked the deacon to bring him away from this place.\nThe deacon guided the wheelchair of Ouyang Feng to the surface. He had shown the disciple enough.\nHowever, as Ouyang Feng and the deacon were about to leave, one of the returnees called for them. The person was none other than the sect master of the Death Sword Sect, Hua Guanhai. Coincidentally, Hua Guanhai was a distant cousin of Hua Jiashan.\n\"Stay, Ouyang Feng. I have something to ask you.\"\nHua Guanhai was a burly 7-foot-tall man with a square face. He wore a black bandana, covering his black long hair. His full black beard was messy and curly that he looked like a barbarian. The two sword scars on his face were left behind by Hua Jiashan, but his cultivation base was at the quasi-immortal stage.\nAlthough Hua Guanhai was tired from the quick expedition, he came to see the troublesome disciple.\nOuyang Feng bit his lower lips and prepared himself for the punishment that his clan had done. He brought his wheelchair around and lowered his head.\n\"This junior greets sect master Hua. What can I do for you, senior?\"\nHua Guanhai coldly stared at Ouyang Feng. He glanced at the latter's legs and stomach, checking his vitality with his eyes.\nThe brown pupils of Hua Guanhai turned white. They shone as they saw through Ouyang Feng's constitution and hidden injuries. Instantly, he noticed why Ouyang Feng couldn't walk on his own.\n\"You've been afflicted by a strong element essence attack, I see. I sense strong poison essence in your head that disrupts your ability to balance yourself.\"\nOuyang Feng was surprised. Nobody, even his grandfather, managed to identify the cause of his injury. He looked at the sect master and asked him.\n\"Do you know something about it, sect master, sir?\"\nHua Guanhai smirked, \"I know this kind of attack very well. Those bastards from the Tang Clan are masters of poison. I heard they are researching wind elements so that they can improve their combat abilities. Well, it's not like you need to know\"\n\"T-Then, can you cure me?\"\n\"Not possible. I'm not a poison expert.\"\n\"…Oh.\"\nAgain, Hua Guanhai grinned as he found it fun to tease the nasty descendant of the obnoxious Ouyang Clan. He snorted and turned around.\n\"You can leave. I'm busy.\"\n\"…\"\nOuyang Feng was dejected. The deacon behind him sneered at the youth and guided the wheelchair around. He then brought Ouyang Feng back to the surface.\nAfter Ouyang Feng had left, Hua Guanhai looked at the returnees and the portal. He gave them a new command.\n\"The desert mystic realm is too dangerous for us to stay there for too long. We will close the portal today and end this season's expedition. I will not allow anyone to go back in there anymore!\"\nThe elders and disciples that didn't get their chance to go were disappointed. As they couldn't go, they only welcomed the lucky disciples and elders. Then, they left in peace.\nAfter everybody was gone, Hua Guanhai snickered. He played with the portal's array, which turned the energy portal's color from yellow to pink.I think you should take a look at\nWHOOM\nThe destination of the portal changed from the desert to a dense pink mushroom forest. Hua Guanhai looked into the portal and noticed that they were rich in wood Qi and earth Qi. However, the presence of the sweet dream mushrooms deterred him.\n\"Damn mushrooms. This takes me back. But meh, I wish I can find one of those blood realms. We need that legendary blood element from the demon clan.\"\nHua Guanhai sighed and changed the color of the portal again. This time, it turned red.\nHe didn't notice the changes in the forest mystic and the tiniest spore of a certain mushroom. A spore managed to slip through the portal and latched onto Hua Guanhai's boot.\n.\n.\n= West Mountain, Forest Mystic Realm =\nLeo entered the tea pavilion building after he had left the dragon fruit plant alone to grow. He inspected the interior, checking if there was something he could bring home.\nSure enough, there were plenty of glossy clay pots in the building. The cabinets and the shelves of this place had most of the cooking tools, but they seemed outdated.\nLeo picked one of the teapots, made from clay. The shape was a bit crooked, and the pot was not symmetrical. No matter how Leo looked at it, this teapot was made by a beginner craftsman.\nHe put the teapot away and took his eyes off the ancient arts. He sat at the wooden table to rest.\nWhile resting, Leo contemplated his thoughts and his goal, trying to figure out what the dao, the knowledge, or the gnosis of rabbit trent king was.\n\"Dao is knowledge. Gnosis is also some form of knowledge. But why is it related to that plant? Dragon fruit knowledge? How to grow dragon fruits? That shouldn't be it.\"\nLeo smacked his lips and returned to the plant. As it would be better to learn the plant from the source, he stopped touring the mountaintop.\nAfter sitting in front of the plant, Leo noticed that the eyeball already digested the 10th-rank monster core. It grew slightly bigger, but nothing else seemed different.\nLooking at the eyeball, Leo laughed at it.\n\"So? Why did you eat the monster core? What do you need it for? Growing bigger?\"\nThe eyeball looked left and right, disagreeing with Leo. It came out of the plant and hopped on the newly grown dragon fruit. It picked the fruit with its tentacle and handed it to Leo.\n\"Oh? For me? But you didn't answer my question.\"\nThe eyeball pointed at the fruit and Leo's skin, gesturing for him to mutate it.\nAs Leo had nothing else to do, he followed the eyeball's instruction. The white fruit instantly turned dark.\nThe eyeball seemed overjoyed. He then pointed at the ground, wanting Leo to plant it.\n\"Plant the mutated fruit?\"\nThe eyeball nodded. As it was overexcited, it used its small tentacles to dig the soil.\nLeo laughed at it and helped the eyeball dig the ground. After he created a small hole for the fruit, he dropped it into the pit and covered it.\n\"Is that it?\" Asked Leo.\nThe eyeball looked left and right, doing its version of shaking heads. It then pointed at the white plant and pointed at the buried fruit.\nLeo frowned as he didn't understand the eyeball's intention, \"What are you doing?\"\nThe eyeball was frustrated. It kept pointing at the white plant and the buried fruit.\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo tried to connect the dots, but he still couldn't get the whole picture. He closed his eyes and fall into a deep thought.\nBut as Leo kept thinking, a black sprout already emerged from the ground, where Leo had buried the black dragon fruit.\nSCREECH\nThe eyeball jumped on Leo's face and poked him, telling Leo to stop daydreaming. It pointed at the black plant.\nLeo opened his eyes and looked at it. Again, he squinted his eyebrows.\n\"Yeah, it's growing as we speak. So?\"\nThe eyeball was angry that Leo was ignorant and stupid. It poked Leo's eyes with its tiny tentacles, but it did nothing to him. Instead, more cancer cells latched onto the creature and became its food.\nSeeing how worked up the eyeball was, Leo threw away his useless thoughts and observed the plant. He had a feeling that he knew this process, but it got stuck at the back of his head.\n\"Mutation? Dao of Mutation? Gnosis of the rabbit trent king? Wait a minute…\"\nLeo suddenly had an epiphany. He looked at his hands, then he looked at the growing mutated plant.\n\"Dao of Mutation and Evolution, is that the case here?\"\nThe eyeball repeatedly nodded. It kept pointing at the white dragon fruit, trying to tell Leo that Rabbit Trent King had been experimenting on it, turning the regular plant into this white plant.\nIn short, the knowledge or the gnosis that Leo had been looking for was so close to him. It was a part of his ability.\nHowever, turning this knowledge into gnosis or a dao was a different story. Leo had a lot of work to do.",

However, he knew nothing about Qi circulation and breathing.\nAfter 10 minutes of sitting idly, Leo gave up. He stared at the growing black sprout next to the dragon fruit plant.\n\"You know what? Screw this. I'm gonna spit on it and accelerate its growth. Once it's big enough, I'm gonna eat it.\"\nLeo picked up another ripened dragon fruit and waited for it to fully mutated. When the fruit turned black, he dug another hole and plant the fruit. After he covered the hole, he spat on it.\nAlthough Leo had the urge to urinate on the mutated plant, he remembered that he planned to eat it. Thus, it would have been a stupid idea.\nThe saliva fertilizer worked wonders. The first sprout rapidly grew while the second one shot out from the ground. However, both plants were different.\nThe first mutated plant was identical to the white plant except for its color. On the other hand, the second one transformed into a roper tree as all its branches and leaves became long black tentacles.\nLeo's expression turned dark when he saw the second black plant. Before it could grow further, Leo uprooted it and snapped it in half. He cut the tentacles and started eating them even though the shapes and the tips resembled the THING.\nThe appearance was indeed disgusting and repulsive. Fortunately, it tasted like wasabi and nuts.\nThe wasabi smell kicked Leo's nose. He paused several times as he got high from the herb.\n\"WOOO!!\"\nIt was addictive. Leo wished that he had some sashimi to go along with the dildo-looking wasabi plant. However, he was sad that he didn't let it mature and multiply.\nLeo looked at the roots of the broken roper. He replanted it and spat on it twice, begging it for forgiveness. Unfortunately, the plant was already dead.\n\"Hah. Life is hard. Anyway, I need to try again.\"\nLeo picked another ripened fruit from the white tree and mutated it. As usual, he buried the fruit in the ground.\nLuck was not on Leo's side. The new one came out looking like the first mutated plant.\nLeo's face turned ugly. He felt like he gambled in a gacha game, rolling for a five-star character. Then, he got a 3-star or a 4-star character instead.\n\"Again!\"\nGambling could be addictive. Leo rerolled his life gacha game, growing another plant.\nThe fourth sprout rapidly grew. But this time, it mutated into a black bamboo tree.\nLeo dropped his jaw and watched how the black bamboo tree shot to the sky. It rose up 20 meters before it began growing branches and leaves.\nPLOP\nBamboo shoots quickly emerged around the black bamboo tree. In a few seconds, they grew into new black bamboo trees. When they matured, new bamboo shoots came out.\nThe loop went on for 12 circles before the bamboo trees devoured all nutrients from the soil and Leo's spit. When the growing spree ended, over 500 bamboo trees occupied half of the mountaintop.\nLeo smirked and injected his Qi into one of the spatial rings. Then, he pointed the ring at the bamboo.\nWHOOSH\nAll of them entered the ring's pocket space, including a portion of the soil of the mountain.\n\"Hehehe. This is fun. Again!\"\nLeo grabbed another ripened fruit from the white tree to roll another gacha. While burying another fruit, he sang Eduard Khil's Trololo Song.\nThe eyeball and Taxi gave Leo a weird look at first. But after listening to the troll song, they got infected. As the song was not complicated, Taxi quickly learned it.\n\"YEY-YEY-YEY-YEY-YEY YEY-YEY-YEY YEY-YEY-YEY! HOHOHOHOHO!\"\nTaxi stopped smashing and sang along. Leo also played with it, singing the entire song from the beginning. The eyeball bobbed its body up and down while the white plant waved left and right. The mutated black plants also started moving.\nBy the time Leo realized it, he turned into a Disney princess, singing with his wild friends.\nThe black plants soon matured. They began producing black dragon fruits. However, as if they learned what Leo had been trying to do, the ripened fruits fell from the trees and dove into the soil. They moved deeper into the mountain and traveled away from their mothers.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nBlack fruits absorbed the remnant of Leo's radiation and spit. They soon grew on the cliffs of the mountain and remained there.\nLeo didn't notice that the black dragon plants multiplied. He was busy singing and relaxing. As Taxi and the plants enjoyed his little concert, Leo kept looping the song over and over again as if he wanted to sing the 10-hour version of the song.\nCLINK\nCLINK\nAs Leo kept singing, his rainbow aura produced white glittering light. They spread everywhere on the mountain and sank into local trees. As soon as they touched the particles, the trees mutated.\nThis time, they didn't turn black. All of them were white, the same color as the white dragon fruit plant. As more of them turned white, the mutated trees returned the favor by producing countless strings of white Qi, sending them back to Leo.\nLeo didn't notice the white strings of Qi. They gathered behind him and slowly condensed together. After 10 minutes, the threads evolved into essence droplets, and the water droplets slowly grew larger.\n.I think you should take a look at\nFour hours later, Leo stopped rolling the mutated plant gacha. He spat at the white plant and the eyeball, giving them some rewards.\n\"That's enough for the day. I'll try again later. Anyway, it's been fun, guys.\"\nTaxi was bored with the song. His throat was also parched, and it flew away to search for water. As for the eyeball and the plants around Leo, they looked disappointed as they had never listened to a song before – They still wanted more.\nSeeing how sad the eyeball was, Leo came up with an idea. He browsed the online shopping system and searched for a high-spec phone with a long-life battery.\nAI-PHONE 69 was the latest smartphone model from Leo's era when the nuclear war started. The ads boasted that the phone came with a 69-gigapixel camera, and a cutting-edge A69 Bionic processor, capable of clocking up to 5000 MHz.\nLooking at the handheld transparent phone brought Leo back. He remembered that he once used the phone to zoom the moon instead of using a proper telescope.\nFortunately, the price was affordable. It cost only 1,000 years of lifespan.\nLeo purchased it. When he got it, he set up the phone and used the internet. But the next moment, he slapped his forehead.\nThere was no internet in this world. What was the point of having a phone?\n\"I'm stupid. Welp. What a waste of money.\"\nLeo shook his head. He rubbed the smooth touchscreen, admiring the home screen.\nDING\n<Would you spend 1,000 years of lifespan to upgrade the AI-PHONE 69?>\n\"…\"\nLeo forgot about it. He could upgrade every item that he had purchased from the online store shop. However, the upgrade fee was usually expensive.\n\"If I upgrade it, can I even use the internet?\"\nThe system didn't answer the question. Once again, it left him in the dark.\n\"Welp. Screw it. Upgrade it to the max level possible!\"\nDING\nInstantly, the phone was upgraded to level 8.\nWHOOSH\nThe appearance didn't change in the slightest. However, the home screen drastically improved. The top right corner, which showed the status of the battery, revealed the infinite symbol on it. Secondly, it picked up a WiFi signal!\n\"What in the freaking Florida?! How is there a wifi signal here?\"\nThe phone soon updated all its apps and rebooted. When it was done, Leo checked the setting menu to see the phone's details.\nNo bloatware came along with the phone. There were only three apps; a weird internet browser with a ring icon, a camera app, and a mysterious app with a picture icon of a general store.\nCurious, Leo fiddled with the phone, trying to access the internet. He also checked where the wifi signal came from.\nIt wasn't hard to find where he got the signal from. The wifi router was registered as \"RING\".\nLeo immediately looked at the alien ring that merged with his finger. He frowned.\n\"It's you, isn't it?\"\nHe rubbed the ring and tried to inject his Qi string into it. However, the response was different from regular spatial rings – There was no pocket dimension inside.\nHowever, as Leo played with the ring, he sensed something odd. Instead of finding a pocket dimension, he sensed an embryo of a living being.\nWhile Leo was playing with the ring, the condensed essence of light finished condensing itself into a finger-sized water droplet. It then rushed into Leo's alien ring.\n\"Hmm?!\"\nThe corner of Leo's eyes caught something entering his alien ring. It went into his finger and the embryo.\nCLINK\nA wisp of something came out. The light wisp orbited around Leo. After lapping him thrice, it phased through nearby plants and the eyeball monster. When it was done, it dove into Leo's chest.\nLeo saw the streak of light disappearing into his chest. He frowned and closed his eyes, trying to find the weird thing in his body. Unfortunately, his cancer cells failed to find the weird light.\n\"What was that?!\"\nLeo scratched his head and looked around, but he didn't find anything.\n.\nBehind Leo, a floating male toddler manifested. He looked exactly like Leo was he was young.\nThe transparent toddler giggled and sat on top of Leo's head. However, the latter didn't sense his presence. On the other hand, the eyeball monster stared at him as if he was the only one who could see his appearance.\nThe toddler smiled and hushed the eyeball monster. The latter jumped and waved its tentacles, trying to get Leo's attention. The eyeball hinted and pointed at the top of Leo's head, telling Florida Man that something was there.\n\"What is wrong with you, little eye? Oh, right, not enough song, right? Give me a moment. I'll pick a 10-hour version and let it play for as long as you like.\"\nLeo failed to catch the hint. He browsed the internet and found the YouTube site. He opened the 10-hour version of trololol song and put the phone next to the white plant. Then, he walked to the teahouse pavilion to sleep.\nThe toddler stuck out its tongue at the eyeball. It turned around and followed Leo to the pavilion while it continued to gather light particles around him.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 105 – Florida Man Criticizes Missionary, Gets Struck by Lightning, and Gains Enlightenment\nAfter resting for the night, Leo returned to the courtyard and checked on the plants. When he saw the changes in this mountain, he was astonished.\nThe white dragon fruit plant should be called a \"tree\" instead. It grew 10 meters high, and it developed a thick trunk. Surrounding the white tree was 12 black dragon fruit trees. Thousands of mutated fruits hung on the branches, waiting for them to be ripened.\nSeeing so many fruits, Leo brightly smiled. He collected them in his spatial rings, planning to plant them in his shop domain.\nAfter collecting the black trees, Leo looked at the white tree. As he hadn't achieved his goal yet, Leo stared at the tree, wondering what he lacked to acquire the gnosis or dao.\nLeo sat down under the tree. He picked up a white dragon fruit and watched it mutate.\n\"Hah. What am I missing?\"\nHe didn't notice that the toddler spirit had been sitting on his head, giggling and laughing at Leo. The spirit looked at the mutated fruit and came up with an idea. It flew toward a nearby fruit and touched it.\nThe ripened dragon fruit instantly dissipated into dust, and its nutrition entered the spirit's body.\nThe toddler giggled again. As greedy as Leo, it went around and absorbed the life force of the fallen fruits around him. One after another, the fallen fruits around the white tree vanished.\nLeo didn't notice at first. But when half of the fruits around him were gone, he frowned and looked around.\n\"…\"\nLeo frowned and carefully looked around him. He had a hunch that something invisible was at work, and it stole the fruits around here. He then glanced at the eyeball, who latched onto the white tree as usual.\nThe eyeball once again pointed its tentacle at the spirit of a toddler.\nFinally, Leo caught the hint and followed where the tentacles pointed at.\nWHOOSH\nOne of the fruits withered and turned into dust right in front of Leo's eyes. He raised his eyebrows and walked toward the pile of dust. Curious and confused, he picked up the white dust and looked at the eyeball again.\nThe creature tracked the flying spirit and kept pointing, hoping that Leo could do something about it.\nLeo's eyes also followed after the pointer. Upon noticing that the invisible thing went for a pile of ripened fruits, Leo rushed there and gathered the white dragon fruits in his spatial rings, leaving only one fruit on the ground.\nThe toddler spirit was greedy. As it knew that Leo couldn't see it, the spirit went for the fruit next to Leo's feet. It reached out to touch it.\nSuddenly, Leo's hand thrust down. The hand went through the spirit's body, but the former failed to touch or grab it.\nThe spirit was surprised. It flew away in a hurry and hid behind the white tree.\nSCREECH!\nThe eyeball never missed its chance. It jumped down from the white tree and cladded itself in white light.\nPLOP\nThe octopus-like eyeball caught the toddler!\nLeo saw that. He praised the eyeball, \"Good job! Pin it down!\"\nRushing to the eyeball's side, Leo ordered his cancer cells to coat his hands and fingers with Qi strings. Then, he tried to touch the invisible spirit again.\nUnfortunately, Leo's hands and Qi threads were unable to touch the infant dao spirit. Instead, the Qi threads entered the spirit's body and were digested.\nSensing his Qi leaving him, Leo was annoyed. Still, as he had fought with mutated monsters that could steal his life force before, Leo had a trick up in his sleeves.\nInstead of pulling his hands out, Leo ordered his cancer cells to increase the power output. Instead of creating harmless Qi threads, Leo wanted them to exhibit their inner \"essence\" and feed the invisible thief some more.\n\"You want to rob my energy? Sure. Go ahead. Fill your stomach! Make sure you don't die from overeating!\"\nAs if a dam had opened a floodgate, thick energy gushed out from Leo's palm.\n\"!!!\"\nThe toddler spirit was taken aback when its master tried to overflow it with his element essence. It wiggled and tried to flee from the eyeball monster's grasp.\nThis needed to stop. If Leo kept pouring more element essence into the spirit, it would explode because of the overflowing energy. It was not sturdy enough to contain such domineering essence energy.\nUnfortunately, a newborn dao spirit couldn't be an opponent of an older 9th-rank monster. The creature's eye curved up, mocking the spirit that it had no chance. It continued to press the spirit to the ground.\nThe spirit was offended. Still, for the sake of survival, it dispersed its body particles and entered Leo's body.\nLeo immediately sensed a cold energy flow entering his palms, going up his arms, and entering his heart. He widened his eyes in shock.\n\"What?\"\nLeo sank his mind into his body, commanding his cancer cells to identify the weird energy flow inside him.\nThe cells swiftly complied with the order and contained the mysterious energy, driving it away from his heart. They pushed it to his solar plexus.\nThe flow of energy fought back. It manifested itself, transforming into a tiny ball. The ball then shone and repelled the cells from entering its body. Unfortunately, it underestimated Leo.\nLeo was ruthless. He shoved his index finger into his chest and dug the grain-sized ball out. He looked at it and narrowed his eyes as it was so little.\n\"What are you?\"\nThe wound in Leo's chest was healed while he looked at the orb. He wondered if it was the gnosis or dao that the quest mentioned.\nWHOOSH\nThe ball moved by itself and escaped from his fingers. Instantly, it transformed into a streak of light and entered the alien ring.\nLeo witnessed everything. He looked at the finger with the ring.\n\"You again. You never stop amusing me, ring. Very well, let me amuse you!\"\nUsing his full strength, Leo rubbed the alien ring while he ordered his cells to pour essence into it, trying to flush out the light ball earlier.\nHowever, this action awakened something else. Instead of destroying the ring or flushing out the content inside, it reinforced the ring and fed the spirit more energy. As the ring was enhanced, it faded into Leo's flesh, becoming one with him.\nThe alien ring was gone. He could no longer find it.\n\"Huh?!\"\nLeo was at a loss. He had no idea what he had done. He sat on his butt and scratched his head.\n\"Argh! Dammit! This is frustrating. What was that thing?!\"I think you should take a look at\nBecause of frustration, Leo got lazy. He lay on the rocky ground under the white tree and looked at the abundant dragon fruits.\nThe chilly wind above the ground and the thin air made Leo drowsy. A few seconds later, Leo fell asleep.\n.\nAfter Leo was asleep, the spirit came out from Leo's finger. However, its appearance looked a lot different. Instead of coming out as a toddler, it was now a boy.\nThe boy had the same face as Leo when he was six. His cheeky smile and big head made him look naughty rather than cute.\nThe dao spirit looked at Leo's sleeping face and sneered at him. He dug a small hole in the ground near Leo's waist. Then, it created a small water pond. After that, it grabbed Leo's hand and put his fingers into the water.\nWhen the deed was done, the boy's spirit sat on Leo's chest, waiting for his deed to show a result.\nSuddenly, Leo snapped open his eyes. He stared at the being on his chest.\nThe dao spirit was taken aback. It turned around and tried to flee. However, Leo's hand was faster.\nThis time, Leo caught the boy by the neck. His hands were coated with the thick essence of the cancer cells.\nHe could see the spirit!\n\"Too bad for you, I'm immune to this prank. I know exactly which dream will make me wet my bed, and I can easily break every dream I have with a thought! Do you know how many years I have been sleeping and playing in my dream world when I was bored?!\"\nThe boy struggled to flee, but he couldn't escape. It looked at Leo to the face, moving its mouth. However, no word came out.\nRUMBLE\nWhile Leo and the spirit conversed, black thunderclouds manifested above the mountaintop.\nBOOM\nThunder cracked, and a lightning bolt flashed in the clouds. Coincidentally, it was black lightning.\n\"Oh, shit.\"\nLeo had faced this before. He remembered how the black lightning bolts almost killed him several times back when he was on Earth. That time, he managed to escape the lightning barrage by running away from the chasing clouds.\nFacing the unknown tribulation clouds again, Leo realized that he had no time to run. He tossed away the spirit and prepared to bail.\n\"!!!\"\nHowever, the spirit latched onto Leo's chest, hugging him like a baby monkey. He looked up and faced its master.\n\"What do you want, ghost? Do you want to get fried or what?\"\nThe spirit had enough. Its ghostly body sank into Leo's chest and merged with him.\nThis time, the ghost didn't try to do anything funny to his body. Instead, it assimilated with him, transferring all its memory to Leo.\nA new memory gushed into Leo's mind, and one of his blood veins ruptured. Transparent blood came out from his nose, but he snorted all of them back.\n\"Ah? Eh?\"\nIt was hard to comprehend what he saw in the vision. In his mind, he saw countless scenery of trees, forests, and mountains. He witnessed the passage of time, seeing the growth of plants, animals, and insects.\nLife and death came and went. When old creatures died, new beings replaced them. Each generation was different from the previous one as they had different personalities and traits.\nHowever, there was one thing in common. In every generation, one or two of the plants, trees, insects, or creatures mutated and created a new subspecies. These variants changed the major traits of their ancestors, and they either thrived or died trying.\nAmong all plants, a descendant of a green dragon fruit plant absorbed too much wood Qi, and it bored a mutated fruit. That fruit fell from the tree and was eaten by a wild cockatrice. Then, the monster defecated the germinated seeds, which gave birth to a new species of dragon fruit plant – The white dragon fruit plant. Not long after that, a rabbit trent uprooted the plant and gave it to their king.\n\"Ah…\"\nLeo drooled and looked up to the sky as he was still drunk by the memory injection. He tiptoed toward the white tree and the eyeball. As his muscle memory kicked in, he collected the tree and the eyeball into one of the spatial rings.\nCRACK\nA few seconds later, black lightning descended, aiming at Leo!\nWhile half awake, Leo side-stepped and dodged the lightning bolt.\nBOOM!\nThe whole mountain erupted and exploded!\nThat was not all, the black lightning created a five-kilometer-deep hole in the ground. The tip of the lightning bolt then gathered more force, condensing another explosion.\nBOOM!\nSomething in the large hole exploded.\nMeanwhile, Leo fell from the mountain as the heaven tribulation lightning destroyed it. He snapped back to his sense and used the falling debris as a stepping stone. He leaped from the falling rock and hopped on the next.\nAfter five jumps, Leo traveled 500 meters and caught another erected mountain's cliff.\nLeo looked at the sky, wondering why the black lighting pursued him. He didn't remember doing anything wrong for heaven to curse him.\n\"WHAT DID I DO?!\" Leo retorted and cursed heaven.\nRUMBLE\nA second later, the black clouds dispersed, leaving Leo confused.\n\"HUH?! THAT'S IT?!\"\nLeo scratched his head and looked down at the narrow hole that the lightning bolt had created. There was a glowing red dot at the end of the tunnel, but Leo was not interested.\nCLINK\nLeo suddenly heard a chiming bell sound. Behind him, a dao spirit of him emerged. It had the face of Leo, but its body was made of wood.\nThe first dao avatar of Leo was a wood mannequin with his face.\nWhen the dao avatar came out, Leo received a system notification.\n<Congratulations. You have digested the gnosis of rabbit trent king.>\n\"…HUH?!\"",

As it is thick in wood and earth Qi, the local monsters excel in defense and self-regeneration. However, due to the recent infestation of Sweet Dream Mushroom, a portion of this world is not suitable for weak cultivators to explore. Please tread with caution.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 – Kill Rabbit Trent King. (Completed)\n2 – Absorb Gnosis of Rabbit Trent King. (Completed)\nSecondary Objective:\n1 – Locate Entity Fate Crystal in Sweet Dream Mushroom Forest (Completed)\n2 – Absorb Entity Fate Crystal. (Completed)\nExploration Rewards: 3 Free Tickets, Ownership of Planet Rabbit Trent A-3\nSecondary Rewards: 1 Lucky Draw\n.\nThis was the quest that Leo was supposed to do. However, unintentionally, Leo completed all objectives.\nDING\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm <You have obtained 3 Land Expansion Tickets, the ownership of Planet Rabbit Trent A-3, and one lucky draw.>\n<Planet Rabbit Trent A-3 has been added to your domain. You can build a permanent portal to Planet Rabbit Trent A-3. Please check the Mystic Realm Portal Building for more details.>\nLeo was overjoyed when the system mentioned a permanent portal. If he could erect a permanent portal to this world, he could make his mystic realm platform a tourist attraction. He could also use this place as his secret farmland so that he could breed and harvest dangerous plants or sweet dream mushrooms.\nHowever, not all good things come without flaws. The next system's messages shut down Leo's dream.\n<Please be advised. You can build structures in this world when your Humble General Store reaches level 10 or higher, which automatically unlocks necessary facilities.>\n<Please be advised. The local monsters and beasts are not considered your subordinates. You must subjugate the local monsters first before you can expand your store to this world.>\n<Please be advised. The system cannot collect, steal, or deduct the life force of the local monsters and beasts. You must defeat them yourself.>\nReading the three messages, Leo had a headache.\nThe first headache was the humble general store's level. He still remembered that upgrading the store to level 10 would disable the auto-protection perk of his system. When that happened, the stores, buildings, granaries, warehouses, and the apartment would be defenseless – Any cultivator might be able to destroy them.\nFortunately, a hundred unicorns just migrated to his domain. Leo wondered if he could entrust the security duty to them.\nAlso, Leo had a sick idea of how he could arm his subordinates, such as Gao Yan, Wu Buyi, and future trustworthy employees. He ejected the modified handgun that he used to shoot Situ Nantian.\nThe gun was still brand new. Judging from its performance, it was effective against a tough cultivator. Leo wondered if he could arm Gao Yan or Wu Buyi with similar guns.\nThinking about the gun, Leo's blood boiled. His Floridian instinct was tingling, and he had the urge to shoot something.\n\"Hah. I wish the domain system has a gun store. Should I start crafting a homemade 12 gauge and spend some lifespan upgrading it? No, that won't work. The upgrade cost is too steep. It's a lot of investment.\"\nLeo put the thoughts aside and contemplated the second and third issues. As this world was still plagued with unknown creatures, monsters, and animals, it would take a long time to subjugate or capture them all. As such, this project should be left to the employees in the future.\nExploiting employees was what a good capitalist should do. Leo crossed his arms and nodded, believing that it was a good idea.\nAll issues were temporarily solved. Leo shifted his attention to the rewards.\nThe free tickets came in the form of digital assets. It only showed in the domain system menu.\nHowever, the main attraction was the lucky draw ticket. Leo saw an icon of gold paper in the online shopping menu. He pressed on it, checking what it was.\nDING\n<Please select the category you wish to pull the lucky draw from.>\n\"Category?\"\nThe system prompted him with a list of texts – Food, Beverage, Medicines, Furniture, Weapons, Armor, Quality of Life Tools, Vehicles, Electric Appliances, ETC.\nThe list went on. Leo frowned and skimmed through the list as most of the items could be purchased through the online shopping system. Thus, he didn't need to look at the common things.\nAfter scrolling down the long list, Leo's eyes picked up a few interesting categories – Unique Domain Building, Gnosis, Fate Crystals, Cultivation Resource, and Authority.\nAside from the unique buildings and cultivation resources, the rest of the choice was locked. He pressed on the locked choice, hoping to learn why they were inaccessible.\nDING\n<Gnosis Lucky Draw requires Shopping Mall Level 10.>\n<Fate Crystal Lucky Draw requires Shopping Complex Level 20.>\n<Authority Lucky Draw requires Franchise Headquarters Level 20.>\n\"…\"\nThese options seemed to be exclusive to the endgame content. His headquarters building was still called \"Humble General Store\", but the structures in the list hinted at the existence of higher-tier buildings.\nSince the unique domain building choice was the only thing Leo couldn't access from the online store system, Leo picked it.\nDING\n<You have unlocked the shop domain system. This option is available!>\n<Will you use the lucky draw ticket on the category \"Unique Domain Building\"?>\nLeo shrugged. As he had no luck with lottery tickets or gacha games when he was a human, he didn't care if he would get something useless. After all, nothing good came for free.\n\"Yes.\"\nDING\nAll system windows were closed, and a new one appeared in front of Leo. The window sounded the drumrolls, and a lottery ball machine showed up on the screen. It stirred the balls in the machine around.I think you should take a look at\nInside the machine, Leo noticed a few gold balls, purple balls, blue balls, and grey balls.\n\"Four tiers of rewards?\"\nLeo gulped, hoping to get a golden ball.\nKLUK-KLUK\nThe gacha machine twisted its handle, and a ball was chosen. Leo gulped, praying to all alligators and Floridian neighbors in the past to bless him with great luck.\nUnfortunately, Leo's luck was bad. It was a grey ball.\nLeo bit his lower lips and counted the number of grey balls in the machine. It occupied 60% of the content while the blue ones took one-third. The rest were gold and purple.\n\"Yeah, my luck sucks. Anyway, what's the reward?\"\nLeo waited for the system to inform him what he got. He pressed on the window screen, hastening the process.\nPLOP\nThe grey ball was open. Then, a building icon came out.\n<Congratulations. You have unlocked Gunsmith Workshop!>\n\"…\"\nIt was a gunsmith workshop. The building should not be considered a gunsmith workshop at all as it was just a shack with random junk in front of the structure. Leo thought it came straight from a slum or a junkyard.\nFortunately, the icon came with a brief description, showing its potential and its max level.\n.\nGunsmith Workshop (Max Level 20)\nThis workshop is a must if you pursue the art of hot weaponry. At a low level, you may craft weapon parts to make ancient firearms, such as flintlock pistols. After upgrading it to level 10, this building can be evolved into a Gunsmith Factory, which unlocks advanced firearms of the 21st century.\nUpgradable Perks\nGunsmith Mannequin (0/1)\nHandloading Mannequin (0/1)\nFirearm Technology (0/6)\nProduct Quality (0/6)\nStructure Quality (0/6)\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nLeo drooled. He couldn't stop looking at the detail of the gunsmith workshop. Still, the upgrade cost ruined his mood.\n\"10 freaking thousand?! Are you nuts? Why is it so expensive?!\"\nLooking at the upgrade cost, Leo calculated how much he needed to invest in this building. As every structure came in as level one, Leo might have to upgrade it 19 times, which translated to 190,000 years of lifespan!\nThinking of the investment made Leo sweat. He grabbed a leaf from a random tree and wiped his face with it. He checked his current lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 141,346 Years…>\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo remembered that he used 80,000 years for the handgun and ammo during the chase, yet he still had this many.\n\"Oh, right. I ate a lot.\"\nOnce again, Leo shrugged it off as lifespan fluctuated daily. He sometimes used them to buy modern items to improve his quality of life, such as clothes, new rubber gloves, and toilet paper. He also gained a lot from food that he picked up from the wild.\nLeo stopped messing around. He came down from the cliff and landed next to the deep hole. Ignoring the pit, Leo kicked the ground and leaped east, heading toward Wu Buyi's campsite.\nHis mission was over. It was the right time to start collecting goodies in his spatial rings. Also, he could use this opportunity to practice riding a flying sword.\nWhile jumping and leaping across the forest, Leo had a feeling that he forgot something. He rolled his eyes, wondering what he had forgotten.\n.\n.\nAt the pagoda tower, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei still cultivated, gathering as much Qi from the tower as they could. Even though they were slightly injured from the last incident, they never stopped working to grow stronger.\nAs for the disciples on the first floor, they also worked hard. However, Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman were more adventurous. They began climbing the pagoda tower, following the footsteps of Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei.\nYao Qiqi, despite being the only junior among the group, wasn't afraid of the Qi suppression and the gravity of this tower. She skipped and hopped as if she was walking on the moon.\nXu Nuan watched the little child play as she traveled together with the elder's group. She was jealous of the disciple.\n\"Don't run too fast. You will fall.\"\nYao Qiqi giggled, \"I'll be fine! I'm about to reach the bottleneck of the nascent soul stage!\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman almost vomited blood when they overheard her. All of them cultivated for decades, but they had the same cultivation base as the little girl.\nAshamed of their talent, the men closed their mouths and refrained from talking. They rushed forward, trying their best not to mingle around with the two.\nXu Nuan looked at the fleeing men and chuckled. She also had a similar thought when Yao Qiqi suddenly advanced from the golden core stage to the nascent soul stage last night.\nLooking at the little girl, Xu Nuan thought of Leo. She wondered if he was the cause of Yao Qiqi's fast growth. She thought.\n'If I have time, I should bring her to Senior Florida Man again. Maybe, she should study under him rather than me. She might have a brighter future with a stronger mentor. Haiz. I have nothing to teach her other than the common sense.'\nXu Nuan lamented her inability and lack of knowledge. While thinking, Xu Nuan also wondered if Leo needed a servant or an elder to oversee his store and subordinates.\n'Should I ask him to be his store's assistant? Should I bring some girls from the sanctuary to study under him?'",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 107 – Philanthropist \"Mr. Florida Man\" Teaches Teen Carjacking Techniques and How to Survive Cop Chases\nWHOOSH\nLeo finally returned to the campsite after a few days of exploration. Upon arrival, he noticed some changes.\nThe first change was Gao Yan. Although he hadn't moved from the portal area, his aura and presence changed - His pupils and sclera were pure green, and his skin was covered in tree barks. Two antler horns grew from his temples, but they gathered terrifying energy.\nLightning branches kept coming out from Gao Yan's horns. High-voltage lightning bolts randomly struck the river, mangrove trees, and the shelter that Leo and Wu Buyi had made.\nPA\nOne of the lightning bolts hit Leo's chest. It burnt his T-shirt, and it left a black mark on his chest. The stain quickly vanished as Leo's skin absorbed the rampaging Qi of Gao Yan.\nGao Yan gave Leo an apologetic look. He bowed his head several times to apologize to Leo, but his action made his thunder horns send out more lightning strikes toward the latter.\nLeo observed the color of the lightning bolts. Fortunately, they were colorless, and their destructive power was similar to regular lightning bolts from Earth during the pre-apocalypse era.\n\"Stop pointing those horns at me. Point them at the sky or something. If better, dip your head into the water and zap those caimans for me. I'm craving some freshwater fish and caiman meat.\"\nGao Yan wryly smiled and tried his best to lean his head backward. Although he tilted his head, the horns still unleashed more lightning bolts and hit everything that moved around him.\nBANG\nOne of the lightning bolts hit Wu Buyi, who had been sulking in a collapsed shelter.\nLeo turned his attention to Wu Buyi. Upon seeing him hugging his knees inside a leaf shelter, Leo approached him.\n\"What's happening, Wu Buyi? Why are you sulking here? Did someone bully you?\"\nWu Buyi looked at Leo's face. His eyes were teary as if he had been crying.\n\"M-My lord… I…\"\nLeo felt bad for Wu Buyi. He thought that something went wrong with the latter's cultivation or items.\n\"Tell me. What's wrong?\"\nWu Buyi glanced at Gao Yan. He sniffed and confessed, \"While you were away, Gao Yan… had a breakthrough.\"\n\"Oh, isn't that nice? Your disciple is getting stronger. But why are you sad?\"\n\"He… he…\" Wu Buyi sobbed. Teardrops rolled down from his eyes while he looked at Leo's face.\n\"He, what?\"\n\"After the breakthrough, he faced the heaven's tribulation lightning.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"He transcended it.\"\nLeo was puzzled as there was no reason for Wu Buyi to cry or sadden. He frowned and stared into Wu Buyi's eyes, \"And?\"\n\"He… awakens a dao avatar.\"\n\"AND???\"\n\"That dao avatar… is a lightning spirit from the heaven tribulation clouds.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi cried harder. He raised his voice, \"Isn't this unfair, my lord?! He's only like… 16?! Look at him. His cultivation base has already caught up to me! That's not all, he got himself a sexy sentient dao avatar! Look at him, my lord. LOOK!!\"\nLeo facepalmed. He got the gist of it, but he glanced at Gao Yan.\nAfter a careful look, Leo noticed a transparent body of a young maiden, cladded in electricity. The outline of her refined curvy hips and bosoms was ideal for a young lady as she was not too fat or slim. Moreover, although her face couldn't be seen, Leo vaguely saw the gleams of her eyes, which stared directly at him.\nLeo deeply sighed. He gently grabbed a 2-inch thick tree branch nearby. Using less than 1% of his true force, Leo swung it down, bonking Wu Buyi.\nBONK\nThe impact was strong enough to send a regular adult man to ICU. Fortunately, Wu Buyi was a nascent soul cultivator, so this impact was the same as a mild smack to the back of the head.\n\"You senile old coot! Is that why you're jealous of your disciple?!\"\nWu Buyi yelped and covered his head. He looked at Leo and wept, \"But that's a sentient dao avatar, my lord! In the future, that dao avatar can manifest her physical body. And, and… In legends, the manifested dao avatars of the opposite gender usually served their masters as their concubines-\"\nBONK\nLeo heard enough. He hit Wu Buyi again. This time, he used 1% of his strength.\nThe impact stunned Wu Buyi. He fell to the ground, and a large bump grew on his bald head.\nAfter Wu Buyi stopped talking, Leo reminded him.\n\"How old are you this year?\"\n\"108, my lord.\"\nLeo tossed the tree branch away. He purchased a sheet of A3 paper and folded it into a fan.\nWHOOSH\nAlthough it was a paper fan, it could be deadly in the hands of Leo. He used two percent of his strength and smacked Wu Buyi's head for the third time.\nPA!\nThe sound was crisp as the folded fan always caused a loud noise upon impact. Still, because of Leo's abnormal strength and speed, the fan caught fire after the hit.\nWu Buyi got knocked to the ground once again. He failed to get up this time as he started seeing stars.\nLeo shouted at Wu Buyi.\n\"You're freaking over 100 years old, and you're still envious of a junior because he has a potential pretty wife?! What are you, a sex-depraved 14-year-old virgin?!\"\nWhile his head was an inch deep in the ground, Wu Buyi cried, \"Yes, my lord. I have been cultivating all my life, and I have never touched a woman before. I wish I have a pretty woman by my side, too!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi raised his head and wailed, \"I'M A PATHETIC LONELY 100-YEAR-OLD MAN, MASTER! WAAAA!!\"I think you should take a look at\n\"…\"\nLeo double-facepalmed. He understood something that he never wished he would learn.\n'Come to think of it, I never saw a female disciple from Life Sword Sect. All their elders and disciples are men. Only Xu Nuan and her people are women… Wait. Are their sects gender-based?'\nCultivators were lonely creatures. They either spent most of their time cultivating, training, procuring resources, and working to increase their strength. Talented young men usually spent their youthful period in seclusion or got trapped in a male-only sect, such as Life Sword Sect.\nLeo figured that Wu Buyi might have spent decades in cultivation and pill-making arts, which was why he never touched a woman.\n'Poor sod. Well, that's understandable. This world has no internet or Dutch wives. It's already a miracle that he doesn't swing that way.'\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm Thinking of the internet, Leo remembered that he had bought a smartphone for the white dragon fruit tree. He injected his Qi into all five spatial rings, searching if he had picked it when he brought the tree and the eyeball along.\nFortunately, it was still there. Leo's 8,000 years of lifespan wasn't lost along with the destroyed mountain.\nWHOOSH\nLeo ejected the smartphone out. He fiddled with it, checking if he could still access a wild site.\nDUN-DUN-DUN PA-DUM-TSS\nAs Leo had expected, as soon as Leo accessed THAT website and pressed on a random video, the iconic theme song sounded.\nSeeing the old porn website, Leo snickered. Although he doubted how the phone could still enter a modern internet website, he turned off his brain and showed Wu Buyi the phone.\n\"Look here, baldy. I'll teach you a way to relieve some boredom. This is one of many toys I have in my previous world…\"\nLeo sat in front of Wu Buyi, teaching him how to use a modern smartphone.\n.\nTwo hours of crash course worked wonders. Although Wu Buyi had never heard of the internet and smartphones before, a senior alchemist like him quickly adapted to the technologies. He understood how the apps, browsers, and the internet worked.\nAs if Wu Buyi's mental age regressed to a child, he sat alone, staring at the phone with bloodshot eyes. Although Wu Buyi didn't understand the language of many websites and apps, he got addicted to the images and the videos, especially the sites with many sexy women.\nSeeing that Wu Buyi had something to distract the depressing thoughts, Leo was relieved. He decided to give Wu Buyi that phone.\n\"Don't be obsessed with it, okay? The Internet can be addictive, but it's a useful tool to broaden one's horizon…\"\n\"AHN! YES! AH! AHN!\"\n\"…\"\nThe sound from the phone was enough to tell Leo what video Wu Buyi was watching. Once again, Leo slapped his forehead and facepalmed. He left the old man alone as he needed it.\nAfter ditching Wu Buyi, Leo walked toward Gao Yan. The latter's condition hadn't improved as he still couldn't suppress the rampaging lightning Qi in his antler horns.\nGao Yan's horns reminded Leo of someone he had forgotten. Finally, Leo remembered the missing guy.\n\"Where is Taxi?\"\nLeo looked around and realized that Taxi wasn't there with him. He jumped 5 kilometers to the sky and scanned the landscape.\nThe pervert horse was nowhere to be seen.\nAfter the landing, Leo planned to shout to call the horse. But then, he remembered that this realm had become a part of his domain. Since it was within Leo's domain, he should be able to use the map to pinpoint the unicorn.\nPutting his thought to work, Leo opened the shop domain menu and checked the map.\nDING\nIt worked. The system map revealed the entire world.\nThis world only consisted of one big Pangea, aka a single supercontinent. Its overall shape was round in the west and north, but the southeast was long and narrow.\nIt looked like a jellyfish with two tentacles, facing west.\nThe pyramid was located to the northwest of the continent. As for the mountains, they were at the edge of the continent, next to the endless sea. The pagoda town was at the entrance to the east peninsula. As for their campsite location, it was directly south of the pyramid, located at the southwest of the continent.\nBEEP\nRed dots and green dots indicated allies and potential foes on the map. Leo noticed the face icons of Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Xu Nuan, and Yao Qiqi in the pagoda town. About 30 red dots traveled in groups, wandering around the map. As for Taxi, he was in the middle of the North Sea.\n\"What the hell is he doing over there?\"\nAs Taxi might know something about lightning Qi and the cultivation method, Leo decided to go and fetch him to the camp.\n\"Stay there, Gao Yan. I'm going to get you a new mentor. I'll be back.\"\nBecause Leo couldn't fly, he decided to bring out the red flying sword of Situ Nantian.\nWHOOM\nAfter being ejected from a spatial ring, the flying sword hummed and floated in front of Leo. The latter hopped on it and stood tall.\nGao Yan widened his eyes and gazed at the flying sword in admiration. He recognized the model.\n\"Isn't this the Pherrari F50 model? I heard it's a limited edition! Senior, how did you get it?\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows when Gao Yan mentioned the brand name. He was amused.\n\"What did you say? Ferrari?\"\n\"Umm, Pherrari, senior.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo looked at the flying sword and thought of the race cars in his old world. Thinking how they sounded the same, Leo laughed.\n\"Ever heard of GTA, boy?\"\n\"Gee-Tee-Ay?\"\n\"It's a culture in my world, you see?\"\nLeo proceeded to explain what GTA meant and how to GTA someone.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 108 – Florida Man Sued by IATA as He Flies to Space by Riding Drone\nAfter a brief explanation, Leo gazed at Gao Yan with a proud look.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan muttered and reviewed the new knowledge.\n\"GTA is such a profound art! So, if I master that, I can snatch somebody's flying sword during combat? Then, if I master a flying sword technique enough, what technique do I need to learn next?\"\nLeo puffed his chest and ejected the system's pistol to show the boy.\n\"GTA isn't possible without absolute strength and the right tool. Here, you should carry this.\"\nWithout hesitation, Leo gave the pistol to Gao Yan. After all, he seemed more trustworthy than the baldy fox Wu Buyi.\nGao Yan received the pistol and flipped it around. He had never seen a similar artifact before.\n\"Senior, what's this?\"\n\"A gun.\"\n\"A gun?\"\n\"Well, you can take it as an emergency artifact for self-defense. You point the muzzle at the person you want to put a hole inside, then you pull the trigger.\"\n\"???\"\nGao Yan wryly smiled as he couldn't understand Leo.\nSeeing Gao Yan's expression, Leo got down from the flying sword. He pursed his lips and purchased another handgun, investing 5,000 years of lifespan. He then browsed the online store to see if non-lethal rounds existed.\nFortunately, there was plenty of rubber ammunition for sale. They were also a lot cheaper than live rounds as one box of 50 rubber bullets only cost five years of lifespan.\nLeo purchased 10 boxes of ammo. Then, he used the spare pistol to teach Gao Yan how to shoot a gun.\n\"Okay, I'm gonna teach you some basics. Firstly, you need to know the trigger discipline, the safety, and how to not point that muzzle around and kill yourself or your friend by an accident.\"\nHe proceeded to teach Gao Yan the general knowledge of handguns and gun anatomy first. He forced the boy to replace the live rounds with the rubber rounds so that he wouldn't waste the expensive bullets.\n.\nBANG\nBANG\nTwo hours later, Gao Yan practiced shooting a tree from a distance. He was nervous at first as the ammo was limited. But when he learned that the live rounds cost 40,000 years of lifespan to get, he stopped worrying about expendable cheap bullets.\nLeo watched Gao Yan's form and nodded in approval. He was a quick learner. His strong grip and wrist made it so that the recoil never existed. Moreover, his accuracy was no joke as he could even shoot a target 50m away instantly without even aiming.\nThe insane accuracy came from the weird transparent dao avatar of Gao Yan. Leo glanced at her and noticed that the spirit's hands overlapped with Gao Yan's.\nIn short, Gao Yan could use an aimbot in real life. Leo was envious of him.\nSecondly, Leo noticed something odd about him. When Gao Yan focused on his gun, his antler horns stopped releasing random lightning bolts. Instead, the lightning Qi gathered in his hands and fingers, transferring the Qi into the gun.\nBANG!\nLeo narrowed his eyes when Gao Yan fired the next shot. He could clearly see a branch of lightning bolt coming out of the muzzle. However, the rubber didn't conduct electricity, so the lightning Qi failed to influence the bullet.\n\"Senior, this artifact is really difficult. I can't apply my Qi to the bullet,\" Gao Yan complained.\nLeo heartily laughed, \"Don't worry. Rubber is an insulator. Electricity and heat can't get through it easily, so you can't apply your Qi to it. However…\"\nThinking about applying Qi to the bullet heads, Leo was curious if he could do it. He used the level-1 gun to test his theory.\nAfter loading the rubber round magazine, Leo tried injecting his Qi into the rubber bullet head while he aimed.\nRUMBLE\nThe pistol glowed in rainbow light. Leo ignored it and pulled the trigger.\nBOOOOOM!\nInstead of firing a rubber bullet, the ordinary-looking pistol fired a 1-foot-diameter railgun beam. The rainbow energy evaporated everything in its path and vanished after it traveled 50 kilometers.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nLeo and Gao Yan's eyes turned into small dots as they had no words to describe the phenomenon. They stood there in silence.\n\"AHN! OH, YES! HARDER!\"\nUnfortunately, the sultry noise from a certain smartphone in a broken shelter interrupted the tranquility. In the shack, someone was addicted to a lewd video.\nPIKI\nThe 5,000-YOL gun in Leo's hands cracked and emitted white smoke. It seemed that even the system's gun couldn't handle the recoil and Qi.\nLeo clicked his tongue and spent 5,000 years of lifespan upgrading it to level 2.\nDING\nThe pistol was upgraded and automatically repaired. The smoke and the residual essence and Qi were gone.\n\"Ahem,\" Leo was embarrassed. \"Sorry, I couldn't suppress my… strength. Anyway, you might want to use metal Qi, earth Qi, or wood Qi instead of lightning. Avoid fire Qi by the way. It might overhead the gun like what I just did.\"\nGao Yan's eyes brightened. He repeatedly nodded and gazed at Leo in admiration.\n\"I'll keep that in mind, senior! I'll train hard and be as strong as you!\"\n\"Don't rush, boy. You have a long future ahead of you. Also, keep that live rounds with you. There are only…like… 18 bullets in there? Well, I think those ammos are enough to kill an immortal or two. I tested it on a random thief a couple days ago, and it's enough to deter him. Too bad my accuracy sucks or I would have shot him in the head.\"I think you should take a look at\n\"!!!\"\nWhen Gao Yan heard the keywords \"Kill an immortal or two\", he stopped listening to Leo as he was in shock.\nAn artifact that could kill an immortal?!\nEven the dao avatar behind Gao Yan covered her mouth in astonishment before she lowered her head to show gratitude to Leo.\n\"S-Senior. T-This artifact is t-too much!\"\n\"Meh, just keep it. My store is getting bigger, and those stupid robbers are eyeing our goods. It's okay when I'm around. But when I'm not, you will need something for self-protection. Use it to protect your friends and your loved ones.\"\nGao Yan shed a manly tear of gratitude. He prostrated to Leo.\n\"THANK YOU, SENIOR. I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!\"\nLooking at Gao Yan's overreaction, Leo scratched his face, embarrassed. He then purchased 10 more boxes of rubber ammo for Gao Yan.\n\"Keep practicing. Also, try not to clean it with water. I'll come back to teach you how to disassemble and assemble that gun and how to clean it later.\"\n\"YES, SIR!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo smiled at the boy. His honesty, manner, and sincere attitude were likable. He wished that his store would have more employees like him.\nThinking of employees and promising young people, Leo recalled the little girl from the women's group. He opened the map and checked Yao Qiqi's status.\nLooking at the portrait of the little girl, Leo pursed his lips and hesitated.\n'She's too young to work, but that doesn't mean she can't work at my store. Well, she can work here as a playmate for that stupid plant as long as Cat won't eat her. Oh, right. I should also hire experienced managers, too. I can't entrust everything to Wu Buyi alone.'\nLeo changed his plan. He brought back Pherrari flying sword and pointed at the east. Before he left, he told Gao Yan.\n\"I'm going to pay your sect's team a visit. While I'm away, keep practicing. Oh, if a strong monster shows up, don't hesitate to kill it with the live rounds.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nLeo didn't wait for Gao Yan to respond. He looked around and scanned the area with his infrared sight.\nBecause of the loud gun noise and Gao Yan's lightning bolts, no creature lingered in the area except a couple black caimans in the river.\nLeo paused for a moment and picked up a boulder. He threw it into the river.\nBOOM\nThe rock flew like a cannonball, parting the water as if Moses was there. However, as it traveled through the water at a light speed, the boulder reddened and shrank by half.\nPU\nThe hot boulder smashed a unicorn caiman in half. The other one noticed how its friend died and swam away in a panic.\nGao Yan looked at the parted river in astonishment. But when he saw the red area in the transparent river, he understood why Leo did it.\n\"A-Amazing.\"\n\"Anyway, take care of yourself while I'm away. Don't become like your mentor.\"\nLeo snorted and hopped on the flying sword \"Pherrari\". Learning from his mistake, he ordered it to fly up instead of going straight.\nWHOOSH\nJust like that, Leo shuttled to the sky and disappeared along with the sword.\nGao Yan looked up and dropped his jaw. He was astonished at how profound Leo's strength was. He then chatted with his dao avatar.\n\"Say, Senior Thora. Do you think I can be like him one day?\"\nThe lightning spirit giggled and embraced Gao Yan from behind. She whispered in a soft voice. However, nobody but Gao Yan could hear her.\n\"In a decade years, probably not. A hundred years, very low chance. A thousand years, maybe.\"\n\"Wha?! He's that strong?!\"\n\"I can't see through his cultivation base and strength even though I'm a born elemental spirit. He's not an ordinary immortal for sure.\"\n\"…Wow.\"\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nAfter flying vertically for a few seconds, Leo mustered his strength and put his force on the tip of the flying sword, commanding it to adjust its flying course.\nBy the time Leo managed to push the flying sword's tip down, he was already at the stratosphere of the planet. The sky was no longer bright, and stars filled the sky.\nNo moon existed around this planet. Only the white sun at a distance seemed intimidating.\nLeo gazed at the space and admired it for a moment. It was different from the Milky Way as the stars were arranged in a square formation. Moreover, the gas wasn't as thick as it condensed around its source.\nLooking at the stars, Leo wondered if they were the other mystic realms that were linked to the cultivation world or if they were manmade stars in some pocket dimension.\n\"Ah, my stupid ring. Who made you? Who was the owner of that alien ship? Why did it appear in my world?\"\nLeo asked the alien ring that had already become one with his finger. He rubbed it, but he got no response from the ring.",

He jetted toward the pagoda town as he planned to scout Xu Nuan and Yao Qiqi to work for him.\nWhile flying, Leo looked behind him.\nA transparent wooden mannequin with Leo's face followed after its master. It was Leo's first official dao avatar.\nLeo wasn't well-informed about the dao avatar and cultivation techniques. However, he learned a thing or two after he interacted with Gao Yan and Wu Buyi.\n\"So that is my dao avatar?\"\nHe smirked at the mannequin and waved his hand, calling him to come closer.\n\"Hey, bro. Can you talk? What are you?\"\n\"…\"\nThe mannequin dao avatar dully stared at Leo before it vanished into his alien ring.\nSeeing its behavior, Leo was disappointed.\n\"I guess you're sentient, too. Too bad you're quite a rebellious one.\"\nLeo shrugged and ignored his dao avatar. He focused on his feet and pressed more weight on the flying sword, descending and preparing to land.\nA few minutes later, Leo could see the pagoda town again. Unfortunately, it wasn't as beautiful as a few days ago because of the carnage, which Situ Nantian and Leo had caused.\nSeeing the town, Leo jumped off the flying sword as it had no brake pedal to stomp on. It headed toward one of the buildings in the town.\nBOOM\nBecause the flying sword carried Leo's Qi, it punctured a hole in a 20-story pagoda and the building behind it. Fortunately, it crash-landed on the street and stopped there.\nLeo safely landed in front of the city. He broke a sweat when the 20-story pagoda collapsed because of the flying sword.\n\"Whoops. That wasn't me!\"\nAfter denying the responsibility, Leo proceeded to the half-broken 400-story tall pagoda. As the 10 top floors got blasted during the fight between Taxi and the cultivators, it still emitted white smoke.\nEntering the building, Leo found the disciples of the Life Sword Sect and Amazonian Sanctuary again. However, most of their elders were not there.\nWhen the young disciples from both organizations saw Leo, they immediately stood up to greet him. A couple of them had met Leo once, and they told their friends to be respectful.\n\"Greetings, elder!\" A male disciple lowered his head and cupped his fist.\n\"S-Senior… G-Greetings, sir.\" Qi Niu, who once tempted Leo, tried not to be too obvious. She pretended to not recognize him.\nLeo nodded at the crowd, \"At ease, boys and girls. Continue what you've been doing. I'll be on my way to visit your elders.\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir.\"\nAfter parting with the disciples, Leo climbed the tower. As there was nothing to stop him, he started running up the stairs.\n.\nOn the 50th floor, Leo found the group of elders there. Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and the elders from the sanctuary gathered and inspected a pile of white dust on the ground.\nWhen Leo approached them, Han Hao noticed him first. He poked his colleagues with his elbow to get their attention. Then, he bowed 90 degrees.\n\"Senior Florida Man, it's good to see you here with us, sir!\"\nHan Meng gave his father a weird look. He lowered his head and saluted, \"Senior, we meet again.\"\nXu Nuan, Tiger Swordsman, and the other female elders cupped their fists and gave Leo face. As for Yao Qiqi, she boldly grabbed Leo's hand and jumped around.\n\"Senior Angel! Do you remember me? It's me, Qiqi!\"\nLeo lowered his sight and found the little toddler. He glanced at his hand for a moment as he was worried that Yao Qiqi might be infected by his radiation aura.\nFortunately, Yao Qiqi seemed to develop immunity. She didn't mutate like the others.\nAfter making sure, Leo patted her head, \"Of course, I remember you. Sorry that I made you drink that tea. Your physical age has regressed by a lot.\"\n\"Thank you for saving my life, Mister Angel! I'm working hard to become an angel like you!\" Yao Qiqi laughed.\nLooking at the adorable little girl, Leo couldn't help but smile. Although he had the urge to hug her and carried her around, he suppressed his desire. He then complained.\n\"I wish I had a granddaughter as cute as you.\"\n\"Hmm?!\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned it, Xu Nuan's eyes gleamed. She walked toward Leo and seized the opportunity to propose an idea.\n\"Senior. Yao Qiqi is a talented girl. She's only six, but she has already reached the nascent soul stage. However, our sanctuary is incapable of guiding her to a higher path.\"\nLeo flinched for a moment as Xu Nuan's tone implied that the sanctuary wanted to disown her. He frowned.\n\"So, you're saying that you can't raise the girl?\"\n\"N-No! That's not what I'm saying!\" Xu Nuan waved her hands and shook her head, \"I'm trying to say that she deserves a better mentor. I… no, the elders of our sect believe that her talent would be a waste if she keeps staying with us. We were hoping… if you can take her under your wings, senior?\"\nLeo's eyes reddened in anger, \"You want to shove your responsible on me?\"\n\"NO! Of course not!\" Again, Xu Nuan sweated profusely. She looked at Yao Qiqi, \"I mean, we think she deserves a better parent than us, old women, sir!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's frown deepened. He was still angry.I think you should take a look at\nA female-only sanctuary or organization was the best place for Yao Qiqi to find female friends and sisters. She could grow up normally and be happy in the right environment. However, Xu Nuan's action was intolerable as she simply wanted to kick her out and hand her to Leo.\n\"You know what?\" Leo patted Yao Qiqi's head. \"I'm not taking in any disciple unless the person is agreed to it. Let the girl decide where she wants to stay. If she likes staying with you and your sanctuary, she will stay there. But if she wants to be with me, I'll take her in since you old hags are irresponsible!\"\n\"S-Senior. That wasn't our intention!\"\nXu Nuan wanted to cry as Leo misunderstood her. She wished for Yao Qiqi to have a better mentor and growing environment as their sanctuary couldn't provide enough resources to raise her.\nPreventing the misunderstanding, Xu Nuan confessed, \"It's not like that, senior. We… Our sanctuary doesn't have enough cultivation resources to nurture her. In fact, we lack daily grain pills and cultivation resources for our disciples.\"\n\"But haven't many cultivators been donating spirit stones to your sanctuary?\" Han Hao added while he raised his eyebrows.\n\"Most of those donations came from the imperial court and the Ouyang Clan, Elder Han. They added a condition that we had to provide them virgin maidens for their clans in return. Since we don't support prostitution, we returned their money.\"\nLeo heard some disturbing inside news. His anger was shifted toward the imperial court and the Ouyang Clan as they reminded him of the pedophile ring in his homeworld, which was always on the news.\nHe gave Xu Nuan and the female elders a meaningful look. He asked them again.\n\"Are you sure that you have never sold your girls to old men like me before?\"\nXu Nuan and everybody shook their heads, \"No, senior. Never!\"\nLeo slowly nodded. Then, he looked at Yao Qiqi for a moment before he came up with an idea.\n\"You know what? I have a better idea. Tell me, how many members your organization has?\"\n\"Umm, about… 250 disciples and a dozen elders?\"\n\"And you lack cultivation resources, right?\"\n\"…Yes.\"\n\"I'm hiring all of you. My store lacks clerks, cashiers, and employees. I'll pay you essence stones if you move your goddamn sect whatsoever to my territory and settle down there.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nXu Nuan and the old women couldn't believe their ears as Leo suddenly offered them a job. Moreover, the pay was essence stones, which they couldn't get their hands on as they weren't a member of the imperial court.\nHan Hao and others were also stunned as they didn't expect Leo to solicit the entire sanctuary to work for his store.  They looked at each other and secretly contacted Hua Jiashan via telepathy.\nWhile everybody was shocked, Leo began listing the employee welfare and working conditions.\n\"I'll provide a dorm for you to stay, but you will still need to build your own houses later. Of course, you will have to move in and live in my territory. Even so, everybody only needs to clock eight hours a day or 40 hours a week! Working overtime will be rewarded accordingly. You get free healthcare, aka free medical pills from me if you are sick or injured. Also, the pay is one essence stone per month.\"\n\"ONE ESSENCE STONE PER MONTH?!\" Xu Nuan's eyes were round. The other elders also drooled.\nLeo smirked as he didn't tell them that he paid Gao Yan and Wu Buyi more than that. As he didn't know how good Xu Nuan and the others were, he offered them minimum wage.\nMeanwhile, Han Hao and the male elders had a wry smile on their faces. They recently purchased Leo's essence stones for one YOL per stone. Hearing that the women had a chance to earn one stone per month, they didn't know if they should be jealous of them or not.\nAs the old said, \"Money is King\", the sanctuary elders readily agreed. Even Xu Nuan shed a tear of happiness as they couldn't get a better offer elsewhere.\n\"As long as you don't force us to do something immoral, we will gladly work for you. However… there's a problem,\" Xu Nuan gulped as she looked around.\n\"What?\" Leo was annoyed as Xu Nuan still dared to give him a condition.\n\"Umm, our sanctuary possesses a portal to a mystic realm. If we abandon the portal to work for you, I'm afraid that our elders and disciples won't be able to challenge any mystic realm anymore. T-This offer might be impossible for us after all.\"\nXu Nuan was worried that the girls wouldn't be able to enter any mystic realm if they joined Leo. The others also had the same thought, and they were reluctant to abandon their precious territory to join him.\nLeo rolled his eyes. He deeply sighed and told them a secret.\n\"What if I tell you that I'm the owner of this world, and I might be able to open a PERMANENT portal?\"\n\"EH?!\"\n\"I mean exactly when I said PERMANENT PORTAL. It's fixed to this world, though. Anything you find here, you can keep them. Any monster you kill, you can keep them. Well, this world is kinda dangerous, though, since there're gators and those pink mushrooms-\"\nSuddenly, Han Hao pushed Xu Nuan aside, interrupting Leo mid-conversation, \"We'll join you! WE WILL JOIN YOU! LET LIFE SWORD SECT MERGE WITH YOUR DOMAIN, SIR!\"\nXu Nuan: \"…\"\nLeo: \"…\"\nEverybody stared at Han Hao. They all had the same question in their minds.\n'Who asked you?'\n.\nWhile the adults talking, Yao Qiqi looked back and forth between Xu Nuan and Leo. She didn't understand a thing.\nAs Yao Qiqi was bored, she looked at Leo's big hand. Then, she noticed a ring pattern around his middle finger.\n\"A ring?\"\nCurious, Yao Qiqi touched the ring tattoo. But as soon as she touched it, she heard a young man's voice.\n'Who goes there? Who are you? How do you have the same aura as my master?'\nThe owner of the voice peeked out the ring. A transparent wooden mannequin head came out from the ring and looked at Yao Qiqi.\n'You, who are you?'\nYao Qiqi was surprised. She laughed at the mannequin as he had the same face as Leo, except it looked younger.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 110 – Locals Refuse to Call Cops after Witnessing Florida Man Urinating on Wooden Mannequin in front of His 6-Year-Old Daughter, \"We saw nothing!\"\nHan Hao was shameless. Instead of listening and waiting for his turn to chat, he self-inserted into the conversation and sold his sect to Leo. Moreover, he hadn't gotten approval from Hua Jiashan yet.\nLeo frowned and brought out a paper fan from his spatial ring. He smacked the shameless old man's head in front of the crowd.\nPA!\nThe elders were taken aback. But when they noticed that Leo did it to punish Han Hao, the corners of their mouths curved up as they found the situation funny.\n\"Pipe it down. You have to talk to Hua Jiashan first if you want to merge your sect with my company.\"\n\"C-Can we really serve you, senior?!\" Han Hao gulped as he thought that he had jumped the gun. However, Leo didn't decline the offer.\n\"I'm planning to poach disciples from your sect anyway. If you can migrate to my domain and help me fortify my territory, I have no reason to refuse.\"\n\"WOOOOO!!\"\nHan Hao forgot about manners and raised his arms to the sky, celebrating. Everybody stared at the weird old man with a blank expression.\nWhen Han Hao came back to his senses, he coughed and rubbed their hands, \"About the wage… can we get the essence stones too?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Go fetch Hua Jiashan and we'll discuss the wage!\"\n\"YES, SENIOR!\"\nHan Hao laughed and turned around to look at Han Meng and Tiger Swordsman. The two elders frowned at their grand elder.\n\"What are you looking at?\"\nHan Meng grumbled, \"You're crazy, Father. Sect Master is not going to like this. Life Sword Sect was found by the sword saint, and he was Sect Master Hua's ancestor. He won't disband his sect to serve Senior Florida Man.\"\n\"Well, we'll find out.\"\nWhile Leo and the group chatted previously, Han Hao had been chatting with Hua Jiashan via voice transmission, which was a common skill of cultivators with at least one dao avatar.\nHua Jiashan promised Han Hao that he would return to chat with Leo. Han Hao was waiting for the sect master to be here.\nMeanwhile, Leo shifted his attention to Xu Nuan. He believed that she might need her master's permission to move her people as well. Thus, he waited for the two big shots to arrive.\nWhile waiting, Xu Nuan was curious about Leo's background. She boldly asked him, \"Senior Florida Man. Since we will work for you, we wish to know more about you. Could you tell us about yourself?\"\n\"Ah, an interview?\" Leo snickered, \"I'm supposed to interview you, not the other way around, though.\"\n\"Please satisfy our curiosity, senior. At least, we need to know who and what we are working for. What is your goal? Why are you expanding your domain? Where were you from? And how strong are you?\"\nXu Nuan dropped the most important question that Han Hao and others were dying to know. They stopped talking to listen.\nLeo looked at the group of old men and women. He deeply sighed and looked at Yao Qiqi, afraid that she might get bored as the adults forgot about her.\nBetraying Leo's expectation, Yao Qiqi mumbled as if she was chatting with someone or something. Leo followed her gaze and found the reason.\nThe wooden mannequin spirit came out from his alien ring and sat in front of Yao Qiqi. They seemed to converse in a silent language that the others couldn't eavesdrop or hear.\nSince Yao Qiqi was busy, Leo returned his attention to the group of elders. He briefly explained.\n\"As you've guessed, I'm not from this planet.\"\n\"I knew it!\" Han Hao smacked his knees as he had predicted it. \"Which immortal realm are you from, senior?\"\n'Immortal realm?'\nLeo pursed his lips as he didn't remember that Earth had that fantasy background except for the mutated monsters and thick radiation gas.\nStill, the strength of Earth's monsters, mutated insects, Godzillas, and Kaijus was a lot superior to the unicorns and the horn caimans of this realm. Even Situ Nantian couldn't hold a candle against one of them.\nAs Leo didn't know how to explain, he described the environment of Earth.\n\"It was a place with thick gas and huge monsters. Half of them are capable of injuring me while the other half can potentially kill me if I'm not careful.\"\nHan Hao and Xu Nuan nodded as they could vividly picture the harsh environment of an immortal realm. Still, Xu Nuan wished to know the detail. She probed for more information.\n\"Which rank are they, senior? I heard the 10th-rank monster beast are immortal beasts, but we have never seen an 11th-rank or higher. Can you tell me the average strength of those monsters?\"\nLeo pursed his lips and counted his fingers. As he had no idea how the locals categorized a monster's strength, he told them the truth.\n\"I've never counted. Well, I know that they are immune to red lightning, but they can still die if black lightning hit them.\"\n\"R-R-RED LIGHTNING?! D-DO YOU MEAN RED LIGHTNING TRIBULATIONS?!\"\nHan Hao and Xu Nuan uttered in unison. As they were the most educated people in the group, they had studied a lot about heavenly tribulation lightning's variations.\nXu Nuan narrated her thoughts to make sure her knowledge matched Leo's.\n\"Senior. If I remember correctly, the red lightning tribulation is called the baptism of god. My sanctuary's ancestors and seniors who had already ascended to the immortal realms used to leave us with a note. They said that the gold lightning tribulation separated mortals and immortals apart. Orange lightning tribulation separates weak immortals from the strong, and the red lightning tribulation weeds out untalented immortals from reaching godhood.\"\n\"G-Godhood!?\"\nThis time, Tiger Swordsman, Han Meng, and the other sanctuary's elders were shocked. They looked at Leo again as they had a sick hypothesis in their mind.\n\"S-Senior Florida Man. Are you god?!\" Han Meng was the first to ask.\nLeo smirked and sarcastically replied, \"If red lightning bolts can make those Kaijus gods, then I'm probably a creator. Hell, I got killed and resurrected by black lightning bolts once. Y'all have no idea how nasty that black lightning bolts were. One direct hit is always game over.\"\n\"…\"\nThe elders failed to comprehend what Leo talked about. As for Xu Nuan, she trembled in fear and respect.\n\"T-There's another color?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Black is the strongest from what I've been through. Red and orange are merely food for me.\"I think you should take a look at\n\"…\"\nHan Hao's face lost all color. He took several deep breaths and readdressed Leo's title.\n\"T-Then, Great Venerable Florida Man, are you from a deity realm?\"\nHearing the question, Leo burst into laughter. He thought of his old world and pranked them, \"Well, probably. Considering that the Dao of Florida is eternal and their will lives within me, you can say that Florida is the land of gods.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAs soon as they heard the affirmative from Leo's mouth, all of them kneeled and prostrated to Leo. Everybody sweated profusely as they no longer dared to disrespect him or casually chat with him.\n\"Lord, sir! P-Please forgive us for the past offenses! We really didn't know that you are a deity!\"\nXu Nuan even smacked her face, \"Please forgive this insolent lady, Lord God! I-I overstepped my boundary! I shouldn't have asked you to take Yao Qiqi!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo's expression turned ugly. He thought about what he said and smacked his forehead. Correcting his mistakes, he tried to downplay his earlier sentences.\n\"Guys. That was a joke. I'm no god. I'm still a being with flesh and blood. See this?\"\nProving that he was a mortal, Leo cut the tip of his finger with his nail and showed them his transparent blood. Little did he know that transparent blood was exclusive to immortals and higher beings, who cultivated the purest element essences.\n\"C-Clear blood!?\"\n\"No, that's heaven's blood!\"\nThe elders smacked their foreheads to the floor. They firmly believed that Leo was either a high-ranking deity or someone stronger than average immortals.\nSeeing their reactions, Leo facepalmed. He thought to himself.\n'Man, why are these people so stupid? Even the homeless zombies in San Fran are smarter than you!'\n.\nBecause of the misunderstanding, Leo was treated like a king. No one dared to stand in front of Leo. Everybody still prostrated on the floor as Leo never told them to raise their heads or look up. The awkward silence continued for five minutes.\nOn the other hand, Yao Qiqi ignored the manner and clung to Leo's hand. As the adults stopped talking, she started chirping, monopolizing the conversation with Leo.\n\"Senior angel! Your dao avatar tells me that you bullied him. Did you do it?\"\n\"Dao avatar?\" Leo raised his eyebrows for a moment and remembered that he had a stalking mannequin ghost with his face. He snickered, \"Do you mean the wood mannequin spirit that has my face?\"\n\"Yes! He said that you almost killed him when he was born. He didn't understand why you bullied him when he tried to help you.\"\nThe adults eavesdropped the conversation. They looked up and sneaked a glance at Yao Qiqi, secretly praising her for initiating an interesting topic.\nLeo looked at his ring and deeply sighed. He patted Yao Qiqi's head and sat next to her.\n\"Ah, that was a misunderstanding. I didn't know that he was my dao avatar at that time. I was in a bad mood because I didn't know what gnosis was, so I kinda mistook him as a local spirit.\"\nYao Qiqi pouted, \"But you shouldn't treat him badly. You must apologize to him.\"\nLeo paused to think for a few seconds. Then, he nodded, \"Alright. I'll apologize to him. By the way, where is he?\"\nWHOOSH\nThe mannequin spirit manifested its body and stood in front of Leo. However, nobody but Leo and Yao Qiqi could see him.\nThe sentient dao avatar had a mind of its own like Thora, who was the dao avatar of Gao Yan. However, it didn't have a name as it was a newborn spirit.\nThe mannequin stared at Leo. Although his face was the same as his master's, he couldn't express himself well as he could only dully look at the other party.\nLeo gazed at his own dao avatar. He took a deep breath and deeply sighed. Then, he lowered his head, bowing while sitting.\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't know that you were my dao avatar, and I harmed you.\"\nHad it been in the past when Leo was a human, he would have never apologized to anybody. Instead, he would have made an excuse. But as he aged and lived in seclusion for years, the past mistakes always haunted him at night and when he found something nostalgic.\nIt hurt him. He wished that he could have thrown away his ego and acted like a decent human back then.\nWhen Yao Qiqi reminded Leo that he should apologize, Leo had a flashback of his Karen self when he hurt others with his words. As he didn't want to become that stupid Florida Man again, he swallowed his pride and accepted his mistakes.\nThe dao avatar flinched when Leo apologized to him. Although he was angry and dissatisfied with Leo, the dao avatar's mood got better. He sat in front of Leo and raised his fist.\nLeo noticed it. He fist-bumped the mannequin.\nWhen their fists touched, Leo finally heard the mannequin's voice clearly.\n'Learn some common sense of this world, you idiot.'\nLeo bitterly smiled, \"My bad. Yeah, I'm an idiot. By the way, are we cool?\"\n'Fine. No next time, though. If you do that to me again, I'll really ditch you.'\n\"Sorry about that. Anyway, what do you drink or eat? Tell me so I can feed you.\"\nThe mannequin finally revealed a bright smile. Then, he shocked Leo with his demand.\n'Plant me somewhere and piss on me.'\n\"…\"\nLeo awkwardly glanced at Yao Qiqi. The girl pouted and yelled at the spirit.\n\"NO BAD WORDS! What are you saying in front of a six-year-old girl?!\"\nLeo & Dao Avatar: \"…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 111 – Florida Man Evicts 100-Year-Old Elders from Nursing Home and Forces Them to Work in Sweatshop\nAfter making up with the dao avatar, Leo shifted his attention to the crowd. When he turned toward them, they gazed at Leo with sparkling eyes.\n\"V-Venerable Florida Man. Could you teach us what kind of dao you were talking about? Also, Yao Qiqi, can you see Venerable Florida Man's dao avatar?!\"\nXu Nuan had heard a myth. Soul formation cultivators and genies could see another cultivator's hidden dao avatars, thus giving them an edge in combat over regular cultivators.\nShe had long noticed that Yao Qiqi always looked at empty spaces and talked to herself a lot. Xu Nuan was finally convinced that she was one of the gifted children who could naturally see dao avatars that normal people couldn't.\nBefore Leo or Yao Qiqi could reply, the sound of footsteps came from the upper floor. Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei finally arrived.\nHua Jiashan was surprised when he saw Han Hao and others on their knees. He was even more astonished when he saw a wooden dao avatar of Leo, which he couldn't detect before.\nDongfang Mei, on the other hand, frowned at Xu Nuan and her subordinates. She stared at Leo, suspecting that he bullied her people.\n\"What's going on here?\" Dongfang Mei circulated her Qi to push her wheelchair forward.\nLeo shifted his gaze to Dongfang Mei and stroked his beard. Leo had run into the woman and Hua Jiashan a few days ago, but he forgot about her.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"I'm… Eh?\"\nDongfang Mei frowned as she noticed the dao avatar of Leo, who had the same face as him.\nThe dao avatar also looked at her. As soon as the avatar and Dongfang Mei faced each other, the former sensed the terrifying pressure of ten thousand immortal monster beasts beyond the 10th grade.\nThe mannequin spirit's aura represented the entire mystic realm. At a glance, he carried a bottomless amount of wood and earth element essence. But as Dongfang Mei looked at him carefully, she noticed his Yang Essence, which ceaselessly evolved and gave birth to new droplets of earth and wood essence droplets.\nDongfang Mei finally realized that Leo was not a mortal. No mortal's dao avatar could be this strong!\nAs Dongfang Mei already sat in a wheelchair, she couldn't kneel like the others. She lowered her head.\n\"This old woman is getting senile. Please forgive me for not recognizing you, Lord Immortal.\"\n\"Meh,\" Leo rolled his eyes as he got used to being called immortal. \"Immortal this, venerable that, make up your mind. I'm tired of having too many titles!\"\n\"T-Then, what should we call you?\"\n\"Just Florida Man is fine!\"\n\"O-Okay, senior Florida Man…\"\nLeo refused to tell them his real name. After all, he enjoyed it when people called him by that nickname. Moreover, it hid the fact that Leo had no surname.\nHe totally forgot about it. Even the system failed to search for the memory in his brain.\n\"Anyway\", Leo looked at the two leaders. Since they were together, it was the right time for business. \"I've talked to your subordinates, and I'm planning to migrate your people to my domain. I'll pay you accordingly. What do you think?\"\nHua Jiashan already heard the detail from Han Hao. He was still reluctant as his mentors and ancestors entrusted the sect to him. He couldn't simply abandon it.\nTo make sure, Hua Jiashan asked Leo, \"By migration, do you mean you will take all my sect's people? Are you trying to merge your domain with my sect, senior?\"\n\"Yes, everybody. And yes, this is a takeover.\"\n\"Including the city?\"\n\"Well, claiming the ownership of your city is too much. I only need workers, not citizens. But hey, if those people want to work for me, they have to get their resume ready. I don't have too many spots.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan bitterly smiled. He looked at his people for a moment before he shook his head.\n\"I'm sorry, Sir Florida Man. The Life Sword Sect has a long tradition and inheritance. It belongs to the sword saint, and I can't disband it. I have to refuse. Even if I have to be the only member of my sect, I cannot join you.\"\nLeo smirked. As a fellow old man, he knew exactly how other old men react when a stranger evicted them from their home. Obviously, they would always reject and resist.\nIt was not about the inheritance. Everything had to do with emotional attachment.\nLeo nodded and crossed his arms. \"But who said that I want to disband your sect. All I want is freaking manpower! Your goddamn sect can be a branch of my domain, and you can be the general manager if you want to cherish that inheritance.\"\nHua Jiashan was surprised. As long as he could protect the sect's name and continue its legacy, he had no problem with it. However, Hua Jiashan needed more insurance and detail.\n\"What about the sect's facilities and the portal, sir?\"\n\"Meh, you can still keep doing what you have been doing, but the organization structure and the personal allocation will change. Some of your workers will be assigned to my domain.\"\n\"…Oh.\"\nHua Jiashan lowered his head. He deeply sighed and lamented his powerlessness.\nHe misunderstood Leo. He thought that Leo was the same as others.\n'He's the same as Death Sword Sect and other sects. Well, this is what happens when the sect master is too weak. All my disciples and elders will be taken away, and the sect will be left abandoned in a few years. Hah…'I think you should take a look at\nBut Leo hadn't finished yet. He told Hua Jiashan the perks of merging the Life Sword Sect with his company.\n\"As compensation, I'll pay the wage of your elders, disciples, and workers. Your sect can keep whatever resources you have initially. All the wages will be essence stones.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"As for you, the chairman of the Life Sword Sect, I'll pay you for the takeover. In my world, company board directors and owners sold their SHARES of their business for money. I won't rob you of your business.\"\nWhile talking, Leo scanned through his spatial ring and searched for something to give to Hua Jiashan. He found several books, strange mirrors, and weapons in there. A few dimmed essence stones were in there as well.\nAfter coming up with an idea, Leo pulled out a ring that he stole from Situ Nantian. There were plenty of talismans, essence stones, cultivation books, and random artifacts that Leo didn't know how to use.\n\"Take this first. When we get home, I'll pay you… 100,000 essence stones for the trouble. That should be enough for you to retire, right?\"\n\"!!!\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman looked at Hua Jiashan in envy. With that many essence stones, Hua Jiashan could live in luxury for the rest of his life.\nHua Jiashan was also taken aback and surprised. He didn't expect compensation for the takeover. Still, he accepted the ring and scanned through it.\nWhen Hua Jiashan noticed the talismans and several artifacts of Situ Nantian, he sweated profusely.\n\"I-Isn't this killing array talismans of the Situ Clan? S-Sir Florida Man. How did you get these?\"\n\"Oh, that?\" Leo snickered as he thought of Situ Nantian, \"A thief tried to steal my 10th-grade monster core from me, so I blasted that mofo's hand to pieces. I got these rings from him, you see?\"\nLeo showed them the four rings on his fingers.\n\"…\"\nThe crowd went silent. Everybody's face lost all color as they connected the dots and learned something terrible.\nSitu Clan was even bigger than the Ouyang Clan. Many of their ancestors were immortals, and they sometimes visited the clan to help them. Therefore, provoking the Situ Clan was worse than provoking the Ouyang Clan.\nHua Jiashan was scared that Leo might have harmed one of the Situ Clan's elders or members to get those rings. He rescanned the spatial ring in his hand to investigate its owner.\nIt wasn't hard to find the real owner of the ring. Among the artifacts, there was a personal item of Situ Nantian in the mix.\nThe sentient fishing pole that he loved the most got stuck in the bottom of the treasures.\n\"Umm…\" Hua Jiashan pointed at the ring, \"By chance, does the ring belong to Situ Nantian, sir?\"\n\"Sitto, who? Sit on someone's face? What kind of mother names their child like that?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had no idea who Situ Nantian was, but the crowd had heard the name. It belonged to the previous Chancellor of the Imperial Court, who retired years ago. Moreover, Situ Nantian had a deep connection to the higher realm as his parents and children had already ascended.\nThe bystander of the conversation, Dongfang Mei, also had a lot of concerns. She couldn't stop sweating as this old man already poked a hornet's nest.\nThere might even be war!\nHua Jiashan facepalmed as he regretted joining Leo's pirate ship. Unfortunately, it was too late to change his mind since Leo already gave the ring to him.\nThe sect master made his decision. He took several deep breaths and voiced his thoughts, \"Are you trying to make us join you so that we can fight in your war, sir?\"\n\"What war?\" Leo scratched his face, \"What are you on about? Did you snort some coke on the way here?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nBoth Leo and Hua Jiashan were confused. The former didn't understand why Hua Jiashan mentioned war while the latter thought that Leo had everything planned.\nNoticing that Leo was clueless, Hua Jiashan tried to affirm him.\n\"Umm, you've just provoked the Situ Clan, and they have many immortal backers. If they learn about it, they will come down to hunt you down, sir.\"\n\"REALLY?!\"\nLeo's pupils dilated. He bashfully rubbed his hands and grinned from ear to ear, \"Why didn't you tell me earlier? Actually, let them come! I'll gladly welcome those idiots with a snap… I mean, with hospitality and hostility.\"\n\"…\"\n\"You know what? Y'all should be happy since I'll be HARVESTING a lot from this little… visit. I won't pay you commission for inviting idiots to my domain, though.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, back to the topic,\" Leo changed the subject. \"In case you're worried about your mystic realm portal, you can still keep it if you can. Once you migrate to my domain, you can always access my domain's portal. Oh, have I told you that there will be a permanent portal linking to this realm? There will be no requirement or limit since this planet is already mine.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei's brains couldn't digest all the information at once. Their eyes span, and their minds went blank.\nWhile the crowd was silent, Leo kept talking. He briefly explained the payment, working days, and employee welfare.",

However, he asked Leo if he could keep operating the Life Sword Sect as a sword school, which Leo had no issue with that.\nLeo turned to Dongfang Mei, wondering if she would be interested to join him.\n\"What about you? Will you move your sanctuary to my territory? We have a permanent mystic realm portal, and we have essence stones.\"\nDongfang Mei bitterly smiled. She had seen many men soliciting her and her people for their selfish agenda. From her perspective, Leo was similar to those men.\nStill, Dongfang Mei could tell the differences between lecherous old men and sincere ones. Leo had a weird playful and naïve demeanor, which young boys usually had. She didn't detect any lewd air from him.\nAs Dongfang Mei hadn't known Leo for long enough, she planned to wait and see. The elder raised her finger and was about to decline the offer.\n\"SMASH!!\"\nA certain weird unicorn interrupted their conversation. The loud voice of Taxi came from a distance, followed by a thunderous noise of an explosion.\nA shockwave of the explosion hit the pagoda. The entire structure trembled while dust fell from the ceiling. Everybody stopped talking. Then, they looked through the windows, gazing at the north.\nFar of a distance, Taxi had been fighting with a flying black caiman. As both creatures could use thunder and lightning, their fight was loud.\nLeo deeply sighed as he recognized the unicorn. Worrying that the horse might lose, he rubbed his ring and searched for the red flying sword.\n\"Hmm? Ah, silly me. I forgot.\"\nHe forgot that he jumped off the sword. It was not in his spatial ring. In addition, Leo had no clue how to retrieve it remotely.\nWhile rumbling through the pocket space in his spatial rings, Leo found the spare handgun that he had purchased earlier. He also had a magazine full of rubber bullets.\nAs Leo couldn't go there to help Taxi, he could at least provide a covering fire. He pulled out his handgun and unlocked the safety. Then, he took aim.\nDongfang Mei, Hua Jiashan, and the elders were curious about Leo's newest artifact as they had never seen it before. The pistol's structure, shape, and utility were foreign to them.\nWHOOSH\nLeo charged the pistol with his Qi thread. Like before, it emitted rainbow light.\nHe measured the distance and calculated the caiman's movement speed. Unfortunately, they were at least 200 kilometers away from the pagoda, and it seemed impossible to accurately hit anything.\nLeo pondered if he should just YOLO and fire it. He pursed his lips and lowered his gun.\n\"Senior, what are you doing?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\nLeo took a deep breath and ignored the crowd. He silently ordered his system.\n'Upgrade the gun to level 8.'\n<Affirmative.>\nThe gun's appearance remained the same. However, the materials of the pistol were no longer polymer or metal. The alloy transformed into something else entirely, which didn't exist on Earth.\nLeo rubbed the CZ 75 in his hand and sensed the similarity between his blood and the mysterious gun frame.\n'This should do it.'\nBetting on the newly upgraded pistol, Leo aimed again. This time, he filled the rubber round with his Qi threads until it was full.\nHe pulled the trigger.\nPSHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUU\nThe weird sound of the pistol was the only thing everybody heard before Leo took one step backward because of the absurd recoil.\nBecause of the whizzed noise and Leo's action, nobody paid attention to the result of the shot, except Leo.\n\"Senior, umm, can you explain what you have been doing?\" Again, Hua Jiashan wished to learn more about the artifact in Leo's hands.\nLeo deeply sighed and gazed at the smoking pistol. It was overheated, and the entire gun frame was bright red. He then looked up and checked the result.\nThe rubber round was indeed fired.  However, no explosion or flashy atomic bomb erupted.\n'Weird. I thought I would have fired a laser beam or Death Star's cannon. This thing seems lackluster…'\nBOOOOOOOOM\nWhen Leo gave up on the gun, a rainbow light flashed from the north. The explosion was round and small, but the light was too bright.\nA small white hole was created, which repelled every object nearby outward and emanated blinding light.\nAll elders either covered or closed their eyes as they couldn't see through the light. Only Leo brazenly gazed into the blinding flashbang of his little bomb. His pupils were so small that they almost disappeared.\n\"Odd.\"\nLeo put the gun away and walked to a window to get a better look. He stood there for several minutes.\nIt took ten minutes before the light subsided. When the rainbow light faded from the sky, everybody could open their eyes to see the result.\n\"What happened?\"\nThe elders rushed to the windows to gaze toward the north, where Leo had launched a mysterious object toward that location.\nThe horned caiman was gone. Rather, it was evaporated to nothingness. The white hole also vanished and left behind the remnant of carnage and the destruction power of an immortal.\n\"SMASH T-T\"\nThe unicorn wobbly flew toward the pagoda. Its speed was a lot slower than usual as it only sprinted in the sky with the speed of sound.\nWhen Taxi got closer, Leo noticed something hilarious. He burst into laughter.\nThe white gorgeous unicorn was charred black. Instead of calling him a graceful unicorn, he became a \"Nightmare\".\n\"Ay, yo, Taxi! I didn't know you were black. I always thought you were white!\"\nTaxi approached the pagoda and entered it through a window. He glanced at Leo and snorted.\n\"SMASH!! D:\"\n\"No, I didn't mean to sound racist, but boy, you look gorgeous in black!\"\n\"SMASH!!! D:<\"\n\"Sorry, sorry. I won't use that term anymore. Anyway…\"\nLeo giggled and pointed his finger and Taxi. He ordered his cancer cells to use water element essence and Qi to produce fresh water.\nPHOOSH\nHis fingers became high-pressured water hose. They sprayed beams of water and wiped away the black dust that dirtied Taxi's skin.\nTaxi smiled and let Leo bathe him. A few minutes later, he was cleaned.\n\"Done!\"\nLeo pointed one of his fingers at his mouth and drank a few gulps of water. Then, he disabled the water jet stream ability.\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"You're welcome, boy.\"\n\"Smash!\"\nTaxi nudged his head at Leo's face. The latter also patted the horse.I think you should take a look at\nWhile petting the pony, Leo recalled that he hadn't finished the deal yet. He turned around to resume the topic.\n\"Umm, sorry for the distraction. Anyway, Ma'am. Will your sanctuary move to my domain?\"\n\"…\"\nDongfang Mei looked back and forth between Leo and Taxi. The corners of her mouth curved up. Even Xu Nuan and others began to giggle as they figured out the nature of Leo's character.\nNot only the unicorns loved virgin men and women, but they also followed people with pure hearts. If this unicorn showed affection toward Leo, the latter couldn't be a vile old man.\nDongfang Mei stopped being on guard. If this unicorn was this obedient, then she could trust Leo.\n\"Senior Florida Man, our Amazonian Sanctuary will move to your domain. We will migrate the outer disciples, initiates, and children to your domain first to build a shelter for us. Then, we'll plan about future projects later.\"\nHearing that Dongfang Mei approved of the merge, Leo was overjoyed. With more workers, he could expand his farms beyond the boundary of his domain.\n\"Alright! Well, for now, you should bring your people back to your sect and sanctuary. We can come back to this mystic realm whenever we want anyway.\"\nHua Jiashan, Han Hao, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, and the other elders brightly smiled as they no longer had to be cautious about the time limit and the quota anymore. They bowed to Leo and bid farewell. Yao Qiqi also said goodbye to Leo and followed her mentor back.\n.\nAfter the group was gone, Leo wiped his sweat and deeply sighed.\nThe day was long. At first, he almost fought Xu Nuan for trying to give him Yao Qiqi. Fortunately, they cleared up the misunderstandings, and Leo managed to persuade them to merge their sects with his future company.\n'I'm done with this quest. I should go back and check the store.'\nLeo thought of Cat and the hundred unicorn friends of Taxi. He was concerned that the little plant girl might get bullied by those nasty ponies.\n\"Taxi, can you help me find my lost flying sword? I dropped it somewhere in the town.\"\n\"Smash?\"\n\"Yeah, I don't know how to pilot flying swords. Wait, what do you mean by \"Marking the artifact\"?\"\n\"Smash? Smash!\"\nTaxi smirked and mocked Leo for being stupid. He then explained how human cultivators and monster beasts could claim ownership of magic items, artifacts, and treasures by using their Qi and essence.\nSimilar to spatial rings, artifacts of this world could be locked and branded. Only a stronger cultivator or the owners could erase the brands and make the artifacts their own. Once branded with their Qi, new owners could remotely summon them with a thought.\nAfter learning the new information, Leo was inspired. He slapped Taxi's leg to thank him.\n\"Man, what could I do without your advice? You're really helpful, dude.\"\n\"Smash :E\"\nTaxi showed Leo his ugly smile once again.\n.\nAfter retrieving the missing flying sword with Taxi's help, Leo rode on the horse's back, heading back to the starting point.\nWhen Leo arrived at the campsite, Gao Yan was no longer around. Only Wu Buyi was present. However, he looked exhausted for a certain reason. His cheeks sank, and there were black rings under his eyes. In addition, his right arm was strangely swelled as if he only used it to work out for a long period.\nLeo gave Wu Buyi a disgusted look.\n\"Did you have fun, Wu Buyi?\"\nWu Buyi snapped back to his senses. Although exhausted, he smiled at Leo and kowtowed.\n\"My lord! Your artifact is amazing! I've learned a lot from this artifact! I no longer need women anymore!\"\nLeo facepalmed, regretting that he accidentally corrupted this alchemist.\n\"Don't overdo it.\"\n\"Haha! Don't worry, my lord. We, cultivators, are not like commoners! Normal men can only do it once or twice a day on average, but cultivators like us can squeeze a hundred rounds with ease!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo silently gazed at Wu Buyi's shelter. Although he couldn't see inside, his nose already caught the unpleasant scent from the deeds.\nNot wanting to continue discussing the private activity, Leo changed the subject.\n\"Where is Gao Yan?\"\n\"Oh,\" Wu Buyi finally remembered that he left Gao Yan alone for too long. He looked around, but he couldn't find him.\nUpon realizing that Gao Yan was not in the camp, Wu Buyi sweated profusely.\n\"Umm, senior. Do you know where Gao Yan is?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo quietly pulled out a paper fan and smacked Wu Buyi's head.\n\"THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ANSWER MY QUESTION, NOT ASK ME THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU!\"\n\"EEP! I'M SORRY!\"\nLeo smacked Wu Buyi a few more times as this idiot needed some whipping.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan strolled in the forest, following the instructions of his sentient dao avatar.\nThe spirit girl brought Gao Yan across the south river and entered a secret cave, where another ruin was located. Thora pointed at the cave and narrated the backstory of her ancestor.\n'This was the place where the previous lightning element spirit queen resided. She was also the creator of those lewd unicorns and horned caimans.'\n\"Wow.\"\n'And under this cave, we also hid a great artifact. Follow me. I'll show you something good!'\n\"Okay, okay. Don't rush!\"\nThe two entered the cave together. A few minutes later, Gao Yan walked through the natural cave and descended to the underground level.\nWalking further into the underground cave, Gao Yan discovered an underground area. The underground dome was 20 meters tall and covered 20,000 square meters.\nThere was also something in the middle.\nραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm \"T-This!!\"\nGao Yan stopped his feet as he gazed at the gigantic metal saucer structure in the middle of the dome room.\nHad Leo been there, he would have screamed in shock. It was an alien spaceship!\nThora flew into the mysterious alien ship.\nPSHOOOSH\nA few seconds later, a portion of the ship moved, opening a door for Gao Yan to get in.\n'Come in, master. I know an artifact that you can use.'",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 113 – Florida Teen Discovers Real Lightsaber in Alien Spaceship and Claims Ownership. Star Wars Fans Riots.\nEntering the alien spaceship, Gao Yan found an airtight room. After entering it, the gate behind him closed, trapping him inside.\nAir was sucked out, and the walls sprayed Gao Yan with white fume. He coughed as he accidentally inhaled some of the fumes.\nWHOOSH\nA new door was open, revealing Thora on the other side. While floating, she waved her hand and invited Gao Yan in.\n'Come in! Follow me!'\n\"O-Okay?\"\nGao Yan looked around and admired the interior of the spaceship. The passage was narrow, but the ceiling was high. Only one person could walk through the corridor at a time.\nAlong the way, Gao Yan noticed a few sealed metal doors. At the top right corner of each door, strange labels told Gao Yan what the room was for. However, he could not read the language.\nHe looked up and stared at the thin line of glasses. They were the only source of light in here. Despite being in a sealed area, the air wasn't stale, and Gao Yan could feel the airflow.\n\"This place is strange. There is no window, but I smell fresh air.\"\nFollowing Thora, Gao Yan took a left turn and walked along the passageway. At the end of the walkway, Gao Yan found another closed metal door.\n'Here! The artifact is stored here!'\nGao Yan nodded and touched the door. However, it didn't open.\nThora giggled and pointed at the glowing green glass on a pedestal next to the wall.\n'Touch that first. Inject your lightning element Qi into the glass, and it should recognize you.'\n\"Really?\"\nGao Yan turned toward the console panel near the wall. He tried as Thora had instructed him.\nBEEP\nThe console panel turned red. The monitor on the panel also showed a message that Gao Yan couldn't read.\n<Access Denied.>\nThora frowned. She floated toward the panel.\n'Odd. A few days ago, it still recognized anyone with lightning Qi.'\nShe put her hand on the panel and tested it.\nBEEP\n<Access Denied.>\n'Huh?' Thora was confused. Her expression turned ugly, 'Why?! It still worked when a few days ago!'\nShe tried it for the second time. However, it prompted an additional message, which only Thora could read.\n<Access Denied. The engine room will be temporarily locked for security measures.>\n'WHAT?!' Thora was frustrated and discharged static electricity around her. Branches of light flashed and hit the ceiling and the walls.\nAs Thora was afraid of losing face, she rushed into the room, phasing through the metal door.\nGao Yan had no idea what went wrong as he had never seen a spaceship before. He scratched his head and patiently waited for the sentient element spirit to return.\nTwo minutes passed.\nTen minutes passed.\n30 minutes went by, and Thora finally walked through the door and returned to Gao Yan's side. She was crestfallen.\n'I'm so sorry, master.'\nGao Yan tilted his head and wryly smiled, \"I don't know what's going on. Did something happen?\"\n'Well, yes. The place no longer recognizes me or visitors as guests anymore. I tried to unlock the door from the other side, but it said that we need permission from the new owner of this realm.'\n\"New owner of this realm? Who?\"\n'That… I don't know. As a matter of fact, I'm as confused as you, master.'\nThora was sad. In the engine room, there was a large soul stone, which provided endless energy for the spaceship. She planned to let Gao Yan consume it so that he would obtain some life force and energy.\nSoul stones were the upgraded version of essence stones. Immortals and immortal beasts usually nested around them as they never stopped producing element essence for them to cultivate and consume. A finger-sized soul stone could provide 1000-essence-stone's worth of energy while a bigger one contained more.\nAs Thora couldn't bring the massive soul stone to Gao Yan with her power, she could only blame her bad luck.\nMeanwhile, Gao Yan had no clue about soul stones or any potential treasure. He snickered.\n\"It's fine. I'm glad you worry about me. Well, since we can't take it, we should check somewhere else. Maybe, we can find the owner of this place and get his permission.\"\nThora pouted, 'I doubt the owner would give it to us.'\n\"Haha. True. Anyway, what about the spirit queen? Where did she live? You mentioned her before.\"\n'Oh, right! This way. Follow me.'\n\"Is she still alive?\"\n'She already ascended to heaven realm. She's beyond the immortal realm now.'\n\"Wow. So, she's a deity? She's an elemental goddess now?\"\n'Hehe. You can say that.'\nThora puffed her chest as she was proud of her spirit queen. She forgot to watch her steps and phased through a wall by an accident. She quickly came back and resumed guiding Gao Yan to another room.\nAfter walking 100 meters, Thora stood in front of another sealed door. Above the door, a label was written in English.\nHydroponics Lab\nThora glanced at the label and sighed. She missed her kin and her sisters back home.\nUnlike the engine room, the hydro lab's door was automatic. It opened when Gao Yan got close.\nGao Yan and Thora were relieved. Entering the lab, Gao Yan found an oxygen power plant. Arrays of greeneries, such as algae, vegetables, and fruit plants, were sealed in glass tubes. They were lined up in rows and columns, which occupied 70% of the room.\nAt the center of the room, the largest tube was empty. However, the bottom of the glass tube was charred as if something wrong had happened in there.\nThora phased through the glass tube and floated inside. She introduced her home.\n'This is where I and the previous spirit queen lived. Isn't this place lovely?'\nGao Yan looked around in astonishment. He had never seen someone storing random plants, moss, and green patches in a container before.\n\"But aren't these grasses worthless? I'm an alchemist. Those things in the glasses are just common plants and moss. We can find these everywhere in a moist area.\"\nThora pouted, 'But they were essential for our former masters. They used these so they could breathe, you know?'\n\"But cultivators and immortals don't need to breathe, right? We can survive without air for months if we want to hold our breath.\"\n'You're stupid, master. This place is a guesthouse for air-breathing creatures like regular humans and beasts. Without these plants, there would have been no air!'\n\"Huh?\"\nThora changed the topic. She phased through the center glass and pointed at a small metal stick, which was buried under the plants.\n'Since we can't get you the soul stone, you should be able to use that. Pick that up, master.'\nGao Yan looked at the plant and found a metallic hilt or a handle of something. He pulled it off the grass and removed the dirt. Then, he inspected the item.\nThe white cylinder-shaped hilt was two-inch thick and one foot long. Gao Yan gripped it, and he found it perfect for his hand. Strangely, there was a flip button on it, but the button was broken.\nThora looked at the cylinder hilt's button and frowned. She grumbled, 'I guess this is busted, too. What a shame.'\n\"What is this, Thora?\"\n'A sword.'\n\"A sword?\"\n'An artifact that immortals can kill for, master. Oh, I know that the button is broken, but can you try injecting your lightning Qi into it? Maybe, we can reactivate it with your Qi instead of using its internal energy.'\n\"…\"\nGao Yan nodded and injected his Qi into it. Then, he started feeling the suction force, drawing in his energy and Qi.\nA second later, the suction power intensified. Gao Yan felt like his blood gathered in his hand, which was holding the object.\nBZZZZ\nHe regretted injecting his Qi into it. The mysterious cylinder hilt drained 90% of his Qi within seconds, and it demanded more. Even Thora sensed the crisis.\n'Master, I'm sorry! Stop!'\nGao Yan gritted his teeth and let go of the hilt. Taking two steps back, Gao Yan stared at the artifact while holding his right hand.\nThe palm, which held the hilt earlier, was burnt. A layer of his skin came off, and faint smoke emanated from his heated hand.\nThe artifact glowed in green light. A small panel on the bottom of the hilt glowed and showed strange symbols, which represented numbers.\nThora read the number and giggled, 'Master, you barely charged the artifact. You need to do it 99 more times.'\n\"Huh?! I need to do that again?!\"\n'Well, yes. It runs out of battery. We need to fuel it with lightning Qi until it's full so that we can repair the artifact.'\nThora also tried to touch the hilt, but her hands went through it. She pouted as she couldn't contribute to the object's battery.\n'But I think it should be enough for demonstration. Master, pick it up again and try to press into the hole over here.'\n\"…\"\nGao Yan was reluctant this time. Yet, he picked it up and looked at the broken switch.\nIts switch was missing. However, Gao Yan used his nails and finger to press inside the object.\n'Oh, by the way, master. If I were you, I would point the tip and the bottom of that thing away from your body… Whoops.'\nThe warning came too late. Gao Yan successfully activated the artifact.\nA distinctive hum echoed in the room. Green beams came from the top and the bottom of the hilt.\nFFFFFSSSKKRRRSH\n\"OW!\"\nThe beam of the lightsaber staff slightly grazed Gao Yan's arm by accident. He dropped it on the ground for the second time.\nFFSSHEEEW\nThe lightsaber was deactivated.\nGao Yan widened his eyes and looked at Thora. He was shocked by the tool.\n\"WHAT WAS THAT?!\"\nThora smirked and laughed at Gao Yan, 'A staff sword, master. You are also a swordsman, right? This artifact should suit you. Use this and the gun that the senior gave you, you should be invincible under the immortal realm. Oh, have I told you that this sword staff can also kill 10th-grade monster beasts and low-rank immortals?'",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 114 – NSA Agents Files Lawsuit against Florida Man for Riding Unicorn into Area 51\nFloating over Leo's camp was Wu Buyi. He scanned the forest with his Qi, searching for Gao Yan's whereabouts. He also brought out a life candle of the disciple, holding it and gazing at the flame.\nThe life candle's fire fluttered and flickered as the strong wind in the sky threatened to blow it. The west wind hit Wu Buyi's face. However, the tip of the flame didn't point toward the east according to the wind.\nIt pointed south.\nWu Buyi smiled as he finally found where Gao Yan went. He put the candle away and descended. After landing on the ground, Wu Buyi reported his findings to Leo.\n\"My lord. I've found my disciple. He's just south of here.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Just go and find him, then. He's your disciple, so it's your responsibility.\"\n\"O-Of course. I'll go fetch him right away. B-But, my lord. I'm afraid of the local beasts. They're a lot stronger than me. Could you go with me?\"\nLeo had already scared most of the dangerous animals away, and it was impossible for Wu Buyi to get ambushed. Seeing how useless Wu Buyi was, Leo deeply sighed.\n\"Lead the way. I'll follow you.\"\n\"Okay!\"\nWu Buyi brought out Gao Yan's life candle again and followed the flame. Leo hopped on Taxi's back and patted the horse.\n\"Follow him.\"\n\"Smash!\"\nThe group flew south to the area that they had never explored before.\n.\nWhile riding Taxi, Leo opened the system's domain menu and checked the map.\nBEEP\nAs Leo had expected, a green dot, which represented Gao Yan, was only 10 kilometers south of the camp. With Taxi's speed, they should reach the destination in a minute.\nUnfortunately, Wu Buyi was slow. Because of the slowpoke, Taxi decreased his speed to match him.\nAs Leo was bored sitting and doing nothing, he fiddled with the upgraded handgun. He also rechecked the remaining rubber bullets in the magazine.\nCLICK\nHe reloaded the pistol and looked around, searching for something to shoot for fun. However, no creature was in sight.\nNoticing that no one was there to entertain him, Leo put the gun away. He admired the scenery instead.\nIn the south, it was close to the edge of the continent. The land was mostly covered in rainforests and small hills. A large river cut through the south mountain range, creating a mysterious passage toward the sea.\nAside from the canyon, no other landmark was noteworthy.\nAs there was nothing to do, Leo gazed at the forest. He changed his mindset and thought of a way to use this world.\n'A farmland? Eh, no. I shouldn't clear the entire forest. I should leave some for the local beasts and the future tourists. I can collect entrance fees from the visitors and let them play there. Since this will be a tourist spot, I shouldn't build a warehouse around here to attract looters. Another branch of a convenience store or a tavern is better. Oh, can I build a livestock shed here?'\nThinking of the building, Leo tested his domain system if he could build anything in this world.\nDING\nSurprisingly, he could.\n\"!!!\"\nLeo almost stood up. He pressed the domain map menu to see the grid map. A new window popped up in front of him.\nThe entire continent was within Leo's territory!\n\"…Too bad.\"\nUnfortunately, every grid had a lock icon on them. When Leo pressed the lock icons, the system prompted him with a message.\n<Please activate a permanent portal from your Mystic Realm Portal first.>\nIn short, Leo had to return to the other world before he could use this function.\nLeo found it fair. Having a minor condition might be inconvenient, but it was insignificant to him. He planned to go back and update the portal platform anyway.\nWhile Leo was absentminded, Wu Buyi reached the destination. He pointed at a cave near a hill.\n\"Over there, my lord!\"\nLeo came back to his senses. He looked at the hill and frowned.\nIt was strangely round. Rather, it looked like a dome instead of a natural mountain or hill. Moreover, no tree or plant grew on this bald hill.\nTaxi and Wu Buyi landed on the ground. Leo jumped off the horse and walked toward the dome-like hill. Then, he leaped on top of it.\n\"Umm, my lord. The cave entrance is over here,\" Wu Buyi pointed at the natural cave, which led a path into the hill.\nLeo ignored Wu Buyi and stared at the green grass under his feet. He took his shoes off and touched them with his skin.\nNo grass mutated upon touch.\nSeeing the result, Leo frowned. He pulled a stalk of grasses to see up close. Then, he put one in his mouth and chewed it.\nIt tasted like plastic!\nThis was not natural grass. It was artificial!\nLeo spat the plastic grass and threw the fake stalk away. He squatted and began uprooting the other grasses.\nAs Leo pulled harder, a square patch of fake ground and grasses came off, revealing the structure of a dome underneath.\n\"Hohoh?\"\nLeo smiled at the hidden metallic dome under the fake grasses. Finding it interesting, Leo peeled the other square patches and threw them away.\nSeeing that Leo did something interesting, Taxi jumped on the dome and helped Leo peel the cover. As for Wu Buyi, he watched the duo in silence.\nWith two workers working together, Leo and Taxi managed to remove artificial grasses and fake dirt from the dome. When they finished, Leo sat on Taxi's back and ordered it to hover over it.\nLooking at it from above, Leo's smile widened. He smirked at the structure as he had a rough idea of what it was.\nThe dome reminded him of a stadium's roof or a cover of an underground missile silo in sci-fi movies. Leo leaned toward the latter as a distinctive line, which split the dome in half, could be seen from above. It was obvious that the dome should be able to open in half and release whatever was under it.\n\"Well, well, well. What do we have here? I thought I'm in a fantasy world, but I've found a trace of high-tech civilization. What a combination!\"\nLeo rubbed his hands and jumped down. He landed on top of the dome, after which he sat and rubbed the metal surface. Then, he lightly knocked it.\nDONG-DONG\nThe dome was slightly dented, but it produced a crisp sound like a giant bell.\nAgain, Leo rubbed his hands. He looked forward to seeing an ICBM missile or a modern silo underground.\n\"Lead the way, Wu Buyi! I'll follow you.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi was confused, but he nodded. He sneaked glances at the metal dome as he found it weird. In his mind, he thought about the ruins of other civilizations that he always saw in other mystic realms.\n\"Eh, it's just one of those ruins. Since it's made of metal, I bet it's another fire or metal type. I wonder what kind of artifact we can scavenge from this place,\" Wu Buyi muttered and proceeded into the natural cave.\nTaxi was also curious. It followed Wu Buyi into the cave first.\nLeo walked after them and licked his lips. But before he entered the cave, he paused and opened the domain system's map.\nOn the map, a group of ten red dots gathered at his campsite. Another 10 red dots were also 500 meters north of Leo's current location.\nNoticing the guests, Leo turned around. He was about to go back and welcome the uninvited visitors. But the next second, Leo smacked his forehead as he remembered that he couldn't collect the compensation or lifespan until he properly build the permanent portal at the platform.\n\"Man. Consider yourself lucky. If you leave me alone, I'll leave you alone.\"\nLeo turned around and entered the cave. He prayed that those people wouldn't mess with his exit portal and them.\n.\n.\n500 meters away from the artificial hill's cave was a group of the second prince's expedition team. As for the other group at Leo's camp, they were the first prince's team. The first prince and the second prince were with their teammates, and they formed an alliance to work together in this realm.\nThe second prince was led by Yan Long, the second prince himself. He brought his aide and servants over to search for treasures and usable herbs.\nSo far, the second prince managed to defeat two cockatrices. They also kept their corpses in the prince's spatial ring. Aside from the monster subjugation, they managed to harvest a ton of useful herbs in the forest.\nWhile searching for more herbs and goodies, Yan Long's group discovered Leo's trace by chance and had been following him. They found Leo's den, but they didn't get anything useful from the camp. Thus, they abandoned the camp and left it to the first prince's party to search next.\nAfter following Leo, they soon caught up to him and his team.\n\"Your Highness, that old man with the thunder unicorn has just entered a ruin. Should we follow them?\" Yan Long's aide informed his master.\nYan Long looked like a man in his mid-30s. He had a trimmed full beard, and his long black hair was tied and hidden under a gold pheasant headwear on top of his head. Despite having a dandy beard, his narrow eyes and thin eyebrows made him look like a cunning character in anime. Because of his narrow eyes, his handsomeness was degraded by a tier.\nHis gold armor was the symbol of the royal family. The left shoulder guard was in the shape of a dragon's head while the right had the face of a tiger. However, they emanated the aura of an immortal as an immortal blacksmith refined the armor for him.\nWith the armor, Yan Long was confident in his survivability against a quasi-immortal. In addition, he also had the deadliest talismans from the Situ Clan, which was capable of killing any non-immortal of this world.\nBecause of his confidence, Yan Long made a bold decision.\n\"Follow them into the ruin. If they somehow find a good treasure, we'll use our status to extract their spatial rings and their loot. But if they aren't that interesting, we'll just give an excuse that we accidentally run into them and leave them alone.\"\n\"Do we have to fight, your highness?\"\n\"Probably not. They only have two people – One nascent soul and one quasi-immortal. We have 10 soul transformation cultivators on our side and the immortal killing array talismans. If we have to fight, we can't lose.\"\n\"…\"\nThe subordinates still hesitated. However, the prince already flew toward the hill.\nWithout a choice, the aide and the soldiers followed their master to the dome.\n.\n.\nUsing the life candle, Wu Buyi beelined toward Gao Yan's location. After walking for five minutes, he was in front of a weird metal saucer structure.\nTaxi and Leo reached the place later. But when Leo noticed the UFO-like spaceship, he exclaimed.\n\"YEEHAW! We hit the jackpot!\"\nWu Buyi wryly smiled as he was confused, \"How so, my lord?\"\n\"It depends on that ship's technology levels. If it surpasses my old world, we're in for gold. But if it's inferior to the spaceship I came from, it might be useless.\"\n\"Sa-Pace-Ship?\" Wu Buyi couldn't pronounce the word.\nLeo stepped forward and walked closer to the spaceship. However, there was no gate or entrance for them to enter. The gang began rubbing and knocking the metal, looking for a way to enter it.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 115 – Florida Man Riding Unicorn on Highway While Fleeing from Area 51's Military Tanks Gets Caught on Video\nWu Buyi was clueless about technology. Thus, it was natural that he failed to figure out a way to enter. As for Leo, he had a better understanding of science, but he couldn't find a device or clue.\nAfter fiddling with the ship's surface for an hour, both men gave up looking for a way in. They gathered in front of the spaceship, looking at the ceiling and the underground interior.\n\"Should I just smash it?\" Leo rubbed his chin. He wondered if he should crack the ship open and brute-force his way in.\nWu Buyi brought out the life candle of Gao Yan and rechecked the latter's location.\nThe flame's tip pointed at the spaceship. Obviously, Gao Yan was inside.\n\"Is he abducted or captured?\" Wu Buyi was concerned.\nLeo opened the domain's mini-map and found a green dot in front of him. He pressed the system screen and zoomed in. Then, the system mini-map showed the portrait of Gao Yan, who was moving from the center of the ship toward them.\n\"Nah, I don't think so.\" Leo closed his system map, \"He should be coming out soon.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Any minute now.\"\nThe men gazed at the spaceship and silently waited.\nTOK-TOK\nWhile they waited, they heard the footsteps of people coming from the passageway behind them. Taxi and Wu Buyi looked back, but Leo remained unfazed.\nYan Long and his entourage entered the cave and caught up to them.\nWu Buyi gulped as he couldn't measure their cultivation base and strength. He roughly figured that they were at least the soul formation stage at the minimum. Because of the strength gap, Wu Buyi took three steps back and hid behind Leo and Taxi.\nTaxi, on the other hand, glanced at the people and scoffed. A 9th-stage thunder unicorn like him was capable of killing newborn immortals, so 10 soul transformation cultivators were nothing to him. Moreover, Leo, who was stronger than Taxi, was here. The pony believed there was nothing to fear.\nAs for Leo, he didn't think much of the group. As long as they weren't as stupid as Situ Nantian, Ouyang Long, and Ouyang Ting, he was willing to spare them.\nMeanwhile, the second prince finally got to see Leo. His eyes swept around the room and scanned through the transparent dao avatar of Wu Buyi and Leo.\nWu Buyi's hidden dao avatar was a fire spirit and a cauldron. As their strength was limited to the nascent soul stage, Yan Long scoffed and ignored them. He checked Taxi's dao avatar next.\nUpon sensing Taxi's aura and his dao avatar, Yan Long smacked his lips. He ordered his men.\n\"Tsk. 9th-rank thunder unicorn. Men, abort the plant. Don't do anything stupid.\"\nLeo and others overheard that. The former snorted in disgust while Wu Buyi was relieved. As for Taxi, he sneered at the group of cowards and looked away.\nYan Long flinched as he noticed the disdain in Taxi and Leo's eyes. His expression turned cold as he held a grudge against Leo for looking down on them.\nThe second prince exerted his authority.\n\"My name is Yan Long, the second prince of the Yan Empire. Senior, this ruin is now under the jurisdiction of the imperial court. Our forces will escort you out, and we'll take the risks exploring this ruin in your stead.\"\nWu Buyi's face was as white as a sheet as he was afraid of the imperial court and the royalty. He tugged Taxi's mane, begging the horse to protect him.\nTaxi and Leo didn't bother looking at the group. Because Yan Long was rude, Leo had no reason to feed the troll or interact with them. The man and horse continued waiting for Gao Yan to come out.\nNoticing that he was ignored, Yan Long's eyes reddened in anger. He crossed his hands behind his back, but he secretly summoned immortal killing talismans from his spatial rings.\n\"Senior, I'll say this again. We will take over the responsibility of exploring this ruin. You don't need to waste your precious time on something unknown. This isn't our first time dealing with the remnant of a lost civilization.\"\nFinally, Yan Long uttered something interesting. Leo stroked his beard and turned around.\n\"Did you say this isn't your first time?\"\n\"Correct,\" Yan Long sneered. \"I bet you don't know how to access that building.\"\nLeo suddenly burst into laughter, \"Building, you say? PFFT, yeah, right. BUILDING! FUHAHAHAHA!!\"\n\"…\"\nBlood gathered in Yan Long's face, and he clenched his fists. He almost activated the talismans because of anger, but he held it in.\n\"Would you like me to continue being courteous, or would you like me to be more direct?\" Yan Long glanced at his men and gestured for them to prepare to attack if necessary.\nLeo turned toward them and crossed his arms. He walked 10 steps, approaching the arrogant prince.\n\"Stop being a hypocrite and say it to my face, kid.\"\n\"Very well.\"\nYan Long smirked and walked 10 steps forward, challenging Leo. As they got close their height difference was more noticeable.\nLeo was 6'3 while Yan Long was only 5'11. Even though the prince seemed bulky because of his armor, Leo seemed more aesthetic as his refined muscle looked better underneath the robes.\nIn short, Leo's size alone won the unspoken charisma contest.\nNoticing how Leo was taller and bigger, Yan Long narrowed his eyes for a moment. He then replied in a crisp voice.\n\"What I'm trying to say is… Scram or die, idiot.\"\n\"That's a lot better.\"\nLeo snickered and took off his rubber gloves. He patted Yan Long's head and leaned closer. Then, he whispered.\n\"Unfortunately, you're already dead, boy.\"\n\"Is that so? BUT THE DEAD PERSON IS YOU!!\" Yan Long sneered. The next moment, his hands brought two immortal killing talismans and slapped them on Leo's cheeks.\nPA!\nThe two yellowish talismans turned red. Then, they vanished into Leo's skin.\nYan Long laughed and kicked the ground, retreating three steps, \"You're dead, quasi-immortal! Those talismans are made to kill immortals. They will destroy your dantian and deplete your life force! No matter how strong you are, you're still a mortal! Now, if you kowtow to me and beg to be my slave, I might change my mind and save you!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows, amused. He slowly pulled the CZ pistol out from his spatial ring and unlocked the safety. While he rechecked the ammo, he counted the time.\n\"Five… Six… Seven…\"\nWhile counting, Leo also sensed the movements of the infiltrating talismans. They acted like parasites, moving through his blood veins and traveling toward his stomach.\nHad Leo been a regular cultivator, he would have panicked. Unfortunately, parasites and poison couldn't harm evolved cancer cells and their favorite host.\nTransparent blood cells swarmed the talismans like hungry zombies. They devoured the moving parasites until the foreign objects vanished.\nDING\n<You have digested Immortal Dantian Destruction Talismans. Your lifespan has increased by 6,000 years.>\nThe system message stunned Leo. He almost forgot to continue counting. While counting down Yan Long's death, Leo asked the prince if he had more juicy food for his cancer cells to digest.\n\"Eight… Nine… Hey, do you have more of those? Twelve… Thirteen.\"\nYan Long frowned. Ignoring Leo, he raised his hand and gestured to his men.\n\"Use your talismans. Ignore this fool and get rid of the unicorn. We'll dissect it and harvest its monster core.\"\nHearing the order, the nine soul transformation cultivators smirked and pulled out their talismans.\nLeo stopped counting after it reached 15 seconds. He looked at Yan Long's long black hair, which already turned white and slowly fell off. In addition, the prince's youthful skin rapidly wrinkled and dried.\nStrangely, Yan Long hadn't realized it yet.\nLeo was amused once again as someone finally endured the mutation for more than 15 seconds. To celebrate this occasion, Leo let them witness a firework.\nThe pistol's muzzle pointed at the aide next to the prince. He carefully injected threads of Qi into rubber bullets in the magazine. However, he didn't notice that his mannequin dao avatar merged with his body and poured some wood element essence into it.\n\"DIEEEE!!\"\nThe nine men jumped and lunged at Taxi, ignoring Leo.\nLeo sighed, but his right hand followed the men's movements. Without looking, Leo pulled the trigger.\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nNine consecutive fires came out, followed by echoing gunshot sounds. Within one second, Leo shot nine times.\nHe didn't notice that the rubber bullet heads transformed into tree seeds. They pierced into the nine men's skulls and got stuck inside their brains.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nPU\nNine more muffled noises came from their heads as the nine skulls shattered. Soft pink tissues scattered everywhere. Some of them fell on Wu Buyi's face and Taxi's back.\nLeo rotated his right shoulder, relieving the stiffness after using a point shooting technique. Still, he hadn't noticed that his mannequin dao avatar did something to the bullets. Without looking at what he did, Leo ordered Taxi.\n\"Get rid of them, Taxi. I've already weakened them for you.\"\nWu Buyi and Taxi's expressions were blank. They gazed at the corpses without intact heads.\nWIGGLE\nMoreover, black sprouts emerged from the exploded heads. Some brain tissues already turned black and wiggled as if they were alive.\nTaxi retorted.\n\"Smash?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Yes. Smash them.\"\n\"Smash? Smash?!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Do I need to explain how to smash them to pieces or what? Just kill them and be done with it. I'm busy waiting for this mofo to become another package of yin fluid.\"\n\"…Smashed smash. D:\"\n\"What do you mean they're already dead?\"\nLeo had enough. He turned around to look at the messes he made.\nUpon looking back, Leo found the bodies of nine men, whose heads had exploded because of the wood essence bullets.\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression became the same as a pokerface cartoon meme. He quietly turned around and looked at Yan Long.\nMeanwhile, Yan Long stood still and stopped moving. His hair and headwear fell to the ground. The gold armor also slipped off from his body along with his clothes, revealing his skinny limbs and torso.\nHe became a dried mummy. While standing, Yan Long lost consciousness and died without realizing what hit him.\nLeo frowned and walked toward the guy. He poked the prince's head.\nPLOP\nThe entire body of Yan Long turned into dust.\n\"Hah?!\"\nLeo was disappointed. He thought the prince would have convulsed or swelled because of the expanding cancer cells. Instead, the guy lost all his fluid and died.\n\"Ah, dang it. I thought I would have gotten another source of yin fluid. I should have touched the other guys instead of shooting them… Wait, can I still mutate the corpses?\"\nHe rushed to the corpses and touched them with his hands. For a safety measure, Leo spat on them to boost the mutation speed.\nWIGGLE\nUnfortunately, Leo was too late. The bullet seeds earlier already germinated and absorbed the hosts' blood and fluid to the last drop. Without blood, the muscle fibers and bones quickly withered and dried.\nA few seconds later, the corpses turned into black soil. Only black sprouts rapidly grew into small dragon fruit plants.\nLooking at the plants, Leo smacked his forehead. He regretted using guns instead of the usual. He lamented and blamed himself.\n\"Dammit, Florida Wick. Stop playing with guns! Next time, only use guns in aerial fights, not ground combat!\"",

He also didn't forget to pick up their spatial rings and weapons.\nAmong the loot, Leo loved the talismans the most. He stuffed them in his pant pockets, planning to experiment on them later.\nWu Buyi also helped Leo gather their clothes and armor. While he was at it, he picked up one of the yellow talismans on the ground. He inspected it.\n\"I-Isn't this the infamous Immortal Killing Talismans of the Situ Clan?!\"\n\"What's that?\"\nLeo raised his head and looked at Wu Buyi. He then patted an identical talisman on the ground, patted the dirt off, and put it in his mouth. He chewed the paper as if he was a goat.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 3,000 years.>\nIt was worth degrading oneself into a goat. Leo loved seeing big numbers.\nWu Buyi blankly stared at Leo. He thought he got used to the weirdo, but he underestimated Leo's Floridaness. He thought that his master only ate precious herbs and monster's meat as food, but he didn't expect the guy to eat the talismans.\nEach talisman was worth a city! How could he eat it so casually!?\n\"Umm, my lord. T-That talisman's worth is at least a billion spirit stones. A-Are you sure you want to keep eating those? Why don't you keep some for emergencies? They're very useful in group fights. If we could deploy one or two of those talismans, we can deter even a hundred quasi-immortal cultivators with ease.\"\nLeo didn't listen to Wu Buyi. He picked another talisman from a pile of dirt. Then, he created a stream of water, soaking the paper. When it was wet and clean enough, Leo crumbled it into a small ball and swallowed it.\nThe paper ball went down his throat easily. Instantly, the cancer cells in his stomach devoured the foreign object and converted its residual energy into life force.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 3,000 years.>\nAfter mastering the trick, Leo pulled out more talismans from his pocket and poured more water on them.\nLooking at his master, Wu Buyi sweated profusely. His heart ached as he watched billions of spirit stones enter Leo's belly for no reason. His pupils gradually dimmed, and he began smiling even though he was in pain.\n\"Ah, I don't get it anymore. What is cultivation? What is life?\" Wu Buyi looked at the ceiling and deeply sighed.\nPHOOSH\nWhile the two men were busy handling the aftermath, the troublemaker finally exited the spaceship. Gao Yan activated the sealed gate, and a section of the spaceship was open.\nGao Yan, carrying the lightsaber staff, walked down the stairs and gazed at the elders. When he saw Leo and Wu Buyi, he wryly smiled.\n\"M-Master. E-Elder Florida Man?\"\nWu Buyi turned around and glared at his disciple. He stomped toward the boy and smacked the back of his head.\n\"You idiot! You worried us! Do you know how hard it is to track you? You could have been killed by other cultivators in the same realm!\"\n\"I'm sorry!\" Gao Yan covered his head and squatted, preventing himself from getting another hit.\nWu Buyi proceeded to bonk Gao Yan's head several more times to vent his anger. Gao Yan confusedly cried and ran around the spaceship while Wu Buyi sprinted after the boy to hit him some more. The comedic duo ran around the spaceship thrice before Gao Yan got penta-bonked, having five bumps on top of his head.\nWhile the master and disciple messed around, Leo took this opportunity to enter the spaceship, using the gate that Gao Yan had come out of. Taxi also followed after his boss.\nWhen Leo and Taxi entered the ship, Flora stopped following Gao Yan and followed after them. She was worried that they might get trapped in there if they didn't understand the ship's mechanism.\nBetraying Thora's expectation, Leo ordered Taxi to wait in the air pressure chamber. When the gate behind them was closed, the man remained calm as if he had done this before.\n\"This takes me back,\" Leo muttered. He gazed at the interior in nostalgia.\n\"Smash?\" Taxi looked back and forth, getting nervous.\n\"Relax. This is a method to get inside the ship. It's a standard procedure even if we aren't in space.\"\n\"Smash?\"\nTaxi tilted his head, unable to comprehend the situation. He'd rather destroy obstacles instead of waiting for a complicated door to open.\nThora was also surprised but for another reason. Other than fellow lightning element spirits like her, nobody should have learned about this spaceship and its functions. When she noticed that Leo knew about the chamber, her interest was piqued.\nThe lightning element dao avatar hovered in front of Leo, trying to communicate with him.\nUnfortunately, Leo could only see her moving mouth and her transparent body. Her words didn't reach him.\nNoticing that Leo couldn't hear her, Thora came up with an idea. She used her Qi to write on the wall. As the dust was thick, she successfully wrote the words in Chinese.\nLeo paused to read the words. It looked foreign to him, but his brain comprehended them instantly as the purchased linguistic skill was at work. He waited for Thora to finish.\n\"Who…am I? Meh, kiddo. I am the last Floridian.\"\nThora kept writing.\n'How do you know about the room's function?'\n\"Isn't that obvious? Even if I'm not an astronaut, I just know how it works. I watched sci-fi movies, you know?\"\n'Sai…Fai?'\nWHOOSH\nThe inner door was opened, and Leo proceeded forward. Taxi and Thora quickly followed after Leo.\nWalking further, Leo encountered something strange. After leaving the air-pressured room, Leo found a corridor. In front of him, there was a sign and the ship's map, showing his current location.\nThe map was easy to read. However, what shocked Leo was its language.\nEverything was written in English.\nAn abandoned alien spaceship in a cultivation world had English?!\nSomething was not right about this place. Leo frowned and gazed at Thora.\n\"Why is English here? Who was the captain of this ship? Predator? Alien? Darth Vader? Skywalker?\"\nThora smirked. She picked a section of a dusty wall and wrote.\n'The spirit queen told me that her master had already passed away. She became the new owner of this place.'\n\"Spirit queen? Someone from your species?\"\n'What's sa-pee-shie?'\nLeo scratched his head. He almost got a vital intelligence, but Thora seemed clueless. He retried and rephrased his words.\n\"Okay. Change of questions. Do you know where this ship came from?\"\nThora clapped her hands and puffed her chest. She wrote big words.\n'Milky Road!'\nMilky?\nMilky Road?\nMilky Way Galaxy?\nLeo's pupils dilated. He had a sick hypothesis in his mind, and he needed confirmation. Leo probed Thora again.\n\"Be specific. Which star? Which star system? Is it Earth from Solar System?\"\n'I don't know.'\nLeo smacked his lips in pity as he couldn't confirm the alien spaceship's origin yet. Still, learning that it might be from the same galaxy as Earth, Leo was excited. He had a feeling that he might find other survivors or the descendants of Earthlings in one of the mystic realms in the future.\nFor now, Leo was curious about the spaceship. He wondered if it contained any artifact that was similar to his ring.\nLeo rechecked the sign and the map. As he could read the description and the language, he found where he needed to go.\nThe first destination – The Bridge!\nWithout hesitation, Leo guided Taxi to head deeper into the ship. Thora also trailed after them as she was curious about what Leo would do in there.\nA few minutes later, Leo, Taxi, and Thora reached a gate, which separated them from the hallway and the bridge. Leo looked around and noticed the dim light of a console in front of the door.\nLeo swiped the dust away and looked at the monitor. There was an image of a hand on it.\n\"Handprint? Sure.\"\nHe put his right hand on it.\nThora giggled. She didn't believe that it would work as the console only acknowledged the realm's owner, her, and the spirit queen.\nBEEP\nThe dim monitor brightened in green. Then, the gate was unsealed.\n'Huh? Hold up! HOW?!' Thora was speechless.\nLeo snickered and waltzed into the bridge. As soon as he entered, he found a tragic scene.\nOn the bridge, seven dried human skeletons in tight spacesuits still sat on their seats. Another dead body was on the floor, behind the center console. All skeletons were pitch black.\n\"Ah, never mind. I guess I won't find other humans here.\"\nLeo was slightly disappointed. He thought he might find someone with the same language instead of local cultivators.\nStill, the spacesuit looked neat. Leo stripped one of them and fluttered the suit a few times. He didn't notice that the owner of the clothes turned to dust when Leo moved it.\nCRACK\nUnfortunately, the suit seemed to be too old. It fell apart and crumbled to pieces.\n\"…\"\nLeo's disappointment was immeasurable, and his day was ruined. He thought he could wear some cool-looking spacesuit to flex the locals, but it was wishful thinking.\nAs their suits had no value, Leo turned his attention to the black skeletons. He wondered if he could use them as alchemy ingredients.\nBut again, as soon as Leo tried to pick them up, they turned into dust like the first corpse.\nRealizing that he got nothing but dust, Leo gave up disrespecting the dead. He turned his attention to the ship's consoles next.\n\"Say, ghost. Can I still pilot this thing?\"\nThora sneered and wrote on the ground.\n'You wish! Without the spirit queen's blessing, this thing won't budge!'\n\"Are you sure?\"\nLeo noticed a few switches on a side console. They also came with labels \"Engine 1\", \"Engine 2\", \"Engine 3\", and so on.\nTreating it as a game, Leo flipped them up, switching them on.\nRUMBLE\nBOOM\nSomething exploded and caused a tremor. Dust fell from the ceiling, and the light inside the ship was turned off.\n\"Whoops.\"\nLeo bonked his head. Knowing that he had done something wrong, he stopped fiddling with a sophisticated console. After all, he couldn't even fly a plane.\n'You idiot!'\nThora was enraged. She ditched Leo and flew toward the engine room, checking if the soul stone still had enough energy to generate air and purify water for the plants.\nLeo also turned around and headed out. He also wondered if something exploded, and this spaceship might be on fire.\nHowever, as soon as Leo turned around, the black dust of the black skeletons merged, forming a humanoid silhouette of a strange creature.\nLeo stopped his feet as he sensed the cold stare behind him. He turned around and saw a humanoid monster, who was covered in black dust.\nThe dust monster had no eye or face. It simply confronted Leo and gathered more black dust around itself.\nLooking at the monster, Leo was reminded of the monsters in the alien ship that he came from. He wondered if this strange creature was the byproduct of an inhuman experiment.\n\"What are you? Can you still talk?\"\nThe dust monster didn't reply. It focused on gathering black dust and condensing them into a new set of skeletons.\nWIGGLE\nIt succeeded. Its silhouette transformed into a complete human skeleton. Then, it fell to the ground as it had no ligament.\nLeo gazed at the skeleton. He pulled out a tree branch from his spatial ring and poked it.\n\"Hey, dude. Are you still alive?\"\nCLATTER\nThe skull clattered its jaw, trying to tell Leo something. Leo also leaned closer, hoping to hear its words.\n\"Smash.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He glanced to the left and found Taxi, who also leaned closer to the skeleton.\n\"Can you shut up for a second?\"\n\"…Smash XD\"\nLeo shook his head and looked at the black skeleton once again. As if poking with a stick wasn't enough, he lifted it up.\nThe skeleton didn't turn into dust this time. Instead, Leo saw a glint of its smile even though it had no skin.\nCLATTER\nIts jaws clattered as if it was laughing at him. Then, the black bones melted and attached to Leo's skin.\nLeo raised his eyebrows at first. A second later, he frowned.\nHe realized its intention now.\n\"Oh, boy. I guess I'm not the only one with evolved cancer cells. You, too, eh?\"\nThe entire skeleton was a unified consciousness of undying cancer cells of the corpses. They had been waiting to devour or take over another host.\nUnfortunately, they picked Leo instead of a local cultivator.\n\"Sorry to say this to you, but you're outnumbered, damn parasites.\"\nLeo closed his eyes and deeply inhaled, allowing the skeleton to enter his body through his skin.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 117 – Naked Florida Man Dances and Sings to Cheer Arson Victim after He Burnt Her House\nThe parasitic cancerous cells of the skeleton vanished into Leo's body. Leo's blood cells quickly swarmed the intruders, and a war erupted inside him.\nMuscle tissues and fibers were twisted and torn. Cracking arm bones let out a loud noise, warning Leo about the crisis. However, the guy ignored the pain in his broken right arm. He pulled another talisman from his left pocket and put it in his mouth, eating it as a snack.\nLeo was never afraid of symbiosis creatures or microorganisms. Because of his evolved cells, his immunity system had never been defeated by random viruses, parasites, bacteria, or fungi.\nCRACK\nThe right arm swelled and wiggled as most intruding cells were in there. As for his left arm, nothing changed as his cells already suppressed the parasites.\nWIGGLE\nThe swelling right arm turned green. Leo glanced at it as he started to get annoyed.\nA few seconds later, the arm shrank and reverted to normal. The skin's complexion restored its usual color. Unfortunately, impurity gathered in Leo's nails, causing his right hand's fingernails to turn black.\nDING\n<You have digested soul stone parasites.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10,000 years.>\nA smile appeared on Leo's face. At least, the reward was worth the trouble.\nNonchalantly, Leo pulled his right hand's fingernails off his fingers. He flickered one of them away, discarding it.\nAs soon as the nail hit the floor, it melted the metal frame, releasing acidic gas and a sizzling sound.\n\"Ah, crap. Are you for real? Is my body fluid the same as Aliens in movies? Even my freaking nails can melt spaceships now?\"\nNoticing the melting floor, Leo pulled the black nail out of the ground and looked at it. While holding it in his hand, it slightly burnt his skin.\nSince the polluted fingernails might be too dangerous, Leo stored them in his spatial ring for the moment. He turned around and left the bridge.\n.\nAfter taking care of his business, Leo explored the spaceship, following the guide from the map earlier. He visited the crew cabins next.\nAt the back of the ship, a section was dedicated to a living quarter. Capsule beds lined up in the walls, allowing the ship's crew to sleep inside.\nLooking at the cramped space, Leo couldn't imagine himself living in this spaceship. Still, he challenged his inner claustrophobia and climbed into one of the capsules for fun.\nThe bed was soft and comfortable if Leo didn't mind the thick layer of dust and trillions of dust mites.\n\"I should build these for my employees later. I don't think the apartment is enough for a couple thousand people.\"\nLeo wondered if he could build another apartment or a living quarter for more people as the current facilities in his system domain were insufficient to house at least a thousand people from Amazonian Sanctuary and Life Sword Sect. He might have to manually build a resident for them.\nAfter leaving the capsule, Leo patted his clothes. He searched for the crew's belongings if they had some useful sci-fi tools or interesting weapons to use.\nThinking of weaponry, Leo had an idea.\n\"If this spaceship came from the US, they should at least have firearms or an armory onboard.\"\nLeo snickered and scanned through the drawers, cabinets, and crates in the living quarter. It didn't take long for Leo to find unknown objects.\nHe found a metallic tube with a button. Leo pressed on it, but it did nothing. There were three others. However, Leo couldn't make it work for some reason.\nAfter shaking and slapping one of them a few times, something came off the metallic tube.\nTOK-TOK\nA small black crystal bounced and rolled on the floor. When Leo found it, he raised his eyebrows in bemusement.\nIt was an essence stone. However, its energy was already depleted.\n\"So, I need an essence stone? Alrighty, then!\"\nLeo mimicked Jim Carrey's expression and ejected a spirit stone from his spatial ring. He grabbed the stolen spirit stone and shouted at it, again, copying the actor's iconic voice.\n\"My brother in Christ! BEHOLD ZE MIRACLE!\"\nThe spirit stone glittered and transformed into an essence stone. Its energy was filled with Leo's element essence and his life force.\nAfter getting a brand new essence stone, Leo fiddled with the unknown stick, inserting the stone back in.\nFive minutes later, Leo finally learned how the tool worked. He twisted the handle, which revealed s small hole to insert the stone, aka a battery. After putting the essence stone in, Leo pressed the button again.\nFZZKKRRRGG\nThe lightsaber was activated. Its red color and its sci-fi sound effect stunned Leo.\n\"Isn't this a freaking lightsaber? Ha… Hahahaha! Oh, dear lord. I have a freaking lightsaber in a Chinese fantasy world! What the hell?!\"\nPlaying with the lightsaber, Leo swung it around, pretending to be a master Jedi. However, he accidentally sliced capsule beds nearby and left carnage behind.\nPlaying enough, Leo flipped the switch and deactivated the lightsaber. He quickly stored it in his spatial ring. However, having one wasn't enough.\nLeo scoured and gathered more broken lightsaber handles. He chortled like a maniac while he broke more crates and cabinets in the area, searching for more.\nAfter 10 minutes, Leo only secured 10 lightsabers. He was slightly disappointed, but he was still excited to find more useful futuristic tools from this spaceship.\nWhen Leo left the cabin area, Thora returned to him. She didn't look happy.\n'The air circulation machine is broken because of you. The plants are going to die soon,' Thora wrote the wall in anger.\nLeo stroked his beard, \"Air circulation? Plants? Well, instead of growing those plants in here, how about I bring those plants to my domain?\"\n'Yes, please. Well, if you can access the engine room, that is. You still need the spirit queen's permission to access the other restricted area.'\nThora paused for a moment. She frowned as she remembered that the crew cabin area was also restricted. Even Gao Yan couldn't enter here when he tried earlier.\n'By the way, how did you get in here?' Thora had a bad feeling about this.\nLeo shrugged, \"I just can. Well, same-old, same-old. I just scanned my fingerprints and hands on the console, and voila!\"\nThe corners of Thora's mouth twitched. She had a wild guess, but she prayed that it wouldn't be the case. Still, for the sake of confirmation, she guided him to the engine room.\n'Follow me.'\n\"Okie, dokie. By the way, does this spaceship have an armory? Where did the former crew store the guns?\"\nThora had no idea what Leo was talking about. She scoffed and ignored him.\nSeeing the girl's reaction, Leo shook his head. He stopped making jokes and walked through the dark corridor, proceeding toward the engine room.\n.\nWhen the duo was close to the engine room, they came across thick black smoke and extreme heat. Leo's green eyes and nostrils braced the toxic as he stomped toward the burning engine room.\n\"Oh, boy. Nobody here has a fire extinguisher, I see.\"\nLeo pointed his finger in front of him and ordered his cancer cells to produce water for him.\nZAAAA\nA high-pressure water stream came out from Leo's index finger like a laser beam. He let out a long sigh and sprayed water everywhere to reduce the heat.\nWhen Leo got closer to the engine room, he saw a trace of blue flame, which was burning something behind the room. As electronic devices wouldn't work, Leo ignored the console and walked toward the sealed metal door.\nWithout hesitation, Leo punched it.\nBOOM\nBad idea.\nAs soon as the door was blasted and allowed the air to flow out of the engine room, a sea of flame flooded Leo, devouring him whole. Even the water from Leo's index finger was suppressed.\nThe blue flame burnt his clothes, but it couldn't do anything to his skin. Leo snorted and changed his approach, commanding his cancer cells to unleash his water element essence and create more water.\nZAAAA\nA tsunami came out from Leo's body, entering the engine room.\nZAAAP\nUnfortunately, by doing so, Leo got zapped by an unknown source of electricity. He felt like he was hit by a green tribulation lightning bolt.\nA mild electric current didn't faze him. Leo patiently extinguished the flame and waited for the situation to be under his control.\nWhen the fire died down, Leo stopped producing water. While butt naked, Leo walked into the ruined engine room to check the ship's condition.\nEverything in the room was reduced to metal scraps. Leo bitterly smiled as he felt guilty for flipping the wrong switches and burning the ship by accident.\nThora looked inside the room and cried. This place was once her home, and she used to live here. Without the functioning engine, no other lightning element spirit could be born.\n'It's your fault, geezer! Why did you have to ruin my home?!'\nLeo couldn't hear Thora. He explored the destroyed engine room and found a pedestal, which stored a large crystal ball inside a glass container. However, the glasses were already melted, leaving only the fist-sized crystal ball.\nLeo frowned and rubbed its surface, wondering what it was.\nVIING\nAs soon as Leo touched it, its property changed. Some of his element essences recharged its energy.\nWHOOSH\nThe soul stone changed color from black to green. Then, it emanated green lightning branches everywhere.\n'Eh?! HOW?!'\nThora was shocked as Leo just recharged the soul stone's energy to the max with one touch. As for Leo, he still had no clue what it was for as he hadn't researched this item yet.\n\"Eh… It wasn't me!\" Leo laughed, denying his responsibility. Still, he grabbed the soul stone and stored it in his spatial ring. \"Welp, we're done here. Let's go to other places and rescue your little plants.\"\nWhile flabbergasted, Thora kept staring at Leo's face. When she came back to her senses, she wrote the floor to ask Leo the most important question.\n'Geezer, are you the new owner of this realm? Did you kill the Rabbit Trent King?'\n\"How did you know?\" Leo proudly grinned, \"I thought I hadn't told anybody.\"\n'You…'\nThora pointed her finger at Leo's face, but she gave up commenting on anything else. She was mentally exhausted.\n'Fine. Let's take the plants out, and we're leaving. There's nothing to see here.'\nAgain, Leo couldn't hear her. He Gangnam-styled his way to the plant chamber, trying to cheer her up.\nThe weird sight of a buffed elderly man dancing made Thora smile. She shook her head and secretly cursed him.\n'Dumb geezer.'\n\"OP-OP-OP OPPAN Gangnum Style!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 118 – Florida Man Murders 10 Elders and Bring Their Corpses Home for Food\nAfter dancing enough, Leo stopped playing around. He salvaged the burnt clothes to search for his precious talismans, which he had stuffed into his pants pockets.\nThe pants were burnt to a crisp. When Leo found it, he bitterly smiled.\nThe talismans were gone with the flame.\n\"Haiya…\"\nLeo smacked his forehead and lamented in silence. He proceeded to the next destination with a broken heart.\n.\nHydroponics Lab\nBecause the air ventilation and machines stopped working, the room was too quiet. Without a source of light, everything was pitch black.\nAfter putting on a new t-shirt and jeans, Leo explored the lab and inspected the plant factory here. Using his night sight, Leo navigated through the wreck and collected every plant he found.\n'Take these too, geezer.'\nThora pointed at the broken lab capsule machine, which was once the home of the spirit queen. Although the machine had long ceased functioning, it still held a lot of sentimental value for Thora.\nLeo took the machine in his spatial ring. He lost count of how many objects he stored in those dimensional pockets, but they were almost full to the brim. As the space was limited, Leo stored some of the plants in the ring, where he had kept the eyeball and the dragon fruit trees.\nOther than the plants, nothing else was worth Leo's attention. He looked at Thora.\n\"Anything else?\"\n'No. That will be all.'\n\"What about guns and armory? I want my railgun and laser guns!\"\n'There is nothing like that!'\nLeo sighed and shook his head. He muttered in pity, \"How uncultured and primitive. What kind of spaceship doesn't bring guns and weapons for the crew? Haiya.\"\n'…'\n.\nAfter touring enough, Leo and Thora opened the door and came out of the ship. While walking out, Leo turned around to give the spaceship a meaningful look.\n'It's different from THAT spaceship. This one might have come from Earth, but who knows which Earth or dimension it came from. One thing is for sure, the spaceship I know wasn't this fragile. It endured red lightning bolts a hundred times before it collapsed.'\nLeo gave up the idea of bringing the spaceship to his domain. He left it there for the time being as his spatial rings were full.\nComing out of the ship, Leo found Wu Buyi, Taxi, and Gao Yan, who had been waiting for them.\n\"Let's go home. We're done here.\"\nWu Buyi was reluctant to leave this mystic realm. He scratched his arms and face as he was nervous.\n\"My lord, can we stay a bit longer? I haven't cultivated enough.\"\n\"Then, who asked you to fap all day long?\"\nWu Buyi lowered his head, ashamed of what he did.\n\"Don't worry. Y'all can come back here and cultivate to your heart's content. When we get back, I'll set up a permanent portal for you to return here. This world belongs to me, and we can do whatever we want to it.\"\nWu Buyi's eyes gleamed. He repeatedly nodded as he had faith in Leo and his mysterious power, \"Yes, my lord! Let's go home!\"\nLeo hopped on Taxi's back and led the group out of the cave.\n.\n.\nLeo, Wu Buyi, Gao Yan, Thora, and Taxi left the manmade underground cave and returned to their campsite. They ignored local monsters, such as cockatrices, black caimans, giant wasps, and oversized tarantula spiders.\nWhile they flew in the sky, they crossed paths with another group of 10 soul transformation cultivators.\nGao Yan nervously looked at the group of strong cultivators at a distance. Wu Buyi also sweated profusely, but Taxi, Thora, and Leo remained expressionless.\nThe 10 soul transformation cultivators also avoided them. They took a detour and kept their distance. Still, they continued traveling south, heading to the artificial cave that Leo had come from.\nAfter they parted ways without chatting, Leo glanced at the group. He then asked Wu Buyi.\n\"Say, have we collected all corpses and their gears before we left?\"\nWu Buyi brightly smiled. He showed Leo the spatial rings of the second prince and his entourage, \"They're right here, my lord. As for their clothes and armor, they are inside my spatial ring.\"\n\"Good job. That's a relief.\"\nWu Buyi tilted his head. He looked at the team of strong cultivators, wondering why Leo was wary of them.\n\"What's wrong, my lord? Are you worrying about something? Are you afraid that they might find out?\"\n\"Nah,\" Leo scoffed. \"I was more concerned about the loot. It would have been a waste if we forgot to take their rings and their precious lifespan papers. Speaking of which, I need to eat more.\"\nLeo stuck his hands into his jeans' pockets only to discover that they were empty.\n\"Ah…\"\nHe suddenly had a flashback. He remembered that he no longer had the talismans in his pockets. Thus, he scanned his spatial rings, searching if he still had some leftovers in there.\nFortunately, a stack of 20 talismans was in one of the rings. Leo put them there when he collected the random drops from the dead people, and he forgot about them.\nLeo almost had a heart attack. He let out a long sigh of relief that he didn't accidentally destroy all of them because of his greed. He ejected one of them out and chewed it as usual.\n.\n.\nLeading the group of nine soul transformation cultivators was Yan Luo, the first prince of the Yan Empire. He was a grey-haired elder, but his eyebrows and long full beard were still black.\nUnlike the second prince, the first prince, Yan Luo, didn't wear fancy clothes or artifacts. He donned himself in patched robes as if he was a commoner or a beggar. He also carried a wooden staff, which was made from sacred wood.\nThis elderly prince glanced at Leo's group and bitterly smiled. He let out a long sigh when Leo didn't bother with them.\n\"I guess my brother is already dead.\"\nWhen Yan Luo mentioned the death of the second prince, the bodyguards gulped. They stared at Leo's group in wary and fear.\n\"Is that elder really a quasi-immortal, your highness?\"\nYan Luo nodded, \"Very likely. My brother never spared the weak or made friends with stronger cultivators. He always relied on Situ Clan's talismans like the third-rated assassin group from the Ouyang Clan. Whenever he quarreled with stronger seniors, he always used those talismans to kill them.\"\nThe group wryly smiled. They had heard the rumor about the second prince's personality before, but hearing it from their lord had a different vibe.\n\"That group came out from the place that my brother visited, so they must have met. Knowing my brother's personality, he must have tried to rob those people one way or another. Since they've come out first without a trace of combat…\"\nYan Luo sighed. He had planned to kill Yan Long for a long time, but someone did it for him.\n\"He finally swallowed more than he could chew. Suit him right.\"\nThe first prince burst into laughter while he led his men toward the artificial cave. He pointed his staff at the metal dome.\n\"Go in and explore. Since we're here, we should be nice and bring their corpses back home.\"\nThe nine cultivators nodded and rushed into the cave.\nA few minutes later, Yan Luo and his men found the abandoned spaceship. However, they didn't find the corpses of the second prince's people. Everybody walked around the ship while they scanned the cave, searching for the track of Yan Long.\nAs they searched, one of them picked up a couple warm bullet shells. They brought them and presented them to Yan Luo.\n\"Your Highness. We've detected strong wood element essence in these metal cylinders. I think they were new.\"\nYan Luo picked them up and flipped them in his hands. He also detected the remnant of Leo's aura.\nSIZZLE\nAfter holding them for a few seconds, Yan Luo's hands were charred. He dropped the shells and rubbed his palms.\n\"Your Highness?!\"\nYan Luo deeply inhaled and circulated his Qi. A few seconds later, the charred parts were slightly healed, but he lost a layer of his skin.\n\"Those cylinders are not made from wood or metal element essence,\" Uttered Yan Luo.\n\"What do you mean, Your Highness?\"\nYan Luo's eyes glinted as he studied the aura of the shells on the ground. He solemnly looked at his men.\n\"This is the power of dao or the work of a sentient dao avatar. Either that quasi-immortal used an artifact or a secret technique, I'm sure Yan Long died here. I think they might have taken their corpses with them.\"\n\"…\"\nThe group gulped. They wondered who that elder was as he boldly stole the corpses of imperial guards and the second prince. This didn't include the crime of murdering a royalty.\nThere was only one way to find out.\n\"It doesn't matter. Someone from the imperial palace will use Yan Long's life candle to identify the murderer and how they died anyway. We don't need to do anything. By the way, does anyone have a spatial ring that can store this massive artifact?\"\nYan Luo smiled and pointed at the spaceship. He added, \"We're bringing this thing to the palace. We already found two, and we are close to learning the lost techniques from those artifacts. Maybe, this one will help our scholars at home.\"\nThe bodyguards stopped worrying about the second prince's group and looked at the spaceship. As it wasn't their first time handling this order, they brought out their ropes to tie the ship. Two of them flew toward the ceiling and began digging a hole even though the roof was manmade.\nSoon, they pried open the dome. Then, everybody carried the entire spaceship as if they were supermen. Yan Luo laughed and guided his men to their portal near the pagoda town.\n.\n.\nLeo's group reached the camp unhindered. When they arrived, they found the ransacked shacks and destroyed cooking utensils.\nWu Buyi and Gao Yan grumbled as those tools were gifts from Leo. On the other hand, Leo thought of the people they saw.\n\"Eh, this world is full of thieves,\" Leo complained. \"Welp. We can't help it. There's no law here, and people can use superpowers. Since everybody abuses their powers as they see fit, the country is in anarchy. What a beautiful civilization. This world should get nuked once or twice so that they can understand the hardship of having no peasant to provide them food or services.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi and Gao Yan gave Leo a weird look. Both of them didn't understand what he meant, but they could feel his killing intent rising. They also secretly prayed for whoever made Leo angry.\n'May they rest in pieces in hell.'\n'Even Yama can't save you now.'\nLeo didn't bother scavenging for remaining tools and usable utensils. He touched the blue portal, and the system prompted him with a message.\n<Will you return to the domain?>\n<You have completed all objectives, and you are the master of this mystic realm. When you return you can build a new portal, which can permanently link between your domain and this world.>\nLeo ignored the message. He was mentally exhausted, and he needed a good night's rest on a warm bed.\n\"Bring me home.\"\n<Affirmative.>\nThe portal was unsealed, and Leo's hand sank into the energy portal. He took a step and entered it.\nWu Buyi, Thora, Gao Yan, and Taxi also followed suit. They obtained enough treasures and stories to tell their friends for months.\nAfter crossing the gate, Leo and the group returned to the floating platform with the four heavenly demons. When their eyes adjusted to the light, the first sight they saw was the pride of cowering thunder unicorns, which had been trapped in a square cube.\n\"Smash?\"\nTaxi sneered at his friends and family. He didn't even try to ask them why they got into that position.\n\"SMASH!\"\nThe other ponies cried and begged Taxi for help. They also pointed their hooves at the four giant statues.\nMeanwhile, Leo laughed at the horses. He was also relieved that the dangerous monsters didn't go on a rampage or try to molest Cat.\nThinking of Cat, Leo's eyes swept through the platform. However, he couldn't see the giant wasps and cockatrices that he had thrown here.\nLeo facepalmed. It wasn't hard to guess who stole them.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow, I see.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 119 – Warrant Issued on Florida Man Again after His Missing Man-Eating Cat Found in Church Along With Half-Eaten Priests\n\"Who's doing this to y'all?\"\nLeo inspected the transparent cage that trapped the horses. He stroked the smooth surface of the cube.\nThe four statues glanced at Leo and grinned. The cat-octopus statue secretly chanted a spell, dispelling the trap array.\nMunya!\nThe transparent cage vanished like smoke. The thunder unicorns cried and surrounded Leo, thanking him for freeing them.\n\"Alright. Alright. Calm your tits, damn donkeys! Let's come down and arrange a place for you to stay. Also, we need to set some rules so that you won't accidentally kill my employees down there.\"\nLeo ordered the unicorns and Taxi to sit around him while he gave them a brief lecture about the domain's rules.\nFirst, they could not harm Leo and his employees unless it was self-defense.\nSecond, thunder unicorns were obliged to protect the facilities, employees, and guests of Leo's domain. Against hostile intruders, they were allowed to use deadly force as long as they wouldn't damage the store and other buildings.\nThird, they had to treat their comrades, Leo, and his employees with respect. Bullying and sexual harassment would not be tolerated.\nFourth, thunder unicorns, including Taxi, could explore outside the domain at their own risk. In case they caused trouble, Leo and his employees would not be held responsible for their actions. However, in case they were attacked first and were forced to flee to the domain, they could ask Leo to help them if necessary.\nFifth, each thunder unicorn would receive a fixed wage per day by choosing one of the following choices; 10 stalks of immortal grass, 10 yin cabbages, 10 bottles of rejuvenate tea, or one essence stone.\nTaxi and others agreed to the terms as protecting Leo's territory was a simple task. After all, they could laze around and wait to receive free food easily. All unicorns inwardly laughed.\n\"Smashishishishishi.\"\n\"Smashishishishishi!\"\n\"SMASHSHISHISHI!\"\nAfter seeing how cocky they were, Leo imposed the sixth condition.\n\"As you know, I'm an alchemist, and I need some ingredients to make pills. Coincidentally, I need unicorn horns. Therefore…\"\nTaxi and the other unicorns closed their mouths. They sweated profusely.\n\"I won't ask for much, but I will need one of you to sell me your horn. Of course, I'll pay you with whatever you want from the store, be it extra food or pills that I made.\"\nTaxi and the unicorns gulped as their horns were their pride and social status. Trimming it or cutting it was like a death sentence in their social life.\nHowever, Leo's offer tempted the elderly unicorns. A few of them already mated with their partners, and they no longer needed the horns to find mates. One of them trotted in front of the group and gazed at Leo.\nLeo gazed back at the elderly unicorn. Curious, he summoned a lifespan status to check its age.\n.\nName: Nameless Thunder Unicorn\nAge: 4,487 Years\nRemaining Lifespan: 512 Years, 11 Months, 29 Days, 11 Hours, 49 Minutes\n.\n\"Wow.\"\nLeo was surprised to see a real elder among the ponies. It was over 4,000 years old, and its physique was toner than the others. However, it didn't look as energetic as Taxi and the younger unicorns.\nThe nameless unicorn lowered its head and rubbed it against Leo's face, showing affection and trust.\nLeo bitterly smiled. He patted its head in return, \"You do realize that my body is poisonous, right? You could have died had your immunity system and DNA failed on you.\"\n\"Smash…\"\n\"You don't care? Well, I do care for my friends and family. I don't want to accidentally kill you by touching you. Anyway, back to the topic, it's not like I want your entire horn. I just need the tiny tip.\"\nThe elder unicorn's horn was over a meter long, and it curved upward like an elephant's tusk. As it was too long for the 2-meter-tall pony, a portion of it was covered in dirt. Leo patted the dirt and mud off to see its real beauty.\nCRACK\nBefore Leo could pick the part he wanted, the elder unicorn's horn glowed in silver light and broke in half!\n\"Hold up! I didn't say that I want that now!\"\n\"…Smash :P\"\n\"Yeah, too late. I know. Oh, dear. Does it hurt?\" Leo checked the wound to see if the unicorn was in pain. He thought of making a new batch of elixir grain pills to heal it.\"\n\"Smash :D\"\nThe elder unicorn smiled. The next moment, it gathered lightning essence in its horn. The wound mended, and a portion of its horn regrew. Although it failed to restore the horn's size and shape at the moment, it would soon restore its former glory in a few weeks.\nLeo was relieved to learn that the unicorns could regrow their horns. He stroked the pony's head.\n\"Thanks, buddy. I'll give you extra food today. What do you want?\"\n\"Smash :D\" The elder wanted a mountain of dragon fruits.\n\"Dragon fruits? Fine. I'll bring you some. Also, do you need a name?\"\n\"Smash XD\"\n\"Okay. Then. Since I call that idiot Fake Taxi, you will be known as P***hub!\"\n\"… Smash? D:\" The elder unicorn found the name weird.\n\"Don't worry. This name is very unique. It also has a nice meaning to it!\" Leo bashfully smiled and gave it a thumbs up.\n.\nAfter naming the elderly unicorn, the others also wanted their unique names, and Leo satisfied their desire. However, nobody realized where their origins came from.\nOnlyF***, Xvi***, Nh***ai, R***34, those iconic names were famous in Leo's world as only cultured men and women would know. There were others, but Leo simply gave them some actresses' names that he remembered.\nAfter the naming ceremony was complete, Leo guided the crowd to the ground. The unicorns cheered and jumped down along with Leo.\nWhile they were gliding and descending, Leo finally noticed the change in geography and landscape. At the southwest of his domain, there was a humongous trench, threading from the southwest of the farmland to the south.\nLeo landed and rushed to see the giant hole. He looked into the pit in confusion at first. But when he recalled the order that he had given to some mannequins a week ago, Leo smacked his forehead.\n\"Did those idiots keep digging because I didn't tell them when to stop?!\"\nAnnoyed, Leo turned around and ordered Wu Buyi to bring the horses to the northwest area of the domain to settle there. He then jumped into the pit to measure the depth.\nFalling three kilometers deep, Leo landed at the bottom of the massive hole. He looked up to see the rays of light from above as it was dark in there.\nLooking at the scenery from below, Leo thought of the Grand Canyon as this place reminded him of the bottom of those tall canyons and plateaus. Two tall cliffs and the deep trench created a path to the south.\nLeo sprinted and followed the pathway. He wondered if this deep trench would continue until the edge of his domain.\nExceeding his expectation, the path continued outside the domain boundary. After traveling two kilometers, Leo still couldn't see the end of the trench.\nAs Leo couldn't measure the length efficiently by looking at it from below, he kicked the ground and jumped off the canyon. Leo landed on the surface first. Then, he jumped again so that he could see where the trench's other end was.\nAfter jumping to the sky, Leo could get a clear picture of the canyon's pathway. It was connected to a river. However, that river was also dried by an unknown cause.\nComing down, Leo leaped toward the dried river. He wondered if the mannequins unknowingly worked until they reached that area. When Leo arrived, he found five of his mannequins digging the trench with their shovels.\n'Since when had I bought them shovels?'\nLeo scratched his head. He didn't remember giving them shovels.\nWhen Leo looked at them carefully, he noticed that they weren't actually shovels. The things in their hands were makeshift shovels, made from spear shafts and metal plates.\n\"Dudes. Where did you get those?\" Leo approached the bots and asked them. He forgot that they couldn't speak.\nOne of them stopped working and menacingly stared at Leo with two glowing red eyes. The others also did the same, surrounding him.\nFortunately, Leo wasn't scared of creep dolls. He patted their heads, \"That's enough work. I ordered you to dig a fish pond, but you freaking created the Grand Canyon. What were you thinking?\"\nThe mannequins tilted their heads in unison. Then, they pointed at the river.\n\"???\"\nLeo couldn't understand them. He also tilted his head, mimicking their gesture.\nWhile Leo was confused, his dao avatar came out from his body. He stood in front of the crowd and looked at them for a moment. He then turned around and acted as their translator.\n'Silly master, they said they were digging a fish pond as you asked.'\n\"But why it's so deep and big?!\"\nThe mannequin turned to the workers. While turning its back to Leo, the avatar's shoulders trembled as if it was laughing.\n'That's what she said.'\n\"…\"\nLeo flinched for a minute as he didn't expect to hear that joke in this world. He took a deep breath, handling it like a pro.\n\"Okay. You got me. But it's too big.\"\n'That's what she said.'\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his hands and turned around, secretly venting his frustration. After reeling in his emotion, he smiled at his avatar and avoided the trap.\n\"What are they doing?\"\n'Tsk.'\n\"Don't \"Tsk\" me. Tell me what they were doing?\"\n'Fine.'\nThe dao avatar pointed at the dried river. Leo also looked at it.\n'There was plenty of water when the mannequins reached here. But when they were about to direct the waterway to the trench, some black-clothed cultivators attacked them. Cat joined the fight, and they managed to repel the attackers.'\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He rechecked the conditions of the workers.\nFortunately, no clear damage had been inflicted on them. They looked brand new.\n\"How did they survive? I remember that they aren't combatants.\"\n'Meh, those cultivators were weak. Anything under the immortal stage can't possibly hurt them… they said.'\nLeo nodded in approval. If they were this strong, he could leave dangerous tasks with them, \"Excellent. Well, where is Cat, by the way? What happened to her?\"\nThe mannequins lowered their heads. The dao avatar's expression was also gloomed.\n'They said… Cat has been captured by those guys.'\n\"WHAT?!\"\nSomething didn't make sense there. Since these mannequins were stronger than average cultivators in this world, they should have been able to protect or repel random thieves and robbers. Leo couldn't understand how Cat got abducted when these mannequins were invincible.\n\"If these guys said they are stronger than everybody here, how come she got captured?\"\nThe dao avatar shook his head, 'It's not their fault. It's hers.'\n\"How so?\" Leo was confused.\n'They said that… she… deliberately allowed herself to be captured, and she told these guys not to help her.'\n\"…\"\n'…For the sake of nom-nom meow.'\n\"…\"\nLeo facepalmed. It took him five minutes to restore his sanity to ask another question.\n\"Where is she now? Where did she go?\"\nThe mannequins pointed at the southwest. The dao avatar also looked in that direction and translated their thoughts.\n'Fatui Cult.'",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 120 – Homeless Florida Man Arrested for Taking a Bath\nUnderground beneath the Frozen Fire City hid an underground city. A total of 2,000 cultists lived there, using it as a hideout and a secret ritual site, avoiding the eyes and ears of Yan Xiang Emperor.\nThe ruler of this place was none other than Yan Zhu, the third prince. In addition, this place was the true headquarters of the Fatui Cult, where their cultivators practiced black arts and forbidden techniques.\nSacrificial altars, giant cauldrons full of human blood, rundown torture tools, and dry bloodstains were common there. Cultivators usually traveled back and forth between the Frozen Fire City and their underground headquarters, shipping and importing new slaves, monsters, and orthodox cultivators that they had captured.\nAmong the caravans, a cart carried a large cage, which trapped a monster inside. However, the people accompanying the wagon kept their distance from the monster.\nSitting in a cage, a chomper plant monster chewed a cultivator's corpse in glee. This was the sixth person that got too close to her cage.\nA hundred golden core cultivators escorted the caged monster while 20 nascent soul cultivators walked in front of them. Everybody wore black robes and black cone masks, revealing only their eyes and hands.\nIt was already a miracle that their platoon managed to capture Cat with their meager strength. At the moment, Cat was a 7th-stage monster, which should have been so strong that no nascent soul cultivators could have been her opponent. Yet, she was easily captured and brought there.\nSeveral of the cultivators thought that their teamwork successfully suppressed the monster. However, the reality told a different story.\nWhile sitting in the cage, Cat periodically and randomly snatched escorting cultivators into her cage and ate them alive.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nAgain, Cat's vines lashed at lightning speed, extending from inside her cage and latching on five escorting golden core cultivators behind the wagon. She then pulled them into the cage and peeled their clothes like bananas. A few seconds later, the gory scene and the bone-crunching sound made the escorting cultivators turn away in disgust and fear.\n\"Damn monster.\"\nOne of the cultists grudgingly glared at Cat. He believed that the monster pretended to lose and got herself captured intentionally.\n\"Not for long, monster. Those sacred wood on your body will become fine weapons for our elders. Your monster core and all your body parts will be refined! We will make sure that you will die as painfully as possible!\"\nCat ignored the angry man and chewed the five men earlier. After swallowing their blood, flesh, and bones, she burped and released green gas from her mouth.\nThe gas was just her breath, but it smelled worse than rotting human corpses mixed with the smelliest wet feces of elders with constipation issues and intestine cancer.\nCultivators in this world improved their inner Qi and five senses through training and cultivation. When the nasty smell came out, they covered their nose and mouth. Their faces turned purple, and a dozen of them vomited.\n\"Goddammit! Can somebody put that monster to sleep or kill it?!\"\n\"S-Sir, but our weapons did nothing to its skin when we fought it.\"\n\"Ah! You're useless! Use flame element techniques! Watch this!\"\nA nascent soul cultivator stepped forward and summoned his dao avatar. A flame spirit emerged from his body and pointed its palm toward Cat.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nCat turned around and thrust two vines toward the cultivator. She grabbed him and pulled him toward her cage. Without peeling his clothes, she opened her mouth, baring her thousand teeth.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nCHOMP!\nCat bit his head off before the dao avatar could even use a dao technique. Its spiritual physique disintegrated into particles while the spirit widened its eyes in confusion.\nAfter the nascent soul cultivator perished, nobody dared to utter another word. They silently gestured to the caravan leader to bring that monster to the underground city as soon as possible.\n.\n.\nAt the bottom of the dried river, Leo listened to his mannequin dao avatar while the latter translated the silent language of the workers.\n'As for the river issue, the water actually sank into the ground that they dug. It seems they found something that drained the entire river, but they haven't searched for the source yet.'\nLeo shrugged, \"Where is it, then? Maybe I'll dig it out and put it in my store for sale.\"\nThe mannequin spirit turned to the workers. The latter nodded and guided the group to the place where the water disappeared into.\nLeo and his dao avatar followed the workers and noticed an area with firm ground. The former lightly tapped on it to test its strength.\n\"Is this the place?\"\n'I think so.'\n\"Good. Let's dig then.\"\nLeo took a makeshift shovel from one of the workers. He shoved it in and pulled a layer of dirt.\nAt first, his movement was clumsy and awkward. A few seconds later, Leo picked up speed. He left behind afterimages while he repeatedly threw dirt and rocky soil to the side. Some of the dirt went through the dao avatar's body by accident.\nWithin five minutes, Leo dug 100 meters deeper. Then, his shovel hit something hard and shiny.\nLeo stopped applying forces or using the super speed. He lightly removed the dirt around the object. However, the mysterious shining blue object was bigger than Leo had imagined.\nLooking at the mysterious blue gemstone, Leo rubbed his chin and pondered. Then, he smacked his forehead and jumped out of the hole.\nLeo injected his Qi into one of his spatial rings. He unloaded the pharaoh's statue and edible gold coins. Then, he asked the workers.\n\"Bring those to the junkyard, but don't recycle them. Those are my food.\"\nThe workers nodded and began lifting the statue. They turned around and jumped in unison. A second later, they were out of the 3km-deep trench.\nLeo gazed at his workers and nodded in approval. At least, they didn't need his help.\nThe dao avatar observed Leo and understood his intention. He looked at the spatial ring that Leo had emptied.\n'Very creative.'\n\"Call me the master.\"\n'Meh.'\nLeo returned to the hole and touched the mysterious gemstone. He injected his Qi into the ring and the object. The next moment, the massive gemstone vanished into the ring as if it got sucked into a black hole.\nWhen the gemstone was stored in the ring, a massive chunk of ground vanished. Leo fell further into the ground, and the soft soil nearby collapsed on him.\nHe was buried alive.\nA second later, blasted out of the collapsed soil and got back to the bottom of the trench. His t-shirt and jeans were dark brown as the wet dirt dirtied him.\n\"Oh, boy. That was scary. This takes me back.\" Leo snickered. It was his second time getting buried alive. Fortunately, he wasn't as weak as when he got buried the first time.\nAt that time, Leo got struck by green lightning tribulation for the first time, and his heart stopped beating, and he could not move after the first hit. However, his brain and consciousness were intact. Leo got stuck in that state for 100 years, eating and swallowing sand, dirt, and polluted rainwater while he got buried alive by a random landslide.\nIt was a nightmarish experience. However, he managed to survive, and his body became immune to the green lightning bolts since then.\n\"Let's go home. We're done here.\"\n'What about your pet?'\nLeo looked south. He pursed his lips for a moment, wondering if he should go and rescue Cat. At first, Leo planned to go home and wait for the naughty kid to return. But when Leo recalled the pitiful cry of Cat when she was hurt, his heart wrenched.\n\"Haiya. Fine. You win. We'll take a short visit to Fatui Cult. By the way, did my workers tell you where she went?\"\n'Just use your nose and follow her scent.'\n\"I ain't a dog, you dumb doll. But you're right. I can smell her from here.\"\n'…'\nLeo laughed and started sniffing the air. He then looked toward the southwest direction and leaped to the sky.\n.\nAfter leaping and jumping 10 kilometers southwest, Leo found a province-sized city. The 15-meter-tall stone city walls stood tall and looked intimidating. In front of the walls, a water moat was 100 meters wide, deterring wandering monsters and thieves from reaching the bottom of the walls.\nHowever, the tall and defensive city array was nothing to Leo. He leaped across the wall and landed on a rooftop of a wooden house. Unfortunately, his momentum was too strong, and his weight broke the wooden beams on the ceiling. He fell into the building.\nLeo landed inside a bedroom. On the stone bed, a naked young man and a woman screamed in fright. Hearing their voices, Leo turned around to look at them.\nUpon seeing the naked couple, Leo smiled at them.\n\"My bad. Just think of me as a random hailstone. Anyway, I won't disturb you. Continue.\"\nHe walked out of the room and proceeded to exit the building through the front door. While he walked out of the place, many men and women in fancy silk clothes looked at Leo's muddy t-shirt and jeans in disgust.\n\"Who let a beggar in here?!\"\n\"Chase him out!\"\nLeo ignored the crowd. He glanced at them, but he didn't feel the presence of a cultivator or their Qi. It seemed that they were all commoners in this city.\nAs Leo left the building, he looked around to see what he had fallen into earlier.\nIt was a 10-story wooden building with medieval Chinese architecture. The sign clearly stated \"Flower House\", which implied a certain meaning.\nThis building was a brothel.\n\"Haiya. Even in this world, they still spread STDs and AIDS. I pity for those thirsty men.\"\nThe dao avatar came out from Leo's body and mocked him, 'You're still a virgin, though.'\n\"Virgin with Godzilla physique, mind you.\"\nLeo snickered and looked around. Again, he started sniffing, tracking the scent of Cat. He walked while he looked up, causing the bystanders to give Leo a weird look.\nA young boy who walked on the street with his mother pointed at Leo.\n\"Mom. Look! A crazy beggar!\"\nThe mother panicked, \"Don't look. Come here. Let's go.\"\nLeo overheard it and flinched. He then looked at his dirty clothes and his arms.\nThey were covered in dirt and mud. Even his hair was messy because of the landslide earlier.\nHe needed a bath.\n\"Meh.\"\nLeo put his right palm on his head. Then, a stream of water came out from his hand, pouring down on him. Using the water pressure and the freshwater, Leo washed away the dirt from his body and his face.\nHowever, this action caused the stone road in the city to become wet. As the ancient road had no sophisticated drainage system, water gathered in several areas and created small puddles. Some of the water accidentally wet bystanders' shoes and clothes.\nAs Leo caused a lot of commotion, nearby commoners ran away from him and rushed to the authority outpost nearby.\n\"Help! A cultivator is ruining my store!\"\nAs soon as the commoner reported it to the local guards in the outpost, they rushed to the site to find the culprit.\nMeanwhile, Leo stopped pouring water on himself. He purchased a clean towel and a new set of clothes. He cleaned himself and changed into a new one while he was on the public street.\nThe guards spotted Leo, who was butt-naked on the road. They shouted.\n\"Arrest him!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 121 – Florida Man Outruns Cops by Mimicking Animals\nA group of 20 golden core cultivators blindly charged toward Leo. They ignored the strength difference and attacked with their palms in unison.\nTen palms hit Leo's chest and back while he hadn't finished changing his clothes. Their hands directly touched his skin.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo frowned while he was in the middle of wearing a new t-shirt. He wondered what their problem was.\n\"What's the big deal, dudes? Can't you see that I'm changing clothes?\"\nThe cultivators also frowned as their full-power attacks were ineffective. They then rechecked Leo's cultivation base.\nThe cultists' expressions turned dark as they were offended. However, none of them could see through Leo's cultivation base. The only thing they noticed was his rainbow aura.\n\"A soul formation cultivator?\" One of them guessed Leo's strength, but it was far off.\nLeo glanced at them for a moment. When he recalled that he didn't know the cult's headquarters' location, he had an idea.\n\"You there, boy. Are you one of those cultists? What was the name? Fatui Cult?\"\nThe cultists flinched as if they weren't Leo's opponent. All golden core cultivators took several steps back and pulled out their weapons from their spatial rings. Realizing that they weren't Leo's opponent, one of the cultists asked Leo to de-escalate the situation.\n\"Senior, this is a commoner's town. Someone with your status shouldn't cause trouble here. It will affect your reputation.\"\nNoticing how quickly their attitude changed, Leo was impressed.\n\"Ah, finally some smart people. I've met so many stupid cultivators that I feel sick. Or should I say, great strength comes with great idiocy? When a person is weak, that person cultivates brain cells? Too bad, they're a tat stupid. Shame.\"\n\"…\"\nNobody understood what Leo mumbled about.\n10 seconds later, the golden core cultists felt the burn from their palms. They looked at their hands in confusion.\nEverybody's hands swelled and turned purple. Their finger bones shattered while their arms grew new boneless limbs at a rapid rate. Two seconds later, the swelling disease reached their shoulders, enlarging their muscle mass and creating new organs at random.\nOne of them grew a large eyeball on his shoulder as if he was a villain character in Resident Evil. Two grew ribcages from their shoulders and spinal cords while the rest got extra limbs.\nThe mutation process seemed to benefit the cultivators at first. But when the purple blood reached their hearts, they collapsed and stopped breathing.\nLeo finally finished putting on his new clothes. He hummed and gazed at the dead mutated humans in a good mood. Sitting next to the corpses, Leo collected their bodies into his spatial ring, putting them in the same ring as the mysterious blue stone.\n\"Nice! Free yin fluid.\"\nNothing was better than free materials. Unfortunately, Leo couldn't steal their lifespan here as he was outside his domain.\nAfter storing the dead cultivators, Leo looked around.\nSurrounding Leo were hundreds of cowering commoners. They trembled and looked at Leo in fear, unable to move. As they were commoners, they didn't dare to do anything stupid like the guards.\nNoticing how the situation escalated, Leo sighed. He approached one of the onlookers and questioned them.\nThe person was a wandering merchant, who carried a wooden backpack full of trinkets and tools. He shivered as Leo approached.\nThe merchant was a 50-year-old man. He had a long and thick mustache, but he had no beard. His long messy hair was already grey, but he had a bald forehead.\n\"You, there.\"\n\"M-Me?\"\n\"Yes, you. Do you know where the Fatui Cult's headquarters is?\"\nThe merchant looked around him to ask for help, but the other commoners finally regained their leg strength and ran away.\nSeeing how he was abandoned, the merchant swallowed his fear and answered honestly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know. I'm also a visitor here.\"\n\"I see.\"\nLeo lightly snorted as he pitied himself for asking the wrong person. Still, feeling bad for the innocent bystander, Leo thought of something. He scanned his spatial rings, checking if he had something useful in this situation. He also picked up 20 spatial rings of the golden core cultivators earlier.\nIt was easy to find something valuable among the loot. Leo unsealed one of the rings and ejected a handful of spirit stones. As he directly touched the spirit stones, they were upgraded into essence stones.\nLeo flickered one of the essence stones to the merchant, which the latter barely caught it. Leo didn't forget to advertise his store.\n\"I see that you're a wandering merchant. If you have time, visit my humble store north of here. It's not far from Magpie City. You can't miss it! If you do, I'll sell you something good. Of course, it might be expensive, but they will be worth your time!\"\nAfter pitching the sale, Leo left the wondering merchant alone. He leaped to the sky.\n.\n.\n\"…\"\nJiang Cheng, the merchant, gulped and gazed at the essence stone in his hand for a moment. A few seconds later, he dropped it on the ground as it burnt his skin.\n\"Ow! It's hot!\"\nThe essence stone fell into one of the puddles. As soon as it touched the water, the clear puddle got contaminated and emitted rainbow light.\nJiang Cheng patted his scarred hands on his robes in pain. Still, as he was curious, he grabbed a pair of chopsticks from his ware and picked up the round stone.\nPLOP\nAs the essence stone looked like a glass marble, a pair of chopsticks weren't suitable for picking the round ball. The merchant switched his tool to fire tongs and picked it up.\nLooking at the item closer, the man widened his eyes in shock. He could roughly guess what it was even though it was incorrect.\n\"Isn't this a spirit stone?! A spirit stone that those immortals use?! I-If I use this, can I become an immortal or a cultivator like them?!\"\nJiang Cheng looked left and right. He took off his outer layer of robes and wrapped the essence stone. He then put the bundle of clothes in his wooden backpack and sprinted out of town.\nThe gate guards didn't stop the man. He let the guy out as many people came in and out every day, so there was no point checking leaving people.\nAfter leaving the city, the wandering merchant dryly laughed. He thought about Leo's words and looked north.\n\"I remember Magpie City. It's a small town that big firms ignore. Well, since there won't be as many competitors, should I pay them a visit and see what I can buy and resell? Also, I need a place to study about this!\"\nJiang Cheng had never had a chance to practice martial arts. He wondered if he could fly like the Fatui cultists in the Frozen Fire City too.\n.\n.\nAfter ditching the bald forehead merchant, Leo continued scanning the city, searching for landmarks and big buildings.\n\"Oh, there!\"\nLeo noticed the tallest pagoda not far from there. He thought of the pagodas in the mystic realm and wondered if weird monsters lived there as well.\nStill, the scent of Cat was getting thinner as the odor of commoners, latrines, and food mixed together. It started to smell the same.\nAfter landing, Leo stopped relying on his eyes and solely focused on his nose. He even concentrated and commanded his cells to focus on the olfactory system.\nThe living cancer cells were cooperative. Leo's face whitened as his transparent blood gathered in his face, carrying countless drops of element essence.\nLeo's five senses sharpened. Although his eyes couldn't perceive the color of the scent, his nose created a mental image of scent flow in his mind, filtering and differentiating each odor.\nHaving another mental map in his mind, Leo's body moved by instinct. He crawled on all four and sprinted like a dog.\nLeo didn't understand why he degraded himself to that of a dog. However, by lowering his stance, he picked up the scent better. Although he was ashamed and embarrassed, Leo pushed on and ignored the bystanders.\n\"WOOF-WOOF COMING THROUGH! Don't stand in my way, or I'll nom-nom woof you!\"\nAt first, Leo ran through the busy streets like a 4-legged animal. But after getting used to it, he started pushing his legs and arms longer, sprinting like a cheetah. Then, he started parkouring instinctively over people and obstacles in front of him.\nRunning for two kilometers, Leo arrived in front of a shabby wooden cabin in a slum area. However, two nascent soul cultivators stood in front of the building.\nLeo stopped running and stood on two legs. He patted his hands twice.\n\"Ah…\"\nHe suddenly flinched as he remembered something important. Along the way, he accidentally touched random objects with his bare hands when he parkouring through the crowded places.\nLeo secretly prayed that no innocent bystanders got hurt by the random radiation that he left behind.\n\"Oh, no. Anyway…\"\nHe gazed at the nascent soul cultivators, who already noticed Leo's arrival. They sweated profusely as they realized that Leo had a higher cultivation base than theirs.\n\"Gentlemen, I'll be brief. GTFO, or else.\"\nThe two guards looked at each other. They then cupped their fists and flew away without saying a word.\nLeo nodded in approval, \"Finally, some smart people. I hate dealing with idiots.\"\nResuming the posture of a 4-leg animal, Leo entered the building and followed Cat's scent.\n.\n.\nIt had been a week since every mystic realm portal on this planet was open. However, not everybody came out early as the emperor or Situ Nantian.\nFatui Cult sent many people into the same mystic realm. As there were two portals in their territory, they got to send 20 people in. However, nobody had come out to report about their expedition result yet.\nAs most big shots were away, the strongest person in the cult was just a soul transformation elder. He was also in charge of sacrificial rituals as he cultivated the rare blood element, which required cultivators to gather the blood of other cultivators to get stronger.\nIn front of an altar, the elder wore black robes and a black wood mask to cover his face. His scarce white hair couldn't hide his bald head and his pale skin.\nThe elder stared at the cages of today's sacrifices. He also frowned when he noticed the giant monster, who nonchalantly ate another disciple from his sect.\n\"What have you idiots captured!?\"",

It glowed in purple light, illuminating the dark building.\nAs Leo had no idea what it was, he sniffed the air, following Cat's scent. Strangely, it stopped in the middle of the magic circle.\nSince Leo's clue ended there. He stepped on the circle and inspected the floating characters. He reached out to touch one of them.\nThe character dissipated to particles upon contact. Then, the entire magic circle dimmed and got deactivated.\n\"What?\"\nLeo's disappointment was immeasurable, and his day was ruined. He scratched his head in frustration.\n\"How the hell do you activate this thing?! Goddammit. I should have dragged one of those fools along!\"\nBecause of his frustration, he stomped out of the building. He looked left and right, searching for one of the cultists in the area. Unfortunately, no cultivator was in sight. Only beggars and poor commoners nearby warily gazed at Leo.\nUnable to find a local cultivator, Leo thought of a sick plan. He looked up and stared at the tall pagoda at the center of the town.\nLeo paused to contemplate. He would surely find a cultivator there, but they might not cooperate with him. After all, not all cultivators were as friendly as people from the Life Sword Sect.\n\"Maybe later.\"\nLeo snorted and went back into the cabin. He returned to the deactivated magic circle. Crouching, Leo touched the stone floor.\nAnother weird idea came to his mind. He gently punched the ground.\nBOOM\nThe stone floor cracked and crumbled, revealing a hollow area underground.\nLeo fell into the large hole along with the debris, yet he smiled. His plan worked as intended.\n\"Ahah! I'm a genius!\"\nUpon landing, a few pieces of stone and rubble hit his head and his shoulders, but Leo ignored them. His green eyes shone as he scanned through the darkness.\nThe hollow area was not a natural cave or an underground waterway. Stone beams and pillars were visible everywhere. The ceiling was made from glowing purple metal that Leo had never seen before, and it emitted a foul odor of rotten rats. The purple fog around the metal frame was also thick, hindering Leo's visibility.\nSeeing the thick fog and the weird metal frames, Leo rubbed his hands in glee. He fiddled with the newly acquired spatial rings of the dead guards earlier.\nUseless grain pills, black clothes, cone hoodies, and random objects came out from the rings as Leo threw them away. He then glanced at the black uniform for a moment before he put them on.\nAfter dressing as one of the cultists, Leo pointed his finger at the pile of items. He silently thought to himself, commanding his cancer cells.\n'Can you guys create fire? I need to burn those things.'\nThe cells were very cooperative. Several transparent blood cells released fire element essence and transformed them into a stream of flame. As if Leo's finger turned into a flamethrower gun, it sprayed white flame at the pile of junk.\nThe non-element grain pills, clothes, and useless tools of the cultivators melted instantly. After everything turned to ash, Leo patted his finger and removed the fire.\nAfter clearing spaces in his spatial rings, Leo walked toward a purple metal pillar. He widely grinned and linked his Qi string from the purple metal and his spatial ring.\nWHOOSH\nJust like when Leo sucked the blue gemstone into his ring earlier, the entire pillar vanished into his ring's pocket inventory.\nRUMBLE\nAfter one of the pillars vanished, the ceiling slightly trembled. Dust and small stones fell from the tall ceiling.\nLeo looked up and rubbed his chin. Then, he thought of the commoners in the city, and his expression turned dark.\n'Tsk. I can't be greedy. I might enjoy collecting some idiots' lifespan, but I ain't Putin. I'm not into a senseless massacre.'\nAvoiding killing bystanding commoners, Leo stopped stealing another metal pillar. He explored the underground cave instead.\nIt wasn't difficult to locate new points of interest. Aside from the pillars and beams, four 10-meter-tall doors stood tall in four different directions – North, West, East, and South.\nThe underground cave's walls seemed asymmetrical. However, its general shape was a square, which was easy to navigate.\nLeo sniffed each door. Three of the doors smelled like concentrated smelling salt, which caused Leo to turn his head away and covered his nose. Although the scent heightened his senses and adrenaline, it was unpleasant.\nAs for the other door, aka the east gate, it had a thick scent of blood.\nTrusting his instinct, Leo chose to enter the east gate first. Instead of pushing the two doors open, Leo patted them and stored the massive metal doors in his spatial rings.\nIt was not about greed. It was about moral integrity. Since local cultivators abandoned these precious metals and used them as metal frames and doors, Leo believed that he could do them a favor by collecting their junk and researching them.\nAfter all, there was a saying – One man's trash is another man's treasure!\nAfter the doors vanished, a large underground hallway stood before Leo. Unlike this room, it was well-decorated with wall torches, human bones, and random Chinese words written in blood. However, no one had lightened the torches in the area.\nLeo smiled and was about to follow the path. However, he paused for a moment and made a U-turn. Returning to the north gate, Leo quietly stored the doors to his spatial rings. Then, he went to the other two gates and collected them as well.\nNothing was left behind, except the metal frames that supported the ceiling.\nAfter grabbing the precious metal doors, Leo returned to the bloody hallway. He walked in the dark while he adjusted his robes.\n.\nWalking a kilometer, Leo came across another gate. This time, it was a single glowing gate. Its purple light was brighter than the beams and pillars in the previous room, and the fog was even thicker and smellier.\nOn the door's surface, there was an emblem that the previous four doors didn't have. It was the image of a cone mask that the cultists always wore.\nLooking at the emblem, Leo was disgusted. He was even more disturbed that he was wearing their uniform.\n'I pray that you don't discriminate against another race, or I'll freaking turn y'all into yin fluid!'\nLeo braced the fog and put his palms on the single gate. Then, he tried to steal it.\nAs soon as Leo touched it, the emblem shone and unleashed a shockwave blast. A strong gale made Leo's robes flutter, and his cone hoodie was blown away.\nHowever, that did nothing to him. He stood there, picking his nose. He scooped a centimeter-diameter booger ball out from his nostril. He inspected it because of the old habit, after which he tried to flicker it away, but it got stuck on his finger.\nAfter combating the sticky booger for a minute, Leo surrendered. He pressed the booger against the door and swiped it away from his finger.\nEven though the booger was a collective bacteria and small particles, the majority of it was made from Leo's bodily fluid. Thus, it contained a thick amount of essence.\nAs soon as the booger was planted on the door, it began transforming the metal door. From purple, it turned red, and the metal door expanded larger.\nCREAK\nThe loud sound of moving metal echoed underground before the entire door distorted and bent because of its large size. A few seconds later, it was folded in half, and it stopped glowing.\nLeo tilted his head in confusion as he had no clue what just happened. He shrugged and collected the folded metal door and proceeded forward.\nAfter entering another room, Leo came across a populated area. As soon as he entered, he found a hundred cultists in the same clothes, looking at him.\n\"WHO ARE YOU?!\"\nLeo paused for a moment. He then pointed at his clothes and feigned ignorance.\n\"Ain't I one of you?\"\n\"…\"\nAs most cultists always wore masks, they couldn't remember every member's face. They stared at Leo in doubt, but half of them only glanced at his robes and looked away.\n\"Where's your mask? Why are you coming from that gate?\"\n\"Ah, my mask?\" Leo touched his face and smacked his forehead. \"My bad. That stupid door suddenly spat on my face and blew my mask away. It should be somewhere in the hallway.\"\n\"You haven't answered all my questions. Why are you coming from that hallway? That place should have been sealed!\"\n\"Sealed? Oh.\"\nLeo smacked his lips. He pondered if he should continue playing it cool like Agent 47 or if should he start genociding. Since he found the situation fun, he picked the first option first.\n\"There was an accident. I tried to use the usual teleportation array, but it collapsed on me. When I realized it, I got trapped in an abandoned room. It took me a while to get back here.\"\nThat was a random excuse. Leo crossed his fingers and revealed a bad pokerface.\nThe cultists stared at Leo for a while. Some of them brought a torch closer to see Leo's face. But as soon as they got a clearer look, the cultists instantly noticed Leo's rainbow aura, which reflected the torchlight.\nNoticing Leo's superior cultivation base, a hundred cultists knelt in panic.\n\"FORGIVE US, SENIOR! WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD VISIT THE OUR CHAMBER!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo blankly stared at the crowd. He frowned for a moment.\nNoticing that Leo stopped talking, everybody took off their masks and hoodies, revealing their faces. Surprisingly, they were all old men.\nNoticing their ages, Leo wryly smiled. He figured out why they weren't intimidated by his look and appearance age.\n\"Which chamber is this?\" Leo continued playing it cool.\n\"T-This is lowly priest residential area, senior. Only golden core and nascent soul priests live here.\"\n\"Oh, just you? Is there anybody else?\"\n\"No, senior. Most of the priests have gathered at the sacrificial city. I think the elder priest will perform another sacrifice ritual soon since they have captured a 7th-grade plant monster.\"\n\"Hoh?\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He finally heard something interesting, \"Tell me more about the ritual. Who the hell is holding an event while I was away?\"\n\"T-This…\"\nThe cultists sweated profusely. They gave Leo a nervous look, mistaking him for one of the high priests that had participated in a mystic realm expedition.\n\"S-Senior, w-while you were in the middle of the expedition, our priests managed to capture the monster by chance. T-The elder priest plans to use it to boost his cultivation base and attack the quasi-immortal realm today!\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLeo nodded as he believed that Cat might be there. He crouched in front of the priest and smiled.\n\"Can you lead me to them?\"\n\"O-Of course, senior!\"\n\"Then, get up and show me the way. I'm old, and I'm kinda forgetful. I always got lost around here.\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 123 – Armed Florida Man Interrupted Baptism Ceremony to Rescue His Cat. One Pastor Killed.\nStanding on the altar was Situ Shang, one of many Situ Clan agents. The elder wore cone-shaped headwear like the others. Nobody could see his face or his skin underneath his clothes.\nSitu Shang served both Situ Clan and the Fatui Cult as he practiced a unique cultivation method, which enabled him to cultivate Blood Element Qi. Because of such a method, he reached the soul transformation stage before his age even reach 200. However, the next stage required a lot of sacrifices and assistance from the Fatui Cult.\nAbusing the authority of the Fatui Cult while all core members were away, Situ Shang managed to abduct commoners, cultivators, and monster beasts around the continent and gather them in the underground city. The next hurdle was to break the limitations of mortal and reach the quasi-immortal stage.\nHowever, Situ Shang needed a catalyst for his blood element essence to reach the next stage. The sacrifices were insufficient for him.\nSitu Shang glared at Cat in the cage. Although she never stopped eating random cultists nearby, the Situ elder refrained from making a move on her. Instead, he inwardly sneered at the disciples and Cat.\n'Keep eating, you monster. When you're full, I'll kill you and get your monster core. Oh, I can't just stand still and do nothing. I have to command these fools to start the ritual.'\nThe elder coughed and ordered everybody.\n\"Start the ritual! Drain the captive' blood. As for that monster, stay away from it! Array masters, seal the cage and prevent the vines from coming out!\"\n.\n.\nThe priests and disciples rushed to work, hoping to gain some contributions and leftover Qi from the ritual. A dozen cultists threw talismans into the air.\nYellow papers shone and floated around Cat's cage. They formed a dome barrier array, trapping Cat from poking her vines out.\nTINK\nHer thorn vines touched the array, but an electric current zapped her. She pulled her vines back.\nCat took her time. She chew the last guy in her mouth until his flesh and bones melted into a liquid. After digesting the juicy meat, Cat looked around. Her humanoid torso also came out to explore the underground city.\nNoticing how she was trapped, Cat pouted. She had the urge to cry and call Leo for help like a spoiled child. But then, her eyes spotted so many strangers, who never hid their hostile intents and murderous aura.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nThe chomper mouth widely smiled, and so did her human face. Since many edible humans were present there, it would have been a waste to scream and call for Leo to help her. She might as well kill these people for food.\nShe wanted to hog all cultists to herself.\nThe girl cackled and lashed eight thorn vines at the cage. The metal bars were snapped in half upon impact while shrapnel and pieces of small steel pipes flew in every direction.\nDONG\nDONG\nThe shrapnel and cage's pieces hit the array dome and bounced back. None of the fragments harmed the surrounding cultists.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\nCat pushed forward. She swung her pride thorn whips and the barrier.\nThe first few hits did nothing to the dome. She managed to cause several ripples in the formation, but she couldn't get through the barrier.\nHer strength, which had been nurtured through her food and Leo's influence, was stimulated by her desperation. She cladded her thorn whips with wood element essence and tried again. Putting more force into each strike, she targeted the same spot that she had hit earlier.\nCLANK\nIn one hit, the talisman array barrier was broken. All floating talismans turned into normal paper and flew by the wind.\nThe array masters around Cat coughed blood as they suffered a backlash from the destroyed array. Some of them collapsed to the ground, falling unconscious.\nAs soon as Cat broke free, she charged at the largest crowd in front of the altar, where the cultists had gathered their captives and sacrifices. Without discrimination, Cat swallowed everybody in her path and captured as many humans as she could with her thorn vines.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nThat was not all. Cat summoned her dao avatar to merge with her physique. When they became one, she grew 10 meters taller. Her size expanded until her human head hit the ceiling.\n\"Mya?!\"\nCat stopped growing. Instead, she shrank her body mass to reduce her height by a meter. She then looked up and rubbed the top of her head.\nWhen she stabilized, she heard the command of their leader.\n\"NOW! KILL ALL CAPTIVES AND KILL THAT MONSTER!\"\n.\n.\nSitu Shang sneered at Cat after she transformed into a giant chomper plant. He believed that it was time to harvest her monster core.\nAfter ordering his men, Situ Shang summoned his dao avatar. A spirit emerged from his body and floated behind him.\nThe dao avatar was a tall and slender young man in a robe. He had long vampire fangs and elf ears. However, his bright crimson pupils were the same as blood.\nThe dao avatar opened his arms and screeched. Suddenly, all liquid blood and blood cells within a hundred meters gathered in him. Each droplet became Situ Shang's element Qi.\nAfter extracting blood from his surroundings, Situ Shang pointed his left fingertip at Cat.\n\"Blood Sovereign! Blood Spear!\"\nAfter shouting his technique name, the dao avatar merged with the collected blood and transformed himself into a crimson spear. It floated in mid-air for a moment. Then, it accelerated toward Cat at the speed of sound.\nCat instantly turned around and opened her chomper mouth. She caught the spear with her teeth.\nThe blood spear instantly exploded, scattering blood droplets everywhere. Some of the blood splashed on Cat's skin.\nSIZZLE\nThe crimson fluid was as hot as magma, causing Cat's skin to sizzle because of the intense heat. She frowned and patted her chomper mouth to get rid of the hot acidic liquid from her body.\n\"AGAIN!\"\nSitu Shang hadn't finished his technique. He straightened his fingertip and summoned another spear.\nThe scattered blood droplets earlier gathered in front of Situ Shang. At the same time, his men began slaughtering the captives and other sacrifices, which spilled more blood. As more fluid was within range, Situ Shang's blood spear became bigger and longer.\nCat also noticed the trend. She threw her prey away and focused on the elder. However, she paused for a moment as she calculated how to defeat this foe.\nLooking at the elder, Cat recalled how Leo fought. The chomper's mouth curved up into a wide grin as Cat weaved her vines into a massive arm and fist. She applied wood, metal, water, fire, and earth element essence into the fist and threw a punch toward her target.\nSensing the crisis, Situ Shang kicked the ground.\nBOOM\nThe punch hit the altar and destroyed half of the building. However, Cat's attack hadn't finished yet.\nAs Cat's vine arm and fist had no joint, she used it as a whip, lashing at Situ Shang.\n\"Impudence!\"\nRealizing that he couldn't dodge the strike, Situ Shang transformed the mass of blood spear into a blood barrier dome, covering himself.\nBOOM\nThe thorn arm directly hit Situ Shang. However, something unexpected occurred.\nThe blood dome around Situ Shang remained intact. However, Cat's arm was cut in half!\n\"MYA?!\"\nCat screamed in pain and confusion as she didn't understand how her proud element essence was destroyed by a simple corrosive blood barrier.\n\"HAHAHAHAHA! Foolish monster! My blood element essence is superior to the basic five elements! Your Qi is nothing but food for my power!\"\n\"…\"\nCat gave Situ Shang a meaningful look. She glanced at her severed thorn vines, which rapidly blackened as if they were mutating.\nSeeing the mutating vines, Cat thought of Leo again. She imagined what Leo would do in her position. But suddenly, she remembered the teaching of the mysterious voice.\n\"Munya!\"\nMimicking the mysterious master's voice, Cat used a new technique.\nCat's severed vines began producing black liquid. She deeply inhaled and commanded the fluid to gather in front of her human torso. When the black blood mass was as big as the humanoid part, Cat transformed it into a mannequin before she hardened the substances.\nA female black mannequin, which was made from Cat's blood, appeared for the first time.\n\"A summoning art?\" Situ Shang narrowed his eyes and sneered at Cat, \"Your struggle is futile! Your fate is sealed, monster. Now, surrender and give me your monster core, and I'll give you a painless death!\"\nCat said nothing. She commanded the black mannequin.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\"\nThe black mannequin looked up while it was floating in mid-air. Her face and head slowly wiggled and transformed into a pretty woman's face. She slowly grew long black hair and evolved her torso to become as slender as a modern model.\nThe transformation was completed in seconds. The black mannequin raised her head and glared at Situ Shang. Then, she vanished.\n\"!!!\"\nSitu Shang recognized the technique. It was the same technique that Situ Nantian always used when the latter traveled around the continent.\nWHOOSH\nInstantly, the mannequin appeared in front of the elder. Her punch directly hit the man's gut.\n\"GAAAH!!\"\nSitu Shang bent forward upon impact. He vomited a stream of fluid from his mouth before the punch's momentum pushed Situ Shang toward the ceiling.\nBOOM\nThe elder's back hit the ceiling before he fell to the ground.\nThe mannequin pursued to finish off the foe. But as soon as Situ Shang fell to the ground, his body transformed into a pool of blood.\nCat and the mannequin paused as they were confused. They had no idea how to deal with a shapeshifting opponent.\nRUMBLE\nAs more blood came out from the sacrifices, they condensed and gathered into a dozen blood masses, floating in mid-air. Because of the movements, the mannequins and Cat looked at them for a moment.\nThat distraction was their mistake.\nPU!\nThe blood pool earlier transformed into a spike and pierced through the black mannequin's chest! The spike quickly wrapped around the doll, and the face of Situ Shang appeared among the floating blood.\n\"Fool! I'm the blood master! You cannot kill me! I AM IMMORTAL-\"\n\"Say what?\"\nA foreign voice and the weird accent of an old man interrupted Situ Shang's sentences. He momentarily looked at the person.\nApproaching the sacrificial altar and the chaos was a group of hundred cultists, who escorted a strange old man here. In addition, Situ Shang had never seen this old man before.\nFFZZZHKKRRGGH\nAn energy hum echoed in the underground city as a rainbow sword flew toward the black mannequin. It pierced through a layer of blood, but it didn't harm her body.\nThe mannequin turned to look at Leo and glanced at the lightsaber. She grabbed the handle and weaved it around.\nSWUA\nThe lightsaber sliced and burnt the blood spike and the mass around her. The mannequin fell to the ground and looked at the damage she had caused.\n\"AAAAAAAHHH!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!\"\nSitu Shang's real body emerged from one of the floating blood masses. White smoke came out from his body as he narrowly escaped from the burning sword. He glared at the mannequin's lightsaber for a moment before he turned to the intruder.\n\"YOU! YOU ARE COURTING DEATH-\"\nBANG!\nA rubber bullet, cladded with Leo's element essence, pierced through Situ Shang's head. The latter's consciousness turned black without realizing what hit him.\n.\n.\nLeo calmly stood while he held the gunpoint toward Situ Shang's floating corpse. He yawned.\n\"Can we finish this quick? I'm tired. I wanna sleep.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 124 – WHO Baffled as Florida Man Successfully Cured COVID by Spitting into Patient's Mouth\nA few minutes earlier\nLeo followed the crowd to a massive horror hallway, where dried corpses, blood stains, skeletons, and human body parts piled into mountains. He glanced at the scene and pursed his lips, having the urge to contaminate everything and bring them to his alchemy workshop.\n\"So many treasures,\" uttered Leo.\nThe cultists laughed in elation, \"Of course, senior. We've brought in so many sacrifices this year.\"\n\"Situ Shang?\"\nIt was Leo's first time hearing of Situ surname. He still had no idea that he had defeated Situ Nantian, who was the strongest among Situ Clan's cultivators in this world.\n\"Yes, senior. After you and everybody has entered the mystic realm, Elder Priest Situ Shang has been managing the cult. He said that he was about to reach the quasi-immortal stage soon. If we can bring him enough sacrifices, he promised to contribute his blood element cultivation method to the sect and allow us to cultivate it.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes for a moment and turned his attention to the mountains of corpses. He secretly checked the age and gender of the sacrifices.\nMost of the dead bodies were adult and old men. Some beasts' carcasses were in the mix. Although everything looked perfectly fine for a villain organization, Leo was still disgusted by their ethic and warped philosophies.\nThese guys weren't qualified to be his customers, Leo thought. They deserved to rot in hell.\nLooking enough, Leo averted his eyes from the piles of dead bodies. But as he walked without looking at the road, his feet kicked something small.\nLeo looked at his feet. Then, he noticed a dead body of a 3-or-4-year-old little boy. The dead body looked like a dried mummy whose blood had been drained.\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression turned dark. He knelt and flipped the dead body. When it was flipped over, Leo could see the child's wide eyes. The boy's despair and desperation could be seen in his expression as he died with his eyes wide open.\nSilently, Leo reached out and touched the child's face. He closed the boy's eyes and inwardly prayed.\n'They will pay. Be patient.'\nAs Leo directly touched the dead body, the corpse crumbled into dust.\nLeo stood up and quietly followed the crowd. He pulled out a pistol and a repaired lightsaber from his spatial ring, preparing a massacre.\nBOOM\nAs Leo was about to activate the avenger mode, a loud explosion from the end of the hallway interrupted his thought. Leo and the cultists looked forward.\n\"Someone is fighting!\"\nThe cultists sprinted in the direction. As for Leo, he cocked the pistol, preparing to backstab everybody. But then, his nose caught the scent of Cat. In addition, a thick iron-like odor kicked Leo's nose.\nFlashback scenes of Cat entered Leo's mind. His pupil color changed from green to red, and his sclera turned black. For the second time in this world, the kind and silly Florida Man was angry. This time, his rage surpassed when Situ Nantian stole his goodies.\nKicking the ground, Leo leaped forward and sprinted on the wall, overtaking the cultists. He arrived at the altar area before the group. Upon arrival, Leo looked up and found Cat.\nHowever, she was not in good condition. Her vines were severed, and she bled black blood. Not far from her, a black mannequin lady's stomach got punctured by a spike, and slime-like blood threatened to devour her.\nLeo also overheard their conversation.\n\"Fool! I'm the blood master! You cannot kill me! I AM IMMORTAL-\"\n\"Say what?!\" Leo uttered, but his voice echoed in the chasm.\nNot thinking of anything, Leo threw the lightsaber toward the mannequin.\nThe mannequin lady caught the lightsaber and glanced at Leo. As soon as she saw him, she and Cat reacted in unison as they recognized him.\nAlthough the mannequin's physique was made from Cat's blood, her face was capable of expressing emotions. For the first time, the mannequin lady proudly smiled.\nUsing the lightsaber, Cat's dao avatar broke free from the blood restraints and the spike. After getting back to the ground, she gazed at the damaged spike and the mass of blood.\nStrangely, the blood slime failed to merge or come back to life. They melted and burnt because of the sword's energy.\nThe mannequin gazed at the lightsaber, impressed and astonished. She then looked at her savior and Cat.\nMeanwhile, Situ Shang felt the burn from the lightsaber. He transferred his consciousness to another floating blood mass and reconstructed his body.\n\"AAAAAAAHHH!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!\"\nHe soon spotted Leo, who had thrown the lightsaber at the mannequin.\nIn anger, Situ Shang glared at Leo, and their eyes met.\nLeo silently aimed his pistol toward Situ Shang's head. His mannequin dao avatar also merged his hand with Leo's, assisting the aim.\n\"YOU! YOU ARE COURTING DEATH-\"\nBANG!\nThe bullet pierced through Situ Shang's head and exploded his brain out from the back hole. No fancy effect occurred as Leo didn't bother adding too many drops of his element essence or Qi.\nThe floating body of Situ Shang was suspended in the air for a few seconds before it fell to the ground.\n\"ELDER SITU?!\"\nThe cultists looked at Leo and Situ Shang in shock as the fight happened so fast. The people around the altar were also stunned as they didn't expect a fellow cultist to kill each other. Moreover, none of the cultists had seen the artifact in Leo's hand before.\nThe cultists shivered and trembled in fear. Even though Leo had murdered one of their elders, they didn't have the guts to retaliate. After all, the strongest cultivators here were nascent soul cultivators. They were aware that they couldn't defeat Leo, whose aura resembled soul formation cultivators.\nLeo complained and yawned.\n\"Can we finish this quick? I need to sleep. I'm tired.\"\nIgnoring Leo, Cat shed tears of joy. She jumped.\n\"Meow <3\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. I love you too. Also, who is this black lady? Is she your friend?\"\nCat turned to the black blood mannequin. The hole in her stomach was already healed as her physique was made from liquid. She faced Leo and slightly bowed her head.\nLeo looked back and forth between Cat and the mannequin. He let out a short sigh.\n\"Fine. I'll ask you two later.\"\nHe turned his attention to the other cultists around him.\nAs random combat would have been troublesome, Leo came up with an idea. He shouted.\n\"FORM RANKS, IDIOTS! STAND 10 ROWS IN FRONT OF ME IF YOU DON'T WANNA DIE!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe people jolted and ran toward Leo. However, as Cat was still in her giant form and the mannequin was still on the loose, not everybody followed his order.\nNoticing that the crowd didn't follow Leo's instructions, he pointed at Cat.\n\"Guess what?! That monster over there is my freaking DAUGHTER! WHOEVER MESSES WITH HER MESS WITH ME! CAPISCE?!\"\nHearing Leo's words, their brains computed and understood why Leo killed Situ Shang. They rushed toward Leo and stood in rows and columns, ignoring the presence of Cat and the mannequin lady.\nWhen everybody in the chasm finished gathering, Leo let out a sigh of relief. He stared at them, pondering if he should massacre everybody here at the same time or capture them in his domain.\nStill, human trafficking, senseless murdering, and promoting dubious rituals were unforgivable crimes by Leo's standards. He had no intention of leaving them alive.\n'I might as well terminate this stupid organization. I need to expand my store domain south one day, and these idiots are in the way. Welp. Time for some yin liquid harvesting!'\nComing up with an idea, Leo also purchased a large bucket from a system store. He then spat several times into the bucket and filled it with water, using his water Qi.\nAfter the bucket was full, Leo ordered the crowd.\n\"One by one, bring your cup and scoop the water from the bucket! Do not drink it yet!\"\n\"???\"\nThe crowd was confused. As they saw Leo spit into the container, their expressions were complex as they were disgusted. Still, as it was an order from a senior cultivator, they had no choice but to comply.\nOne after another, the cultists brought out a cup, a glass, or a bamboo canteen from their spatial rings. They took the water from the bucket and went back to the line.\nAs over two hundred cultists were present in the chasm, Leo quickly ran out of water. He was forced to spit several more times and refilled the container with his Qi. Then, he continued the process until everybody got theirs.\nThree hours later, everybody got their water. They stared at the containers in their hands, wondering what Leo was trying to do. As they inspected further, they discovered that the water surface glittered in rainbow light.\n\"What is this water?\"\n\"T-The elder spat in it. What is he doing?\"\n\"Isn't this element Qi?\"\nNobody could guess Leo's intention. They waited for his next order.\nWhen everybody returned to their position, Leo gave them the next order, which shocked them.\n\"VERY GOOD! NOW, DRINK THE ELIXIR IN YOUR HANDS! NO EXCEPTION!\"\n\"W-What?!\"\nEverybody was taken aback as they hadn't forgotten how Leo spat into the bucket. They looked at the water containers in their hands in disgust.\nStill, Leo's order was absolute. Fearing death, more than half of the cultists drank the water while the rest waited to see the result.\nLeo wasn't naïve when he dealt with his prisoners. He looked at Cat.\n\"Cat. Nom-Nom the idiots that haven't drunk the water yet!\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\"\nWithout hesitation, Cat regrew her vines and snatched 50 cultists in the yard. Not bothering with their clothes and spatial rings, she threw them into her chomper mouth and chewed them in glee.\n\"NOOOO!! FORGIVE US!!\"\nAs Cat hadn't captured all of them in one try, the rest of the cultists covered their noses and downed the water in their throats. After drinking the diluted spit, they knelt and begged Leo.\n\"We drank it. We've drunk it, senior! Please forgive us!\"\n\"We didn't know, senior! It was Situ Shang's fault!\"\n\"Please don't kill us!\"\nLeo snorted. He walked toward the mannequin lady and took back the lightsaber. He deactivated it and put it back into his spatial ring, after which he crossed his arms and silently stared at the remaining crowd.\nHe counted as he waited.\n\"Seven… Eight… Nine…\"\nThe people were more confused. They counted along.\n\"Ten? Eleven? Twelve… UGH!\"\nA cultist squeezed his throat and collapsed to the ground. He trembled and uncontrollably convulsed. After the first guy showed the symptom of mutation, the others also began to scream.\n\"AAAAHHH!!\"\n\"P-POISON!!\"\n\"NOOOOO!!\"\nThe remaining cultists in the chasm courtyard squirmed in pain. Their muscle mass swelled and bloated as their blood multiplied.\n\"Shwifty-one…Shwifty-two…\"\nAs torturing these cultists improved Leo's mood, his accent degraded. He started counting and using baby language.\n\"Shwifty… Five? Man. This takes me back to the classical age of YouTube.\"\n.\nThat day, Cat and the mannequin watched how Leo mutated and killed 200 cultists at once while the guy randomly danced like a lunatic in the middle of the corpse field.",

Meticulously, Leo inspected every spatial ring and ejected useless items. Then, he used them to store the mutated corpses to bring back home.\nWhen he finished cleaning the mess, Leo went back to the pile of human corpses that the cultists had discarded.\nAlthough Leo wasn't a religious person, he held his hands and prayed.\n\"Y'all can rest in peace. I've avenged you. Those mofos are now rotting in hell.\"\nLeo bitterly smiled and patted the mountains of corpses with his bare hand. Dried bones and old dead bodies instantly turned to dust while wet corpses turned black.\nAs Leo had no intention of desecrating regular people, he pointed his finger at them.\n\"Cancer cells, can I have some fire Qi, please? I need a torch to burn them.\"\nFWOOSH\nLeo's blood cells were always cooperative. A stream of flame came out from Leo's fingertip and burn the victims' remains.\nMeanwhile, Cat and her mannequin subordinate had nothing to do. As Leo seemed busy, they helped him gather the mutated corpses into one place. While they were at it, they secretly stole a couple mutated corpses and shoved them in Cat's mouth.\nAs the black mannequin lady was originally Cat's blood, her time in this world was limited. 10 minutes after coming out to life, she reverted into a puddle of black blood and returned to Cat's body.\nCat's dao avatar also returned to her side after she had possessed the mannequin. She patted her master's human head and laughed at her.\n.\nWhen all the dead victims got their respective cremation, Leo turned his attention to the living. He gazed at the captives, who survived the onslaught earlier.\nA hundred cages trapped over a thousand men and women. Most of them were poor people in ragged clothes while over 100 of them were children.\nUnfortunately, not everybody was lucky. When the cultists extracted their blood earlier, they got hit by their Daoist techniques. Everybody in the cages was dead.\nLeo opened the cages and inspected the victims one after another, searching for survivors. Unfortunately, no miracle existed for the weak.\nAlthough sad and angry, Leo patiently burned the carriages along with the corpses of the victims, disallowing the other cultists from outside to use their dead bodies for dubious purposes.\nAfter thrashing and burning everything, Leo looked at Cat.\n\"Have you played enough?\"\n\"…Meow,\" Cat pouted as she thought that Leo would scold her.\n\"Let's go home.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\n\"Also, you have a lot of explanation to do. Did you steal my food again?!\"\n\"MYA!!\"\nCat's pupils dilated. She reverted to her chomper form and sprinted away from Leo in panic.\n\"COME BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE SHIT!\"\nLeo laughed, but he didn't run after her. He gazed at the underground city and narrowed his eyes.\nHe hadn't found the Fatui Cult's treasury yet. Unless he could steal their valuables and treasures, this cult could always recover their losses. For the sake of annihilating the Fatui Cult to its roots, Leo didn't follow Cat home. He explored the city and searched for other cultists. After all, the underground city was huge.\n.\nWalking randomly in the underground city for six hours, Leo got a lot of souvenirs for Gao Yan and Wu Buyi. He found several bottles of pills and herb fields in some gardens and collected everything.\nAfter ransacking the last house, Leo stopped exploring the underground city. He turned his attention to the other sections of the underground labyrinth.\nAside from the sacrificial altars and the city, Leo found a hundred doors, which connected to other rooms and hallways. When Leo explored them, he discovered that the hallways brought him to the surface instead.\nNot wanting to leave yet, Leo returned to the underground city. He backtracked to the area that he had fallen into earlier as he remembered that there were other paths that he hadn't checked yet.\nGetting back to the abandoned underground area with smelling salt doors, Leo looked at the south gate, the north gate, and the west gate. He shut down the sense of smell for the sake of his sanity and approach the south gate first.\nOnce Leo stored the purple doors, a new path led him to a new area. Walking along the hallway, Leo came across a prison area.\nThe same purple steel bars and prison rooms were made from the same material, which seemed odd. Leo looked into each cell to see if anybody got trapped there.\nUnfortunately, only old skeletons remained. Spider webs, stale air, and trick layers of dust told Leo that nobody had come here in ages.\nLeo covered his nose and explored further into the prison to search for a survivor.\nAt the end of the prison hallway, Leo came across a 10-meter-tall prison cell. Inside the room was a dried corpse of a little girl, whose arms and legs were chained to the wall. Strangely, on the bars, silver talismans never stopped shining, emitting strong yang element essence.\nLeo glanced at the talismans. Then, he looked at the prisoner's corpse. After that, Leo checked the talismans again.\n\"I have a feeling that something will go wrong if I steal these talismans. Should I remove it? Decision. Decision.\"\nLeo crossed his arms and deeply pondered, calculating the pros and the cons. His instinct cried that he shouldn't remove the talismans as they might be sealing something dangerous inside, especially the chained little girl. However, his greediness urged him to snatch the talismans and eat them to boost his lifespan.\nBut in the end, Leo's confidence in his abilities supported his greed. He pulled the silver talismans on the bars and shoved them in his spatial rings, keeping them as food.\nRUMBLE\nThe earth trembled as soon as Leo removed one of them. The other talismans also ceased emitting light, and the yang element essence around the cell was gone.\nLeo paused for a moment as he had a bad feeling about this. He wryly smiled.\n\"Meh. What could go wrong? At best, I'll just die again.\"\nHe shrugged and pulled other silver talismans, not leaving anything behind. After collecting the last lifespan paper, Leo glanced at the dead loli on the wall.\nBut the corpse was no longer there.\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression turned into a pokerface meme. The corners of his mouth slightly curved up into a grin, and his eyes looked up as if he mischievously mimicked a meme.\n\"F*ck.\"\nCHOMP!\nSomething small latched onto Leo's back and bit his nape. Four small fangs poked his skin, but they failed to penetrate it. Still, the fangs managed to push his skin one centimeter deep.\nWhile being attacked, Leo stood still. He tried chatting with the assailant.\n\"Erm, you might die again if you touch my skin. But I guess it's too late to warn you.\"\nGRRR\nThe little girl inside the cell earlier clung to Leo's back. Leo wasn't surprised that she suddenly came back to life after he removed the talismans as he had seen this template in movies before. Still, he found it funny that he experienced this horror scheme first-handed.\nThe girl kept trying to bite him. A minute later, her four fangs broke in half.\n\"…Ugh.\"\nFinally, the girl groaned. Then, her hoarse voice entered Leo's ears.\n\"…What…are…you?\"\nLeo snickered. While the girl clung to him, he leisurely walked out of the prison. He also introduced himself.\n\"Just a passing-by Florida Man. Nice to meet you, kid. Also, you're welcome.\"\nThe girl stopped talking. She seemed exhausted after the biting attempt. Still, she seemed immune to his cancer cells for some reason.\nLeo was also surprised that the girl didn't mutate after touching him for a minute. He thought of the monsters in the mystic realm, such as a giant tarantula spider and thunder unicorns. He wondered if strong monsters managed to naturally evolve and develop immunity to cancer cells.\nAs the girl wouldn't die from cancer, Leo decided to give her a hand. After all, he might be able to extract her lifespan after this. Since she seemed to be thirsty, Leo created water with his Qi and splashed it on her face.\n\"You thirsty, kid?\"\nThe girl accidentally swallowed the water. She coughed several times, but she drank it anyway. However, the water and Leo's attitude irritated her.\n\"…I'm… no kid.\"\n\"Really? How old are you, then?\"\n\"…Older… than your grandfather.\"\n\"Oh? Are you over 50,000 years old?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe girl squinted her brows, confused. She slowly grabbed the back of his neck with her small hands and extended her fingernails. Slowly, she clawed Leo's nape.\nAgain, the claw was ineffective. Leo's skin was unharmed.\n\"…You… You're a monster.\"\n\"I got that a lot when I beat up some talking Kaijus. Anyway, thanks for scratching that. Can I ask you a favor and scratch my left back? I think my stupid cancer cells are having a feast of dust mites over there, and it's itchy. Can you scratch it for me?\"\n\"…\"\nThe girl froze. For the first time in her life, she met a weirdo, the strongest weirdo.\nWhile chatting, Leo reached the west gate of the previous room. He walked along the hallway and reached another area. This time, it was a room, full of skeletons.\nLeo sat and inspected a skull. Strangely, the skull had long fangs, but it resembled a human skull.\nThe girl glanced at the skeleton mountain. She groaned again.\n\"Damn cultivators. If I was in my prime, the likes of Situ and Yan couldn't possibly harm my kin!\"\nLeo smiled as she sounded a lot clearer, \"Say, kid. Are you one of these dead people?\"\n\"They're my people, so what?\"\n\"Then, are you a vampire or something? Your kin's fangs are kinda long.\"\nThe girl snorted, \"Don't lump us together with those blood-sucking fiends. We're the nobles of the night! We don't even need blood to live!\"\n\"But your fangs…\"\n\"Those are for hunting!\"\nLeo shrugged. He turned around and returned to the room earlier. Afterward, he tried the north gate next.\nWhile walking the girl didn't give up trying to kill Leo. She clawed him, using the best of her abilities. However, he didn't budge, and his skin was unscratched.\nFrustrated, the girl revealed her identity.\n\"You're not human! What are you?! Why can't I, the Immortal Lich Empress, kill you?!\"\nLeo stopped walking. He then burst into laughter.\n\"Immortal Lich Empress? You? HAHAHAHAHAHA!\"\nThe lich loli was enraged. She punched the back of Leo's head, but it did nothing to him. From an onlooker's perspective, she looked like a little girl throwing a tantrum.\n\"How dare you humiliate this queen!? I'll kill you!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. Keep trying, kid.\"\n\"You…\"\nIgnoring the kid, Leo entered the north section of the abandoned area. Then, he arrived at a small courtyard with a decayed mansion.\nStone statues of gargoyles were half broken as they all lost their heads. The walls and the doors were also in ruins. In front of the mansion was a garden area, but only dead plants remained.\nAs for the mansion, it still looked as new. A red dome covered the entire building, protecting the resident from external influence.\nWhen Leo approached the mansion, he discovered the same silver talismans around the area. Someone deliberately placed them around the structure as if they wanted to seal the residents inside.\nLeo scoffed and collected the talismans around the mansion. Again, as soon as he picked one of them, the formation array was broken, and the array's effects were dispelled.\nThe girl narrowed her eyes as she observed how Leo collected the talismans.\n\"Why are you helping us?\" Asked the girl.\n\"I'm not helping you. I'm just a scavenger, and I'm taking some goodies home.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, nice to meet you, empress. Can you get off my back now?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 126 – Florida Man Abducts Children Home, Discovers They Are Adult Cosplayers\nEsen was the empress of an ancient civilization, the Molg Empire. She was once the lich empress, who ruled over a million vampires, death knights, and arch liches, aka the country's only population.\n5,000 years ago, Esen and her undead empire governed the main continent of this planet. She coexisted along with the local creatures as she kept the undead population minimum. Because of her policies and laws, her people learned to be kind and gentle to living creatures.\nThe undead empire operated like a church to the local creatures as they taught them the way of life. They preached about peace and the afterlife.\nUsually, they chose well-behaved animals and beasts to resurrect as undead. Then, they trained the chosen ones until they evolved into liches, vampires, or death knights. As for the disqualified ones, their bodies returned to the soil.\nIn short, the Molg Empire was full of pacifists. They were harmless to the living.\nEverything was peaceful and tranquil until immortals from another world invaded them. Millions of cultivators accused them of being heretics and they needed to be subjugated. Then, war broke out.\nThe war didn't last long. As the pacifist undead creatures never fought in such a war, they were annihilated within a month. Esen's empire vanished from history.\nHowever, not everybody was weak. The empress of the Molg Empire, Esen, led her remaining army to fight back. She managed to slaughter and enslaved 100,000 immortals during the counter-siege. During the war, she proved that she was stronger than average immortals from the otherworld.\nUnfortunately, cultivators were good at adapting and flexibility. They soon trapped her with their tricky arrays. As they weren't strong enough to kill her, they chose to seal her and left her to rot in an underground dungeon.\nTime passed. The legend of the invasion was forgotten through time. However, Esen and other survivors were still stuck in their prison.\nOne day, people from the Yan and the Situ Clan found the underground ruin. They soon explored the area and found the entrance to Esen's prison.\nHowever, the seal arrays of the immortals in the past were too complicated for the cultists. None of them could enter or journey beyond the doors and the rooms, full of purple pillars and beams. Thus, they left the places alone.\nThen, Leo came along.\n.\n.\nEsen, the Lich Empress, stared at Leo with a deep frown. She was once the strongest undead immortal that vanquished 100,000 immortal cultivators from the other worlds, but she couldn't even leave a scratch on Leo's skin.\n\"You're weird.\" Esen clicked her tongue.\nLeo rolled his eyes and walked around the mansion. He continued picking the dimmed talismans around the building. He also thought to himself.\n'What the hell does this zombie want?! I'm fine if she bites me, but she keeps getting on my nerve. Man, I hate dealing with children, especially zombie children.'\nLeo already accepted the fact that he had freed a freaky zombie kid. Thus, he maintained his composure throughout the interaction. As Leo wanted to chase the lich girl away, he complained.\n\"Whatever. Now that I've freed you, you're free to go. Go home already.\"\n\"That mansion is my home. You're the one intruding.\"\n\"Then, get the hell down from my back, kid. Why are you still clinging to me and scratching my neck? I'm not interested in kids and weird fetishes.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen was offended. Still, realizing how Leo never tried to harm her, she let go of him and stood behind him.\nEsen thought, 'This man is too strange. He has an air of an immortal, but he is not. He is definitely stronger than regular immortal cultivators, though. Isn't he on the same side as those raiders?'\nAlthough Esen was grateful that Leo had freed her, she didn't let her guard down. She slowly climbed down from Leo's back while she maintained her fighting stance, getting ready to fight to the death.\nBetraying Esen's expectation, Leo turned around and gave her a meaningful look. Upon gazing at the girl up close, he got to see her true appearance.\nFrom Leo's perspective, Esen looked like the corpse of a six or seven years old girl. She had no eyeballs, and her dry skinny limbs were already dark. Most of her long hair already fell off, revealing her scalp and skin on her head.\nLeo pursed his lips. Although it was his first time seeing a talking zombie, he was amused. His mood also got better, and he teased her.\n\"I see. That explains a lot. Now, I understand why you tried to bite me. Anyway, kid. Are you thirsty or hungry? Do you need food?\"\n\"I'm not a kid,\" Esen was annoyed. In anger, she revealed her secret to winning the argument, \"I've been living for over 10,000 years! I'm older than your grandmother!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. His immature side also wanted to win the argument, \"As I said. You're still a kid to me. I'm already 50,038 this year if you wanna know. I'm five times older than you!\"\nLike bantering children, the duo yelled at each other for a minute before they stopped because of their exhaustion.\nIn the end, Esen didn't believe him. She kicked Leo's shin in anger.\nCRACK\nInstead of breaking Leo's leg, Esen's leg was broken in half.\n\"…\"\nEsen felt no pain. She looked at her broken leg for a moment and clapped her hands.\nCRACK\nRandom bones from the other room flew toward the mansion. They gathered behind Esen, piling into a big mountain.\nEsen turned around and picked a random skull of a vampire. The white skull melted upon touch and merged with Esen's boney body.\nAfter absorbing the mass, Esen's broken bones were instantly repaired. Though she was still lanky and skinny.\nWhen her leg was in good condition, Esen turned to Leo. She shamelessly demanded him and opened her palm.\n\"I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.\"\nLeo shrugged. Esen's behavior might be rude and immature, but Leo didn't mind it. After all, he couldn't get mad at a child.\n'A kid is always a kid. I shouldn't behave like a Karen. I'm a mature and responsible adult!' Leo thought to himself. Then, he asked her.\n\"What do you prefer? Fresh meat, blood, or brains?\"\n\"Are you an idiot?!\" Esen grumbled, \"I only eat vegetables! We, the proud Molg Liches, never eat meat! We only eat leaves and vegetables!\"\n\"A vegan zombie, I see. How peculiar.\"\n\"I'm a lich, not a zombie!!\"\nAgain, Esen wanted to beat Leo to a pulp, but she was helpless against this monster. Shouting and yelling at his face was the only thing she could do to quell her anger.\nLeo sighed and searched his rings, checking if he had anything edible. He pulled out a mutated dragon fruit tree from his ring.\nAs the tree already produced dragon fruits, Leo picked a few and gave them to Esen.\n\"Can you eat these?\"\nEsen frowned and stared at the black fruits. She flipped it around for a moment before she noticed something odd.\n\"Yin fruit?! W-Where did you get these?!\"\n\"Obviously, I grow them.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen gave Leo a meaningful look before she started nom-noming the fruits in her hands. She quickly devoured everything in seconds, not leaving the seeds behind.\nAfter consuming the fruit, her hair and her eyeballs regenerated. Her coarse and dry white hair turned gold, and her dark skin whitened. Still, Esen needed to increase her body mass.\n\"More.\"\nLeo shrugged. He loved feeding kids and homeless people, \"Sure, your majesty. Man, looking at you reminds me of the old days. I wish I could make a YouTube channel to compete with Mr. Beast. My channel name would have been Mr. Florida Man. That would have been fun.\"\n\"???\"\nAgain, Esen didn't understand Leo's mumbling. She snatched dragon fruits from Leo's hands and continued eating them.\nAs soon as Esen finished eating the 20th fruit, she was full. Her stomach was slightly bloated, and she burped.\n\"How unladylike,\" Leo chuckled.\n\"This empress does whatever she wants!\"\n\"Sure. Sure.\"\nLeo stopped entertaining her. He continued exploring the exterior of the mansion, picking the remaining talismans in the area. As for Esen, she followed Leo around, observing his actions.\nWalking around the mansion in a circle, Leo secured a total of 666 silver talismans. He stuffed them in his spatial ring and turned to leave.\nBefore Leo left the mansion's garden, he waved his hand at Esen.\n\"Take care of yourself. I'm leaving.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen flinched. She opened her mouth and raised a finger for a moment. However, she changed her mind.\nThe next moment, Esen vanished as if she teleported. Afterimages appeared inside the mansion as if she searched for something inside. Five seconds later, Esen appeared in front of Leo, bringing seven knight helmets, five tailcoat robes, and three black gowns along with her.\nEsen then shoved everything to Leo.\n\"Store these in your magic ring. Take those along.\"\nLeo frowned and looked at the stuff, \"What are these?\"\n\"My subordinates.\"\n\"Your… what?\"\n\"I'll resurrect them later. They have been sealed for so long that their souls are hibernating. Until I regain my power, keep them with you.\"\nLeo crossed his arms. Although he cared for children, he didn't like being pushed around.\n\"What's in it for me? Why should I bring them along?\"\nEsen took a long pause. She flustered, looking left and right as if she hesitated on something. Then, she made her decision.\nSince her empire was already ruined and Leo helped her, Esen tried to seduce him.\n\"I'll teach you the power of necromancy! You can become an immortal like me and live forever!\"\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"I'd rather keep my flesh and blood. Also, I don't like living inside a rotting body. My current body looks more aesthetic than those of a zombie.\"\n\"…\"\nEven though Leo said that he cooperated with Esen, taking the clothes and the skulls into his spatial ring.\n\"By the way, empress. If you want to repay me, you can do something else in return.\"\n\"What?\" Esen was curious why Leo would want her help, judging from his demeanor and attitude toward her.\nLeo might be silly and crazy most of the time. However, when it came to dealing with kids, his brain functioned normally like human beings. He had an idea of how he could exploit the self-proclaim empress.\n'Well, since you keep saying 'empress-this', 'empress-that', why don't I put you to work? I already have a bunch of unicorns and mannequins at home. Why don't I bring in some zombies to work for me? They're free laborers!'\nLeo rubbed his hands and grinned.\n\"Instead of teaching me necromancy and evil magic, how about you use those magic for me? You see, I happen to run a shop, and I need a lot of employees, security guards, and stable caretakers. Are you interested, kid?\"\nEsen pondered for a moment before she sneaked a glance at the mutated dragon fruit tree. She pointed at the tree.\n\"If I help you, will you give me more of those?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"Then, can you help me resurrect my subordinates?\"\n\"If I can…\"\n\"Then, that's a deal! I'll help you watch over your shop, and you will help me restore my Molg Empire!\"\n\"Molg what?\"\nLeo scratched his head. He had a feeling that he was missing something. Unfortunately, it was too late.\nEsen latched on Leo's back and sat on his shoulder. Then, she pointed forward.\n\"Let's go, Florida Man! To your domain!\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 127 – Florida Man Steals Man's Underwear to Smell Its Crotch\nThe return trip was fast. As Leo had a clear destination, he ignored everything and traveled north by leaping and jumping.\nEsen exploited the privilege of a petite body by riding on Leo's shoulders. The latter also allowed her to play as she wished since he couldn't say no to a little kid.\nWhen they returned, they found a hundred thunder unicorns on the farmland, sniffing and eating the crops. Cat was also there, and she had been screaming at the ponies.\n\"MEOW!\"\nCat was furious. The crops belonged to Leo, and she was the only one who had the privilege to steal them. When the unicorns competed for the loot, she threw and fit and lashed her whips at them.\nUnfortunately, the unicorns were a bunch of 9th-stage monsters. Only immortals or an army of quasi-immortals could be their opponents. Cat's attacks failed to harm the ponies.\nAlthough Cat was hostile to the unicorns, the ponies didn't harm her as she had a strong scent of Leo. Moreover, she was a virgin child, whose virgin yin Qi was as pure as Leo's virgin yang. All thunder unicorns on the farm treated her as a potential energy bank and waited for her to become a refined adult.\nAmong the crowd, a certain unicorn tried to woo Cat.\n\"Smash <3\"\n\"MEOW!!\"\n\"Smash? ;)\"\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\n\"Smash D:\"\n\"HISSSS!!\"\n\"…Smash T-T\"\nTaxi sulked after the failed attempt. He lowered his head and walked away from the crowd while his colleagues laughed and neighed at him.\nLeo arrived when Taxi got rejected. He witnessed the entire event, and he also laughed at Taxi.\n\"Bad donkey! That girl is a newborn child! Why are you trying to woo her?! Are you a pedo or what?!\"\n\"Smash T-T\"\nTaxi cried a river and ran away from the farmland. He then cried to the unicorn elder, who gave Leo his horn.\nElder P.Hub snorted and bonked Taxi with his half-horn. He then roared, unleashing lightning Qi to suppress the rowdy unicorns.\nAs soon as P.Hub's overwhelming Qi exuded, all unicorns stopped eating. They ran toward the elder and gathered around the senior.\nLeo and P.Hub's eyes met. Both nodded at each other as Leo thanked him for watching over the naughty horses.\nWhen everything was in order, Leo walked toward the crowd of unicorns while sneaking glances at the apartment building.\nOn the balcony of the apartment, the disciples gathered there, watching the unicorns from above. As they were too weak to interact with them, they kept their distance to avoid trouble.\nWu Buyi also stood beside them, retelling the tale of how Leo tamed countless thunder unicorns and vanquished strong monsters in the mystic realm.\nLeo looked up and found Wu Buyi. He waved his hand, calling him over.\n\"Bring the disciples! I'll formally introduce the new workers!\"\nWu Buyi acknowledged the order and guided the scardy teens down. They joined the gathering and gazed at the tall unicorns in astonishment and awe.\nThe unicorns also sensed their respect. Some of them sniffed the young boys and discovered that they were all virgins. As soon as they recognized the scent, female thunder unicorns rushed toward them and nudged their heads against the disciples, showing affection and courtship.\nThe disciples were taken aback, but they laughed. Some of them innocently petted the female unicorns, unaware of their motifs.\n\"Ahem!\" Leo coughed to get their attention. The crowd's eyes fixated on Leo, waiting for his announcement.\n\"Eh, where should I start? For now, I need to introduce everybody here to your new friends. First off, the young men over there will be your working colleagues and your caretakers…\"\nThe introduction was brief.\nLeo got the disciples and the thunder unicorns to know each other. He also requested Taxi and P.Hub to control the rowdy unicorns so that they wouldn't hurt the disciples.\nAs for the disciples, they got a new job. Leo ordered them to build a large stable for the unicorns so they could sleep or rest under a rooftop. They were also in charge of distributing food to the ponies.\nNext, it was Esen's turn. At first, nobody paid attention to the girl as they mistook her for Leo's weird experimental material. But when she got down from Leo's shoulders and walked on her two feet, the crowd stared at the loli.\n\"I-Is that a jiangshi?!\" One of the disciples trembled in fear as he was afraid of zombies and undead.\nWu Buyi looked indifferent in the beginning as he mistook Esen for another harmless pet of Leo. But when he inspected her further, Wu Buyi sweated profusely.\nHe could not measure her cultivation base or strength. Esen had no dantian. Instead, she was a walking mass of yin essence.\nEsen calmly looked around and smirked at the thunder unicorns. She found them weak and insignificant.\n\"I have never seen these horses before. They seem strong, but they are too weak to be my servant.\"\nLeo coughed, \"Ahem! Kid… I mean, your majesty. Could you please grace us with your name and your words of introduction, please?\"\n\"Since you ask nicely, fine!\" Esen turned to the disciples and gazed at them even though she had no eyeball. \"My name is Esen, the 12th Monarch of Molg Empire and the Empress of all liches! I AM the true ruler of this realm, not you, descendants of vile cultivators!\"\n\"…\"\nAside from the thunder unicorns and Wu Buyi, the disciples didn't know what to think. They looked at each other and shrugged as they found Esen's backstory weird.\nGao Yan narrowed his eyes for a moment as he faintly saw Esen's dark aura and the menacing presence of evil spirits around her. He turned to Thora, asking for her opinion.\n\"Is she for real, Thora?\"\nBetraying Gao Yan's expectations, Thora hid behind Gao Yan, shivering in fear. She whispered to him, avoiding Esen's detection.\n'S-She's a real deal! T-That girl is even stronger than the spirit queen! D-Don't provoke her!'\n\"EH!?\"\nUnfortunately, the unicorns had sharp senses. They heard Thora's voice, and they were shocked as well. Because of the stunning info, they caused a commotion and neighed in fright.\n\"ORDER!\"\nLeo clapped his hands, trying to calm the horses. Unfortunately, the unicorns were already in panic mode, and they were ready to flee from here.\nEsen rolled her eyes as she found the horses annoying. She pulled a large tomato from the farm and ate it to replenish her energy.\nWhile Esen ate the tomato, her shadow expanded toward the unicorns. When their shadows overlapped, the horses stopped moving as if they were frozen.\n\"Stop making useless noises, foolish creatures! This empress is not some vile bandit that senselessly takes lives! We govern life and death! Those who respect the dead will enjoy a peaceful life. Those who respect the living can enjoy life after death!\"\nWhile preaching, Esen branded the unicorns with her aura marks, linking her thought with theirs. Then, she communicated directly to their brains.\nThe unicorns stopped resisting or panicking. They stared at Esen in a daze before they lowered their heads. Only Taxi and P.Hub refused to bow to her.\nA second later, half of the white thunder unicorns turned black. Their pupils, mane, and tails were as red as blood.\nPOOF\nSuddenly, their bodies were ignited on fire.\nJust like that, half of the thunder unicorns transformed into nightmares from hell.\nLeo flinched for a moment as he didn't expect this result. He stomped toward Esen and grabbed her crown, lifting her in the air.\n\"Oi, brat. What the hell have you done to my beautiful donkeys?!\"\nEsen didn't resist. She allowed Leo to lift her up by holding her head with one hand. Then, she explained.\n\"Those unicorns have evil thoughts, and they are planning to ravish those young men and that plant monster. I brainwash them and turn them into my servants before they cause damage to your farms and your people. Instead of cursing me, you should thank me, Florida Man.\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows and rechecked the transformed unicorns. Although they became black horses, they still retained the lightning Qi and the horns. In exchange for the transformation, they looked composed and calm, which was the opposite of their nature.\nEsen smirked at Leo. She then offered her services, \"I'll be in charge of managing those nightmares. Just provide me food and shelter, and I'll help you train them. Oh, if you change your mind and want to learn my secret art of necromancy, come talk to me any time.\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nThe introduction process was hectic, but the old and the new members got along well.\nEsen seemed to be prideful and arrogant at a glance, but she was quite a sociable person. She went around and talked to everybody, including Cat, Gao Yan, Wu Buyi, and the disciples. She even chatted with Thora for a while.\nFor some reason, Cat hit it off with Esen. The latter introduced her to the granaries and the domain's infrastructures. She also shared giant potatoes with the lich empress.\nAs everything was in order, Leo stopped worrying about his people and went to check on his mannequins. He visited the cloth shop first, checking on the tailor.\nWhen Leo got inside the store, he found a lineup of long pants, shorts, long shorts, and men's underwear. All clothes were as white as a sheet, but they smelled nice.\nLeo's sensitive nose was drawn toward a pile of men's underwear. He picked one of them and sniffed it.\nIt smelled like sunlight mixed with the back of his oily ears. The vomit odor and the warm ultraviolet gave birth to a pleasant puke aroma.\n\"Yup. Smell like my buttcrack.\"\nLeo laughed and took off his clothes in front of the tailor mannequin. The mannequin slightly brushed, but she stared at Leo's refined body, especially his assets.\nAfter putting on a new set of underwear and long pants, Leo collected a dozen sets in his spatial rings for a spare. Then, he gave the mannequin girl a new order.\n\"Stop making pants for now. I'll give you a new work to do!\"\nLeo purchased a full set of man's suits, a long coat, jackets, and sweaters from the online store system. He then gave them to the tailor mannequin, hoping that she could replicate those.\nThe mannequin stared at the clothes and repeatedly nodded. However, she kept staring at Leo while she poked his skin.\n\"What? You run out of material?\"\nThe mannequin nodded. She then stared at Leo's arm, waiting for him to skin himself.\n\"Eh, fine. Give me a moment.\"\nSkinning oneself was easy if one could withstand pain. Leo grabbed the tip of his index fingernail and pulled it backward.\nCRACK\nLeo pulled it off the nail plate, which revealed his transparent blood and the skin beneath the nail. Tossing away the nail piece, Leo dug into the wound with his other finger, grabbing the soft skin that was attached to the nail bed.\nKWAK\nPeeling from the nail, Leo dragged the sticky skin until it reached his elbow. Then, he cut off the skin and tossed it to the mannequin girl.\nThe wound was deeper this time as Leo was too heavy-handed. Fortunately, it was instantly healed.\nAfter receiving the piece of skin, the mannequin installed it into her arm and began analyzing the cloth's patterns. She got fired up, and her needle arms began moving, sewing, and weaving new clothes from nothingness.\nLeo left the mannequin alone. He strolled out of the shop with his new white pants.\nWhen Leo got out, he ran into Esen, who had been peeking into the store.\nEsen gazed at the store's interior through the front window, eyeing the rainbow evening dress. She didn't realize that she drooled.\n\"Do you want those?\" Leo teased Esen.\nEsen turned to Leo. In her eye sockets, purple fireballs were ignited, and she repeatedly nodded.\n\"Alright, sure.\"\nLeo went back into the store and fetched a completed evening dress for Esen. He passed the dress to her.\nUnfortunately, the dress was made for an adult woman. It was too big for a little girl like her.\nEsen grabbed the dress and widely grinned. A moment later, she vanished into thin air, disappearing along with the new dress.\nLeo shrugged as he stopped caring about unusual techniques, teleportation, and the cultivator's logic.\nBefore Leo could go elsewhere, Esen flew back and carried a mountain of monster bones with her. She dumped the bones in front of the store and pointed at them.\n\"Florida Man. This is the payment for this artifact! Take them!\"\n\"…What?\"\nLeo was confused. He planned to give the dress to her for free since she had been wearing a piece of rag. Even if that was Esen's payment, Leo had never expected to receive a mountain of bones as a currency.\n\"What am I going to use these for? Oh, wait. Alchemy?\"\nEsen puffed her chest and laughed, \"That's right. We, the liches, vampires, and death knights cultivate our yin in our bones to strengthen our power. Each piece of bone contains even more Qi than soul stones or essence stones! Anyway, use them as you see fit!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo picked up a hand of a skeleton to check it. Indeed, it carried a thick dark purple aura.\nAs Esen reminded him of its quality, Leo brought a piece of it and walked to the back of his general store. Upon arriving at the alchemy workshop, Leo smiled at the working mannequins as if he was finally at home.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 128 – Florida Man Announces He Will Open Kindergarten for Elders\n\"It has been a while. I miss this place.\"\nLeo visited an alchemist mannequin, who was busy making another batch of rejuvenate tea. When Leo approached him, he turned around to look and stood there, waiting for a new instruction.\nAs Leo remembered its past deeds, he scanned through the workshop. Fortunately, the mannequin got smarter as it stored the finished product in the barrels and the containers that Leo had prepared for it.\nHe lifted one of the barrels to check the content. Sure enough, it was full of the perfect-grade tea.\n.\nPinnacle Grade Rejuvenate Tea\n- Evolve bone marrow and blood cells.\n- Decrease physical age by 20 years per liter.\n- Increase metabolism by 100% for 480 hours.\n- Remove cancer cells.\n.\nThe item seemed dangerous for Leo as he was the host of evolved cancer cells. From a glance, drinking this tea could potentially kill him.\nLeo once tested the tea's effects. Indeed, it damaged his cells, but it was not strong enough to kill the blood cells in his system. A small dose of tea managed to immobilize the transparent blood cells for a few minutes. After that, the cells self-resurrected and corrected the repaired damaged organs as if nothing had happened.\nStill, during the immobilized period, the tea made Leo slightly tipsy!\nThe tea had the same effects as alcoholic beverages!\nLooking at the barrels of tea, Leo snickered. He had enough drink to enjoy for ages. Moreover, he could flex by serving this drink to his future guests and employees.\nLeo thought of Wu Buyi. He wondered what that dumb alchemist would look like in his youth.\n'I should keep feeding him the tea until his physical age is as young as that brat. Oh, once he's that young, I'll trick the other geezers into drinking more of my tea. Then, this entire place will be full of grade-schoolers. PFFT. This should be fun.'\nThe immature thought took over Leo's brain once again. He carried one of the barrels and brought it in front of Wu Buyi's house. Coincidentally, the guy was also in his house. As usual, he was busy watching his smartphone and enjoying the internet.\nLeo noticed Wu Buyi's deed through the foul scent of the latter's bodily fluid. As he respected the latter's privacy, Leo knocked on the door and shouted.\n\"Wu Buyi. I've brought you your overtime pay! The tea barrel is in front of your house. Make sure to drink this while it's still fresh! Oh, don't overdrink it and turn yourself into sperm! One cup a day is enough!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWu Buyi's boner was killed. He put on his pants and rushed outside. Upon opening the door, he found a wooden barrel. However, Leo had already left.\nLooking left and right, Wu Buyi silently carried the barrel into his house and shut the door. Then, he continued his research, broadening his horizon.\nHe hadn't realized that the unicorns and Cat could detect his scent.\nMeanwhile, Leo went back to the workshop. By the time he arrived, the first workshop's mannequin already finished making the latest batch of rejuvenating tea.\nLeo stopped the worker and ordered him to take a break. The mannequin nodded and returned to the building, opening the door and getting inside the house.\nWhile the mannequin was entering the workshop building, Leo took a peek inside. Then, he was astonished.\nInside the workshop was a warehouse of thousand tea barrels. Even though the interior space was expanded, the wooden barrels filled the room to the brim, leaving only a small space for the worker to sit.\nThe mannequin silently sat and hugged his knees, staring at Leo's face. He then looked at the work he had done.\n\"…\"\nLeo had a complex feeling about this mannequin. He felt bad for the automaton.\nSince Leo had learned the spatial ring's function and usage, he entered the workshop and stored half of the barrels in his spatial rings. After clearing a portion of the room, he opened the online shopping system and purchased some furniture for the automaton.\nA bed, a couch, a cabinet, flower vases, and random portraits of scenery came out. Leo arranged the future and patted the mannequin's shoulder.\n\"Next time you rest, you can sit on the couch or sleep in the bed. Oh, make sure you take a bath before you take a long rest.\"\nThe automaton's eyes gleamed. He repeatedly nodded and walked toward the bed and the couch to inspect them. Remembering Leo's instruction, he inspected his body, which got sandy and rough because of the accumulated dirt, dust, and mud.\nAfter discovering the dirtiness, the mannequin understood why a bath was a must. He left the building and entered the general store as the bathrooms there provided infinite tap water.\nLeo had been observing the mannequin's actions. When the wooden doll entered his store, Leo had a bad premonition. He immediately purchased rubber door mats that he usually found in department stores. Rushing into the general store, he placed the mats in the air filtering room and in front of the public toilets.\nThat was not enough. As people might be using the public toilets as their bathhouses, Leo bought a clean towel and threw it toward the mannequin.\n\"Before you come out after a bath, dry your body with it. When you're done, make sure to do the laundry so you can use that again.\"\nThe mannequin tilted his head. He didn't understand what LAUNDRY was.\nLooking at the mannequin, Leo had a headache. He purchased a laundry machine, a cloth dryer, and a huge canteen of liquid detergent.\nAs the machines couldn't operate without electricity, Leo had no choice but to upgrade them once. The machines cost only 20 years of lifespan, but upgrading both of them cost 2,000 YOL.\nAfter upgrading the machines, Leo paused to think. He wondered how far he could upgrade the modern electrical appliance. Putting his inspiration to work, Leo upgraded it to level 8, spending an additional 12,000 YOL.\nDING\nBoth the cloth dryer and laundry machine looked the same. However, all buttons vanished.\nLeo frowned. Without a button, he had no idea how the machines worked. Thus, he tested them by throwing the dirty uniform of a cultist into the laundry machine.\nAfter closing the hatch, the machine hummed. A second later, colorful water soaked the clothes, and a pleasant flowery scent kicked Leo's nose.\nThe machine didn't need detergent anymore. It came with a built-in detergent generator, and it also created water for the laundry!\nHowever, without an external water pipe, Leo got curious about how the machine would dispose of the used water. He and the mannequin observed the machine.\nDING\nIt took the machine 20 minutes to wash the clothes. It looked like a normal washing machine at a glance. But when Leo looked inside the machine to see the washed clothes, he was astonished.\nEvery piece of clothes glittered even though they were still wet. Leo pulled one of the wet robes out to inspect its color and quality. Checking its durability, Leo lightly stretched it.\nThe wet clothes didn't rip. Had it been regular clothes, it would have been torn in half.\n\"How the hail…\"\nThe robe was upgraded after the laundry. From a black uniform, it became white. In addition, the texture was softer, but the durability and flexibility improved.\nWith such a sturdy cloth, Leo wondered if others could use it as armor.\nLeo's eyes glinted as his capitalist side got another inspiration. He explored the online shopping system, searching for a coin meter system to install on top of the washing machine.\nIt was easy to find as there were many brands. Still, Leo chose not to purchase them due to a troublesome reason – Nobody here used coins.\n'Tsk. I wish they sold spirit stone machines. Do I have to invent one myself?'\nLeo closed the menu. For now, he put the project aside and left the washing machine there as an exclusive tool for himself. He turned his attention to the cloth dryer next.\nThe next machine's function was a lot simpler. Leo tossed the wet clothes in there, but the machine instantly ejected them out. All clothes were instantly dried and ironed. In addition, they came out folded.\nLeo inwardly laughed. This machine would have been popular among lazy housewives and salarymen in the modern world.\n\"Welp. This is perfect for me. I don't have to keep buying new clothes from the store anymore.\"\n.\nAfter instructing the mannequin and showing him how to use the machines, Leo left the mannequin alone in the bath. He then purchased another set of rubber mats to place in front of the public toilets.\nComing out of the general store, Leo returned to the workshop. He hadn't forgotten his primary objective yet.\nWhen Leo arrived, he put a glowing purple bone that Esen had given him into the cauldron. He then pressed the research button.\nDING\n.\nMolg Lich's Femur\nThis piece of bone once belonged to an immortal celestial general of the destroyed Molg Empire. Even though 10,000 years have passed, this piece of bone still contains a great amount of yin essence. It can be used as a catalyst for necromancy or converted into soul stones with alchemy. However, top immortal alchemists can turn this piece of bone into something greater.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stones]\nOne Molg Lich's Bone (Any Piece)\nYin Essence\n[Alchemy Recipe – Luck Crystal]\nSeven Purified Molg Lich's Bones\nBlood of 10,000-Year-Old Virgin Maiden\nBlood of 10,000-Year-Old Virgin Man\nYin and Yang Essence\n.\nLeo had a lot to say when he read the recipe of Luck Crystal. He wanted to curse his system for demanding impossible ingredients.\n\"Where the hell can I find a 10,000-year-old virgin maiden!? Are you nuts?! Also, virgin man? You… are you dissing me?!\"\nBecause of his innocence, Leo took a defensive stance and bellowed at the blue window in front of him. He didn't realize that the unicorns, nightmares, and Esen could hear him.\nTaxi and P.Hub smirked and shook their heads. The emotionless nightmares simply snorted, but Esen was taken aback.\nCurious about what Leo was doing, Esen checked on him. He lightly poked Leo's butt with another femur bone that she had brought.\n\"What's the problem with a 10,000-year-old maiden? Are you talking to me?\"\n\"Hah?!\"\nLeo turned around and looked at the loli lich. He didn't get it at first. But when he saw the deep frown on Esen's face, Leo figured it out and was surprised.\n\"You… dammit. Did someone set me up?\"\n\"What's the matter? Why are you looking for a virgin maiden?\"\nLeo sighed and confessed, \"I need her blood in alchemy.\"\n\"Oh. Is that so? Well, once I recover my power, I'll donate some to you. By the way, what are you making? Can I know the alchemy recipe?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo was speechless. He didn't expect the arrogant girl to be this kind. Still, he appreciated her offer nonetheless.\nNobody hated free goodies!\n\"Ahem!\" For the sake of the long-lasting relationship, Leo told her the truth, \"I'm planning to make Luck Crystal. Well, coincidentally, it takes seven pieces of your people's bones, blood of a virgin 10,000-year-old man and woman… and some basic essence.\"\nEsen narrowed her eye sockets even though she had no eyeballs. Her expression was solemn for a moment before she suddenly smiled and laughed.\n\"FUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!\"\nLeo was offended. He yelled at the loli, \"What's the matter with you? What's so funny?!\"\n\"If I guess correctly, you must also be a virgin. Am I right? How old are you again? 50,000? PFFT! BAHAHAHAHA!!\"\n\"…\"",

I'll take care of it eventually.\"\nBecause of the lack of key ingredients, Leo put aside the new project. He turned his attention to the old recipes that he had never tried yet. He opened the alchemy workshop's status menu and explored the known recipes.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Pill of Youth]\nOne Hundred Blades of Immortal Grass\nOne Drop of Virgin Sage's Blood\nOne Drop of Unicorn's Tear\nOne Liter of Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nFive Elemental Essence\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Longevity Pill]\nOne Blade of Immortal Grass\nOne Liter of Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nOne Black Heart of 9th-Grade Demon Beast\n*Optional* Any Fire, Water, Earth, Metal, or Wood Element Catalyst\nAny Elemental Essence\n.\n\"Whoops.\"\nLeo smacked his forehead. He mistook the unicorn's tear for a unicorn's horn. Also, he stocked 9th-grade monster cores instead of collecting their black hearts. Realizing his mistake, he had the urge to return to the mystic realm and bring the alligator monsters back.\nStill, it was a slight setback. Since Leo got those ingredients in his hands, he might as well research them.\nLeo brought out P.Hub's horn and broke the tip. Then, he tossed it into the cauldron and pressed the research button.\nDING\n.\nHorn of Thunder Unicorn\nCan only be found on a planet among Forbidden Constellation Star Sector as Thunder Unicorns only live there. As Thunder Unicorns utilize their horns as their second dantian, every piece of it contains a thick amount of lightning element essence. Because it contains a rare element, many celestial beings from immortal realms put a bounty for it, and they are willing to pay an arm and a leg to get a piece of it.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Lighting Dantian Pill]\nOne gram of Thunder Unicorn's horn\nOne drop of Thunder Unicorn's tear\nA Spark of White Tribulation Lightning Bolt\nA Spark of Green Tribulation Lightning Bolt\nA Spark of Purple Tribulation Lightning Bolt\nA Spark of Yellow Tribulation Lightning Bolt\nLightning Element Essence\n.\nLeo scoffed as he found the recipe obnoxious as it required lightning element essence.\n\"Yup. It's one of those idiotic kind of recipes. Without the lightning essence, you can't make lightning element pills. But without pills, you can't cultivate lightning elements. It's like which came first – chicken or eggs.\"\nThe recipe was also difficult because the pills required tribulation lightning's sparks, which was new to Leo. Fortunately, the list only went up to the yellow grade. Had it demanded red lightning or black lightning bolts, Leo would have flipped the cauldron out of rage.\nLeo closed the window and postponed this project. He researched another item. This time, he threw a 9th-grade monster core into the cauldron.\nDING\nwater and lightning elements, and their meat is delicious. This monster core is their crystalized dantian. Alchemists love these .\n9th-Grade Monster Core of Horned Caiman\nHorned Caimans are common in immortal realms as they are the bottom-feeders of the river. They are known to be the master of water and lightning elements, and their meat is delicious. This monster core is their crystalized dantian. Alchemists love these monster cores as they can be refined into Water or Lightning Dantian Pills. However, nobody has discovered a secret recipe, which can bring chaos to any mortal realm.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Lighting Dantian Pill]\nOne 9th-Grade Monster Core of Horned Caiman\nOne Yang Element Catalyst\nLightning Element Essence\n[Alchemy Recipe – Water Dantian Pill]\nOne 9th-Grade Monster Core of Horned Caiman\nOne Yin Element Catalyst\nWater Element Essence\n[Alchemy Recipe – Floridian Dantian Pill]\nOne 9th-Grade Monster Core of Horned Caiman\nOne Drop of Florida Man's Blood\nOne Piece of Florida Man's Flesh\n.\n\"…\"\nThe first two recipes looked normal as they required catalysts, which were the same as other regular pills and dans. However, Leo was stunned by the third recipe.\nFloridian Dantian Pill?!\nLeo couldn't laugh. He believed the system made this up to bully him, and he was offended.\n\"Is this some kind of a joke? Floridians have a dantian now? We can be made into pills?!\"\nDING\nUnlike usual, the system replied to Leo's inquiry instead of ignoring Leo's questions.\n<Research Feature automatically calculates and analyzes the material and comes up with every possible recipe, using the existing materials in every mortal world and immortal realm. Your existence is included in the calculation.>\n\"…I'll be damned.\"\nIt was not a pleasant feeling when he became one of the alchemy ingredients. Leo feared that one day, the system might want him to sacrifice his organs to make something absurd.\nBut since the recipe seemed easy this time, Leo let it slide. He bit his arm and pulled out a chunk of his flesh. Then, he tossed it into the cauldron.\nAs the flesh had some of his transparent blood, Leo fulfilled the requirements. He then threw a caiman's monster core in there and spat into the fireplace as usual. After closing the lid, Leo initiated the pill-making procedure.\nDING\n<Refining Floridian Dantian Pill…>\n<Remaining Time – 29 Days, 23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 59 Seconds.>\nSomething was not right about the timer – It took too long to complete! In the past, the longest pill-making time was only a few days. However, this one required a whole month!\nFortunately, Wu Buyi was not there, and the alchemist couldn't read Leo's mind. Otherwise, he would have vomited blood and died out of rage because his cultivation pills took him longer than a month to make. Thus, one month was a short refining time among local alchemists.\nBecause the first cauldron would be busy for a month, Leo moved on to the other workshops. He went to check the yang flame dan factory and yin ice dan factory.\nBoth workshops did well. The automaton mannequins stood there, pressing their hands on the cauldrons. They focused solely on their tasks, ignoring Leo.\nLeo entered the second workshop building. Inside the workshop, frozen crates full of yin ice dans filled the building. Looking at the finished products, Leo wondered why the warehouse worker didn't put them in the warehouse buildings.\nHe visited the yang flame dan's workshop next. Upon getting inside, he found an opposite world.\nThe dans were on fire, and they were piled inside a metal container, which Leo had never seen before. It glittered in silver light, which resisted the dans' extreme heat.\n\"What the hell? Where did they find these?\"\nLeo walked out of the workshop to ask the mannequins. But when he looked at their faces, he smacked his forehead.\n\"Right. They can't speak. What the hell, my workers? What have you been doing? Where did you get all these goodies and containers?\"\nWhile Leo complained, a warehouse worker passed by. He heard Leo's questions and poked his master.\nGetting poked, Leo turned around, \"What?\"\nThe warehouse worker waved his hand and pointed at the junkyard. Leo tilted his head in confusion, but he followed the warehouse mannequin anyway.\nWhen Leo arrived at the junkyard, he found a new world. Instead of seeing a mountain of trash and his past collections, he found the recycle center workers, who were in the middle of transforming iron pine lumber into random furniture.\n\"…\"\nLeo blankly stared at them. He didn't remember giving them such an order.\n\"Who asked you to make furniture, damn bots?\"\nThe recycling center workers looked at each other. Then, they pointed at the floating platform in the sky.\n\"What? Heaven?\"\nThe workers shook their heads. They started drawing a picture of four statues over there and drew a circle around the fisherman.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo still had no idea what they were trying to communicate. He looked up and frowned.\n\"Are you saying that a freaking statue ordered you to make those?\"\nEvery worker nodded.\n\"Haiya…\"\nLeo was at a loss for words for multiple reasons. First, the workers did something without his permission, which threatened his authority. Secondly, someone had the power to influence the workers, which Leo didn't like.\nAnd lastly, from the workers' testimony, they pointed toward the mysterious statues on the mystic realm portal platform.\n\"I guess I have to go see those statues next. Anyway, what else have that fisherman statue told you to do?\"\nThe mannequins looked at each other. Then, they pointed south, where Leo had ordered them to dig the fish pond. However, it became a grand canyon trench.\nOne of them gestured to Leo to follow him. Leo did so and reached the cliff of the trench.\nThe guiding mannequin stopped at the edge and made a T-Pose. He then raised his right arm 90 degrees upward for a moment before he robotically raised his left arm while maintaining 90 degrees between his both arms. Then, an unthinkable thing occurred.\nZAAAA\nThe mystic realm platform suddenly poured a stream of water from above, raining upon the trench. Like a leaking dam, the stream got bigger over time.\nSoon, it became a massive waterfall from the sky. A rainbow came out and beautified the scene.\n<AHEM!>\nAs if the mannequin had unlocked something, Leo heard an elderly man's cough. He turned to look at the flying platform.\nUnfortunately, the elder didn't continue speaking. Leo frowned and was confused.\n\"I clearly heard a sound.\"\nLeo jumped up to the platform. He stomped toward the fisherman's statue and confronted it.\n\"What did you do? I heard you.\"\n<…>\nNo statue responded.\nLeo slightly tilted his head and gave the statue a \"Are you serious\" look. He cracked his knuckles.\n\"Will you talk nicely or do you want me to smash every statue here?\"\n<…>\nThe four statues sweated profusely, yet they refused to talk for some reason.\nFortunately, one of them gave in first. The round slime-like cat with tentacles shifted his eyes.\n<Calm down, master, munya!>\n\"Hmm?\"\nAs soon as the catopus talked, the others stopped the façade. They all deeply sighed.\n<Please calm your anger, woof!> Said the wolf statue.\nThe black-winged angel statue also stood up, but he knelt on one knee to pay respect.\n<Don't be angry, master. He means well.>\nThe fisherman statue lowered his head next.\n<I used your golems without your permission. Please forgive me.>\n\"…\"\nLeo blankly stared at the four talking statues in shock for a minute. When he came to terms with the weird things around the domain and the system, Leo slapped his forehead and complained.\n\"An introduction is in order. Tell me who you are and why are you're here? Who are you? Why do you come out? What are your purposes?\"\nThe four heavenly guardians looked at each other and smiled. The fisherman began his introduction first.\n<We are… originally a part of you, master.> Said the fisherman.\n<We were your shadow, to be exact.> Said the black-winged angel.\n<You created us, munya!>\n<Or should we say… we exist because of your entity fate crystal, woof?>\nAs soon as the wolf blurt out the keywords, the other statues glared at her.\n<Bad dog, munya!>\n\"…\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he heard something interesting. He also tried to recall his past when he first got the alien rings.\nHe vaguely remembered something similar. Also, strangely, the expedition objective was related to an entity fate crystal. Leo wondered if they were connected.\n\"Next question, what is entity fate crystal? Why does it have to do with y'all?\"",

Water-based creatures have been strengthened. The density of water element essences have been doubled.>\n<Guardian \"Kitten\" will collect life force from the local population of Orlando Planet as local taxes. Every month, the guardian shall transfer the accumulated life force to you directly.>\nLeo gazed at the fisherman statue, who transformed into an elderly fisherman and vanished into the newly erected permanent portal to the previous mystic realm. He waved his hand to the elder.\n\"I'll call you back when I can find a better governor. Be patient… Kitten.\"\nThe fisherman statue bitterly laughed at his new nickname. He slightly bowed and vanished into the permanent portal.\nAfter the fisherman statue was gone, the three others returned to their previous position. They resumed their poses, pretending to be regular statues.\nLeo glanced at the trio and deeply sighed. He had heard everything from them, and he got a better understanding of his system and the entity fate crystal.\nStill, as the entity fate crystal's secret was too heavy, Leo still couldn't calm down. He also couldn't stop sighing.\n\"What the hell have I gotten myself into?\"\nAs overthinking deteriorated his sanity, Leo threw everything he had learned earlier to the back of his head. He glanced at the three statues.\n\"Keep up the good work. I'll summon you when I need your help in the future.\"\n<Roger, Munya!>\n<Of course, Woof!>\n<Understood, boss.>\nThe black-winged angel, the catopus, and the wolf respectfully bowed. Their eyes dimmed as they went back to dormant mode.\nLeo turned around and jumped down from the platform. He still had a lot of things to do, such as building the Gunsmith Workshop, upgrading the general store, tidying the junkyard, sorting spatial rings, and overseeing the warehouses.\nManaging an entire company alone was a tough job. The Florida Ceo would be busy for a long time.\n.\n.\nIt had been two weeks since every mystic realm portal in the world was opened. The expedition teams from big sects and clans returned to deliver their results.\nThe Tang Clan returned in full numbers as they never ventured far into the dangerous forests. They lingered around the pagoda town for a week before everybody returned.\nTang Xuan and his young junior received a full boon of the mystic realm. Some of them awakened either wood or water element while a few youngsters managed to advance to the golden core stage by cultivating the elemental Qi.\nYang Xiang and the first prince's teams managed to come back to tell a tale as well. The former's group returned early after they had discovered the sweet dream mushroom. As for the first prince's group, they salvaged a strange metallic ship and brought it home.\nUnfortunately, the second prince and his men perished because of a certain someone. The imperial court was in the middle of investigating the incident. It wouldn't be long before they would discover the culprit.\nAs for the third prince and his imperial bodyguards, they missed out on this event because Yan Xiang had punished him for ruining Tang Xuan's job when they visited Leo. Thus, he unknowingly saved his own hides for another day.\nStill, Yan Zhu couldn't enjoy his luck because his secret military base, aka the Fatui Cult, was in terrible shape.\nWhen the cultist from the Frozen Fire City went to check on their underground city, they discovered that all resident there was either missing or dead. Furthermore, the chosen cultists that participated in this season's mystic realm never returned. As a result, they lost 90% of their military strength.\nSitu Clan also got a disastrous casualty. Situ Nantian was critically injured while the rest of his followers perished in the mystic realm. The other elders also went missing as they became victims of the sweet dream mushrooms near the pyramid.\nThe Ouyang Clan's teams were the lucky dog among the prominent clans. They went to a different mystic realm, and they secured some treasures and rare herbs. A few clansmen managed to increase their strength to the next stage and gained a new elemental power.\nHowever, not all Ouyang Clan's members were as fortunate. Some of their agents in the Death Sword Sect suddenly stopped contacting their clan's headquarters to report their findings. Among the agents, Hua Guanhai no longer informed the clan about the Death Sword Sect's movements.\nNobody had realized yet that the Death Sword Sect brought in something from Leo's mystic realm, which would bring the second calamity that once traumatized Hua Jiashan and Situ Nantian 500 years ago.\ndisciples managed to return alive. Everybody but Hua Jiashan had .\nWHOOSH\nHua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and their disciples managed to return alive. Everybody but Hua Jiashan had been grinning from ear to ear as they were looking forward to the future merging.\nThe sect master gazed at his people and bitterly laughed. He already accepted his fate as a vessel of a new lord. He gazed at these people and instructed them one last time.\n\"Make sure to tidy up your living quarters and every facility before you visit senior Florida Man. At least, return the favor of the sword saint by treasuring his old home.\"\nHao Han and others came back to their senses. They faced Hua Jiashan and deeply bowed.\n\"We will not forget our true home, sect master. Even though we will be working for Senior Florida Man soon, our hearts and our blood belong to the Life Sword Sect!\" Han Hao pledged.\nHan Meng saluted, \"We may have to serve a new lord, but we won't forget our roots! We grew up from here, and this place will always be our home! You are also like a father to us. Our bond will never be broken!\"\nTiger Swordsman dryly laughed and chimed in, \"It's not like we will abandon the sect, Senior Hua. We can always return here to take care of the sect or help you teach young disciples. We just have another side job at Senior Florida Man's place!\"\nListening to his trusty people, Hua Jiashan was relieved. He waved his hand and allowed them to leave.\n\"Alright. You're dismissed. It will be lonely here, but you can always come back to visit me and tell me what it's like working for Florida Man.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nEverybody saluted Hua Jiashan. Then, they gradually spread the word to their colleagues that they would merge their sect with Florida Man's domain as they would receive abundant cultivation resources from him.\nAfter everybody had left, Hua Jiashan silently returned to his courtyard. He stood in the middle of the field and brought out a long sword. Then, he repeated the signature move of his sect, performing a rite for his ancestors.\nDancing with a sword for 10 minutes, Hua Jiashan's metal and fire element Qi resonated with his sword. However, his mind was blank as his consciousness already traveled to another place far away.\nWhile being absentminded, Hua Jiashan suddenly heard a stranger's voice in his mind.\n'You're getting sloppy, disciple.'\nHua Jiashan stopped practicing. He widened his eyes in shock.\n\"T-This voice… Master!? Is that you?!\"\nThe voice belonged to the ancient sword saint, who had long ascended to the immortal realm. The sword saint was also Hua Jiashan's secret mentor whom he had never told anybody about.\n'I've been listening. I heard our sect is going to merge with somebody else's domain? Is that true?'\n\"Y-Yes, master.\"\n'Who is he? Is he an immortal or a fellow swordsman?'\nHua Jiashan lowered his head in shame. He confessed, \"That person… is a mysterious cultivator, master. I believe that he might be an immortal in disguise, and he's a physique cultivator. He uses no sword or obvious martial arts, but his physical strength is definitely superior to everybody I've seen. His Qi is also… unique.\"\n'Tell me more.'\nHua Jiashan finally revealed a bright smile. He sat on the field alone and narrated how he encountered Leo in the mystic realm.\nLike a child telling his day at school to his parent, the sad look on his face vanished as if the merging no longer troubled his heart.\n.\n.\nCultivators from various sects either celebrated their successful expeditions or were saddened by their losses. The Amazonian Sanctuary was neither.\nFar north, beyond the Death Sword Sect's headquarters, thousands of young maiden and female elders gathered at a forest city, welcoming their master's return.\nEverybody cheered when Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and everybody returned without an injury at first. But then, Dongfang Mei returned and shocked her subordinates by announcing the new arrangement.\n\"We have a piece of bad news for you, ladies.\"\nDongfang Mei took a deep breath before she announced the merge.\n\"We shall relocate south and join a powerful immortal's domain! We will abandon this city!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nThe women stopped celebrating and stared at their master in disbelief. The forest and the city were their only sanctuary as the cultivation world was unforgiving for female cultivators.\nSexual harassment, human trafficking, and slavery were common in this world, where male cultivators ignored common sense and moral ethics. They acted like caveman barbarians, treating weaker cultivators as animals. Thus, living in this world as a woman was a nightmare. Many women developed a trauma, which prevented them from interacting with men.\nBecause of such oppression and treatment, the women banded together in this city to protect themselves. They even managed to gain respect from medium and small sects.\nHowever, Dongfang Mei, who had given them hope, suddenly dropped the bomb.\nUpon learning that they might have to leave this place to live with other male cultivators, some of the women protested.\n\"Why do we have to move?! We are safe here!\"\n\"Have you asked us if we want to move?!\"\n\"I'm not going anywhere! We built this city! We're not serving some perverts!\"\n\"Senior Dongfang! Are you trying to sell us to some vile men?!\"\nNoises got louder, and more women yelled at her.\nDongfang Mei had expected this outcome. She clapped her hands and gave them a choice.\n\"I see that most of you here favor staying. Then, I will give you a choice.\"\n\"A choice?\" Everybody stopped making noise. They listened to their leader.\n\"First, I will step down as the caretaker of this sanctuary and allow you to select a new leader.\"\n\"…\"\nThe women nodded in acknowledgment as they needed someone to replace Dongfang Mei. Still, they hesitated as none of them was as strong as her. The second strongest female cultivator there was Xu Nuan, but she didn't seem to be on their side.\nAside from Xu Nuan, there were plenty of nascent soul cultivators. They looked at each other, unable to decide which one to be nominated.\nWhile everybody was lost in thought, Dongfang Mei continued her speech.\n\"The new leader will inherit this city and the sanctuary, while I and Xu Nuan will migrate south. If anyone wishes to follow me, you are welcome to do so. However, you must continue to follow my instructions and orders until the authority is handed over to the domain lord.\"\nYao Qiqi next to Xu Nuan innocently vouched for Leo, \"The domain lord is very kind and strong, sister! He healed me, and he can fly with a SWOOSH!\"\nXu Nuan and Dongfang Mei's followers giggled at the girl. They patted her head.\n\"How did he fly?\"\nYao Qiqi mimicked how Leo jumped.\n\"He stomped the ground and SWOOSH!\" Yao Qiqi started leap-frogging while extending her arms like Superman.\n\"Hahahahaha!\"\nNothing healed a woman's heart pain more than seeing their child innocently playing. Xu Nuan and Dongfang Mei regained their hope, hoping to convince their followers to join them.\nXu Nuan stepped forward and told everybody the tale of Leo. She even included the incident when Leo rejected one of her disciples after the latter had attempted to seduce him.\nAmong the listeners, Qi Niu, who was the person in question, glared at Xu Nuan with red eyes. She bit her lower lip in embarrassment and shame.\nThanks to her reaction, many disciples noticed her expressions and connected the dots. One of them even asked the girl.\n\"Is that true, Qi Niu?\"\n\"…\"\n\"Did you get turned down by an elder? Did you try to seduce him?\"\n\"…\"\nThe two questions and Qi Niu's silence were enough to convince many girls. Slowly and gradually, more women leaned toward joining the domain of a mysterious elder.\nStill, after the speech, not all of them were willing to follow Dongfang Mei. Only 100 women chose to join their migration. As for the rest, they refused to change their ways.\nThe two groups silently parted ways. Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and 100 female disciples of the sanctuary boarded a small flying boat and flew south, heading to the Magpie City.",

Coincidentally, Dongfang Mei also arrived at the same time and parked their ship nearby.\nBoth Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei dryly laughed even though they would serve a stranger from now on.\nLeo and Wu Buyi welcomed them at the east road, 100 meters away from the apartment. They also prepared welcoming gifts for the new workers.\n\"You're finally here,\" Mocked Wu Buyi.\n\"…Yeah.\"\nHan Hao and Han Meng bitterly smiled while they stood in front of Wu Buyi. They were embarrassed that they weren't as decisive as him.\nHua Jiashan no longer looked sad anymore. He smiled and saluted Leo, \"Please take care of us, Lord Florida Man!\"\nDongfang Mei was the same. She glanced at her young disciples and hoped that Leo wouldn't bully them, \"Our fate is in your hands. Please guide us, Lord Florida Man.\"\nLeo swept his eyes across the field of 100 attractive maidens, who seemed to be in their teens. He then glanced at the crowd of male disciples. The latter group already lost their cool, and they drooled like a monkey who had never seen bananas. He was worried about their future.\nFor the sake of the female workers' safety, Leo gave them a little privilege.\n\"Dongfang Mei, is it? You will be in charge of all female workers here. The entire building is yours. There are about 40 rooms there, so some of you will have to share rooms. Decide how you share the rooms yourself.\"\nDongfang Mei and Xu Nuan were pleasantly surprised. They gazed at the building that Leo pointed at.\n.\nEmployee Apartment Level 9\nApartment Size – (3/10)\nApartment Quality – (6/10)\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThe apartment had been upgraded to level 9, and its quality was slightly improved. The plant walls were covered with wallpapers while the linoleum mats were smooth and seamless. Every room also came with a pre-installed air-conditioner and a heater.\nThe girls were glad that they didn't need to camp outside or build a new shelter. They brought their belongings to the building and explored their new living quarters.\nXu Nuan took charge of exploring each room. She received the room keys from Leo, and she went inside to see where her disciples would live.\nThe interior of each room and the space exceeded Xu Nuan's expectations. Each room was over 50 square meters, and Leo had already installed basic furniture for them. Two wooden bunk beds, four desks, four cabinets, and one refrigerator were present in every room.\nLeo proceeded to teach Xu Nuan and her people about the apartment's electricity system and the toilet. He flipped the light switches and showed her how the air conditioners and heaters worked. He even explained what the refrigerators could do.\n\"Four people can share one room by standard, but you can decide if you want to stuff four or more people in the same room. Also, I have already upgraded the refrigerators for you, so you don't have to worry about the electricity bills. Just don't throw rotten food or wet trash in there and forget about it. I'll be pissed if you ruin those!\"\n\"…\"\n\"The light switches are easy to operate. You just have to flip it on when you need a light source during nighttime. I have also sealed most of the electrical outlets. As long as you don't remove the covers and stick your fingers in there, you won't get zapped to death.\"\n\"…\"\n\"About the bathrooms and tap water, do remind your people not to overly rely on them as your drinking water source. I tried that, and the water still smells a bit fishy. If you need drinking water, take it from the main general store's building. The water there is a lot cleaner and it doesn't smell. Oh, you know how to use the toilets, don't you?\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan was so flabbergasted that she couldn't come up with the right questions to ask Leo. She had never seen a sect or a clan using unique artifacts to improve their quality of life as they usually used them to boost their combat prowess instead.\nEven if they were useful in random situations, most cultivators always drain every artifact's residual Qi and throw them away when they no longer provided Qi for them.\nSecondly, Xu Nuan sensed thick lightning Qi from the electrical outlets. Every room was a perfect living quarters for the big sect's executive members as they provided endless Qi to the residents. She was stunned that Leo nonchalantly shared the precious living quarters with her people.\n\"That will be all,\" Leo cut the coaching short as he had a lot of work to do. \"For today, get yourself familiar with your new home. If you need food, go pick a random fruit or veggie from the farms around here. If there is no food, go check the granaries near Wu Buyi's house. There should be a lot of potatoes in there if Cat hasn't eaten all of them. As for drinking water, as I said, take them from the general store.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Is there any question?\"\nThe girls no longer listened to Leo. Everybody cheered as they started picking their rooms without waiting for Dongfang Mei or Xu Nuan's instructions. The two elders also forgot about Leo as they were still stunned by the endless supply of lightning Qi.\nAt first, the teenage maidens didn't notice the Qi source. But when they lingered in the rooms for five minutes, their sharp senses picked up the Qi insignia of the lightning element Qi strands. Unknowingly, they stopped making noises to cultivate the Qi.\nThe group settled down, and the girls got quiet.\nSeeing that the girls adapted well, Leo left them alone for the day. He returned to the Life Sword Sect's group to give them a new place to live.\nDirectly north of the girl's apartment was another identical building, which Leo had unlocked after the general store had reached level 9.\nIt was the second apartment building, where Leo had prepared for Hua Jiashan's group.\nWhen Leo returned to the sword sect's people, he made a new rule.\n\"Alright, boys. As you can see, the apartment on the front is the girl's dorm. As for you horny sausages, you live in the back. I expect you to respect the girl's privacy and distance. I don't mind if some of you pursue them. But if you cross the line, your ass is fired, okay?\"\nIn short, Leo set up a line that the boys couldn't cross. He treated them like hormone-driven 13-year-old teens, who had never seen a woman in their entire lives.\nEven though Leo yelled at the men, they barely listened to him. Some of the disciples still eyed the gorgeous disciples of the sanctuary.\nLeo deeply sighed. He passed a paper fan to Wu Buyi. The latter received it and nodded as he knew what Leo wanted to do.\nPA!\nThen…\nPA!\nPA!\nPA!\nSeveral crisp slaps could be heard throughout the domain as Wu Buyi smacked the heads of horny disciples. Even Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman were slapped.\n\"AHEM!\"\nAgain, Leo tried to get their attention. He repeated what he said earlier. Then, he added a bait to entice the boys to work harder and become gentlemen.\nLeo ejected broken lightsabers, which he had obtained from the broken spaceship. He then activated one that he owned.\nA rainbow lightsaber was activated, releasing a loud buzz-hum noise.\n\"!!!\"\nHua Jiashan widened his eyes in shock. Tiger Swordsman dropped his jaw and drooled in envy. Even Han Meng rubbed his eyes several times as he couldn't comprehend what he just saw.\n\"L-Lord Florida Man. What is that?!\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\nAfter getting their attention, Leo baited them.\n\"This is an example of a monthly reward for the best employee of my store! It's called EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH!\"\n\"E-Employee of the month?\"\n\"That's right. All you have to do is to contribute the most, just like how you contribute to your sect.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"The judgment criteria will be how efficient you work, how much impact your contribution is, and how many people or customers you manage to bring to my store!\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"And most importantly, the employee of the month must not commit any taboo of my store, such as taking advantage of the weak, harassing women, bullying a child, or committing vile acts that trouble your colleagues, commoners, or other customers. If I catch you violating a girl or someone, your rewards will be confiscated, and I'll kick you out of my domain!\"\n\"OH!!\"\nFinally, the boys understood what Leo wanted. They were eager to start working right away.\n\"For now, your shelter will be that apartment over there. Four men to each room! I don't care how you allocate your men, but I don't want to see a random young master occupying a room to himself. Regardless of their statuses, they MUST share the rooms!\"\nWu Buyi and everybody saluted and bowed to Leo. Even Hua Jiashan lowered his head and guided his former subordinates to the building.\nHowever, as there were more people from Life Sword Sect, there weren't enough rooms for the men. After assigning 160 former deacons and elders to the rooms, they ran out of a place to sleep.\nIn the end, a thousand inner disciples and outer disciples were without shelter.\nLeo was ready for such a scenario. He guided the disciples to his general store.\nThe current building was three story-tall. It became an empty shopping mall with nothing to sell. However, Leo could use it for another purpose.\nLeo brought the young men to the third floor, where there was nothing but blank partitioned rooms and stores. Then, he started purchasing cheap beds from his online store and threw them into the blank rooms.\nAfter spending almost 5,000 years of lifespan, Leo provided the young men basic needs, such as warm spring beds, bed sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, soaps, shampoos, and a set of uniforms. He also allocated the third floor's public toilets as their exclusive bathrooms.\nIt took a whole day for Leo to reeducate the newcomers. Gao Yan also came to teach them about the toilets and the new common sense in this domain.\n.\n.\nThe day was long, but hard work was well-rewarded. Leo stood on top of the general store building, gazing at his shopping mall empire.\nDING\n<Current Lifespan – 176,127 Years…>\nTalismans provided a lot of lifespans. Even though Leo had used a lot to upgrade all of his buildings to level 9, he still had some leftovers.\n\"It's time.\"\nLeo went back into the general store's building, where he had built a new facility inside.\nOn the second floor, there was a new workshop, which Leo had secretly constructed. It occupied the northeast corner of the department store.\n.\nGunsmith Workshop Level 9\nGunsmith Mannequin (1/1)\nHandloading Mannequin (1/1)\nFirearm Technology (2/6)\nProduct Quality (2/6)\nStructure Quality (3/6)\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nTwo wooden mannequins tirelessly worked inside their store, building ancient firearms for Leo.\nLeo visited the workshop inside his mall and checked the finished product. He picked up a matchlock rifle and flipped it around. Then, he tested it by pulling the trigger without using any gunpowder.\nCLICK\nNothing was shot out. However, the trigger worked as intended.\nLeo smiled at the product. He brought it out to the store's rooftop to test it. After bringing it outside, he patiently loaded the rifle with the gunpowder that the mannequins had provided him in the workshop. Then, Leo loaded the weapon with an essence stone, using it instead of regular bullets.\nHe took aim toward the north. Then, he fired.\nBANG\nIt had a strong recoil. Leo's hands slightly jerked after the rifle fired a laser beam toward the sky. As for the essence stone, it disappeared along with the laser beam.\nLeo shrugged as he found the shot average. He loaded a new bullet and gunpowder sack. Then, he added his Qi to the bullet and rifle.\nBOOM\nThe matchlock rifle exploded as it was overloaded. The gunpowder and the essence stone created a flame blast, burning Leo's shirt. Fortunately, his new pants and underwear didn't catch flame.\nAfter causing the misfire, Leo sighed.\n\"I need new testers. Maybe, I should use assign new employees to the workshop and have them test the rifles.\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. Although he had a new source of lifespan income, he didn't forget about the core of his shop domain's perks.\n\"I also need new merchandise to scam others. Well, I might as well only sell essence stones for lifespan while I sell my items for essence stones. That way, I can get more profits!\"",

Comfortable beds, great cultivation environment, and useful artifacts, I can't ask for more.\"\nHan Hao and Han Meng shared the same room as they were father and son. Although the room was big enough for four people to live, nobody dared to share a room with them as an ex-grand elder and the head disciplinary elder's statuses were still superior to others.\nIn addition, Han Hao's wife hadn't learned about this place yet. He still had to travel to his wife's hometown and bring them here in the future.\nBoth elders checked every nook and cranny of their new home as everything was so interesting, especially the electrical appliances.\n\"Isn't this something alchemists love?\" Han Hao opened a modern refrigerator and inhaled cold air.\nHan Meng opened a curtain to see the view behind the apartment. Unfortunately, Leo didn't build this apartment like a resort, Han Meng only saw the recycling center, a junkyard, and a lumber yard.\nBeyond the recycling center, Han Meng noticed long fences and a large barn. A few thunder unicorns gathered there as the barn was their new home.\nLooking at the group of 9th-stage monster beasts, Han Meng wryly smiled, \"Nah, I'm not surprised anymore. We're working for a big shot now. Father, I think we will advance to the quasi-immortal stage within 100 years if we keep working under Lord Florida Man. Look at those monster horses! They are obeying Lord Florida Mna's orders!\"\nHan Hao and Han Meng laughed. They looked forward to working with Leo. For the day, they adjusted their conditions, cultivating whatever Qi they detected in the room.\n.\nMeanwhile, Tiger Swordsman and Hua Jiashan shared the same room. The former awkwardly knelt on his knees, looking at the sect master.\n\"I-I thought you wouldn't join us, sect master.\"\nHua Jiashan stroked his beard. He widely grinned, \"Who said I couldn't change my mind?\"\n\"B-But I thought you treasured the sect. Who's going to take care of the sect's facilities?\"\nTiger Swordsman thought of the abandoned buildings of the Life Sword Sect. As everybody migrated to Leo's domain, nobody would take care of it anymore. The local townsmen from Magpie City might also be in trouble as they could no longer commission their disciples or elders to help them.\nHua Jiashan saw through Tiger Swordsman's thoughts. He snickered.\n\"The sect is close-by. We can rotate our people or send some free disciples back there to clean our sect.\"\n\"A-And what about our library and treasury?\"\n\"Who's gonna steal that useless library with nothing but common martial art techniques? Everything is in my head. If I want to, I can just write new manuals.\"\n\"But the heritage of the sword saint…\"\nHua Jiashan burst into laughter. He waved his hand.\nWHOOSH\nAn energy sword manifested and hovered in front of Hua Jiashan. Moreover, it didn't use the sect master's Qi as its primary energy source.\nIt was an electric energy sword, emitting yellow light. It also had the same aura as yellow tribulation lightning bolts.\n\"T-This,\" Tiger Swordsman was astonished.\n\"The sword saint contacted me a few days ago. He taught me a better version of our sword arts, and he allows me to work for another immortal for the time being. He told me that we could easily restore the Life Sword Sect after we got a lot stronger. For now, we can stop worrying about managing the sect so that we can focus solely on our training.\"\nTiger Swordsman repeatedly nodded as he agreed. When he was still an elder of the Life Sword Sect, he spent 70% of his time teaching and completing the sect's missions. The rest of his free time was shared between recuperation time and training. This was the reason why his growth rate was slower than the others.\n\"B-But, sect master, what about the work in this domain? Will Lord Florida Man allow us to train?\"\nHua Jiashan laughed again, \"Are you stupid? Did you listen to his explanation about the work rules?\"\n\"Erm, rules?\"\n\"We only need to work when the sun is up, and we can rest when the sun goes down. We work five days and get two days off every week. Compared to what I imposed on you lots, this work rule is very lenient and comfortable!\"\n\"…Wow.\"\nTiger Swordsman finally remembered what Leo had told him when they were inside the pagoda town. He was excited that he luckily secured an easy job with high pay. At this rate, he would swim in essence stones and cultivation resources.\n\"For now, let's get used to the room's natural pressure and the lightning Qi. Get on your bed and start adjusting your dantian and conditions.\"\n\"Yes, sect master!\"\nHua Jiashan's smile stiffened. Even though they submitted to Leo, Tiger Swordsman still called him sect master. As Hua Jiashan wished to avoid complications, he corrected Tiger Swordsman.\n\"Just call me by my name. We're no longer masters and subordinates. We're colleagues now.\"\n\"…Ugh, yes, s-senior Hua.\"\n\"Still be bit stiff, but, well, fine.\"\nIt would take a while before Tiger Swordsman could relax around Hua Jiashan.\n.\n.\nThe next day at 4 AM, the sanctuary girls, the sect's disciples, and elders stopped cultivating and gathered in the field, east of the apartment. They waited for Leo to come out and give them instructions.\nUnfortunately, Leo did not follow the local's traditions of not sleeping and eating. He still required 6-8 hours of sleep every day even though he could stay awake for months without sleeping if he wanted to.\nAs a result, some young disciples got bored of waiting. As they had nothing to do, they roamed the farms and the domain's territory, exploring the buildings.\nMany disciples gathered around Gao Yan, who was the only disciple that got to live in a small house, next to Wu Buyi's home. They bombarded him with questions.\n\"Gao Yan, what's it like to work here? What do we have to do?\"\n\"Is Lord Florida Man kind? What did you get from him?\"\n\"Has Lord Florida Man taught you any techniques?\"\nGao Yan patiently answered them one at a time. He also glanced at the group of girls, who secretly eavesdropped their conversations.\n\"So far, the work here is quite simple. We only need to help Senior Florida Man with the farm work. You see the farms in front of the apartment? That's where most of us will be working at.\"\nGao Yan walked toward the chilies farm and brought out a large crate from his spatial ring. He then showed the people how to collect the crops.\n\"For example, these chilies are Exploding Reaper Chilies. It's a spice that can be used in alchemy, and it's edible if you cultivate the fire element Qi. We collect the chilies like this…\"\nEach chili was one foot long and three inches thick. Each plant bore hundreds of red spices, which glowed in the dark.\nGao Yan avoided touching the chilies directly. He cut the stalks with a knife and let the large chilies fall into the wooden crate.\n\"One crate can store about 40-50 chilies at most, so I usually store about 30ish chilies. Well, you don't have to count it. Just measure the size with your eyes and stop using the same crate when it's half-full. Because we can't touch it, we will play it safe and only store half.\"\nOne of the girls got curious. She pushed through the crowd and asked Gao Yan.\n\"What will happen if we touch the chilies?\"\nGao Yan wryly smiled. He showed them by picking one of the chilies with a tong and placing it on the ground, 10 meters away from the farm and the crowd. He turned around and warned them.\n\"Don't try this, ever.\"\nAfter giving them a warning, Gao Yan poked the chili with his fingertip. As soon as he touched it, he kicked the ground and leaped away.\nThe chili instantly swelled. Then, as its name implied, it exploded. A small flame bomb erupted, burning everything within 10 meters black.\nGao Yan licked the tip of his finger to heal the burn wound. Unfortunately, the spiciness of the chili hit his tongue, and the strong smell of wasabi hit his nose. He staggered backward two steps before he regained his bearings.\nComing back to his senses, Gao Yan warned them again.\n\"There you have it. The explosion is capable enough to kill any nascent soul cultivator, according to Elder Wu's estimation. Unless you have already mastered the fire element, you should avoid working at the chilies farm. I suggest you try the potato farm or the dragon fruit farm over there.\"\nGao Yan pointed at the array of strange trees, south of the chilies farm. A hundred black trees surrounded a tall white tree at the center. Under the trees, piles of black fruits emanated thick fag of yin Qi.\n\"W-What is that place?\" Asked the girl.\n\"Dragon Fruit Farm. They're the fruits that the thunder unicorns eat. Oh, Cat also loves that. If you work there, you will run into them a lot.\"\n\"Cat? Thunder Unicorns?\"\nSeveral disciples, elders, and deacons had already seen Cat and the unicorns, but many hadn't noticed them yet. Those who knew brightly smiled while those who didn't had a dark expression.\nSpeaking of the devil, Cat heard the call and responded to Gao Yan. Despite being a massive chomper plant, she jumped by using her long roots.\nBOOM\nCat landed in the middle of the crowd. She grinned and greeted them.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nThis was her way of greeting and judging the newcomers. Any disrespectful cultivator would usually attack her and got themselves killed. As for those who knew, they simply needed to pay the \"Nom-Nom Tax\", and Cat would leave them alone.\nXu Nuan, Han Hao, Han Meng, and many people from the Life Sword Sect were aware of this custom. They each ejected a large dead animal from their spatial rings and tossed them to Cat.\nThe chomper bobbed her head up and down like a cheerful cockatoo, giving them approval. She swallowed the nom-nom taxes and leaped away.\nAgain, the old customers laughed and smiled while the newcomers looked at the parting monster in shock and fear.\n\"W-What was that?!\"\n\"I-Isn't that a 7th-stage monster plant?!\"\n\"Are they keeping a monster here?!\"\nGao Yan wryly smiled and pointed at the sky. Everybody looked up. Then, they found two thunder unicorns, walking in mid-air and patrolling the area.\n\"Please get used to the guardians around here. Not only do we have Senior Florida Man's pet, but we also have a hundred of his mounts… 9th-stage monster beast mounts. We will be helping him feed these mounts and his pet every day from now on. This will be our primary job.\"\n\"…\"\nWhile every youngster and newcomer was shocked, Xu Nuan couldn't stop smiling. As taming was her forte, this place was her paradise.\nUnable to stop her excitement, Xu Nuan asked Gao Yan.\n\"Do you know if I can volunteer to be those beasts' caretaker?\"\n\"Err, are you sure?\" Gao Yan was surprised.\n\"I'm confident in my abilities. Actually, if I work with those unicorns, everybody here won't have to risk their lives interacting with those monsters. Let me take charge of this job!\"\nGao Yan and everybody from Life Sword Sect gazed at the elderly lady in awe and respect. As nobody disagreed, they selected Xu Nuan and her disciples to take care of the animals.\n.\nThe talk continued for two hours as Gao Yan continued introducing every place to the women and the new employees.\nAt 8 AM, Leo finally woke up. He carried a dozen prototype matchlock rifles and came out of his store. He found the large crowd on the farms, harvesting and helping the farming mannequins.\nImpressed by their proactive and enthusiasm, Leo couldn't help but smile.\n\"Wow. They're workaholics, I see.\"\nLeo thought of the lazy youngsters in his home country. Weirdly, a job application was a bane of their existence to the point that it could be used in a certain exorcism.\nIt was pointless to think about the modern era. Leo walked toward them and clapped his hands.\n\"Gather up! Let's assign roles and tasks before you start messing around!\"\nThe new farmers stopped what they were doing and gathered in front of the general store. Disciples, who were loitering around the workshop area, ran to the front to join the gathering.\nHua Jiashan, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Han Hao, Wu Buyi, Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and other elders were present. They were ready to learn about their new lifestyle.\nWithin five minutes, all members were accounted for. Leo began interviewing them and assigning work.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 133 – Florida Man Distributes Guns to School Teachers and Students for Self-Protection. Multiple School Shooters Reported 10 Minutes Later.\nAfter the interview, Leo took notes on everybody's specialties. He then assigned tasks to them.\nXu Nuan and half of the sanctuary girls were assigned as unicorn grooms, and they were now in charge of feeding 100 thunder unicorns and grooming them if needed.\nYao Qiqi and Esen were grouped together. Leo ordered them to follow Cat around and make sure she wouldn't randomly go anywhere or cause problems.\nThe rest of the girls were sent to the clothing store, where the automaton tailor tirelessly mass-produced men's clothes. Their job was to help the mannequin set up a proper store and manage the clothing store's stocks.\nDongfang Mei and Hua Jiashan got a strange job. Leo called them \"Bouncers\", and he sent them to protect the mystic realm platform. They only needed to be there and make sure nobody could enter Orlando Planet without permission.\nWu Buyi, Gao Yan, and alchemists from Life Sword Sect received permission to build a new alchemy warehouse and herb farm anywhere in Leo's domain so that Leo could expand his farms without using the system.\nTiger Swordsman, Han Hao, Han Meng, and seven elders of the Life Sword Sect were put into the same team. Leo gave them the prototype matchlock rifles and told them to practice using them.\nAs for the rest of the disciples and deacons, Leo divided them into three groups and let them work in an 8-hour shift. Their job was to plant seeds and harvest crops as Leo's system farms produced crops nonstop, and the automaton farmers couldn't harvest the ripened fruits, vegetables, and plants fast enough.\nOnce everybody got a job, Leo reminded them of their pay.\n\"As promised, I'll pay your monthly wage in essence stones. But if you don't like them, you may exchange them for the products that I sell in my store. Of course, the new prototype weapons and clothes are included.\"\nLeo pointed at the group of elders, who held strange rods in their hands. They flipped the rifles around as if they had never seen them before.\n\"What is this artifact, senior?\" Asked Tiger Swordsman.\n\"A gun.\"\n\"A… gun?\"\nThe elders still didn't understand what they were for. On the other hand, Gao Yan gulped as he was envious of the elders.\nBecause of his curiosity, Gao Yan asked Leo and brought out the level-8 pistol, \"Sir, are they the same as the gun you gave me?\"\nLeo glanced at Gao Yan's gun and nodded. He explained, \"Your weapon is a bit different since I made that. As for those prototype rifles, they are the mass-produced version that I will be selling in my store in the future. For now, I need you to learn how to use them first. When you master those, you can teach our future customers without relying on me.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"Also,\" Leo remembered that he forgot to mention the danger of those firearms. He reminded them, \"Those rifles use spirit stones or essence stones as ammunition. You can add your Qi into the ammo to increase its destructive power, but I haven't tested how far you can add.\"\nLeo grinned while the expressions of the elders turned white. They realized that Leo used them as guinea pigs to test his new artifacts.\n\"Umm,\" Han Meng raised his hand. \"You said something about using spirit stones as ammunition. Do we have to use our spirit stones to practice using it?\"\n\"Well, it won't be fair if I let you use your money to test my weapons. Of course, I'll be providing you my spirit stones.\"\n\"I-I see.\"\nHan Hao's team was relieved as they wouldn't need to squander their precious cultivation resources and money to complete their assignments.\nStill, nobody in the world would be willing to work for someone for free. Dongfang Mei, Hua Jiashan, and Han Hao wondered if Leo could fulfill his promises.\n\"Lord Florida Man,\" Hua Jiashan stepped forward. \"About the promise, can we enter your domain's mystic realm freely?\"\nLeo nodded, \"You may enter the domain if it's your day off or when you're off your shift. During working days, nobody should be entering that place!\"\n\"I see!\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were delighted. As they only needed to work 40 hours a week, they had plenty of time to enter the mystic realm and cultivate.\nWith just that information, both leaders no longer felt bad that they had abandoned everything to serve Leo. They were happy with the treatments, the jobs, and the pay.\n.\nAfter assigning jobs to his employees, everybody was dismissed to get familiarized with their tasks.\nAs Xu Nuan was experienced in communicating with beasts and monsters, she didn't need Leo's help. She guided her people to the barn and introduced herself to the 9th-stage monster beasts.\nThe thunder unicorns received her well. Even P.Hub and Taxi liked her.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei also had no issues with their job since they only needed to be on the platform and protect the portal. Both sat in front of the permanent portal on the platform, gazing at the three giant statues and meditating in peace.\nYao Qiqi and Esen laughed and rode on Cat's chomper head. The plant monster ran around the domain, showing them everything they needed to know. The loli trio seemed to be playing instead of working.\nThe clothing store team seemed to be having fun as well. Leo and others could hear their squeal from outside the store as the girls got overexcited from seeing the even dresses in there. They would be busy in the store for a long time.\nThe alchemists had no issue with their assignments at first. But when they tried to chop iron pine lumber to build a new house, they failed to cut through the thick wood. Only when Gao Yan pulled out his lightsaber and cut the lumber with it, they could continue working.\nWu Buyi only watched the team working on a new workshop. He didn't tell Gao Yan or others that some of the lumber was sacred wood, which got mixed into the lumber. As a lot of sacred wood lay around in the lumber field, Wu Buyi stopped caring and let everything run its course.\nThe farmer team had no issue as most of the disciples were originally born from farmer families. Only the chilies farm workers seemed to be hesitating as they were afraid of touching the crops.\nAs the new farmers were afraid of exploding chilies, Leo purchased rubber gloves from the online store system and distributed them to all workers on the field, including the off-shift employees.\nWith rubber gloves, the employees tried to touch the chilies.\nUpon touch, the chilies didn't explode. Everybody was relieved that their lives wouldn't be at risk anymore, and they had no issue working.\nEvery group adjusted to the new environment and quickly settled in, except the group of new riflemen.\n.\nLeo ordered Han Hao's team to follow him. The group arrived at the west of the domain, where they could see a long stream. Leo put a long table there and covered it with a white sheet. Then, he lined a hundred small sacks of gunpowder on the table.\nHe also brought out a bin full of spirit stones. As these stones came from dead thieves, their quality was average. They were perfect materials for practice shooting.\nOnce the arrangement was ready, Leo ordered them.\n\"Stand in one column. Bring out the guns I gave you.\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao and others brought out the rifles from their spatial rings and awkwardly carried them in their arms.\nLeo also brought out his rifle. He showed them how to safely carry a rifle without pointing the muzzle at their teammates.\n\"This is how you carry a long rifle. Use your arm and shoulder to support it. Don't forget to point it up or down at the ground for safety even though there's no bullet in it. Discipline is a must if you want to master advanced firearms in the future…\"\nThe crowd mimicked Leo's action. As they were cultivators, they were fast learners. In a few minutes, they could rotate the long rifles like a modern tomb guard, except the weapon was different.\nSeeing how they could adjust to the rifles well, Leo moved on to the next lesson.\n\"See the little sacks here? Break one of them in half and pour the black powder in here. Then, you put a spirit stone into this hole and use this shaft to push it to the end of the tunnel…\"\nAgain, after one demonstration, they perfectly copied Leo's technique. However, the group was disappointed as the techniques seemed too easy.\nHan Hao complained while he loaded a spirit stone into the gun barrel.\n\"Umm, Lord Florida Man. Isn't the technique a bit… mundane? Even a commoner can do this. Is this really a useful artifact?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He directly touched a spirit stone and dropped it into his rifle's barrel. After loading the bullet, he aimed up and lighted a cord.\nBANG\nWithout using his Qi, the newly made essence stone transformed into a laser beam and separated the clouds in the sky. The bullet vanished into space and disappeared.\n\"…\"\nThe students gazed at the laser beam and dropped their jaws. Doubts and questions in their mind vanished.\nLeo tilted his head and gave them a meaningful look.\n\"Do you still think it's not useful?\"\n\"N-No, senior! T-That element Qi… was too strong! I-I think it can vaporize any soul formation cultivator, no, any soul transformation cultivator! I don't think sect master Hua can take that shot!\"\nLeo nodded and explained, \"This is an outdated weapon that I want you to try. In the future, my merchandise will be a lot more powerful and easy to use. Even a kid can use it to kill strong cultivators.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Before that can happen, you need to know how to operate each gun so that you will have more experience in the field. When a gunfight occurs, you can outperform them and kill your opponents with the same weapons. Do you get it?\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior.\"\n\"Good. Now, that you have loaded your ammo, I'll teach you how to aim. Copy my posture and look carefully at how I aim at the target…\"\n\"…\"\nNo one questioned Leo anymore. They listened and watched the demonstration.\n.\n10 minutes later…\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nTen elders of the Life Sword Sect pulled the triggers in unison. The spirit stones transformed into long yellowish needles and pierced through iron pine trees.\nUnlike Leo, the elders added their Qi into the spirit stones to increase firepower. Everybody smiled as they could feel the feedback from each shot.\nThey got addicted to the toys. Every time the targets were hit, they were elated.\nLike a company of musketeers, their reload motions seemed like a choreography. Even when they aimed and pulled the triggers, everything happened at the same time.\nLeo watched them from the back and secretly swallowed his saliva. He wondered if these cultivators were hidden geniuses.\n'I'll be damned. Why are these old men so good at guns? I thought they would have fumbled a few times or shot their own feet. Welp, there goes the fun.'\nDespite these thoughts, Leo was happy that they mastered the art. With this improvement, they could teach the other employees in his stead and reduce his workload.\nAlso, with these guys, Leo was confident that he could upgrade his general store to level 10 and remove the system's newbie protection.\nHe wondered if the system would unlock a PVP system or something similar. He could only pray that it wouldn't be that bad.\n.\n.\nImperial Palace\nYan Xiang and Yan Luo gazed at the mysterious spaceship that the latter had salvaged from a ruin. They smiled from ear to ear as they waited for their subordinates to finish exploring it.\nA group of elderly men came out. Surprisingly, the team's leader was none other than Tang Xuan.\n\"We have finished inspecting this artifact, your majesty,\" reported Tang Xuan. \"This is a flying ship of an unknown country. We've found traces of commoners here, but we don't find any Qi sources or artifacts. However...\"\n\"Yeah?\" Both father and son were curious, \"However?\"\nTang Xuan hesitated if he should reveal the thing he had found. He closed his eyes for a moment and chose not to disclose the information. After all, he felt threatened.\n\"However, we've discovered that there were artifacts in this ship, but someone had already taken all of them.\"\nYan Luo smirked, \"Yeah, Florida Man took them all and killed my brother. Or rather, Florida Man found everything, but my brother tried to rob him. He got his karma served.\"\nYan Xiang snorted, \"Florida Man or not, he killed my son. Even if that brat is a disgrace to my family, his surname was YAN. Florida Man has to pay for his crime!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan quietly sighed as he gave up on them. He could only pray for their quick demise.\nStill, as a loyal servant of Yan Xiang, he tried to divert their attention by informing them of the urgent tasks. He reminded them.\n\"Before we think about revenge, how about we plan for the upcoming Jianghu Alliance Meeting in two weeks? All sects will bring their disciples to the capital for the tournament to show off their gains from the mystic realms. You have selected your representatives yet.\"\nYan Xiang and Yan Luo paused to think. As this event focused on their reputation, they couldn't ignore it.\n\"What was the age category again? 20?\" Asked Yan Luo.\n\"It's 18 this year, your highness. The age limit is reduced because of the number of competitors last year.\"\n\"Oh, shame. Well, we have to pick someone from the army again. Say, can I borrow one of your disciples?\" Yan Xiang thought of Tang Tian's disciple. He wondered if he could poach him.\n\"You must be joking, your majesty. He will participate as a representative of my Sixth Element Sect.\"\n\"I'm joking. I'm joking. Don't take it too seriously.\"\n\"Of course, I know.\"\nAlthough their conversation seemed peaceful, Yan Luo secretly glared at Tang Xuan. He was envious of his sect.\n\"I guess we have to postpone the revenge business to another date,\" Yan Xiang grinned as he had an idea. \"Say, Tang Xuan. Can you send an invitation to Florida Man if he will participate in this event? Maybe… we can humiliate him before our ancestors come down to kill the guy.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 134 – Florida Man Purchases Luxurious Sports Cars to Decorate His Parking Lot\nA week passed after the merge, Leo's employees settled down to the new lifestyle.\nOff-shift employees all entered the \"Orlando Planet\" to cultivate wood and water Qi. Even muscle-tempering realm disciples tried their luck in there. However, they had to come back to rest and recuperate as the overflowing elemental Qi in that world was too strong for their bodies to handle.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei finally understood why Leo assigned them there. As the only seniors in the area, they healed and corrected the weak disciples' Qi and dantians. After the recuperation, the disciples either advanced to the Qi condensation stage or improved their constitution.\nFormer outer disciples of the Life Sword Sect and the Amazon Sanctuary quickly developed their physiques and inner Qi. After a week, 300 muscle-tempering stage youths became Qi condensation stage cultivators.\nThe improvement of the teenagers made Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei proud even though they barely helped them. Because of the positive emotion, they had fun rescuing reckless youths and observing their growth.\nAside from the daily routine, a new building was erected. East of the Recycling Center, Wu Buyi, Gao Yan, and their alchemy team built the first non-system alchemy workshop of their own. Using the materials from the junkyard, they made 50 alchemy cauldrons to practice making pills.\nThat day, Wu Buyi and the alchemist team received a new assignment from Leo.\n.\nLeo stood in front of the newly built workshop. He opened the domain system map and noticed that it occupied 100x100 grids. Moreover, the workshop was 10 meters tall, and it came with three floors – The basement, the first floor, and the second floor.\nThe architecture and design were still rough as the roof was made from clay tiles. Because of its amateurish workmanship, there might be leaks. These alchemists would surely get into trouble during the rainy season.\nAlthough he was impressed by their carpentry skills, Leo didn't forget that it was not a system structure. Soon, it had to be deconstructed and replaced with an upgradable system building.\n\"I see that you finish making your workstation. Then, Wu Buyi, are you ready for a new task?\"\nWu Buyi, Gao Yan, Life Sword Sect's alchemists, and aspiring alchemists gathered around Leo and saluted.\n\"We're ready, my lord!\"\n\"Good. Here is your first task. I want you to make grain pills according to the recipe I give you. The ingredients are mostly stored in either the granary or the warehouse. Use them as you see fit.\"\nWu Buyi received a modern A4 paper, which he had never seen before. He was impressed by the smooth surface and the sharp edge.\n\"Erm, senior?\" Gao Yan noticed that Wu Buyi was distracted.\n\"Oh, ahem!\"\nWu Buyi stopped checking the paper and read the recipes.\n\"The recipe is… iron pine nut, one starch, one metal element catalyst, and fire element Qi. Huh?\"\nWu Buyi frowned as the recipe used too many top-grade materials. In addition, Leo wrote a paragraph underneath the recipe to teach them about his insight.\nThe alchemist elder continued reading.\n\"Umm, according to the annotation, the grain pills will mutate according to the additional elemental Qi we use. If we use essence instead of Qi, the pill quality will improve. For example, if we can use all five basic element essence, the grain pills will come out with all five elements.\"\n\"…Wow!\" Gao Yan and the alchemists were astonished.\nWu Buyi paused for a moment and sneaked a glance at Leo's face. He then asked, \"Umm, if it's not too much, can we observe how you make these pills?\"\n\"Can't y'all figure it by yourself? What are you? A donut?\"\nWu Buyi was embarrassed. As shameless as he was, Wu Buyi pressed on.\n\"I'm so sorry, my lord. We need a reference of how you do it.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes as he didn't want to waste his precious system workshop's time on something cheap and outdated. Still, he entertained these alchemists nonetheless.\nWalking back to the workshops, the group followed Leo. Upon arrival, Leo noticed that the second workshop had just finished making another batch of yang flame pills. Leo stopped the mannequin and inserted the ingredients for grain pills instead.\nAfter tossing iron pine leaves, a piece of potato, and a pine nut in there, Leo closed the lid and spat on the fireplace as usual. Then, he activated the system workshop in front of the crowd.\nDING\nThe fire was automatically lit. The workshop mannequin also put his hands on the cauldron and adjusted the flame balance for Leo.\nLeo turned around to look at the crowd.\n\"Done.\"\n\"Eh?\" Gao Yan and others were taken aback. They thought that Leo would teach them.\n\"If you want to learn, watch the doll over here. He will show you how it's done. Oh, also, you.\" Leo ordered the mannequin, \"Keep making the grain pills and let them observe you, okay? Keep making until you're out of materials.\"\nThe mannequin nodded. He then focused on the cauldron.\nAfter entrusting his task to the mannequin, Leo left the alchemist group. He also gave Wu Buyi homework.\n\"I hope to see you master this recipe. If you can't make pinnacle-grade grain pills like that doll, I'll confiscate the phone.\"\n\"!!!\"\nWu Buyi's face was ashen. As the phone had been fulfilling his dream and broadening his horizon, Wu Buyi couldn't afford to lose it.\nBecause of desperation, Wu Buyi's concentration was heightened. He saluted Leo and turned around to observe the mannequin with burning eyes.\nSeeing that the trick worked, Leo pointed at Gao Yan, too.\n\"You, too. If you can't make a pinnacle-grade grain pill within this year, I'll confiscate that lightsaber! You're an alchemist, not a Jedi. Why the hell are you wielding that showy sword around?! Didn't Thora tell you not to use it?!\"\n\"!!!\"\nIt was Gao Yan's turn to be surprised. He closed his mouth and glanced at his sentient dao spirit.\nThora had been crossing her arms and pouting at Gao Yan. She also scolded him.\n'He's right. You shouldn't use that sword or reveal its existence to others! Why did you keep using it in public? Do you want to tempt your friends to kill you in your sleep?'\nGao Yan sweated profusely, \"B-But the lumber is too strong! Even Master Wu can't cut it with his sword. Without the artifact, we can't even build the workshop!\"\n'No excuses! This happened because you people are too weak! If you have time to build that useless thing, you should have trained some more!'\n\"…\"\nGao Yan wanted to cry as building the workshop was Leo's idea, yet he got scolded. Meanwhile, Leo secretly glanced at Gao Yan and looked away, pretending that it was none of his business. He moved on to check the gunsmith in the general store.\n.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nOn the second floor of Leo's store, two automaton mannequins sat at their workbenches, working on their new rifle and ammunition.\nThe gunsmith had robotic arms like the tailor of the clothing store. However, he didn't need Leo's skin to create gun parts as he got the materials from elsewhere.\nLining inside other partitioned rooms were sacred wood blocks and a large chunk of gemstone, which Leo had extracted from the ground.\n.\nSuperconductor Obsidian of Holy Lich\nThis 10,000-year-old mineral is the crystallization of a dead Archlich's dantian core. As the former master of this dantian crystal was as strong as a celestial king, this mineral inherited his physical strength. If it's used to make weapons, it will surely be extremely durable.\nCannot be used in alchemy.\nCan be used to make weapons or converted into metals\n.\nThis superconductor mineral was the primary material for the gun barrels and other parts. The matchlock rifles that Leo had given to Han Hao and others were also made from this material.\nUnfortunately, the superconductor obsidian was not strong enough to withstand Leo's Qi and his empowered essence stones. Leo still needed better material for his personal firearms. In addition, the gunsmith workshop was still low-level. The workshop mannequins couldn't make a better version of rifles or guns yet.\nLeo visited the temporary storage rooms of the gunsmith and replenished the stock. Then, he went to check the other mannequin and his work.\nThe second mannequin didn't tinker or temper with the gun parts. Instead, he worked on the unique gunpowder of Leo's store.\nLeo glanced at the crates of exploding chilies. Looking at the out-of-place ingredient, he wryly smiled.\n.\nExploding Reaper Chilies\nCan be found in a temperate climate area or a mystic realm with the fire element Qi. These chilies can explode if they are directly touched by a cultivator. However, it won't react if you touch it with non-organic objects.\nNot suitable for food or alchemy due to its chemical reactions.\n.\nA knife extended from the second mannequin's arm as he brought a thick chili to the workshop table and sliced it in half. Upon cutting it open, white seeds of the chili came out.\nThe mannequin didn't stop there. He separated the seeds and put them in another container. After moving the seeds away, he began to chop the chili into smaller pieces.\nDOK-DOK-DOK\nAs if someone was chopping a vegetable, the chopping sound echoed in the mall. However, in reality, the mannequin's speed surpassed that of what a human's eye could see. Within seconds, a large piece of chili turned into red powder.\nAfter getting the red powder, the mannequin poured them into a large mortar. He then reached out for a ladle and scooped rainbow water from a bucket in the gunsmith.\nLeo wryly smiled as he remembered the water. It was tap water from the general store, but it was mixed with his saliva. This contaminated water was one of the ingredients to make the gunpowder!\nAfter mixing the water into the chili powder, the mannequin started grinding them. The red pieces of chili slowly turned black and hardened as they absorbed the mutated water.\nA few seconds later, the chili powder turned into black powder.\n.\nReaper Gunpowder\nMade from Florida Man's bodily fluid and Exploding Reaper Chili. A pinch of this gunpowder is as deadly as 100 grams of TNT. Keep it away from fire.\n.\nThis was the source of Leo's gunsmith's gunpowder. As long as Leo kept growing chilies, he would have endless sources of gunpowder for his toys.\nFor now, the bottleneck of gun production was the rifle's crafting speed. The mannequin could only make five matchlock rifles per day, which was not enough to arm everybody in Leo's domain.\n'This will take ages to make a musketeer squadron.'\nLeo sighed and brought empty buckets to a public bathroom. He refilled the water and spat into them. Then, he carried the buckets to the gunsmith for the mannequins to work with.\nAfter replenishing the water, Leo dumped a few more crates of chilies in the store room and left the workers alone. He walked down the stairs.\nArriving on the first floor, Leo admired the new look of his general store. It looked like a large indoor wet market as showcase tables and a dozen door refrigerators were full of his merchandise.\nVegetables, fruits, potatoes, pills, and mutated plants filled the first floor. Instead of storing them in the warehouses or granaries, Leo put them here so the store wouldn't look too empty.\nThe shopping mall was 20% ready for the grand opening. Leo just needed to fill the building with other minor shops and content on the second floor.\nThinking of other merchandise, Leo turned his attention to the clothing store for a moment. He narrowed his eyes.\n'Clothes are good, but cultivators are mostly men. They aren't fond of fashion.'\nLeo closed his eyes and tried to recall what men in the modern world bought whenever they had enough money. He thought of big toys, such as sports cars, yachts, and big bikes.\nFlashy vehicles came to Leo's mind. He opened his eyes and gazed at his online store system. He compared the prices of various modern vehicles.\n\"They might be useless to others, but they are flex factors. Yeah, I should start with you.\"\n.\nPagani Huayra– 1,400 years of lifespan\nMcLaren Elva – 1,700 years of lifespan\nBentley Bacalar – 1,900 years of lifespan\nAston Martin Vulcan – 2,300 years of lifespan\nBugatti Mistral Roadster – 5,000 years of lifespan\nMercedes-Maybach Exelero – 8,000 years of lifespan\n.\nWhen Leo was a human, these vehicles were out of his reach. But after the apocalypse, these toys were so insignificant that they were too cheap.\nLeo bitterly laughed. There was no road for these cars to run on, so they were useless to him. However, they could be used as decoration to attract eccentric customers.\n\"Let's park one or two on the second floor. There's nothing to see here, so I might as well use it as a lounge area for the riches.\"",

Leo also blessed himself with fancy sports cars even though he had no intention to drive them anywhere.\nFerrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Pagani, Rolls-Royce, Porches, Mercedes, Leo purchased one each and parked them on the second floor. When they were lined up in a column, these colorful exotic cars strangely sparkled under the LED light.\nHowever, Leo wasn't satisfied. As each car came out as a default setting, it required gasoline to function. Thus, Leo tampered with it by using the system to upgrade it.\nDING\nThe cars averagely cost 2,000 years of lifespan, except the Rolls-Royce and Bugatti. The upgrade price was also the same. Thus, Leo only upgraded every car once.\nAfter spending 40,000 years of lifespan in these cars, the vehicles no longer needed batteries or gasoline. Instead, it required its driver to charge its fuel by filling the fuel tank with either spirit stones or essence stones.\nTheir fuel tank was also changed. It could automatically crush and dispose of the stones through a new exhaust.\nLeo peeked under every car and admired the new exhausts.\n\"It's weird. So, if I drive it, it will crush my essence stones and pour out the dust through this exhaust? Why don't you just use a Qi battery or something?\"\nAs the upgraded car looked interesting, Leo checked his current lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan – 510,196 Years…>\nHe was rich!\nLeo puffed his chest as he thought of the talismans that he got from the Fatui Cult's underground city. So far, he had already eaten all of them, including random pills from their spatial rings.\nAlthough those talisman papers caused him to defecate bricks every morning for a week, the result was worth the trouble.\n\"Eh, how about upgrading one of the cars to level 9?\"\nCurious about the system's effects, Leo purchased another car. He picked the cheapest one from the sports car catalog, the Ferrari Roma, which only cost him 250 years of lifespan. For the sake of traditions, Leo picked the red one.\nLeo put his hand on it and upgraded the car 8 times, spending another 2,000 YOL.\nCLINK-CLINK\nAs if the vehicle turned into Optimus Prime, it shapeshifted for a few minutes. When it stopped, it reverted to the default look.\nLeo opened the door and inspected the interior. Everything looked the same, except the gears and gearbox.\n\"Where is the gear? Isn't this supposed to be the dual-clutch transmission?\"\nInstead of finding a gear handle or something similar, there was a glass pad with a handprint on it.\nSeeing the hand pad, Leo frowned. He couldn't imagine driving this car while pressing his hand on the glowing pad as it would be uncomfortable. Still, for the sake of the experiment, he needed to try it.\nLeo stored the car in his spatial ring and brought it out in front of his store, where he had made a concrete road. After putting the vehicle on the road, Leo opened his store domain system and expanded the street.\nConcrete road completely cut across the entire domain from east to west. However, Leo wasn't satisfied. He created another path to the north and south, forming a T intersection at the east border area.\nA road course wouldn't be completed without another parallel way. Leo added another road on the north edge, moving from the east to the west. Then, he dragged the road down to the south. Leo repeated the process and made the southwest road meet with the southeast.\nA temporary race track was created with the center road as a pit lane. Leo widely grinned as he looked forward to testing his vehicle.\n\"I hope no idiot crosses the road while I'm playing. Anyway, time to vroom-vroom!\"\nLeo hopped into the cockpit and started the car. He revved the engine to hear the sweet sound.\nVRRRRRRR\nAs Leo had hoped for, it was beautiful.\nHowever, by doing so, he caused a commotion. Life Sword Sect's disciples and elders who had been busy in the farms heard it and came to look. Even Gao Yan, Wu Buyi, and the alchemy team stopped working and came to see the commotion.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"A carriage?\"\n\"No, it doesn't look like a carriage. There are no horses.\"\n\"Stupid. That might be a flying ship of Lord Florida Man. Who knows what kind of artifact he has.\"\n\"Wrong. I have seen many warships from other sects. That is not a ship.\"\n\"Then, what is that?\"\n\"I don't know!\"\nThe onlookers speculated and guessed what the red vehicle was. As they were afraid of offending Leo, they kept their distance and whispered among themselves.\nFortunately, there was a shameless man among them. Wu Buyi was familiar with Leo the most, and he wasn't afraid of his scolding.\nThe alchemist walked to the side of the car and leaned over. He looked inside the car and tilted his head.\n\"My lord. What are you doing in there? What is this?\"\nLeo proudly smirked, \"My ride.\"\n\"Ride?\"\n\"Back off and watch.\"\n\"???\"\n\"Tell the guys on the road to move too if they don't want me to run them over.\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi still didn't understand what this red metal thing with wheels could do. Still, he waved his hand and chased everybody in front of the Ferrari away. The crowd got out of the road as instructed, but they gathered behind the car.\nAfter the path was cleared, Leo was ready to test-drive this machine. As he had no clue how the car worked, he put his palm on the handprint console.\nDING\n<Scanning…>\n\"Oh?\"\nA robotic female voice notified Leo of the car's strange system. He was surprised, but he continued pressing his palm on the console.\n<Registering the driver…>\n<Please tell me your name.>\nLeo paused for a moment. He almost said his true name, but he hated the idea. Thus, he discarded the American name and chose to use his alias as it sounded more pleasant.\n\"Florida Man!\"\n<Affirmative. Master Florida Man has been registered as the car owner.>\n<Please be advised. Unless you grant permission to the new driver, nobody can drive this vehicle.>\n\"…Wow.\"\nLeo was impressed with the new security system. It sounded like it came from a sci-fi movie.\n<You can remove your hand from the console. Please enjoy the ride.>\n\"Cool!\"\nLeo laughed and put his hand on the wheel. He fiddled with the side sticks and checked the wheel's features if digital gears existed.\nIt wasn't hard to locate the gear paddles behind the wheel. Seeing the paddles, Leo was relieved as they still looked similar to modern sports cars.\nSlowly, Leo tried to recall the old memory when he was still a human. He shifted to the first gear and lightly on the gas to get back his feeling.\nUnfortunately, Leo forgot that he had upgraded this vehicle to a monstrous artifact.\nVRRRRRRRR\nLeo's back was pressed on his seat as the car suddenly accelerated. The digital speedometer instantly jumped from 0 to 300mph!\nAs Leo was caught off guard, he jetted forward and got off the road in seconds.\n\"JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL!\"\nLeo screamed as he saw the approaching large tree ahead. He accidentally pulled the wheel toward him.\nIt moved like a commercial plane's wheel.\nBOOM!\nThe vehicle crashed the tree head-on. However, the iron pine tree shattered in half upon impact!\nBOOM!\nBOOM!\nHowever, the impact didn't stop the momentum of the car. It kept on going even though its four wheels were off the ground for a second.\nLeo frowned as he expected the airbag to come out, but nothing happened. Moreover, he saw a faint layer of barrier around the car as it blasted through the obstacles.\nAfter hitting the seventh tree, the car ceased moving. It parked in the middle of the rocky terrain while a tree trunk supported the chassis from underneath. The prestige Ferrari car became a see-saw.\nLeo opened the door and came out of the vehicle to see the mess he made.\nStrangely, the front hood was unharmed and unscratched. The headlights still looked as new, and the bumper was intact.\nHe looked at the chassis next as he was worried that the wheels and the tires might be misaligned. Fortunately, nothing was dented or damaged. Surprisingly, the trunk that supported the car's bottom chassis didn't even touch anything.\nThe entire car floated on top of the trunk by an inch.\n\"Dafuq?\"\nLeo scratched his head and looked at the system item in astonishment. He had no idea what the system did to the normal-looking sports car.\nAs Leo couldn't drive the car at this stage, he stored the vehicle in his spatial ring. Then, he leaped back to the general store.\nUpon arrival, Han Hao, Han Meng, Wu Buyi, and Xu Nuan surrounded him.\n\"Sir, what happened?! Are we under attack?\"\nLeo scratched his head and pursed his lips. He was too embarrassed to confess that he crashed his car.\n\"Nothing happened. I just tested my stupid artifact.\"\n\"Artifact? That red thing, sir?\" Han Hao gazed at the carnage at the edge of the store domain. Seven iron pine trees on the path fell, leaving a trail of dust behind.\nLeo coughed, \"It's in the experiment stage, so I need a lot of practice. Anyway, nothing to see here. Disperse! Disperse!\"\n\"…\"\nThe elder group looked skeptical as the vehicle just now emitted a strong aura of a quasi-immortal. Still, as it was Leo's toy, they chose not to question him.\nAfter the crowd went back to their posts, Leo switched his location. He leaped to the west road, where nobody wandered around.\nLeo gently put the sports car back on the road and tried again. This time, he didn't step on the gas pedal and let the car move by its default gear.\nVRRRRR\nEven though Leo didn't step on the gas, the car sped up and stabilized at 100mph. He stepped on the brake several times to decelerate. However, it went back to the same speed again.\nConfused, Leo put his palm on the console and asked the car.\n\"Alexa! Siri! Google! Whatever your name is, how do I decrease the default speed?!\"\nDING\n<You can inject your Qi into the console and adjust the default speed of each gear.>\n\"…That's it?\"\n<Yes.>\nFor some reason, Leo's kidneys were hurt. He also had the urge to smack his forehead for the stupid resolution.\nFollowing the suggestion, Leo minimized his Qi usage and injected his Qi into the console.\nDING\nA new system window appeared in front of the wheel. Unlike Leo's system, it was a screen, projected by the vehicle.\n[Transmission Settings]\n\"…\"\nLeo bitterly smiled. The more he saw the changes, the more he realized that the system was weird.\n.\n.\nAlthough Leo might not be an engineer, he read a lot when he was on Earth during his free time. He also used to temper with cars during the post-apocalypse era as nobody was there to help him. Gearbox tuning was one of Leo's hobbies back then before all metal and spare parts in the world rotted in rust.\nThe car system made the tuning easier. With the graphs and detailed statistics, Leo decreased the acceleration spike by 90%, allowing the car to run at an Earthling speed.\nStill, several features of the settings made Leo laugh.\n[Flight Settings]\n[Autopilot Settings]\n[Shield and Safety Settings]\nWith just these options, Leo found himself a new hobby that he could enjoy other than building his shopping mall empire.\n\"Oh, boy. This is going to be fun!\"\n.\n.\nWhile Leo had fun with his new toy, a cultivator had been floating over the Magpie City.\nTang Xuan gazed at the Life Sword Sect, which seemed desolate. He couldn't see any deacon or disciple around. Instead, he found several homeless commoners and beggars taking shelter in an outer disciple's barrack.\n\"What happened to Hua Jiashan? Where is he?\"\nTang Xuan gazed at the east, where Leo's general store was. He narrowed his eyes as he noticed a lot of changes in the area. As he thought of Leo, he recalled the recent mysterious incidents.\n'Someone killed the second prince. Situ Nantian mysteriously retreated and went into seclusion after the expedition. The third prince made a fuss in the court and accused Yan Luo that he raided the Fatui Cult. So many things are happening at the same time.'\nTang Xuan narrowed his eyes as the face of an eccentric old man appeared in his mind. He still remembered Leo's face vividly.\n'That man appeared, and everything went to hell. But if Florida Man was behind Situ Nantian's seclusion and the death of the second prince, Yan Xiang would never reconcile with him anymore. Actually, my guts are telling me that Florida Man did it, including the destruction of the Fatui Cult. If that's the case, I have to pick sides. I can't be neutral in this mess or Yan Xiang will rope me in as usual.'\nTang Xuan calculated the pros and cons for an hour. He deeply inhaled and made up his mind. Then, he contacted his son and his clansmen, using his voice transmission.\n\"Tian'er, are you there?\"\nTang Tian, who was on the other side of the continent, heard his father's voice. He replied with his thoughts, but Tang Xuan could hear him clearly.\n'What's wrong, father?'\n\"We will resign from the imperial court.\"\n'What?! But why?! We and Yan Xiang have been allies for centuries!'\n\"Not anymore. Something has to change.\"\n'What happened, father?! Is there something urgent?'\n\"There is…\"\nTang Xuan thought of Leo. He still remembered the strange aura and his unique charisma.\nAlthough his loyalty had been to the Yan Empire for countless years, Tang Xuan's instinct was never wrong. When he heard that Leo killed the second prince, he was sure that a major war between quasi-immortals would break out soon, and the loser's side would be erased from history.\nAnd that loser would be Yan Xiang and his men, the Situ Clan and Ouyang Clan included!\nThere was no point staying on a sinking ship, Tang Xuan made up his mind to ally himself with Leo. After all, he might be the key to improving his clan's status.\nTang Xuan deeply inhaled and strengthened his focus. He answered Tang Tian.\n\"A major war will break out soon, and Yan Xiang will definitely lose. We have to switch sides before that happens! I want you to migrate everybody out of the manor and bring them to Magpie City, RIGHT NOW!\"\n'EH?! NOW?! B-But father, aren't you jumping to conclusions too early? There's no sign of war!'\n\"It will happen. Did you know that someone killed the second prince and destroyed the Fatui Cult?\"\n'WHAT?!'\n\"Someone is targeting the Yan Empire, and a new quasi-immortal suddenly shows up on our land. Don't you think it's strange?\"\n'…'\n\"I don't care what you think, but I trust my guts. We need to move before the others. In the upcoming gathering, we will take sides with the new force!\"\nTang Xuan and Tang Tian spent hours chatting. When it was dark, Tang Xuan flew toward Leo's general store to deliver an invitation to the imperial court's gathering.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 136 – Florida Man Arrested For Hiding A Thousand Underage Immigrants and One Dead Body in His Sweatshop.\nAt night, Leo's farm and his buildings were still bright as many cultivators graduated from sleeping. They cultivated in their rooms instead of resting. Night-shift farmers illuminated the farmland with their Qi by creating light balls. They never stopped harvesting crops as they had a quota to meet every day.\nTang Xuan hovered at the edge of the general store's domain. He gazed at the flying platform and the glass elevator. Then, he watched the young cultivators working as farmers.\nHe recognized some of the people there. A few of them used to work as a deacon of Life Sword Sect. However, they abandoned their sect to work here.\nThat was not all. Tang Xuan spotted Wu Buyi, Gao Yan, and many alchemists in front of the three alchemy workshops behind the general store building. They were busy observing the mannequins and taking notes.\nIn addition, Tang Xuan sensed the Qi signature of Hua Jiashan on top of the flying platform. Furthermore, the presence of the famous Amazonian Sanctuary, Dongfang Mei, was nearby.\nThe Tang Clan's ancestor was confused. The last time he visited here, this place was a small secluded place. But at the moment, it became a small town full of cultivators.\nTang Xuan frowned and glanced at several individuals. As he was an expert in measuring someone's character and talent, he noticed a few irregular people.\nIn front of a small house, next to Gao Yan's residence, a small child without an eyeball, a toddler, and a monster plant sat in a circle as they seemed to be listening to the eyeless girl.\nIn normal circumstances, Tang Xuan would have rushed there to rescue the two little girls from the monster. However, the trio's Qi and strength were abnormal.\nThe weakest one was the little toddler girl. Even though she looked like a 2 or 3-year-old child, her cultivation base was already at the nascent soul realm! Her dao avatar floated behind the child and smiled at her as if she were her elder sister or nanny.\nAs for the monster plant, Tang Xuan had seen it before. The chomper, aka Cat, was a 7th-stage monster whose body was made from sacred wood. Her humanoid dao avatar was always beside her, but the girl spirit seemed to have a mind of her own.\nAlthough the two girls were strange enough, it was incomparable to the mysterious eyeless girl.\nFirst, Tang Xuan couldn't see the usual aura that humans naturally produced. Every commoner and cultivator was born with a thin layer of grey aura, and it could change or evolve to other colors, depending on one's behavior and moral integrity.\nHowever, the eyeless had no such thing! Rather, her presence was the same as a cold corpse!\nSecondly, behind the girl, a thousand transparent spirits and transparent flame balls followed after her. They orbited around the group as if they formed an array, protecting everybody. Furthermore, the spirits of two beautiful maidens with long ears had been looking back at Tang Xuan.\nAnd lastly, her body contained so much yin essence to the point that it was comparable to monster beasts of the immortal realms! Her dantian emitted a strong presence of an immortal. That alone told Tang Xuan that the eyeless girl was not a human or a regular cultivator but something otherworldly!\nShe was not someone Tang Xuan could offend!\nTang Xuan sweated profusely as the presence of Esen deterred him from approaching the domain. He secretly cursed Yan Xiang, the first prince, and the third prince for their vain pride and stupidity.\n'Florida Man shouldn't be provoked. I was right. The Yan Empire will soon face this calamity the hard way because of their ignorance and stubbornness. They should have realized the severity of the situation when the third prince provoked him.'\nThere was no cure for stupidity. Tang Xuan could only pray that the innocent people in the Yan Empire wouldn't be implicated in the future conflict.\nAs the soon-to-be conflict had yet to happen, Tang Xuan planned to play his cards right to avoid the crossfire and stray bullets. He mustered his courage and flew toward the general store.\n.\n.\nIn front of Esen's designated house, the lich empress had fun teaching the two youngsters. She lectured them about the usefulness of yin Qi and yin essence and some general information about necromancy.\n\"We, girls, are born with natural yin Qi inside us. If we can nurture it for at least a hundred years. Those invisible Qi strings will automatically condense into yin essence, which many cultivators called it \"Virgin Yin\".\"\nCat raised her vine and asked Esen.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nEsen dropped her shoulders in disappointment, \"No, Cat. Virgin Yin is not food. You can't eat it.\"\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"Ah, no nom-nom.\"\nCat was saddened and lowered her head.\nEsen snickered and told her a piece of good news, \"But since you're born from Florida Man's Virgin Yang, your constitution is different. You see, your physique can cultivate every type of elemental Qi. And because you are a plant species, your racial specialties lie in absorption abilities. You gain strength and Qi from the food you eat!\"\nCat was overjoyed. Her pupils dilated, \"Nom-Nom Meow-Meow?!\"\n\"Yes. You can gain yin Qi, yang Qi, and many other types of Qi from your food. You just have to eat them when they are still fresh!\"\nCat jumped around in excitement. She then looked around to see if she could eat anybody there. Then, she eyed the farmers in the field.\nEsen silently brought out a paper fan, which she had extorted from Leo. She smacked Cat with it.\nPA!\nCat screamed even though the impact did nothing to her. She lashed her sacred wood whips to retaliate.\nEsen scoffed and caught the sacred wood whips with her fingers. Upon touch, it caused a sizzling sound as the sacred wood slightly burnt her skin.\nThe expression of the lich empress slightly changed as she didn't expect a 7th-stage monster to be strong enough to damage her skin. Esen smirked and praised Cat's owner.\n\"That geezer is really something. He has been feeding you good food, I see. Well, you should be able to do this much if you want to be my disciple.\"\nEsen coated her yin essence on herself. The burnt skin was healed, and two purple flame eyeballs appeared in her eye sockets.\nA thousand will-o-wisp spirits transformed into transparent paper fans. Following Esen's order, they smacked Cat's head to punish her for trying to do something stupid.\n\"MYA!\"\nCat screamed and covered her head with her vines. She stopped retaliating and trembled as she realized that she was not Esen's opponent.\n\"Stupid plant! Your master's workers are not your food! You cannot eat them!\"\n\"…Meow T_T\"\n\"And don't copy those stupid donkey's way of speech! What's with the T T? Are you even speaking a human's language?\"\n\"…Meow.\"\nEsen deeply sighed. She jumped on Cat and patted her humanoid head to soothe her.\n\"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have teased you. Anyway, you can eat people to increase your strength, but you cannot eat your master's subordinates or your comrades, okay?\"\nGetting petted, Cat purred and nodded. She instantly forgot what she was hit for. However, she remembered the core of the lecture.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nEsen's flame eyeballs rolled upward. She dropped her shoulders again.\n\"No. You cannot eat friendly guests, visitors, and random people you see on the street.\"\nWhile the two interacted, Yao Qiqi couldn't stop laughing. When the two stopped messing around, she chimed in and changed the topic.\n\"Senior Esen, about the Virgin Yin, is it necessary to live 100 years or longer?\"\nEsen got energetic again as the other junior was interested in the lecture. She puffed her chest and explained.\n\"Yes. The \"Virgin\" suffix is there for a reason. The longer you can live, the purer the yin essence! The purer the yin essence, the more powerful your power becomes!\"\nYao Qiqi tilted her head. As a child, she didn't understand a certain thing.\n\"Then, why don't you call it 'Pure Yin' instead? Why Virgin Yin?\"\n\"…\"\nEsen stumbled as she didn't know how to explain about the under-the-belly topic. Even though she was an undead, she started to sweat.\n\"Umm, you see. There's an additional condition to get the \"Virgin\" title. Err… first of all…\"\nEsen bit her lower lip as she was afraid of this topic. She didn't want to ruin Yao Qiqi's innocence and pure mind.\nHowever, Cat was too smart for her own good. She explained in Esen's stead.\n\"Meow-Meow Meow!\"\n\"EEEHHH!!?\"\nYao Qiqi widened her eyes and stared at Cat in shock.\nMeanwhile, Esen yelled at Cat again, \"WHAT ARE YOU TELLING A CHILD?!\"\n\"Meow!\"\n\"W-What? O-Oh, you're right. My bad. I didn't think of that word.\"\nEsen coughed and turned to Qiqi as she remembered the right phrasing.\n\"It's like this, Qiqi. You can't marry or have a boyfriend when you're cultivating virgin yin essence. That's why we call it Virgin!\"\nYao Qiqi looked back and forth between Esen and Cat. She then pouted as she didn't really understand what a boyfriend was.\n\"I don't understand what a boyfriend is, senior. But I do understand Cat that I can't suck senior Florida Man's mouth-\"\n\"TAAAAAAHHHHH!!\"\nEsen panicked and closed Yao Qiqi's mouth. She then glared at Cat.\n\"IT'S YOUR FAULT, CAT!\"\nCat snickered and mischievously grinned. She then copied a strange cat's voice.\n\"Munya!\"\nEsen's face twitched. She bonked Cat with the thousand fans again.\n\"Don't speak the Cathulhu Language! They're the blasphemous cancer of the universe!\"\nThe more Esen rebuked, the more exciting Cat became. She meowed like a naughty child.\n\"Munya Meow!\"\n\"You…\"\nEsen facepalmed as she was mentally exhausted from this babysitting job. On the other hand, Yao Qiqi giggled while Cat cackled like a villain.\nOoOOoooOOooO\nWhile the girls enjoyed their company, the two spirits behind Esen whispered and warned her about the new guest. All spirit orbs and transparent fireballs stopped rotating. They gathered and formed a wall in front of Cat and Yao Qiqi.\nWHOOSH\nA few seconds later, an elderly man in a court official robe descended from the dark sky.\nTang Xuan landed and gazed at the group of young girls. He glanced at Cat and Yao Qiqi for a moment before he faced Esen. Showing respect, Tang Xuan saluted and bowed.\n\"I am Chancellor Tang Xuan of the Yan Empire. Fair Lady, I've brought a message from the emperor, and I wish to seek an audience with Sir Florida Man. Could you relay the word to him, please?\"\nEsen narrowed her eyes as she didn't like human cultivators. Still, as the old man was polite and showed some manners, Esen had no reason to send him away.\n\"Wait there. I'll go call that geezer.\"\n\"Thank you, Fair Lady. Oh, by the way, what title may I call you?\"\nEsen smirked and puffed her chest, \"Call me the Empress!\"\n\"…Em…press?\" Tang Xuan was taken aback. \"So, are you an empress of the monster race, your majesty?\"\nEsen loved Tang Xuan's tone. She laughed, \"Yes! I'm the empress of all necromancers and archliches! You should be honored that you are talking to the gorgeous, magmatic, charming, and charismatic emp-*PA*\"\nBefore Esen could finish her sentences, Leo walked out from the alchemy alley with a paper fan in his hand. He smacked her head for her loud voice.\n\"Pipe it down, you brat! I was trying to sleep, goddammit!\"\nEsen squatted and covered her head because of dizziness. After regaining her bearing, she turned around and yelled at Leo.\n\"How dare you hit this empress?!\"\nPA\nLeo smacked her with the fan again. He then grabbed her crown and pulled her from the ground like a rag doll.\n\"Listen here, you little shit. At night, you shut your mouth. If you keep yapping, chirping, and laughing like a banshee in mating season having a bestiality orgy with hyenas, nobody here is gonna a wink of sleep! Think of your poor virgin neighbors. Didn't your mother teach you that?!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan and Esen stared at Leo, wondering if he was trolling. It was common knowledge that cultivators rarely slept at night. Moreover, an undead like Esen didn't need such a thing.\nLeo snorted and put Esen on the ground. He scolded her enough.\nGetting bullied, the little empress was enraged and flailed her arms around, trying to hit him. However, Leo's hand pressed on her head, preventing the little girl from coming closer to him.\n\"MUKIIIIIII!!\"\nWhile pushing the little undead monkey's head away from him, Leo turned his attention to Tang Xuan. He still remembered this envoy.\n\"Oh, hello. It has been a while. The last time I saw you, I almost turned you into cat food. Have you been well? Do you want to rob my store or bully my subordinate again?\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan sweated profusely. He wondered if coming here and talking to this crazy old man was the right choice.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 137 – Florida Man Forces Minor to Fight in Martial Arts Tournament Wearing John Wick's Tactical Suit and Carrying Gun\nAs there was nothing but his life to lose, Tang Xuan apologized to him to de-escalate the hostility.\n\"Senior Florida Man, please forgive this old fool for not stopping the reckless subordinates. I really have no intention of antagonizing you.\"\nWhen Tang Xuan's party visited Leo, the former never participated in the bullying. As a result, Leo's system spared him when Leo collected the compensation from the intruders.\nFortunately, Leo was a reasonable man. As long as the other party was willing to be civil, Leo always welcomed it.\n\"Forget it. Anyway, what are you doing here? Sightseeing?\" Leo changed the subject.\nSensing the opportunity, Tang Xuan brought out an invitation letter from the imperial court. He explained.\n\"This is an invitation letter from his majesty the Emperor. In a few weeks, an annual gathering of Yan Empire and Jianghu Alliance will take place at Cauliflower City. We hope to invite you to join us.\"\n\"A gathering?\"\nLeo's expression turned dark as he hated official gatherings. From his experience, it was always boring as everybody there only flexed their achievements, wealth, and influence.\nBecause of the past trauma when he was a regular human, Leo declined the invitation.\n\"Meh, what's the point of that gathering? There is nothing to gain there. I won't go, sorry.\"\n\"Huh?\" Tang Xuan was surprised that Leo didn't bother socializing with the empire. \"Why, senior? You can seek the audience of the emperor there.\"\n\"See the emperor? Nah, I'm not a bootlicker. Let those eunuchs do their jobs.\"\n\"…\"\nThe corners of Tang Xuan's mouth twitched as he was also one of those so-called bootlickers. Although Leo had no intention of insulting Tang Xuan, the latter got hit by a stray bullet.\nTang Xuan ignored the remark and tried to explain, in case Leo had no idea about the gathering.\n\"Senior, the gathering isn't about a meeting. It's about a competition between sects and cults within the Yan Empire.\"\n\"Oh?\" Leo raised his eyebrows. He never hated sports and games. \"Tell me more.\"\n\"Yes, senior! Ahem!\" Tang Xuan cleared his throat. \"In the gathering, every sect and cult can send their young disciples under 18 years old to participate in the gathering's tournament. The imperial court always sponsors the tournament, so there is nothing for you to lose, senior.\"\n\"What kind of tournament?\"\n\"A martial art tournament, senior.\"\nLeo pursed his lips. He somewhat remembered the theme and the common plots of Chinese novels and dramas in the past. As this event seemed similar to those tournaments in novels, he wondered if it might be dangerous for the participants.\nAfter all, most cultivators were a bunch of lawless savages. They never respected common laws, but they only submitted to the strong.\n\"Does that involve killing or harming the opponent participants?\"\n\"…Umm, yes and no. We don't permit killing, but accidents sometimes occur.\"\nLeo shook his head as his guess was spot on.\n\"What about the mortality rate? How many participants died in the past?\"\n\"A-About one-tenth, senior.\"\n\"10%, I see. That's quite high, isn't it? Also, accidental death? I think it's more like INTENTIONALLY MURDERED.\"\n\"…\"\n\"To be honest, I'm against pitting minors to a death-match tournament. We aren't living in a caveman society anymore. We are already old, and we should be guiding our juniors to the right path, not sending them to their death for some unknown prize.\"\nTang Xuan lowered his head as Leo was right. Unfortunately, Tang Xuan was powerless against Yan Xiang's mandate. He would have been executed had he protested the emperor.\n\"I'm ashamed, senior. You're absolutely right. Too bad that not many court officials agree with you. Those maniacs claim that tournaments are good for the juniors since they are the only events that young cultivators can gain experience of real combat against their peers from other sects.\"\n\"Experience or not, sports are meant for entertainment and competitive spirit. This is just a pointless Roman Gladiator Tournament. Anyway, I'm not going. Tell that stupid emperor that he can send his people to die as he pleases. Count me out.\"\nLeo turned around and patted Yao Qiqi's head. He also stopped bullying Esen as his mood was ruined.\nHowever, Tang Xuan didn't give up. As he wished to get on Leo's good side, he revealed Yan Xiang's ulterior motive.\n\"Senior! I'll tell you the truth! Yan Xiang is planning to use this event to lure you and your disciples out of your domain to kill you! They know about what you did to the second prince!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo stopped his feet and crossed his arms while he showed his back to Tang Xuan. He let out a long sigh.\nOnly Esen and Cat could see Leo's face. The monster plant and the lich's face turned dark as Leo's cold smile was so hideous that a devil would cry in fear had he seen Leo's expression.\nEsen stopped throwing tantrums as she felt bad for the Yan emperor. She inwardly thought.\n'You f'd up, cultivator emperor. This man is worse than ghoul savages and rotting zombies.'\nBut Cat had a different thought. She expected Leo to turn his victims into mutated flesh and yin fluid. She looked forward to stealing Leo's alchemy ingredients again.\n'Ded-Ded? Nom-Nom Meow <3'\nTang Xuan couldn't see Leo's face, but he noticed the odd look on Esen's face. He gulped, wondering if he crossed the line.\n\"Say, Tang Xuan,\" Leo uttered.\n\"Y-Yes, senior?\"\n\"How many people can I send?\"\n\"P-Pardon?\"\nLeo coughed and turned around. His eyes curved up like a crescent moon while his smile showed most of his sparkling white teeth and healthy gum. Oddly enough, Leo had 48 teeth – 12 incisors, 8 canines, 12 premolars, and 16 molars. No wisdom teeth.\nLeo's ugly smile sent a chill running down Tang Xuan's spine. The latter had goosebumps while he stared at Leo's perfect teeth.\n\"Let me rephrase my question. How many people on my side can join the tournament and ALLEGEDLY and UNINTENTIONALLY MURDER their competitors?\"\nTang Xuan regretted everything in his life. This man sounded like a demon in a human's flesh. Still, he replied.\n\"Five per sect, senior. Also, killing isn't allowed…\"\n\"NOICE! BAHAHAHA! How old is the requirement again?\"\n\"Under 18, senior.\"\n\"Alright! Next question, Is there a limitation to the weaponry usage? Artifacts, talismans, bombs, and so on?\"\n\"…Talismans, pills, and consumables are prohibited, senior. Other than that, anything goes.\"\n\"NOICE! HEHEHEHEHE!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan had a bad premonition about Leo's evil laughter, but he couldn't explain why.\n\"You know what? I'm sold. I'll join that stupid gathering of yours. But what's the prize again?\"\n\"Erm… spirit stones and rare pills for the participants. As for the winning sect or cult, they get essence stones, official rank promotion, stipend raise, fame, and the rights to purchase extra land deeds from the imperial court, senior.\"\nLeo nodded in approval. He wasn't interested in ranks, promotions, or essence stones. However, gaining extra land deeds from the government was enticing.\nAlso, fame was a must for Leo's business. He hadn't officially opened his new shopping mall yet, and the only customers so far were his employees. Moreover, Leo's only income came from food and talisman papers, which was not ideal in the long run.\n\"Go tell your emperor that I'll participate in that stupid tournament. Share me the GPS location and date, and I'll be there on time.\"\n\"… What's Gee-Pee-Ess, senior?\"\nLeo feinted his cough as he chose the wrong wordings, \"Can I have a map of Cauliflower City? I have never visited that place, and I don't want to get lost when we get there.\"\n\"O-Oh, okay, senior. I'll draw one for you.\"\nTang Xuan brought out a blank scroll and a brush pen from his spatial ring. He drew a rough map of Cauliflower City and the imperial palace. He even marked the location of the gathering event for Leo.\nAfter receiving the map, Leo was satisfied. They continued chatting randomly for a while before Tang Xuan excused himself.\n.\nLeo sent Tang Xuan off and turned his attention to the kids and the lich. He smiled at them.\n\"You heard me, right?\"\nEsen snorted, \"I'm 10,000 years old. I can't join that silly tournament.\"\n\"Hah! Can they even check how old you are? You're pretty much a kid in my eyes.\"\n\"Strong cultivators can scan everybody's bone age. I can also check yours!\"\nLeo was amused. He challenged her, \"Check mine, then. Tell me how old I am.\"\n\"Of course! Let me see…\"\nEsen grabbed Leo's wrist to feel his pulse and blood.\nHowever, a second later, she let go of his hand. Esen yelled at him and flapped her hand as if hot water splashed on her.\n\"What's wrong?\" Leo frowned.\n\"YOU MONSTER!\"\nEsen was frustrated. She didn't tell Leo the result, but she stomped into her new house and slammed shut the door.\nConfused, Leo looked at the two kids.\n\"What's wrong with your friend, Yao Qiqi?\"\nWhile holding Leo's hand, Yao Qiqi looked up to him, \"I don't know, senior. But I heard from everybody from the sanctuary that girls on period are vulnerable to mood swings. She probably has that.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo didn't know if he should laugh or cry as Yao Qiqi knew something a kid shouldn't. Moreover, an undead lich couldn't possibly have menstruation as it was impossible for her to reproduce…\nA few seconds later after the thoughts, Leo's expression turned into a poker face meme. He regretted overthinking.\n\"WTF brain?!\"\nAs Leo was ashamed of his thoughts, he dismissed everybody and went to bed early.\nOn the bed, Leo buried his face in his pillow, blaming his brain for his inappropriate imagination.\n.\n.\n= The next day morning =\nLeo gathered all elders, including Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei, to inform them about the upcoming imperial court tournament. He was brief as he declared that he would choose five representatives among the employees.\nDongfang Mei and Xu Nuan widely grinned as they had joined the event many times before. The former asked Leo.\n\"Lord Florida Man. Amazonian Sanctuary joined the tournament 145 times in the past, and we won 22 times. Winning the tournament can boost our fame and status. I recommend that we send our strongest disciples to the tournament.\"\nAs Dongfang Mei seemed knowledgeable, Leo consulted with her while the crowd observed and listened to them.\n\"Can you explain what the tournament is and how your disciples competed in the past?\"\n\"Of course, senior. Last year, there were 48 sects in total, including evil cults from the unorthodox path and the imperial court. 240 participated in preliminary rounds until only 36 remained. Then, the real 1v1 tournament weeded out the contestants until we had the last winner.\"\nLeo and everybody nodded as it sounded normal. However, Xu Nuan wryly smiled as she went there and saw the savagery side of the tournament first-hand. She chimed in.\n\"Lord Florida Man. I have to warn you and the soon-to-be participants. During the preliminary round, most deaths occurred there because of the chaos. Sometimes, the organizers forced the participants to fight in a royal rumble match, where many participants fought at once. Last year, Yan Xiang pitted all disciples in cages and let them fight until 36 remained. A total of 53 young cultivators died.\"\n\"…\"\nThis was what Leo was most concerned about. He felt bad for the victims of this brutality.\nStill, Leo had a clear idea of how he could protect his employees.\n\"It's fine, Xu Nuan. We have a sure-fire winning method, actually.\"\n\"How so?\"\nEverybody was curious. Everybody was eager to witness Leo's trump cards or the chosen representatives.\nBetraying their expectations, Leo pulled out casual clothes from his spatial rings. They were white shirts, a black tie, black suits, long black pants, black leather shoes, and socks.\n\"Gao Yan! Come out and put these on!\"\n\"???\"\nNobody was surprised that Gao Yan was selected as he was the only nascent soul cultivator among the juniors. However, they didn't understand why the clothes were relevant to the topic.\nGao Yan's face flushed in red as he received the clothes. While being hesitant, he asked Leo for confirmation.\n\"Umm, senior. Do I have to change my clothes here?\"\n\"Go change somewhere else! Who asked you to strip in front of everybody? What are you, a stripper?! This ain't a strip club, you dumb!\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan's face got redder as he felt stupid. As for the onlookers, they burst into laughter.\nA few minutes later, Gao Yan came out. Although his tie and clothes were shabby as he had never worn such a suit before, he looked handsome in the formal modern clothes.\nLeo taught Gao Yan how to wear a tie while he adjusted the latter's buttons and suit. Once completed, Gao Yan looked like a new man.\nMaidens from Amazonian Sanctuary blushed as they found the guy attractive. A few of them whistled to get his attention.\nXu Nuan, on the other hand, still didn't understand why Gao Yan had to wear the clothes. She asked Leo.\n\"Is this the uniform of our… domain?\"\nLeo smirked and revealed the secret.\n\"This suit is made from the clothing store over there. If you inspect the texture carefully, you'll understand why I equip these to him.\"\n\"???\"\nXu Nuan still didn't understand, but half of the young girls had a general idea as they worked there.\nFor the sake of explaining, Leo pulled out a flying sword from his spatial ring and passed it to Wu Buyi.\n\"Slash him,\" ordered Leo.\nWu Buyi confusedly received the sword. He hesitated for a moment, but he swung it at Gao Yan anyway.\nGao Yan was shocked. He raised his arms to defend on reflex.\nCLANK!\nAs soon as the sword hit Gao Yan's suit, it caused a loud noise. Moreover, the flying sword was dented.\n\"Huh?!\"\nWu Buyi widened his eyes in shock. Although he didn't use much force, the sword should have at least cut through the suit and cut Gao Yan's skin.\nMeanwhile, the swordsmen realized how valuable the suit was. They rushed forward and inspected the dent sword. Then, they looked at the black suit in astonishment.\n\"I-Isn't this a treasure?! An armor artifact?!\"\nLeo laughed and revealed the existence of his new merchandise.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I present you… our domain's signature uniform and cloth armor, a freaking John Wick's tactical suit! Ah, Gao Yan. Have you been practicing shooting? The pistol I gave you the other day fits that suit well!\"\n\"…Eh?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 138 Middle-Aged Florida Men Identified as Teenagers Participate in School Sports Tournament\nChapter 138 – Middle-Aged Florida Men Identified as Teenagers Participate in School Sports Tournament\nLeo snapped his fingers, and the cloth shop's mannequin came out carrying a hundred suits, shirts, pants, belts, leather shoes, socks, and neckties.\nThe tailor automaton had been working on this project for the past week. After receiving Leo's samples, she made these clothes a priority. She also made them in different sizes so that people of all physiques could enjoy wearing these precious treasures, which were made from Leo's dead cancer cells and elemental essence.\nLeo explained.\n\"These clothes will not be just a staple uniform of our domain, but they will serve as your armor! They are made from my goddamn blood and skin, so no trashy young masters or princes of some clans can possibly harm you if you wear these!\"\n\"!!!\"\nGao Yan and the male disciples dropped their jaws while the clothing store girls were elated. Although the girls couldn't contribute to the tailoring process, they were proud to be on the tailor's team.\nAlthough the clothes provided absolute protection against physical attacks, they were omnipotent. Leo brought out his trusty paper fan and lightly tapped Gao Yan's head to warn everybody.\n\"Well, all participants will be wearing these clothes, so it's impossible for them to get injured. But that doesn't mean you will be invincible. If you're stupid enough and get hit in the head, you can still kick the bucket!\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan gazed at Leo and repeatedly nodded. The others also came back to their senses and imagined how they could kill someone with a similar cloth armor.\nImagination often brought fear and anxiety. Gao Yan broke a sweat and rubbed his face with his hand, wondering how he would protect his head in a fight.\nStill, Gao Yan protested. He still had an imposter syndrome.\n\"S-Senior Florida Man. I-I'm an alchemist. I haven't been training in combat lately. I-I think joining the tournament with my current foundation and strength is a bit-\"\nPA!\nLeo smacked Gao Yan's head with his paper fan. The latter's face was slammed to the ground.\n\"You're on the list, silly brat! Do you think teenage nascent soul cultivators are cabbages?! You just have to show yourself in public, and your opponents will either forfeit or crap their pants! Be confident!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi giggled as he felt the same way. The other golden core elders and deacons also nodded in agreement.\nEverybody had been thinking of Gao Yan as a hidden genius of the Life Sword Sect. Even Hua Jiashan was proud that Gao Yan reached this far.\nLeo proceeded with the roster of the participants.\n\"Next up, Yao Qiqi!\"\n\"EH!?\"\nXu Nuan was stunned as they never expected Yao Qiqi to be on the list as she was too young. Moreover, she hadn't been trained in martial arts.\n\"Sir!\" Xu Nuan protested, \"I think it's too much. I know that Yao Qiqi is one of the few geniuses in our domain, but she isn't cut for serious competition and combat tournaments! Please reconsider!\"\nLooking at Xu Nuan's expression, Leo chuckled. He glanced at the dao avatar behind Yao Qiqi, whose eyes met with his. The latter slightly nodded, affirming that she and Yao Qiqi had no issues.\n\"Xu Nuan. Can tamers use their beasts or monsters in the past tournaments?\"\nXu Nuan flinched. She bit her lower lips and nodded, \"Yes, sir. We can, but each tamer can only use one monster beast according to the rules.\"\n\"There you have it,\" Leo burst into laughter. Then, he shouted. \"CAT! GET OVER HERE!\"\nAs soon as Leo's voice echoed, Cat leaped out of her granary home and landed on top of his head. She quickly climbed down and kissed him by swallowing half of his body into her mouth.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo stood still as he didn't expect the obnoxious chomper to kiss him again. He could feel her tongue licking his face, neck, and nape, eating his dead skin and sweat.\nQuietly and calmly, Leo pushed Cat's mouth off his head. As usual, Cat's bad breath got stuck on his hair and his skin. Her slimy saliva dripped all over his face and body.\n\"Hmm?\"\nWhen Leo managed to get out of Cat's mouth, he deeply frowned. In front of him, everybody's shoulders trembled while they sucked their libs into their mouths, holding back their laughter.\nTheir reaction reminded Leo of a scene in a drama series. While having a solemn expression, Leo uttered.\n\"Everyone, do you know a lollipop?\"\n\"W-What's that, sir?\" Xu Nuan tried her best not to laugh, but she averted her eyes when she noticed that Cat's saliva still dripped on Leo's head.\n\"It's a candy for kids. In my world, every kid loved lollipops.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Lollipops came with a stick and a round candy on top. Kids always sucked them and lick them.\"\n\"…Pfft.\"\n\"I wonder, Xu Nuan. Should I change my Daoist name from Florida Man to Lollipop Man? This stupid plant is treating me like a candy.\"\n\"PUHAHAHAHAHA!!\"\nXu Nuan broke her stoic demeanor first and broke into laughter. As soon as one started laughing, the others stopped holding back. Only Leo remained expressionless.\nCalmly and coldly, Leo turned around and pried Cat's mouth open. Then, he tossed Xu Nuan into Cat's mouth and ordered the plant.\n\"Don't eat her. Just lick her like you licked me!\"\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"No Nom-Nom! I'll give you another nom-nom meow later, okay?\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat complied. She produced a pond of saliva in her mouth and licked the old lady for a whole minute. Then, she spat her out.\nXu Nuan came out drenched in transparent slimy juices. Her face was green, and her smiling face disappeared.\nDongfang Mei and the girls stopped laughing and rushed to see their elder's condition. But before they reached her, Xu Nuan vomited.\nShe wasn't injured. However, Cat's stinky saliva got into her mouth, and she couldn't take it.\nLeo turned his attention to the crowd. He groaned, \"Anybody finds this funny?\"\nHua Jiashan and the men shook their heads. They didn't want to be eaten to get into a similar situation as they had seen enough.\nBecause the crowd was intimidated, Leo walked closer to Wu Buyi and the swordsmen. He let them inhale the stinky slimy saliva up close.\nAs Leo had expected, their faces turned green as well. They held their breaths and pinched their noses in disgust.\n\"You still think this is funny?\"\n\"N-No, Lord Florida Man. Never!\" Han Hao repeatedly shook his head.\n\"Good.\"\nLeo turned around and raised his arm. Then, he pointed his palm toward his head.\nZAAA\nBy using water Qi, Leo created a stream of water to wash away Cat's saliva.\nAfter cleaning himself, Leo continued his announcement. He looked at Yao Qiqi, who covered her mouth and tried not to laugh.\n\"Yao Qiqi will participate in the tournament as a tamer. Cat will serve Yao Qiqi as her temporary pet to fight!\"\nYao Qiqi widely smiled and looked at Cat. The latter also widely grinned as she expected a lot of food as a reward.\nWith two members on the roster, Leo continued picking other members. But instead of choosing a disciple of the Life Sword Sect or the sanctuary, Leo called someone else over.\n\"P.Hub! R.34! Come here!\"\nLeo called the unicorn elder and a converted unicorn, aka Esen's nightmare.\nA tall white unicorn and a black horse leaped from the barn to the front of the store. They stood side by side.\nLooking at these 9th-stage monsters, everybody closed their mouths as they respected these guardian beasts. They were glad that all beasts here were their allies.\nThe nightmare silently stared at Leo with dull eyes, waiting for instruction. On the other hand, P.Hub tilted his head in confusion.\nLeo consulted with them as they were the leader of their team. He could have called Taxi, but that guy was too immature.\n\"Is there anyone among you that can transform or disguise as a human? Preferably someone under 18 years old.\"\nR.34 snorted and turned around. A few seconds later, another black unicorn came over. However, it was half as big as their leader.\n\"Oh, you. Isn't you… Ricardo?\"\nThe small nightmare had a nametag necklace on it. Leo named him \"Ricardo\" after a famous meme, but he forgot about it.\nJordi nodded and gazed at Leo. He glanced at R.34 and talked to each other via telepathy.\nA few seconds later, Ricardo nodded. He closed his eyes for a moment.\nCRACK\nRicardo's bones and flesh deformed and changed. His size shrank, transforming into a human. A minute later, he finished morphing and became a thin boy.\nBecause of his thin lips, brown skin, and his unique facial shape, he looked like a brown Brazilian. Although he was short, his muscle was so refined that he looked like a young bodybuilder.\nAlthough the transformation was completed, Ricardo lacked something important.\nLeo and everybody looked down by reflex. The girls squealed while the men's expression turned dark, envious of his absolute unit of a horse.\n\"…Put on the clothes, Ricardo. Also, shrink that thing. It's going to distract the girls.\"\n\"…\"\nBecause of Ricardo's physique, he was sent to the clothing store to let the automaton make custom clothes for him.\nAs Ricardo managed to disguise as a teenage cultivator, he was fit to be the third member of the roster. However, his cultivation base was an issue. He had the strength of a 7th-stage monster, aka a soul transformation cultivator.\nIt was too high-profile. Hua Jiashan and others were certain that many people might find him suspicious. Still, Leo ignored all logic and went through with it anyway since he had no intention of letting Yan Xiang kill his people during the competition.\n\"Next, P.Hub, where is your guy?\"\nP.Hub nodded and turned around. As soon as everybody followed the horse's gaze, they found Taxi.\n\"Smash?\"\nThe perverted unicorn grinned. A few seconds later, he polymorphed into a bald European white guy with a muscular physique. However, he looked a lot older than Ricardo.\nHe looked like Johnny Sinn instead.\n\"DAMN!\"\nLeo snickered and shook his head. He waved his hand and chased Taxi away.\n\"Thanks for the effort, but no. You're too old for this crap. P.Hub, choose someone else.\"\nTaxi pouted, but he didn't give up. He glanced at Gao Yan for a moment and smirked. The next moment, he shapeshifted again.\nThis time, he copied Gao Yan's look and physique, except for his unit.\n\"KYAAAA!!\"\nBecause of the similar physique and faces, the girls squealed harder while they covered their eyes. However, they peeked through their eyes to check on the horse part.\nGao Yan's eyes were teary. He also stared at the THING in envy.\n\"…Ugh.\"\nLeo facepalmed. He deeply sighed.\n\"Okay, you pass. You're the fourth!\"\nDongfang Mei and the elders blankly stared at Leo for his blatant cheating. They prayed for the youngsters that they wouldn't fight these two monsters.\nHowever, Leo wasn't finished. He called another thump card.\n\"Esen! Where are you?! Come here for a second!\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan and others gave up. Their dull eyes and their faint smiles became lifeless as they accepted everything.\nLeo downright planned to cheat the event.\n.\n.\nIn the end, Dongfang Mei and Hua Jiashan convinced Leo to change his mind. They ended up selecting two female disciples from the sanctuary to act as tamers and picked Taxi and Ricardo as their tamed beasts. As for Esen, she remained as the fifth member.\nAfter completing the roster, Leo moved on to the next topic.\nHe brought out four lightsaber hilts from his spatial ring. While holding three of them in his left hand, his right hand flipped on the switch and showed them the beauty of a sci-fi weapon.\nA screeching sound of the lightsaber itched everybody's teeth. But when it radiated a bright green laser stick from the handle, the crowd widened their eyes in astonishment.\n\"S-Sword Qi?!\" A disciple gulped.\n\"No. That's not a sword Qi!\" Tiger Swordsman's mouth was parch as he got excited, \"That's something else! The sword is brimmed with elemental energy! Isn't that the average amount of a quasi-immortal's internal Qi?!\"\nHua Jiashan was in awe. He stroked his chin and nodded, \"It's an artifact that produces pseudo-sword Qi of a quasi-immortal cultivator. From the looks of it, it doesn't consume the user's Qi at all! Lord Florida Man, did you make that?\"\nLeo snorted, \"Like hell I could. I got these from the mystic realm. Also, as you know, that brat Gao Yan also has one, but it's inferior to mine.\"\nGao Yan blushed and lowered his head while everybody stared at the former. Because Gao Yan used his lightsaber too often, everyone was aware that he got his hands on an amazing artifact. The only reason that no one made a fuss was because of Gao Yan's current cultivation base, which was the same as the elders.\nBefore anybody questioned Gao Yan or Leo, the latter turned off the lightsaber and tossed one to Hua Jiashan. The other three went to Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman accordingly.\n\"Those swords will be the signature of our swordsmen. Because it's too strong to be entrusted to youngsters, only you four can have them.\"\nThe other golden core elders and deacons looked at the four in envy. Even Xu Nuan and Dongfang Mei were jealous of them.\nBut Leo dropped a bomb, which made the four swordsmen anxious.\n\"I gave you the swords so that you can protect everybody here when I'm away. Oh, don't forget the guns that I made you practice using them. They will come in handy!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 139 Florida Man Fingers Elementary School Girl in Public to Heal Her Eyes\nChapter 139 – Florida Man Fingers Elementary School Girl in Public to Heal Her Eyes\nTang Xuan mentioned that the event would take place at Cauliflower City in 2 weeks. Leo and his domain's representatives should be there one or two days before the date.\nThe meeting ended. The Life Sword Sect's elders got their new toys to play with while the chosen disciples had time to prepare for the upcoming tournament.\nLeo dispersed everyone. Gao Yan and others returned to their job, and their daily life resumed as normal. However, Leo's job was far from over.\nHe leaped to the flying platform.\nThe mystic realm's main portal was already closed as Leo had returned from the quest. The previously blue portal disappeared, leaving only three metal gold rings at the center. As it was on cooldown, the rings stopped moving as if they were turned off.\nThe ring frames were the stabilizers of the portal while the platform under it served as the engine. It would take three months for them to be active again.\nFortunately, the new permanent portal to Orlando Planet was already active, and every employee could always visit that place.\nVisiting Orlando Planet was not Leo's intention. Upon landing, Leo glanced at his three statue minions for a moment. He then touched the ring frames at the center.\nDING\nA new system window appeared, showing the mystic realm platform's status.\n.\nMystic Realm Portal – Level 9\nEntry Limit (Person) – (4/10)\nPortal Cooldown Reduction – (0/5)\nPortal Duration – (5/5)\nNext Destination: Unknown Low-Mid Plane\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nStatus: On Cooldown\nNumber of Linked Planet(s): 1\n.\nOrlando Planet\nGovernor Name: Kitten\nGovernor's Domain Abilities: Improve the fertility rate of all freshwater creatures and sea creatures by 200%. Increase newborn water-based creature's rank by two. Increase the density of water element essences by 100%.\nPlanet Elements: Water, Lightning, Wind, Wood, and Earth\nProduction: Horned Caimans, Earth Cockatrices, Mangrove Spiders, Spear Hornets, Rock Palm Trees, and Rock Mangrove Trees.\nLife Force Income: 80,000 Years / Month\n.\nAside from the usual status menu, there was an additional window, informing Leo of Orlando Planet's perks.\nAfter conquering a planet, Leo could assign one of his \"immortal\" subordinates to become a governor. Then, the new governor's dao would provide various effects on the planet.\nIn this case, the fisherman guardian statue \"Kitten\" was Leo's shadow, created by the system. He inherited some of Leo's power, and he was a lot stronger than everybody in this world. As his dao was related to water, sea, and sea creatures, Leo appointed him to be the governor of Orlando.\nThe result was satisfactory. The planet got several buffs, which improved the life quality of the local monster beasts.\nThat was not all, the governor could freely life force from the local monster beasts and transfer it to Leo directly, giving Leo a passive income. Moreover, the governor could mine natural resources and transfer them to this world.\nSo far, Kitten hadn't paid him the lifespan tax yet. However, he could see a pile of pine trees and mangrove trees in front of the permanent portal nearby.\nDING\nWhile Leo gazed at the logs, five recycling center workers and a warehouse mannequin rode the elevator and arrived at the platform. They ignored Leo and walked toward the pile of logs.\nEach mannequin lifted two logs each. Then, they jumped down from the platform.\n\"…\"\nLeo followed the mannequins and looked down from the platform, observing his automatons. Then, he saw how his people worked.\nThe warehouse mannequin and others safely landed even though their knee joints trembled. After adjusting their knees and legs, they carried the logs to the junkyard and put them together with the iron pine tree logs.\nSeeing how these automatons work, Leo was happy. Still, he hadn't researched the new mutated resources from the Orlando Planet yet.\nAlthough Leo was tempted to bring those resources to the alchemy workshops, he postponed the idea as the workshops were always crowded.\nHe needed to new alchemy workshop or a similar facility that could be dedicated to the research.\n\"Haiya. I guess I have to allocate specialized buildings to myself. I can't let the bots and my workers hog them all.\"\nLeo opened the shop domain system to see the new building list. As he had upgraded the general store to level 9 recently, there were new structures that he could build.\n.\nBarrack\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 9\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nExpansion Range – 10 x 10\n.\nWarehouse (3)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 9\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nGranary (3)\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 500 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 5 x 5\n.\nUnfortunately, Leo couldn't build another alchemy workshop. Aside from the second employee apartment that Leo had built for the Life Sword Sect's people, he hadn't built the level 9 structures.\nStill, Leo stared at the new facility, aka the barrack. He had a bad premonition about it as it reminded him of many ancient city-building games in the past.\n'Whenever a city-building game features a barrack, there will be combat or war. I don't like this.'\nLeo shook his head in a bad mood. Even though he disliked the new building, he opened the domain map and purchased the building anyway. After all, he needed another place for his employees to live.\nRUMBLE\nA small building appeared behind the men's apartment. It was a square structure with two stories high.\nLeo jumped down from the portal platform to check the new building. He landed 10 meters away from the barrack. Then, he turned around to touch the barrack.\nBecause it came out as a level-1 structure, its walls and roofs were made from thin rusty roofing sheets. The entrance featured no door, and the windows were all broken.\nLeo didn't bother checking the interior of the building. He inspected the building's status menu to see which parts he could upgrade.\n.\nBarrack Level 1\nBarrack Size – (1/5)\nBarrack Quality – (0/10)\nTraining Speed – (0/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nLeo leaned backward for a moment as he found the new structure different from a regular resident building, such as the employee apartments or the small houses.\nIt featured something else.\nCurious, Leo pressed on the \"Training Speed\" label to see its explanation.\nDING\n<Training Speed – Residents of the barrack can learn or master combat techniques faster. One assigned point increases the training speed by 20% (Max 100%).>\nLeo raised his eyebrows. Although this was not what he needed the most, it might be useful for Hua Jiashan, Gao Yan, and other battle freaks.\nDING\nSpending 8,000 years of lifespan, Leo upgraded it to level 9 and assigned some points.\n.\nBarrack Level 9\nBarrack Size – (2/5)\nBarrack Quality – (3/10)\nTraining Speed – (5/5)\n[Upgrade] – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nRUMBLE\nThe building transformed into a square wooden cabin. The roof and the entire structure were made of wood while the windows and doors were repaired.\nLeo entered the building and found a large area inside. Measuring the interior with his eyes, Leo estimated that it was around 150 to 200 square meters, which was larger than its initial size. Moreover, it featured two floors.\nIn addition, 30 wooden bunk beds lined up nicely in three rows. Each bed came with a metal locker. The furniture took a lot of room at a glance, but there were spacious enough for residents to walk around.\nUnfortunately, the facility offered no bathroom. The future residents here might have to use the general store's bathrooms for their daily necessities.\nLeo shrugged and left the building. When he walked out of the barrack, a hundred people already surrounded the place to see the commotion. Among them, the lazy bum Wu Buyi was there.\n\"Ah, my lord! What did you build this time?\"\nLeo sighed and waved his hand, calling Wu Buyi over.\n\"This place is a barrack for aspiring trainees. Call the homeless youngsters over. Allocate 120 of them to stay in here. Oh, FYI, everybody that lives there can master their martial arts or techniques faster. You can try if you want to.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nWu Buyi heard something interesting. However, as he found the small house comfortable, he declined the opportunity.\nOn the other hand, many disciples from the sanctuary and the Life Sword Sect overheard the conversation. They were eager to try.\n\"Sir! Can we move in there?\" One of the girls shouted from the crowd.\nAnother male teenager raised his hand, \"Can we live in there, too?\"\n\"But senior, can we live together with the boys? Isn't it too dangerous for the girls?\"\nEverybody murmured as many sanctuary girls and sword disciples were interested in the new facility. Because of the current segregation and their custom, living together under the same roof might ensue some complications.\nLeo also found this situation complicated. Even in the military, they didn't let men and women stay in the same barracks for this reason.\nFor the sake of fairness, Leo made a new rule.\n\"There are two floors in this building. Women can live on the second floor. As for men, you stick to the first floor. If I find any man going up to the second floor for no reason, I'll cut off your sausage and make you a woman as you wish!\"\n\"…\"\nThe boys covered their crotch in fear while the girls were delighted.\nStill, for the sake of security and protection, Leo needed a couple guards to watch these youngsters. He visited Esen, who had been lurking in her house.\nLeo knocked on the door several times. A few minutes later, Esen slammed open the door in a bad mood.\n\"What do you want?!\"\n\"…What were you doing?\" Leo frowned.\n\"I was taking a nap! I hate sunlight!\"\n\"You? Sleep?\" Leo found Esen amusing. \"A lich can sleep?\"\n\"Shut it, you! Just say it. What do you want?!\"\nLeo sighed and told Esen about the new facility and its perks. At first, Esen yawned and scratched her eye sockets in boredom.\nBut when Leo mentioned that the barrack's residents could learn or train faster, Esen was interested. She stared at him with blank eye sockets.\n\"Hey, geezer. Can I stay in that building?\"\n\"What about this house? Are you moving out?\"\n\"Hell no! It's empty, so it's mine! I'll be staying in that barrack, too!\"\n\"You're a greedy brat. Has anybody told you that?\"\n\"Pfft. This empress already has everything! I'm a magmatic and virtuous lich! I don't greed for someone else's property!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo wanted to retort that she stole one of his facilities, aka the third small house. Still, he chose to keep quiet as he respected this little undead loli.\nAs Esen always frightened others with her blank eye sockets, Leo remembered something. He rushed to his general store and picked up two eyeball parasites from a glass container. He then brought them back and shoved the eyes into the confused loli.\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" Esen panicked when Leo suddenly shoved his fingers into her eyes.\n\"Shut it and let me finger you! I need to shove these balls in!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\n.\nBecause Leo picked the wrong words, a few bystanders blushed and grinned as they thought that Leo and Esen were couples. After all, only Esen had the guts to swear or curse Leo out loud.\nAmong the onlookers, Yao Qiqi was among them. She giggled.\n\"I knew it. Senior Angel and Sister Esen are couples!\"\nXu Nuan blankly stared at the little girl. She corrected her, \"I don't think senior Florida Man and Her Majesty Esen have that kind of relationship. Where did you hear that from?\"\n\"Are you sure? I heard it from Cat!\"\n\"Cat?\"\n\"She said that they have a similar air. They smell the same, she said.\"\n\"…But Esen is an undead.\"\n\"Senior Angel smells like a corpse sometimes, too. He smells like her!\"\n\"…That's probably Cat's saliva. Didn't Cat lick Esen a lot when you guys were playing together?\"\n\"…\"\nYao Qiqi flinched as she also remembered Cat's bad breath. As Xu Nuan had said, Cat often licked Esen and praised her taste.\n\"So, Cat lied to me.\"\n\"More like a misunderstanding. Rather, Cat probably wants to eat her, but she couldn't.\"\n\"No way. Cat never eats her friends, but she loves to kiss and lick! One time, she kissed me, but she sucked me into her mouth by accident! She licked me a lot though. It was fun, but stinky.\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan sighed. This place was so weird that she had a new headache every day.",

      "content": "Chapter 140 Florida Man Struck by Lightning While Fingering His 7-Year-Old Girlfriend\nChapter 140 – Florida Man Struck by Lightning While Fingering His 7-Year-Old Girlfriend\nAfter putting the parasitic eyeballs into Esen's eye sockets, the parasites merged with her. The undead lich regained her eyeballs for the first time.\nEsen blinked several times to get used to her new sense. She rubbed her brow as the vision was too pricky. At first, she stumbled back and forth as she couldn't maintain her body balance. A few minutes later, her pupils dilated as she finally adapted to the new organs.\n\"That wasn't necessary,\" Esen complained. \"My Qi vision is much better. I can see everything around me without these eyes!\"\nLeo scoffed. As he already added her name to the tournament roster, he needed to make her look like a human child. Thus, sending her there without eyeballs might raise some eyebrows.\n\"I need you to disguise yourself as a human child and join that tournament I talked about. I can't send you there without an eye.\"\n\"Are you stupid?! They're gonna know! I'm even stronger than those so-called 'Celestial Kings' among the immortals!\"\n\"…Celestial King? Is that a rank of the immortal tier?\"\nEsen flinched and frowned. She found Leo weird.\n\"Aren't you an immortal?\"\n\"Mortals, immortals, I don't know dog crap about cultivation bases. Welp, if a celestial king like you can't beat me, you might as well call me Florida God!\"\n\"…\"\nEsen tilted her head, but she remembered the feedback that she detected from Leo yesterday. At first, she thought that Leo was a weird immortal whose physique surpassed the limits of all celestial beings. However, upon realizing how clueless Leo was, she believed he was similar to the monster beasts.\nMonster beasts relied on their instinct to grow stronger. They evolved their flesh and blood until they became invincible among their peers. Then, they came out from their nests to either find mates or expand their territory. Judging from the monster beast's nature, Leo strangely fit in the category.\nStill, there was a contradiction to Esen's theory. Leo's body contained Qi and the essence that cultivators had. Someone like him couldn't possibly be a monster beast.\nEsen was confused.\n\"What are you, really?\"\nLeo scoffed, \"Like I said, I'm Florida God!\"\n\"Yeah, right,\" Esen shook her head. She thought of him as a stupid brute. \"Anyway, back to the topic, the tournament hosts will definitely detect my life core. I'm not even a monster beast or a cultivator. I don't have a beating heart or a dantian. They will find out.\"\n\"You don't have to worry about that. Hehehehe.\"\nLeo ejected barrels of rejuvenating tea and yin fluid for Esen.\nThe yin fluid came from the mutated corpses that Leo collected from the Fatui Cult while the pinnacle-grade tea barrels were from the alchemy workshops. Leo had so many of them that he could splurge one or two for bribery.\n\"How about you drink that blood? You tried to suck my blood when we met.\"\n\"…I wanted your life force, not your blood.\"\n\"But don't you drink blood?\"\n\"I do, actually. Well, since you insist…\"\nEsen had no idea what Leo was plotting. She opened the barrel of rejuvenating tea and swallowed several mouthfuls of it at once.\nThe onlookers gulped as they were aware of the effects. Nobody dared to stop her as they were afraid of Leo and Esen. They could only watch their interaction, waiting for the tea to start decreasing Esen's physical age.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nLeo and everybody could hear Esen's skeletons and bones cracking. Esen's purple skin was lighter and brighter while her skinny arms and legs gained some mass.\nEsen got a bit chubbier. She no longer looked malnourished.\nThe lich empress didn't stop drinking tea. She lifted the entire barrel and kept downing every drop as if they were delicious beer.\n\"PUHA!\"\nFinally, Esen emptied 50 liters of tea. She wiped her mouth and loudly burped. Then, she patted her round belly.\n\"That was good shit!\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows and gazed at Esen's physique. He also counted his fingers to calculate.\n\"100cc = 20 years. That was 50 liters, so 500 times 20. That's 10,000 years… How old are you again?\"\nEsen didn't pay attention to Leo and didn't hear his question, but she already opened the barrel of yin fluid. She lifted the 50-liter barrel and started drinking.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nEsen never realized that her body slowly changed. Her bones never stopped cracking and reshaping while her skin gained a brighter color. From light purple, it turned dark green. From dark green, it faded into light yellowish.\nLeo frowned as he wondered where all the liquid disappeared in Esen's body. A hundred liters of blood and tea entered her stomach, but nothing came out.\n\"BURP!\"\nAgain, Esen finished her meal. She widely grinned.\n\"That really hit the spot. I feel alive!\"\nLeo pursed his lips and inspected Esen's current appearance. She looked no different than a Caucasian blond girl, but her pupils were glowing in crimson. Her signature vampire fangs were still there as well.\nShe reverted into a blond vampire, who was also a necromancer.\n\"Say, Esen. How old are you exactly?\"\nEsen licked her bloody fingers, \"Dunno. I've stopped counting when it went over 5,000, but it's roughly 10,000ish.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nCurious, Leo checked Esen's lifespan status as he had never inspected her before.\n.\nName: Esen Sydin IV\nAge: 10,007\nRemaining Lifespan: Null.\n.\nLeo was shocked. For the first time, he found someone without a life force!\n\"Zero lifespans? How the hell are you still alive?\"\nEsen also stared at the revelation of her exact age. When she noticed how old she was, she giggled.\n\"I'm quite accurate, ain't I? I told you I'm somewhat 10,000. Oh, per your inquiry, I was born an undead. UN-DEAD! I'm already dead, you idiot.\"\nLeo had several questions in his mind. He also noticed the inconsistency of Esen's testimony and her current appearance.\nShe looked more like a living person than a lich. Moreover, Leo could faintly hear her heartbeat.\nPointing out his doubt, Leo told Esen, \"Your heart is beating though.\"\n\"That's impossible. All my internal organs all rotted and decayed ages ago… wait, what?!\"\nEsen patted her chest as she sensed her heartbeat. In shock, he stared at Leo.\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO ME?!\"\n\"That's what I'm asking.\"\n\"…\"\nBoth Esen and Leo were baffled. Esen was flabbergasted that she had a pulse like a living creature while Leo still wondered why she had \"Null\" as her lifespan.\nLeo never studied computer languages, so he didn't know about the true meaning of \"Null\". He scratched his head.\nEven though both couldn't understand how these happened, Leo achieved his goal as nobody should suspect Esen of her age and race now.\n\"Anyway, congrats for coming back to life?\" Leo dryly laughed.\n\"This is not funny! I'm an undead! I'm supposed to be dead and alive!\"\n\"Just turn off your brain and accept reality, really. It's easier to skip the first four stages of grieves than go through all five at once. It's bad for mental health.\"\n\"But I should be dead!\"\nLeo deeply sighed as Esen could sometimes be annoying and loud. He patted her head as usual, \"Just treat it as a gift or a miracle. Oh, I forgot to ask you. You said that you were born an undead. Then, how the hell did you grow up?\"\n\"Get your hand off me, peasant!\" Esen swatted Leo's hand off her hand and yelled. \"When I said I was born undead, I meant it! When I came to my senses, I was already an undead!\"\nLeo noticed another clue from her words. He had a hypothesis that Esen was once a human, but she was resurrected by something. After all, she had a surname, and her family seemed to have a long lineage.\n\"So, you don't remember anything when you're a human?\"\n\"I was never a human!\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Of course! The previous lich emperor raised me before he ascended.\"\n\"Mhm. So the previous lich emperor raised you and the first thing you saw was him, right?\"\n\"How did you know?\"\n\"Mhm. I think I get the picture…\"\nLeo was sure that Esen was once a human, but she was resurrected as an undead, which was the reason she never had a lifespan. Moreover, it would explain why she looked like a child. As zombies or undead creatures shouldn't be able to grow up, she might have gotten stuck in her previous human form for 10,000 years without realizing it.\nAfter coming to a revelation, Leo kept his mouth shut. He didn't want to ruin the girl's feelings.\nUnfortunately, Leo forgot something important. It had been 30 seconds since he last touched Esen while she had a mortal physique.\n\"KYAAAAAA!!\"\nSuddenly, Esen screamed. Her blood and flesh swelled and moved in her body like a snake.\n\"GEEZER, HELP!\"\nLeo was also shocked. He had touched Esen several times, but his cancer cells never did anything to her. He was baffled by how the mutation happened after all their interactions.\nHe rushed back to the alchemy workshop, where he had ordered the mannequins to make elixir grain pills to educate the alchemy team. He picked up a handful of pinnacle-grade elixir pills on the way back.\n.\nPinnacle-Grade Elixir Grain Pill\n- Satisfy the hunger for 480 days.\n- Increase metabolism and regenerative abilities for 100 days.\n- Increase lifespan by 200 years.\n- Increase all five elements Qi by 200 years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nThat was Leo's only healing pill among his merchandise. He returned to Esen's side and shoved a pill down her throat.\n\"COUGH!\"\nBecause of Esen's small throat, the pill got stuck.\n\"Dammit. Err, what do I do… Oh, right. I can do that! Sorry, brat!\"\nLeo tried to stick his finger into her throat to push it. However, his skin touched directly to her tongue and mouth, causing to mutation to quicken.\nRealizing his mistake, Leo's brain malfunctioned. He panicked.\n\"Dammit. Not like this!\"\nAs Leo no longer thought properly, he pointed his finger into her mouth and fired a stream of water directly.\nBecause of the water, the elixir pill entered her stomach at long last. Esen was no longer choking, but the mutation already reached every part of her body.\n\"Geezer…\"\nEsen's teary eyes gazed at Leo. She reached out to touch him.\n\"…Help.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo was desperate. He pulled her into a hug and kissed her forehead.\n\"Endure, Esen. Your cells are evolving, but they are rebelling against you. You must show them who the boss is and suppress them with your willpower. When they submit to you, you will evolve like me!\"\n\"…\"\nEsen's swelling body trembled while tears rolled down her cheek. For the first time in her life, she was afraid of death.\nThe mutation process was too painful.\nRUMBLE\nAs if heaven bullied them, lightning tribulation clouds gathered above Esen and Leo. The sky turned dark.\nThe onlookers looked up and noticed the orange lightning bolts in the sky. The disciples and sanctuary maidens opened their mouths in astonishment while Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were flustered.\n\"ORANGE HEAVEN TRIBULATION! EVERYBODY, RUN! GET AWAY FROM LORD FLORIDA MAN!\"\nLeo also looked up. He recognized the orange lightning clouds well. However, he was not in the mood to entertain heaven.\nAs Leo had learned how to use Qi, he pointed his finger at the clouds. Then, he commanded.\n\"Metal rod.\"\nWHOOSH\nA steel beam appeared from Leo's finger and flew toward the clouds. As soon as it touched the orange clouds, a lightning bolt struck.\nBOOM\nThe lightning bolt was a chain lightning. It passed through the steel beam and came for Esen!\nLeo deeply exhaled and threw a punch toward the incoming lightning bolt.\n\"Fine. You win. SERIOUS FLORIDIAN PUNCH!\"\nThe fist generated a wide sonic boom ripple and compressed air. It also produced a black lightning bolt, flying toward the incoming heavenly tribulation.\nThe black lightning consumed the orange lightning. It flew upward and hit the orange clouds.\nBOOOOM\nThe tribulation clouds dispersed! Just like that, Leo canceled the heaven's tribulation with a superior heaven's tribulation lightning bolt.\nThat was not all. The black lightning bolt shot in a straight line like a laser beam. It pierced through the atmosphere and disappeared into space.\nThe thunder was so loud that everybody below covered their ears and screamed. Even Hua Jiashan's eardrums ruptured as he couldn't withstand the noise. As for the rest, they either fainted or vomited blood.\nMUNYA!\nWOOF!\nFollowed by the loud thunderbolt, two of the statue guardians activated their domain abilities. Light beacons shone upon the critically injured disciples, elders, and Hua Jiashan.\nTheir destroyed eardrums were instantly healed. Some of the fainted disciples regained their senses.\nOne of the light beacons also shone upon Esen and Leo. The latter could hear the black-winged angel's voice.\n\"Master, that girl needs your virgin yang to balance her overwhelming virgin yin. Give her your blood, and she should be fine.\"\nLeo heard the tips. He nodded and bit his fingertip.\nUnfortunately, his blood cells misunderstood him and instantly healed the wound.\n\"Dammit. I need some of you. Don't heal my wound!\"\nIn frustration, Leo bit other parts of his body to bleed. After cutting his wrist, his transparent blood finally came out.\nLeo gently poured his blood into Esen's small mouth. However, she didn't react or swallow his blood.\n\"…\"\nAnnoyed, Leo pried open her mouth and squeezed his wrist to drop the transparent blood into her throat. But again, she couldn't swallow it. Esen's mutation reached the critical stage, and she couldn't move or talk anymore.\n\"Sorry, but I ain't a romantic dude. Make do with these, okay?\"\nInstead of kissing her and inserting his tongue like a cliché romance story, Leo pointed his finger into her mouth and fired a pressured water stream at her throat again, forcing the collective blood in her mouth to go down.\nIt worked. Esen swallowed his blood. However, her eyes reddened as if she was angry at something.\n\"What? You drank my blood. Isn't it enough?\" Leo scoffed at her.\nFive minutes later, Esen's condition got better. The swelling flesh and limbs reverted to normal even though some parts were twisted. Her arms, legs, and body got slightly bigger, but it would take a while for her to heal.\nLeo was happy that Esen made it through the tough part. He could only wait for the girl to finish her evolution and obtain a new physique. He put the injured girl to her bed.\nAlthough Esen was in a bad condition, her eyes still rotated around as she had been observing Leo. Her throat vibrated as she tried to talk.\n\"…You fool!\"\nLeo snickered, \"You're welcome.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 141 – Florida Man Discharged Homemade Nuclear Waste Water While Taking Bath in River, Claimed the Water Came From Fukushima\nThe hectic day was over. Esen survived, but she still needed time to recover from the mutation process.\nThe disciples and elders quickly learned about Leo's deadliest power as they witnessed it first-hand – The black lightning beam, the pure physical strength, and the poisonous touch. They finally understood why Leo usually wore rubber gloves when he needed to touch the others.\nFortunately, as no sect or organization provided better treatment than Leo's store, they kept the secrets to themselves. No ingrate youngster or corrupted adult sold his information to the public.\nMoreover, as they saw that Leo could easily destroy the orange tribulation clouds with a punch, they were grateful that they had a strong backer. Their faith in Leo rose instead of declining.\nEverybody was happy…\nExcept…\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nA Texas-State-sized asteroid flew through the dark void at the speed of 50 miles per second while emitting no sound. It left behind a trail of dust, ice particles, and smoke as it moved through countless rocks and gas while the surrounding's temperature was minus 500 Fahrenheit.\nDespite the extreme temperature and the environment, two short-haired middle-aged men in glittering fancy armor stood on the asteroid, gazing toward the void.\nOne of them wore a full plate armor of gold and a gold crown, but they emanated a rainbow aura, similar to Leo's radiation aura. He also wore a golden cloak with the embroidery patterns of a rain dragon. Even his tunic underneath his armor was also the same color.\nThis man's name was Yan Yu. He was the previous emperor of the Yan Empire, who had ascended over 500 years ago. His face looked the same as Yan Xiang as he was the latter's father.\nBehind Yan Yu was another immortal. Unlike the flashy Yan Yu, the young man behind him wore nothing but white scholar robes and bronze court official headwear. His handsome face and skin were flawless and smooth. From an onlooker's perspective, he seemed to be in his teens. However, his real age was in the four digits.\nHe was the ancestor of the Situ Clan, and he was also the father of Situ Nantian. His name was Situ Kang.\nSurrounding the scholar and the former emperor was a thin layer of blue dome, protecting them from random debris, radiation, and gas in space.\nWhile admiring the scenery, Situ Kang sneaked glances at his colleague. He slightly sighed.\n\"What?\" Yan Yu sensed Situ Kang's irritated breathing. He snorted.\n\"Just sighing. Our descendants are really incompetent.\"\n\"I suppose so. Anyway, how are your clan and your son? Did they call you too?\"\n\"Well, yeah. My son will be bedridden for a century at the very least. As for the clan, they lost so many good men in the last mystic realm season.\"\n\"What was the realm they went to? A demon realm?\"\n\"I heard it was the same realm as your dead grandson went. Nantian said he was probably the rumored guy.\"\n\"Florida Man?\"\n\"Yes. That one. Your son and Nantian went to the same mystic realm. Chances are, he's the culprit.\"\n\"Haven't Nantian mastered the ghost steps? His speed is unparalleled among the mortals. Unless the opponent is an immortal, he shouldn't have been caught easily.\"\n\"That's why I'm tagging along with you. If Florida Man is really an immortal in disguise, I can either report this to the Heavenly Court or kill him directly. You know, immortals these days are losers. They can't compete with the older generations for resources, so they often return to their home planet to abuse their new power. We got that a lot during the past 300 years. Florida Man might be one of them.\"\n\"…\"\nYan Yu nodded as Situ Kang's words made sense. He resumed gazing at the stars and stopped talking.\nSitu Kang also didn't bother extending the conversation. He closed his eyes and circulated his soul energy, which was exclusive to immortals.\nAs Situ Kang began circulating his soul Qi, his aura changed. A thick layer of rainbow aura manifested around him, and the asteroid under his feet got blacker. A few seconds later, a small black sprout emerged from the dense rock.\nSitu Kang opened his eyes and sat on the ground. He gently stroked the sprout. As soon as he touched it, the sprout rapidly grew into a matured blade of immortal grass and bloomed a black flower.\nWhen the immortal flowers bloomed, the surface of the asteroid softened, and a thousand immortal grasses emerged.\nWhile Situ Kang slowly grew immortal grasses on the asteroid, Yan Yu frowned.\n\"Stop that. You're going to destroy our ride before we reach that star.\"\nSitu Kang shrugged, \"It's going to be destroyed anyway. Why don't I grow some immortal grasses while we're here so that we can give them to our descendants?\"\n\"…\"\nYan Yu closed his mouth as he agreed with Situ Kang. He stopped checking on his colleague and continued observing the stars.\nRUMBLE\nAs Yan Yu was about to resume his star-gazing hobby, he sensed a suppressive force of energy from a distance. He narrowed his eyes to see further into the dark void.\n\"A tribulation lightning bolt in the void? Is someone breaking through?\" Yan Yu uttered.\nSitu Kang stopped injecting his soul Qi into the asteroid. He stood next to Yan Yu to look into the dark. Then, he recognized the pattern of energy.\n\"Err… Isn't that the heaven tribulation, the immortal-killing lightning bolt?\"\n\"Red tribulation?\" Yan Yu frowned as there were two types of heavenly tribulation lightning bolts that he feared.\nThe first was the red tribulation lightning. As for the other, it was the strongest type – The black one. Both colors were dreaded as the bane of all immortals as nobody could survive a single hit from them, except those who had the aptitude to become a deity.\nZAAAAAPPP\nBefore both men could analyze what it was, the overwhelming tribulation lightning bolt was already in front of them. Its trajectory coincided with the asteroid's flight path!\n\"DODGE!\"\nSitu Kang and Yan Yu leaped away from the asteroid. A split second later, the incoming black laser beam devoured the space rock, disintegrating it to smoke!\nYan Yu and Situ Kang gazed at the massive laser beam, which traveled through the void like an endless tunnel of death. It erased everything in its path and continued going further without slowing down.\nThey were stunned. The former emperor's expression was distorted in fear and shock while Situ Kang gnashed his steel fan in fright.\n\"A-Are deities fighting ahead?! Where did that come from?!\" Yan Yu screamed.\n\"How the hell should I know?! I was with you!\"\nThe two immortals gulped as they couldn't imagine themselves defending against that beam. As low-tier immortals, orange lightning bolts were their limits.\n\"…Say, if that did not come from a deity, is someone undergoing a celestial emperor's tribulation?\"\n\"Celestial emperor? Nah, this star cluster is desolated and barren. Only Earth Celestials, Sky Celestials, and Star Celestials like us roam around here. The last time I saw a Heaven Celestial Immortal or stronger guy around here, it was when the Heavenly Court passed through this cluster.\"\nSitu Kang referred to the first three stages of immortal ranks. The first stage was the Earth Celestials, followed by the Sky Celestial and Star Celestial ranks. After that, there were Heaven Celestial, Celestial Warrior, Celestial General, Celestial King, Celestial Emperor, and True Immortal stages - A total of 9 ranks.\nOrange tribulation only appeared when a mortal tried to break through to the Earth Celestial Stage. After this rank, every immortal was forced to challenge orange tribulation lightning every 100 years to maintain their status as an immortal. In case someone avoided the tribulation, they would get chased by orange tribulation lightning every day until they successfully transcended it.\nThis tradition and rules continued until one reached the Celestial Warrior Stage. Then, the tribulation lighting changed to red, but they had a longer time to prepare. Instead of being forced to get hit once every 100 years, they needed to take it every 1,000 years.\nAs for black, it remained a mystery. Situ Kang and Yan Yu had never seen someone going through a black tribulation yet.\nThen a black laser passed by.\nThey were confused.\n\"… Yan Yu. Should we really head there?\" Situ Kang hesitated if helping his descendants was a good idea.\n\"That place… might be really in danger. I-I can't abandon my children!\" Despite saying that, Yan Yu turned around and flew away from his destination. \"But my life takes priority! I can make more children if I want to! If they die, they die!\"\n\"Y-Yeah. We spent a thousand years to get this far. W-We can't run into a super expert and get ourselves killed prematurely!\"\n\"T-That's right. Let's head back!\"\n\"…Yeah.\"\nThe two cowardly immortals turned tail and fled from their home planet.\nThat was the day that they completely abandoned their descendants. Even though their children repeatedly requested them to come back, they no longer responded to their calls.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile\nAfter sending Esen to bed, Leo resumed upgrading his domain. As Leo had buildable structures, he erected the third warehouse and the third granary to store more goodies.\nOnce all buildings were upgraded to level 9, Leo shifted his focus to modern electric appliances to improve everybody's life quality.\nEach electric appliance was cheap. However, upgrading them cost 1,000 YOL at the minimum. It was worse for vehicles and firearms as the upgrading cost was the same as their price tag.\nStreet lights, microwaves, electric fans, washing machines, and electric cooking stoves were introduced to primitive employees as it was the first step to get them familiarized with a modern lifestyle.\nAs new tools, modern street lights, and new buildings appeared one after another, the new employees got distracted from work. They couldn't stop wandering around to look at the new things.\nLeo left them alone. After decorating and supplying the apartments and other residential buildings with enough electric appliances, he visited the \"Grand Canyon\" next.\nUpon arriving at the massive canyon, Leo looked at the waterfall landmark. More freshwater continued to rain from the mystic realm platform and fell into the endless pit.\nThe new rival's level was half full so far. It flowed down south, heading toward the main river near the Frozen Fire City. As the source of life returned, many fish swam upstream and resided in the canyon.\nLeo stood at the edge of a cliff and gazed into the transparent river. He noticed several catfishes in there, which was not ideal for the ecology. After all, these guys preyed on smaller fishes.\nFor the sake of ecology, Leo jumped into the river. He also cladded himself with lightning Qi.\nPOOF\nAs soon as Leo's body sank into the water, his smiling face froze as he remembered the flaw in his plan. He smacked his forehead while his body slowly floated on top of the water.\nIt was too late. The water source slowly emitted a strange color as it was contaminated by Leo's cells and his radiation.\n\"Goddammit. My radiation can never be filtered like those Japanese nuclear plants! I might end up creating several Godzillas here!\"\nDespite the realization, Leo didn't bother climbing out of the river. Instead, he dove back into it to see the mutation of stunned catfishes.\nAs Leo had guessed, a hundred catfishes nearby squirmed in pain as their bodies swelled and bloated. Some of them looked like swollen puffer fish while many grew pairs of arms and legs. Fortunately, all of them died trying to evolve.\nAs more fish died, they floated on top of the river. Leo collected them into his spatial rings, planning to make some freshwater sushi as dinner.\nBut as Leo happily harvested more dead fish, a large creature suddenly fell from the waterfall.\nBOOM\nThe massive creature hit the water's surface, creating a massive splash. It rapidly sank, but its nose coincidentally smashed into Leo's head.\nLeo rubbed his head and looked up. Then, his eyes met with the animal's eyes.\nThe thing that had fallen from the waterfall was a horned caiman.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo was confused about how it appeared here in this world. He tilted his head, staring at the monster beast. Then, he remembered.\nKitten promised to pay taxes by capturing the local creatures in the mystic realm for Leo. He figured that the statue guardian might have already started working, and this guy was the tribute.\nThe caiman opened its mouth and tried to eat Leo alive. However, it swallowed a lot of contaminated water in the process.\nCHOMP\nIt resisted Leo's radiation and bit Leo's torso. However, its teeth failed to penetrate through his clothes and his skin.\n\"Oh, nice timing. I need a boat.\"\nLeo gently pried the giant caiman's mouth open and climbed on its back. He then smacked its head lightly, teaching it a lesson.\n\"Submerge, my submarine!\"\n\"…\"\nThe caiman resisted. It rolled its body while they were underwater, trying to shake the weird Florida Man off its back.\nLeo resisted. He hugged its mouth and pulled it up.\nZAAAA\nA few seconds later, both man and caiman submerged. The monster beast continued to twist and turn, flapping its tail and body to remove the rider.\nInstead of intimidating the rider, Leo cackled as he had fun.\n\"YEAH! SHAKE IT, BABY! YEE-HAW!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 142 – SWAT Team and FBI Mobilized as Florida Man Successfully Genetic-Engineered 7-Year-Old Girl into Adult WAIFU\nWhile Leo and his people enjoyed their slow life, another place was thrown into chaos.\nDeath Sword Sect…\nDeath Sword Sect was one of the great sects among all clans and martial artist organizations. They were also the descendants of the sword saint, but they relied on a different cultivation method than the original sword saint's techniques.\nThey researched all sword saint boulders on the continent and discovered the completed sword techniques and the original cultivation method. However, instead of following the original guidelines and teachings, their sect improved the cultivation method to hasten the cultivation speed and growth rate of their disciples.\nRegular practitioners and Life Sword Sect's disciples gathered Qi and obtained elemental Qi, such as fire Qi or metal Qi to become a good swordsman. On the other hand, the Death Sword Sect's disciples could acquire elemental Qi by killing their opponents and absorbing their Qi. Living creatures and monster beasts were also on their kill list!\nBecause of such a method, many sword practitioners abandoned the Life Sword Sect to join their counterparts. As a result, their sect exponentially grew.\nStill, the Yan Empire had a strict law. They banned unethical practices and cultivation methods of unorthodox sects. As such, the royal family always suppressed and hunted down Death Sword Sect's disciples. The other unorthodox cults and sects were also purged.\nIt wasn't long until the Death Sword Sects, Fatui Cult, and other evil cults were destroyed. The Jianghu Alliance and the royal family then arrested all evil cultivators.\nUnfortunately, humans were naturally greedy. The imperial family and the representatives from the Jianghu Alliance desired the secret cultivation method of the evil sects, but they were not shameless enough to openly practice the vile cultivation methods.\nInstead of cultivating them directly, they hired the captives and rebuilt the unorthodox sects. Then, they deployed agents and spies into the organizations to learn and develop their secret arts as a pretense of working as their disciples.\nOuyang Clan, Situ Clan, and even royalty sent their people to occupy important positions within the evil sects and cults. After the imperial family and various major clans conquered the evil cults from within, these organizations became vessels of the royal family and big clans. Afterward, those unorthodox cults and sects used their connection to gain membership in the imperial court.\nYears later, Emperor Yan and his sons seized the political advantage and took control of the Death Sword Sect and Fatui Cult. The major clans had no choice but to bow their heads and enjoy the leftovers from the royal family.\nThis status quo had been fixed for 300 years. No one managed to break their political alliance as all major clans enjoyed the new cultivation methods and rose in power…\n…Until the recent mystic realm expedition.\n.\nThe once wealthy Mantis Dragon City, the home base of the Death Sword Sect was no longer the same.\nBuildings and structures of the city were covered by mysterious pink mushrooms and a thick fog of mushroom spore. It was devoid of cultivators and commoners. However, the population was replaced by something terrifying.\n\"Uuuuugh.\"\n\"Oooooooh.\"\n\"Eeeegh.\"\nHumanoid monsters walked aimlessly in the city. They had four limbs and humanoid torso, but their head and blistered skin became the nutritious soil for hardened pink mushrooms.\nEverybody's heads were deformed and mutated differently. The mushrooms that grew from their brains and skulls all had a unique shape and size. Some behaved like the mutated cultivator's mouth while several mushrooms transformed into an extra limb.\nRegular mushrooms, spore spitters, fangs, hammers, spikes, eyes, limbs, beating hearts, hardened flesh, extra heads, extra faces, mouths, and even genitals emerged on everybody's head. Each carried a different trait and strength.\nFloating over the mushroom city were two flying ferry ships. One of them belonged to the Ouyang Clan while the other one was from the imperial court.\nStanding on the deck were the rescuers and the survivors of the outbreak. The rescued were without any garments as the court physicians and alchemists examined them thoroughly with their Qi.\nAmong the alchemists, one of them was a soul transformation cultivator. Coincidentally, he was from the Ouyang Clan and an elder of a prominent group.\nHe was Ouyang Ke, the grandfather of Ouyang Feng and an elder of the World Tree Sect. As his sect commanded, he and many alchemists were dispatched here to investigate the Mantis Dragon City as the imperial court had lost contact with their agents in the Death Sword Sect.\nOuyang Ke and others didn't need to spend too much time as the cause of this incident was apparent – Sweet Dream Mushrooms!\nAlthough this discovery was huge, nobody onboard had the luxurious time to inform their superiors or headquarters. All able cultivators were busy expending their Qi, creating a wind storm and blowing the spores south. As for the physicians and the alchemists, their hands got tied down as they had to heal and filter the survivors.\nWhile checking one of the naked sword sect's disciples, Ouyang Ke detected a movement inside the disciple's left thigh. The latter's blood vessels were black, and pink rashes were visible on his skin.\n\"Another infected!\"\nOuyang Ke warned his colleagues and grabbed the disciple's head.\n\"ELDER, PLEASE SPARE ME!\" The disciple cried.\n\"Sorry, brat. There is no cure!\"\nCRACK\nOuyang Ke twisted the disciple's neck. Then, he severed the young man's head and threw the corpse out of the ship.\n\"Next!\"\nAfter killing the 56th survivor, Ouyang Ke's bloodshot eyes stared at the remaining naked survivors.\nThe remaining disciples trembled in fear. They looked around, searching for a way to flee. Unfortunately, many nascent soul and soul formation cultivators surrounded them, blocking every possible escape route.\n\"Move!\"\nOne of the cultivators pointed his long spear at the frontmost young man. The latter shed a tear of despair and walked toward Ouyang Ke.\nLooking at the young man, Ouyang Ke grumbled, \"Don't cry, brat. If you're not infected, we'll bring you to Cauliflower City. As long as you're not infected…\"\n\"…\"\nOther alchemists and physicians also finished scanning their patients.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nOut of a dozen inspected survivors, three of them got their necks snapped on the spot. Once again, the elders threw the infected corpses away.\nAs for the lucky ones, they cried tears of joy as they wouldn't get killed. They screamed and hugged each other.\nOuyang Ke was in a bad mood. He glared at the non-infected survivors and yelled at them.\n\"Bring them to the isolation cabins and seal them with cage talismans for seven days. We have to make sure that no spore is on them or that they are infected, but they don't show the symptoms! Be thorough! This is Sweet Dream Mushroom we're dealing with!\"\nThe ferry guards gulped and saluted Ouyang Ke. Then, they dragged the inspected survivors to the cabins inside the ship.\nThe disciples cried as everything around them was unfair. They had just survived the sudden mushroom zombie outbreak, but they got caught and imprisoned by their allies.\nOuyang Ke and the other elders ignored their desperate cries and resumed their tasks. They were aware that one small mishap there could bring a calamity to the entire continent. Thus, they tried their best to contain the mushroom spores and the infected.\nAs nobody could predict where the spores would spread, they purposely sacrificed the southern region of their continent to the mushrooms. The only worrisome settlements south of Mantis Dragon City were Magpie City, Leo's shop, and Frozen Fire City, so the imperial court chose to limit the infection to their areas instead of letting it spread elsewhere. Once the reinforcements from the immortal realm arrived, they could remove these troublesome mushrooms and hunt down Leo altogether.\nThat was their initial plan.\n\"UUUUUUURRRAAAAAAAAHHHH!!\"\nWhile everybody was busy scanning the survivors, one of the mushroom zombies below looked up to the sky and bellowed.\nThe ferry guards looked at the zombie. Then, they frowned as they recognized the person's aura and Qi's signature. Although his face and appearance had changed, his signature long swords and his black armor were recognizable.\nThat zombie was Hua Guanhai, aka Hua Jiashan's brother and the sect master of the Death Sword Sect. Because of the mushroom spore that he accidentally carried over from the mystic realm, he was infected first and became a slave of the mushrooms.\nAt first, the guards scoffed at Hua Guanhai.\n\"Are you angry, Hua Guanhai? Hahahaha! It must have felt terrible to be a slave of their own mind.\"\n\"Yeah, I can't imagine how sad it is to get trapped in their own delusion.\"\n\"Less talking. Let's ignore him. We can't let any survivor flee from here, or it will really be a disaster.\"\n\"But the south…\"\n\"That rumored Florida Man is near Magpie City. I heard he killed the second prince, and the emperor wanted him dead. Well, since these mushrooms gradually multiply, we'll send these spores to Florida Man's abode and kill him altogether. We'll kill two birds in one stone.\"\nThe guards smirked as they were on the imperial family's side. They didn't care about the consequences of their actions.\nWHOOSH\nThey would soon be rudely awakened. While they were chatting, Hua Guanhai kicked the ground and charged toward them.\nSWUA\nSWUA\nUsing his black long sword, he cut down ten soul-formation cultivators in the sky in one second!\n\"!!!\"\nOuyang Ke and others sensed the terrifying presence of Hua Guanhai. They took arms and prepared for a fight.\n\"Dammit! Can Jiangshi fly, too?!\"\n\"Hua Guanhai, you bastard!\"\nHua Guanhai turned around and groaned. His mushroom head split open in half, revealing a large eyeball inside, which replaced his brain.\nThe eyeball glared at everybody. Then, Hua Guanhai sneered.\n\"Not good!\" Ouyang Ke broke a sweat. He pulled out an emergency portal talisman and tore it.\nWHOOSH\nA red portal appeared. Ouyang Ke frantically jumped into the portal and escaped alone.\nAs for the other cultivators, they failed to react as fast as Ouyang Ke. They unleashed their Qi attacks on Hua Guanhai.\n\"UUUURRRAAAAAHH!\"\nHua Guanhai screamed and summoned his new dao avatar. The pink fog below gathered into a mass of spore, then shapeshifted into a giant chomper plant.\n\"NOM-NOM!\"\nThe Dao avatar uttered before it transformed into pink clouds. Like a sweeping sandstorm, it devoured everybody in the sky.\n.\n.\n\"ACHOOO! MEOW!\"\nWhile eating potatoes in her granary, Cat's humanoid head sneezed. Her green slimy booger splashed everywhere on the mountain of mutated potatoes.\n\"…\"\nCat sweated profusely. Even though she wantonly ate everything that she could, she was afraid of Leo's paper fans and his scolding. As the potatoes were Leo's important ingredients for pills, he always told Cat not to leave some clean potatoes for his automatons.\nSeeing how all the potatoes in the granary got dirty, Cat cut out the dirty parts and put them in her mouth, hiding the evidence.\nThe smell of her slime booger was worse than Leo's stool and rotten corpses, yet she hummed as it tasted different.\nWhile Cat was enjoying her endless meal, Leo walked into the granary.\n\"Hey, Cat. Have you eaten all the cabbage and chilies? The donkeys are complaining that there are not enough cabbages!\"\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow!\" Cat feigned ignorance.\n\"No? Are you sure?\"\nCat shook her head. She sweated profusely.\n\"…Okay, then. I'll go check the other granary.\"\nLeo left Cat alone. She then let out a sigh of relief.\nAs she was worried that Leo would scold her for eating too much, she decided not to eat more of Leo's food. She got out of the granary and deeply inhaled.\n\"Meow?\"\nAs her foodie instinct was sharp, Cat caught a sweet scent of mushrooms from the north.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nCat drooled. She sprinted and leaped over the junkyard and log fields. Then, she disappeared into the iron pine trees beyond Leo's domain territory.\nAfter running 100 kilometers, she came across a pink fog, which slowly crept toward Leo's domain and Magpie City.\nCat tilted her head as she remembered the scent. It belonged to the sweet dream mushrooms that she once ate. Addicted to the unique taste, she rushed into the fog to find a similar mushroom.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW <3\"\n.\n.\n\"Umm…\"\nWhile Cat went out for food, Esen slowly regained her senses. Her entire body felt numb, and she could barely move.\nEsen gazed at the ceiling and discovered that she was in her new house. She let out a sigh of relief.\n'Geezer, you idiot. Your stupid water hurt my throat! You could have given me water nicely!'\nShe was still mad that Leo used a barbaric method to treat her. However, she also remembered how delicious Leo's blood was.\nThe taste was out of the world. She had drunk many types of blood, but Leo's tasted like a fine wine. Moreover, his blood was full of life force and pure elemental essence.\nThinking of Leo, Esen smirked. She then glanced down, looking at her paralyzed body. S\nEsen tried to move her arms, fingers, and legs. Unfortunately, they wouldn't budge.\n'Oh, dear. This takes me back. I guess I have to keep trying until I regain my strength. Oh, right. I can move my Qi and move like a marionette.'\nUsing her Qi as a string, Esen pulled her arms and legs up to restore her senses.\nBut as soon as she got to see her arms and legs again, Esen deeply frowned. Something wasn't right.\nHer skinny arm was usually short, and her hands were small. However, they seemed longer and bigger. Moreover, her pale skin was so whiter than a sheet.\n'Hmm?'\nNot only were her arms longer, her legs got lengthened as well. Her slender legs and meaty thighs seemed unusual.\n'Huh?'\nUnable to contain her curiosity, Esen closed her eyes to scan her appearance with her Qi. Then, she saw herself in a bird-eye view in her mind.\n'WHAT IN THE WORLD?!'",

FBI Warns Children Not to Trust Any Man in Among Us Cosplay.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow Meow <3\"\nCat giggled as she deeply inhaled the mushroom spores. To her, the sweet scent smelled like a freshly cooked wagyu steak.\nThe living mushrooms entered her bloodstream. However, they were instantly devoured by transparent blood cells, which Cat inherited from Leo.\nThe more the cells absorbed the mushroom spores, the livelier Cat became. As if Cat got injected with a chicken's blood, she sprinted around the infected area and sucked in as much spore as she could.\nHer existence became an air filter. Pink gas entered her mouth whenever she inhaled. But when she exhaled, only her bad breath came out.\nThe expanding pink spore also reacted to her actions. As they moved by their instinct, they traveled closer to the closest lifeform to infect her. As a result, the fog chased after her while she ran around.\nThe torrent of gas filter gradually cleaned the area, stopping the spread from the north to the south.\nUnfortunately, Cat's action wasn't enough to remove all pink spores from the area. As the fully grown mushrooms and zombies from Dragon Mantis City never stopped producing new spores, the disappeared fog was replaced.\n\"Nom Nom-Nom, Nom-Nom, Meow <3\"\nAfter running around for an hour, Cat noticed the traits of the mushroom fog. Instead of chasing the spores, she planted her roots in the soil and spread her thorn vines. Then, she mumbled.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nBlack stems slowly grew from her thorn vines. Soon, they became new branches and leaves. The small leaves produced sticky liquid, which trapped the mushroom spores on her. The parasitic mushrooms melted upon touch and got absorbed into her leaves and vines.\nAs Cat digested more mushrooms, her life force and her strength increased.\nRUMBLE\nDark clouds slowly gathered above Cat as she was about to naturally break through to the 8th stage. She looked up and noticed the flashing purple and yellow lightning in the sky.\nCat's lips curved down. She hated thunder and lightning.\nThunderbolt and lightning, very very frightened her.\nBANG!\nThunder roared as the tribulation clouds warned Cat about her pending trial by fire.\nCat bore her teeth in anger. She plunged her vines and new branches into the ground, getting ready to endure the punishment from heaven.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nPurple and Yellow lightning bolts slammed at her without mercy. At the same time, the extreme heat burnt the pink spores and all surrounding trees.\nGetting hit by yellow lightning bolts, Cat's vines and roots slowly turned into stone. However, her transparent blood cells rushed to the petrified parts to cure the curse.\nCat's innate ability was also active. She summoned the DNA of the cockatrices that she had been storing inside her and digested it. As the new DNA contained instinctive programs that the cockatrices had inherited from their ancestors, Cat took in some of their natural traits.\nOne of them was the power of petrification and the ability to resist the stone curse.\nAfter assimilating with the DNA, her petrified parts rapidly healed and reverted back to normal.\nBOOM\nAlthough the yellow lightning bolts could no longer turn her into stone, their extreme temperature still burnt her vines and roots. Her body was lightened on fire along with the surrounding iron pine trees and mushroom spore.\nCat's eyes gleamed as she imagined what Leo would do in this situation. She came up with a few solutions, but most of them were impossible for her.\nStill, she remembered one thing that he and she could do in common.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\nOpening her mouth wide, she taunted the tribulation clouds to strike her again.\nReplying to Cat's taunt, a yellow and purple lightning bolt descended and descended into her mouth.\nBOOM\nCat shut her mouth and trapped the intense energy inside. The scorching light burnt her tongue and melted her teeth. But a few seconds later, she gulped the air in her mouth into her tree trunk.\nBURP\nAfter letting out some gas, Cat's burnt wounds and her innards were instantly healed. She could feel her life force rising. At the same time, her humanoid body on top of the plant physique also grew bigger.\nFrom a child-like upper torso and face, Cat gained the body of a middle-school teenager. Her dao avatar behind her also transformed into a refined black elf in her adult form.\nYellow electric sparks leaked from her vines and head as Cat stole a portion of lightning Qi to herself.\nRUMBLE\nThe lightning tribulation was far from over. 30 consecutive yellow lightning bolts kept coming, punishing Cat for stealing heaven's energy.\nCat welcomed the lightning bolts with an open mouth. Her humanoid body laughed while the corner of her chomper mouth curved upward.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\n...\nThat day, Cat broke through her bottleneck and became an official 8th-stage monster on her own.\nThe tribulation ended before the sunset. However, Cat didn't return to Leo's domain. She gazed toward the north as she smelled something nicer than the pink gas.\nShe smelled corpses and bigger mushrooms.\n.\n.\nImperial Palace\nSitting in front of the throne room was Ouyang Ke. He reported the incident to Emperor Yan Xiang and the officials.\n\"Sweet Dream Mushrooms?!\"\nThe court officials murmured and looked around in panic. As for Yan Xiang, he stood as this incident reminded him of the calamity 500 years ago.\nLast time, Situ Nantian sacrificed a portion of the continent and forcefully broke through to summon yellow tribulation lightning.\nOnly yellow lightning bolts could burn the mushrooms and stop them from growing. However, to summon such a tribulation, they required a talented soul transformation cultivator who could withstand the punishing attacks from heaven.\nMany good cultivators died during the mystic realm expedition. The second prince's party was wiped out while the Situ Clan suffered a major blow. In short, their manpower was crippled.\nThe officials in the thorn room looked around to find the right candidates. Some sneaked glances at Tang Xuan while weaker cultivators thought of the first prince and the third prince.\nWhile everybody was lost for words, a representative from the Situ Clan took a step forward.\nThe man was Situ Bai. He was an elder of the Cauldron Gnosis Sect, which was a part of the Pill Union. Although he was from the union, he had been working here to coordinate between the imperial court and his clan.\nSitu Bai was like other court officials here. He kept his blue robes clean and spotless. His long hair was hidden inside his headwear, and he carried no weapon with him.\nBowing to the emperor, Situ Bai offered his insight.\n\"Your Majesty, there is no need to panic. From the information, the new sweet dream mushroom lair is the Dragon Mantis City south of here. Thanks to Elder Ouyang's quick wits, the wind is temporarily blowing south.\"\n\"And…?\" Yan Xiang deeply frowned as he wanted the mushrooms contained, not spreading elsewhere.\n\"This is the best solution we have at the moment. Since Daoist Florida Man is rumored to reside near the Magpie City, he would be the first to face the spreading of the mushrooms.\"\nEverybody in the room murmured again. As Leo had just been marked as a criminal due to his recent deed, Yan Xiang and the backers of the imperial family hated him. Hearing that he would run into the deadly mushrooms first, some of the men secretly smirked.\nBut there was an issue.\nYan Luo, the first prince, also attended the meeting. He pointed out the loopholes of their vague goal.\n\"What if Florida Man escapes? He can just avoid the mushrooms and flee to the other continents, right?\"\nSitu Bai grinned, \"That won't be possible. Our spies have discovered that the people of Life Sword Sect and Amazonian Sanctuary are now working for him.\"\nThe listeners nodded as they got the same information as well. Although they didn't get this information from Tang Xuan, they once sent spies to check Leo's movements from time to time. Although they failed to infiltrate his domain, observing everybody from afar was enough to get that piece of information.\nSitu Bai continued, \"We believe that the criminal has taken both groups as his vessels. Since the commoners of the Magpie City can't move as fast as cultivators, I don't think Florida Man's subordinates will abandon their hometown. They will surely force Florida Man to either protect them or abandon them.\"\n\"And you're certain that Florida Man will protect those people?\" Yan Luo raised his brows in amusement.\n\"Yes. He has no choice if he wishes to stay on this continent for a long time. If he ditches his subordinates, his reputation will take a huge hit. After that, he will be isolated among all sects, which is not ideal for someone who randomly opens a shop in the wild. He needs customers, and he needs us.\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang glared at Situ Bai. He disliked the idea of relying on Leo. He deeply inhaled and voiced his thoughts.\n\"What if Florida Man fails to remove the mushrooms?\"\nSitu Bai shook his head, \"Then, he is incompetent, and he deserves to die from the mushroom poisoning.\"\n\"Right. What about the mushroom suppression?\"\nSitu Bai widely grinned. He revealed the existence of his clan's ancestor.\n\"One of our ancestors is coming home to spectate the upcoming youth tournament. Once he arrives, we will ask him to help us remove the deadly mushrooms.\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang nodded. He also contacted his father, but he never told anybody. He kept this piece of information a secret to himself for now as he planned to use his father to kill Leo in case everybody failed.\n\"Alright. Then, what about the jiangshis? Hua Guanhai and his Death Sword Sect's people got infected, right? How do we deal with those men?\"\nSitu Bai affirmed, \"Of course, we'll pit them against Florida Man.\"\n\"How do we do it?\"\nSitu Bai confidently brought out a cyan pill from his pocket. As soon as it came out, the pill hovered over his palm. It also emitted a strong presence of a rare elemental Qi.\n\"This is my new creation, the Garuda Tornado Pill! If I crush this pill, a strong tornado will be summoned, and I can manipulate it at will because I have mastered the wind element. I can trap Hua Guanhai and jiangshi of the Death Sword Sect with this and send them to Florida Man's doorsteps!\"\nThe crowd was astonished. Some of them praised Situ Bai out loud.\n\"Brilliant!\"\n\"Such insight! As expected of the Situ Clan!\"\nYan Xiang and Yan Luo also approved the idea. The former quickly permitted him to put his idea into action.\n\"Situ Bai, since you've proposed the idea, you will be in charge of sending Hua Guanhai to that criminal's store. Also, if anything goes wrong, you will take full responsibility!\"\nSitu Bai smirked. He bowed 90 degrees, \"This servant will not fail you.\"\n.\n.\n= Meanwhile =\nLeo was bored. After the incident with Esen and the waterfall, he had been helping the mannequins chop iron pine lumbers as nobody could do it.\nOne of the alchemy workshops also changed its priority. Leo stopped making more tea as he assigned it to make sacred wood instead.\nAfter the alchemy workshop turned the useless lumber into blocks of sacred wood, Leo transferred them to the gunsmith and ordered the automatons to make new bullets and guns, using the materials.\nThe gun production proceeded nicely. Even though the mannequins could only make outdated matchlock rifles, they were enough to arm more men or be used as spare guns.\nWhile Leo was busy working as a carpenter, his sensitive nose caught a scent of something sweet. He stopped working and looked north.\n\"…\"\nLeo had long forgotten about this scent. But as soon as he smelled it, he finally remembered where he last saw the source of this odor.\nSweet Dream Mushrooms!\n\"Ah, those things. I haven't used them in alchemy yet because of Hua Jiashan. I wonder if I can make a secret workshop in the mall or a basement somewhere to experiment with the new recipes.\"\n.\n[Pill Recipe – Hope and Dream Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yang Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n[Pill Recipe – Determination Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yin Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n[Traits]\nIncrease Lifespan by one year per gram (Consumption)\n.\nLeo never forgot about it. These recipes had been his regrets since Hua Jiashan and Wu Buyi forced him to remove the mushrooms from his workshop.\nSince a new source of mushrooms appeared, it would have been a waste for Leo not to check it out. He put aside his job and put on a new hazmat suit. He also purchased 10 4-foot-tall plastic barrels to store the ingredients.\nPOOF\nTen plastic barrels came out. However, they weren't safe enough for a chemical weapon, such as the zombie mushrooms.\nLeo used the same old trick by touching the new plastic barrels and thought about upgrading these containers.\nDING\n<Will you upgrade Plastic Barrel to Level 2?>\n<Upgrading it will consume 1,000 years of your lifespan.>\nThe barrel itself only cost Leo one year of lifespan, but upgrading it required a lot more.\nAs Leo had no issue with lifespan at the moment, he ordered the system.\n\"Upgrade it to level 9!\"\n<Affirmative!>\nThe barrel shapeshifted as its material drastically changed. As if the system understood Leo's purposes, it changed the barrel to suit the future ingredients.\nThe barrels turned into a cubic metal tank while it retained the same height. Its surface glowed in rainbow light, similar to Leo's aura. However, it had no lid or a way to open it.\n\"Huh?\"\nLooking at the cubic tank, Leo scratched his head. He flipped it around, but he couldn't find a way to open it. But then, his imagination taught him how to use the new artifact.\n\"Like this?\"\nLeo thought outside the box and injected his Qi into it.\nCREAK\nThe cubic tank opened a hole on top, revealing the empty space inside.\n\"…\"\nAs childish as he was, Leo jumped into the container and hugged his knees. Then, he touched the surface of the cube.\n\"Close it!\"\nWHOOSH\nThe square hole was closed.\nLeo looked up and widely grinned. He found himself trapped inside a completely sealed cubic tank.\n\"NOICE! Now, open!\"\nWHOOSH\nAs Leo commanded, the box moved like a slime, opening a hole for Leo to come out.\nUnfortunately, Leo's ADHD and his internal thoughts acted up. He touched the bottom of the cube and designed it.\n\"Open here, here, and here. Oh, open this, too. Make room for me! Oh, you're too tall. Can you shrink?\"\nAgain, the cubic tank shrank and reshaped according to Leo's will. Soon, it became a smaller square box. As for Leo, he inserted his legs through the two bottom holes while the cube remained covering his legs as a layer of suit.\nLeo's head remained inside the new peanut-like container. In front of him, a small area turned transparent, allowing Leo to see the outside. From the outside, Leo's suit looked like a bulky spacesuit with a square backpack. However, it had no arms.\nPLOP-PLOP\nLeo moved his legs, and the container moved as well. He laughed as he got the cosplay suit that he dreamt of.\n\"Hehehehe. I am the new imposter! Where are my crewmates?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 144 – Florida Man Accidentally Evaporated Entire Town by Shooting Fireworks While Parachuting. One of the Fireworks Was Genuine 100-ton TNT.\nFLOP-FLOP-FLOP\nIn the custom-made cosplay suit, Leo waddled north. As he didn't tell anybody about the suit, disciples and elders that had been working on the junkyard and Wu Buyi's alchemy workshop stared at Leo in confusion. Even thunder unicorns and the nightmare horses were confused.\nBecause of the system's suit, nobody could sense his aura. Thus, he thought of this creature as one of the weird things that Leo had created.\nEverybody sneaked glances at the local mannequins. As Leo made them, they believed these automatons could recognize the other creations of the same creator.\nTheir guesses were half correct. The mannequins could tell that Leo was inside that suit. As soon as he got close, they stopped working to salute him.\nSeeing the mannequin's reaction, everybody stopped being on guard of the weird suit.\n\"That must be Lord Florida Man. The golems are showing respect to him.\"\n\"Yeah. What is Lord Florida Man doing?\"\nTiger Swordsman found Leo's eccentric behavior amusing. He stopped practicing shooting and followed Leo.\nLeo ignored his robots and kept going north. Soon, he left the domain boundary, heading further toward the unexplored land. He didn't notice that Tiger Swordsman tagged along with him.\nAs walking took too long, Leo began skipping and leaping. His bulky suit hopped like a 2D character in Nintendo games, ignoring the laws of physics.\nTiger Swordsman brought out his flying sword and rode on it. He kept up with Leo's speed without bothering him.\nAfter traveling for a few minutes, both men discovered an area with dense pink fog.\nBeing cautious, Tiger Swordsman stopped proceeding forward. As for Leo, he ignored everything and kept hopping into the pink mist.\n\"…\"\nTiger Swordsman frowned. His instinct cried that he shouldn't go any further. Thus, he let out a long sigh.\n'I should tell the others about this mist. Lord Florida Man might have already detected it, which might be why he is wearing that strange suit. It's too dangerous here.'\nThe muscular elder turned around and returned to the domain. He would tell Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei about the pink mist later.\n.\n.\nAs Leo hopped deeper into the misty forest, the visor, which he had made, started to get foggy. Leo narrowed his eyes as he noticed the movement on the clothes.\nBranches of mushroom spore rapidly grew and latched on Leo's visor. Leo even heard creaking sounds of small objects, which were made by the growing mushrooms trying to eat the suit.\nAside from the growing mushrooms, the wind around Leo was quite strong. He felt like he was near the eye of a tornado as the mist circulated too fast.\n\"Hmm.\"\nNot allowing the mushrooms to break his new suit, Leo kicked the ground and leaped 10 kilometers in one jump. While he was in the sky, he got out of the mist and got a clear vision of the surroundings.\nThe mist was like a mass of clouds that got glued to the ground. They slowly moved from north to south, but they were caught by a whirlpool under Leo.\nIn the eye of the whirlpool was a giant chomper plant, aka Cat. She emitted a yellow electric current, which had the same characteristic as the yellow tribulation lightning bolts.\nLeo smirked and glanced above him. Above his head was a small yellow cloud, which was about to disperse as it used up its power.\n\"Damn Cat. So, you're here nom-noming mushrooms? Well, good for you. At least, you aren't stealing my food.\"\nLeo looked forward, searching for the source of the mist.\nFurther north, a city wall was on the horizon. Leo estimated that he was about to reach another city north of Magpie City and his domain.\nSoon, his leap momentum ended, and he fell to the ground. Leo leaned forward and bent his knees.\nBOOM\nAs he had done this a million times, Leo landed and planted his two feet firmly on the ground. His kneecaps got slightly itchy as the suit was added to the weight.\nLeo put more force into his legs and was about to jump again. But as he looked up, a shadow silhouette of a man charged toward him.\nAs the silhouette got closer, Leo got a clear vision of the man.\nIt was not a man. It was a humanoid creature with a large mushroom replacing his eyes, nose, and everything above his mouth.\n\"REEEEEEEEEEEE!!\"\nThe mushroom zombie screamed at Leo and jumped at him. He bit the rainbow suit.\nCRACK\nUnfortunately for the zombie, its teeth cracked as it failed to break the spacesuit.\nLeo pursed his lips in frustration. He planned to test this suit against real sweet dream mushrooms, but an idiot scratched it. He touched the side of his bulky spacesuit and ordered it to shapeshift.\nThe side of his suit softened, allowing Leo to extend his arms into them and create rubber-like armguards and gloves. However, Leo made it more creative.\nInstead of fixing the arm and hand sizes to fit his, he ordered his suit to distort the arms and hands. He made the gloves bigger, which was as large as the entire spacesuit.\nUsing his large hands, Leo slapped the zombie like how he slapped some mosquitos in summer.\nPA!\nThe zombie splashed blood, guts, and flesh all over. Some of them got on Leo's visor.\nLeo wiped the bloodstain off his visor. However, he took too much time. More mushroom zombies emerged from the mist and jumped him.\n\"Oh, boy. Am I in a zombie apocalypse world or a cultivation world? Make up your mind!\"\nPA!\nPA!\nAs Leo was wary of the mushrooms, he chose not to fight while wearing the Among Us cosplay spacesuit. Using his suit's large hands, he smacked, punched, and slapped zombies that came in his way.\n.\nOne hour later, the zombies kept on coming. Piles of innards and human flesh scattered throughout the pine tree forest along with the rapidly growing mushrooms.\nSweet dream mushrooms devoured the blood and corpses of victims. They multiplied and covered every inch of the mutated pine trees.\nLeo frowned while he scanned through his surrounding area. Noticing the mushrooms on the trees spitting spore, he thought of his domain. He imagined how it would have affected the workers had these zombie mushrooms infected them.\n\"Tsk! Should I burn this entire place down? I didn't create these mushrooms! I'm not responsible for this!\"\nLeo stopped killing random zombies. He jumped up and took off his spacesuit's gloves. After throwing the gloves into his spatial rings, Leo clenched his fists.\nHis cancer cells reacted to Leo's will. They poured fire and lightning essence into his hands. Black electric current leaked out from his skin.\nLeo glanced at his fist. Worrying that he might destroy the planet, he decreased his power by a few gears.\n\"Yellow is enough. Black is overkill. I don't want to destroy this world, my cells.\"\nThe black electric current changed to yellow. Sensing that his Qi and essence returned to his bloodstream, he was relieved.\nLeo's fists were set in yellow flame. The fire didn't harm him. On the contrary, it added a new power to his punches.\nLetting himself fall, Leo descended. He threw his left fist and hit the ground!\nBOOM!\nThe ground cracked and collapsed as if a massive meteor collided with the planet. The land parted way, creating a massive crater and explosion shockwave.\nYellow lightning from Leo's left fist zapped every zombie within 10 kilometers. Yellow fire followed and disintegrated everything, including plants, mushrooms, and zombies.\nThe wave of zombies got petrified first. Then, they crumbled into piles of molten rocks.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\nWhile the flame expanded, Leo heard the scream of Cat behind him. He turned around and looked up from the crater. Then, he saw the massive body of Cat over his head.\nCat's roots and vines were on fire, but the yellow flame didn't harm her. However, she couldn't extinguish them as the flame reacted to Cat's lightning Qi and her yellow electric current.\nAs if Cat was aware of the culprit behind the shockwave and the flame, she jumped from the previous spot and landed on top of Leo's head.\nBONK\nGetting hit by the massive tree trunk and the massive roots of Cat, Leo groaned. He still didn't notice that Cat's humanoid torso on top of the plant had grown a lot.\n\"Who asked you to play here? Go home!\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow, Munya!\" Cat complained as Leo interrupted her meal.\n\"Don't MUNYA me! I'm here to purge the mist and the zombies!\"\n\"Meow, Meow!!\" Again, Cat bickered that everything was his fault in the first place.\n\"Not my fault. These mushrooms aren't mine.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"Collect them? I'm actually planning to keep some of the mushrooms to grow on some planets later, but these stupid zombies are in the way. Hey, instead of eating mushroom spore, how about you eat those zombies and big mushrooms instead? I need to remove the fog and the wild mushrooms before they infect my slaves.\"\n\"Nom-Nom?\"\n\"…\"\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\n\"FINE! NOM-NOM AS MUCH AS YOU WANT IF YOU CAN! Seriously, I'm gonna clear the zombies up north. You can stay here and eat the corpses!\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nCat jumped away from Leo's head and swung her vines, swiping burnt pine trees and ashes into her mouth. Using her roots as legs, she crept like a massive spider, menacingly stomping and kicking dirt to the sky at the speed of thunder.\nLeo scratched his head and climbed out from the crater. After getting back on the surface, he looked at the bottom again.\nIt was roughly a kilometer deep and ten kilometers wide. The other edge of the crater also reached his domain's northern boundary.\n\"Oh, boy. Those peeps are going to complain about this. Welp, not my fault.\"\nLeo maintained his element essence in his right fist as he hadn't used it yet. He gazed toward the north and kicked the ground, leaping toward the Dragon Mantis City.\nLooking below, Leo bitterly laughed. The massive provincial-sized city was conquered by the mushrooms. Even some of the zombies below were devoured by the growing monsters.\nTraveling deeper, Leo found the massive pink fog gathering in the center of the city. The mist spiraled into a tower, slowly ascending to the sky.\nIn the middle of the spiral, Leo's infrared eyes pierced through the foggy clouds and found a golden mushroom tree. Around the spiral tower of the tree, its roots and foundation were connected to other grown sweet dream mushrooms on top of every roof and house.\nThe golden branch seemed to be an evolved mushroom or its overmind, judging from its roots and the movements of the mist.\nAs Leo approached closer, a new silhouette of a cultivator with a disfigured head shot out from the pink mist. It flew toward Leo, holding a long sword.\n\"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\"\nHua Guanhai cackled. As if he retained some of his memory, the zombie slashed at Leo while it activated its dao avatar ability.\nA spirit of another mushroom zombie appeared behind Leo, carrying an energy sword in its hands. It thrust the sword to pierce Leo from the back.\nSWUA\nSWUA\nThe swords connected!\nCLANK\nHowever, the physical sword of the real body broke in half. As for the energy sword, it failed to penetrate through Leo's spacesuit. Instead of piercing through it, the suit absorbed its energy.\nGetting ambushed out of nowhere, Leo knitted his brows.\n\"Hey, what's your problem?\"\nAnnoyed, Leo used his right hand, which was still coated with yellow electric current and yellow flame, to seize Hua Guanhai's neck.\nCRACK\nMimicking an imposter cracking a crewmate's neck, Leo twisted Hua Guanhai's head 360 degrees. Then, the yellow lightning and yellow flame turned the zombie into ash.\nFWHOOSH\nAs its master died, the dao avatar spirit behind Leo also vanished.\n\"REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!\"\nAs if the death of Hua Guanhai awakened something below, Leo heard multiple loud screams of the living mushroom zombies. A few seconds later, a thousand of them jumped out from the mist and charged at Leo in the sky.\n\"Whoops.\"\nLeo widely grinned as he found the scene funny. He reignited his fire and lightning fist in his right hand while he slowly descended to the middle of the horde.\nThe thousand zombies swarmed Leo in every direction as he fell to the ground inside the city. But as he landed, the fist hit the ground and caused another explosion.\nThe second nuke erupted, and the shockwave disintegrated everything in its path into dust. Zombies were blasted away and burnt to ash while buildings crumbled into dust. As for the mushroom, the mist, and the spore, they vanished into nothingness.\n.\n.\nA few minutes later, the dust subsided. Leo took off his spacesuit and patted his clothes.\nClimbing out of the second crater, Leo inspected the infected city. He then checked the condition of the evolved mushroom.\nEverything around Leo turned into a brown barren land, filled with dirt and dust. However, the golden tree still stood tall, and it continued producing pink mist.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo was surprised that the strange spiral thing was intact after getting hit by his light punch. He stared at the branch for a moment before he came up with an idea.\n\"Can I contain this thing and grow it somewhere else?\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 145 – Florida Man Burnt Alive While Doing TikTok Challenge - Taking a Bath in Active Volcano\nLeo walked closer to the mysterious golden tree. He gave it a closer look.\nThe surface of the golden tree was the same as other sweet dream mushrooms except for its color. It also produced pink mist as it tried to multiply.\nLeo rumbled through his pockets and picked up a blank spatial ring. He put his hand on the golden tree and stored it in the dimensional space.\nThe tree vanished into the ring. However, the pink mist still lingered in the area. Giving it time, they would resurrect sweet dream mushrooms and terrorize this world.\n\"Hans.\"\nLeo uttered and pointed his index finger at the pink mist.\nFWOOSH\nA stream of yellow flame came out from Leo's finger, devouring the pink mist in the area. Leo moved his finger around to torch everything to ash.\nAs Leo kept burning the mist, they faded and vanished. However, he didn't let his guard down as he knew how dangerous they were.\n\"Hans.\"\nFor good measure, Leo sent his Qi into his right foot and stomped it.\nBOOM\nThe ground caved in while the sides got pushed away. Leo created another crater with his stomp, but it had another effect. Everything under him turned into moldy lava as the extreme temperature from the impact and Leo's Qi melted rocks and soil under him.\nThe blasted town sank into the crimson slime-like liquid. As for Leo, his feet sank into the lava until it reached his knees.\nLeo snorted and walked through the lava as if they were regular swamps. He pushed through the heat and got caught on fire once again.\nThe flame did nothing to Leo's hair, skin, or physique, but it removed his fat and impurity from his pores. Leo enjoyed it as if he took a casual sunbath without relying on sunscreen in his hometown.\nThe extreme temperature and the lava melted the remnant mushroom spore away. However, the molten liquid slowly moved and gathered in the crater, threatening to bury Leo alive.\nLeo noticed the wave of lava coming for him. He sighed and jumped, exiting the lava crater. After leaving the crater, Leo checked on his clothes if they were still there.\nFortunately, the new clothes, made from Leo's skin and Qi were unaffected by the flame and the temperature. Even his sneakers were still intact.\nLooking at his jeans and t-shirt, Leo pursed his lips. He was bored of these casual clothes.\n'I should pick up those swags from the cloth shop. But having a long beard and long hair looks weird in a black suit. Should I shave a bit?'\nLeo stroked his beard. He pondered about the shave, and he let his intrusive thoughts take over for a moment. He made a scissor gesture with his index and middle finger. Then, he snipped half of his long silky beard.\nSNIP\nHalf of the long beard fell into the lava pool below. Then, Leo rubbed his trimmed beard.\nUnfortunately, his long white beard instantly regenerated and restored its former glory. Moreover, each string got slightly thicker.\n\"Hah, I knew it.\"\nLeo shook his head. It was as he had predicted.\nAfter the orange lightning tribulation, his body automatically regenerated lost body parts or healed his wounds. Even when he lost a limb or two, he grew them back. However, there was one flaw – His body remained the same as when he transcended the orange lightning tribulation.\nHe could not shave or cut his hair anymore. He had to leave them as they were.\nHaving no choice, Leo thought of tying his hair or braiding his long beard. He thought of ancient Viking portraits on the internet.\n'I should change my looks for once. This might be fun since I have to meet that stupid emperor. I need to bait those idiots to attack my store so that I can steal… no, no, no. Many workers are too weak. If they launch their attacks, those guys will die.'\nUnwilling to let his free laborers die, Leo came up with a new approach. He snickered while he hopped out of the lava swamp, heading back home.\n.\nA few minutes after Leo had left the former city of Dragon Mantis, the swamp of lava changed color from red to black. At first, it looked natural – When magma cooled, they turned into obsidians, cinders, pumice, ash, and dust.\nHowever, as it touched Leo's skin directly and received the blessing of his radiation aura, a hidden bacteria in the lava pool mutated. It devoured hot rocks and random material to grow.\nAs it kept eating, the bacteria multiplied. Soon, they spread everywhere underground and continued consuming lava and random hot minerals.\nUnfortunately, the bacteria had a short lifespan. After staying alive for 10 minutes in the molten liquid, they died and returned to the soil. As they kept dying, they kept multiplying to fight against the impending extinction.\nOne of the surviving mutated bacteria dug deeper into the ground and discovered the buried remains of a badger. It ate some of the rotten meat and multiplied before it died.\nThe bacteria's descendants instantly inherited its ancestor's good and bad traits. As they were born near the buried corpse of an animal, they preyed on the other bacteria and creatures nearby. The newly evolved bacteria absorbed the DNA of the badger. Then, they returned to the lava.\nCRACK\nAfter getting back to the lava pool, the bacteria with badger DNA got in touch with a remnant of Leo's DNA. They evolved again and began forming a physical body, using the badger's DNA as a base.\n12 hours after Leo had left, a small badger emerged from the lava pool. Using Leo's quick generation ability, it mimicked the dead badger's physique and created a new body for itself to survive. However, it quickly died from the excessive evolution.\nMore bacteria ate the dead lava badger and learned from its DNA structure. They tried to copy him and evolved as well.\nMore creatures emerged. Some died instantly after the evolution, but a few managed to survive a few minutes. A trial and error process continued as the newly evolved bacteria experimented with their true potential.\nSoon, a new terrifying monster would be born in the Dragon Mantis City.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo returned home. When he arrived, he discovered the terrible condition of his domain. The northern area of his domain was safe, but it was impossible to expand northward anymore due to the large slope of a crater.\nLeo stood at the edge of the crater and scratched his head.\n'It didn't want to do this. Oh, boy. There goes the northern highway.'\nAfter shaking his head, Leo walked back to his store as he planned to take it easy for the rest of the day.\nWhile walking back, Hua Jiashan, Dongfang Mei, and other elders rushed to see him in panic, especially the sword sect master.\n\"My lord! I heard you went into the mysterious pink mist! Was it a sweet dream mushroom?!\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Yeah, it's the mushrooms.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEverybody's face was as white as a sheet. They froze for a few seconds before they knelt.\n\"P-Please protect us, Lord Florida Man! None of us can remove or repel the sweet dream mushrooms and the Jiangshis. Only you can save us all! We don't want our entire continent to perish!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes as these guys overreacted, \"Meh. Don't worry about that. I've already burnt everything to ash earlier. Don't you see the carnage I left behind?\"\nHe pointed at the crater at the north and the white smoke at a distance. The sky over there was dark as the ash from the magma blocked the sunlight.\nHua Jiashan's eyes glittered. He looked up and brightly smiled, \"Really?!\"\n\"Yup. I nuked them all.\"\n\"YES! THANK YOU, MY LORD!\"\nHua Jiashan squealed and shouted like a madman. He even kissed Leo's sneakers.\nLeo grumbled, \"The show is over. Go back to work. My clothes are still on fire, and you idiot still kiss my dirty shoes? Are you nuts?\"\n\"…\"\nUpon being reminded that Leo's clothes were on fire, the elders finally noticed it. At first, they thought the flame was his aura, so they didn't pay attention to it.\nLeo scoffed and patted the fire off his t-shirt and jeans. He shooed the crowd away.\n\"Scram! Get back to work! This ain't a show!\"\n\"Y-Yes, my lord!\"\nEverybody dispersed in a panic. Still, they secretly laughed as they were happy with how Leo treated his subordinates. After all, Leo was never arrogant or overbearing like other clan lords or sect masters. He might use his paper fans to smack some sense into them, but he never harmed or bullied his men.\nAfter the crowd went away, Leo finally got the time to rest. But instead of heading to his bedroom, he took an elevator to the mystic realm platform.\nGetting on the platform, Leo walked toward the black-winged angel statue. He rubbed the spatial ring that stored the golden mushroom tree earlier and snapped a twig from it. Then, he brought it out.\n\"Meowmeow, do you know what it is?\"\nLeo named the angel statue \"Meowmeow\" out of spite. As the statue had too many beautiful concubines around him, Leo always hated the guy. Still, he was the most knowledgeable servant among the four statues.\nThe angel's eyes glowed in green as it was awakened from Leo's words. He gazed at the golden twig and smirked.\n'That is a twig of the world tree, master.'\n\"A world tree? Are you serious? This came from sweet dream mushrooms!\"\n'Sweet Dream Mushrooms are the origin of world trees, master. Every demon realm has one. I'm surprised that you managed to find one here.'\nLeo frowned. He had doubts.\n\"How did you know that? Aren't you supposed to be my shadow? I don't even know jackshit about this crap, but you seem to know everything.\"\n'I was born from your entity fate crystal and your dao. Obviously, I got my knowledge from the fate crystal that existed long before you were born, master.'\n\"Entity Fate Crystal again…\"\nLeo deeply sighed. The statues already explained to him what it was for, and he still couldn't believe it.\n\"I feel like I'm in the Matrix.\"\n'Not for long, master. You should upgrade your store to level 10. Then, the fun part will begin.'\nLeo deeply sighed as he was depressed. He already figured out what would happen in the next upgrade, and he was not ready for the massive changes. He put this matter to the back of his head.\n\"Anyway,\" Leo changed the subject. \"What can I do with this?\"\n'World Tree's twig is a valuable material for a weapon or alchemy. Instead of asking me, you should research it with the system you have.'\n\"But those guys down there will make a ruckus if they know that I'm keeping an evolved sweet dream mushroom.\"\n'It's fine, master. In fact, you have a subordinate who can suppress the world tree completely and tame it.'\n\"Who?\"\n'Your girlfriend.'\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"I don't have a girlfriend, fool.\"\n'You do now.'\nMeowmeow smirked while his concubines giggled.\nAgain, Leo deeply frowned as he didn't understand Meowmeow. He snorted and stored the twig back in his spatial ring.\nWhen Leo turned around, he found a person behind him.\nShe was a pretty girl in her teens. Her iconic blond hair curled into two small drills, hanging by the side of her pointy ears. Her small lips and glossy skin looked alive as if she was a human. In addition, her green parasite eyes were brighter than a torch as they assimilated with her virgin yin Qi.\nEsen looked like a high-elf aristocrat from a Japanese anime!\nLeo stared at the new look of Esen, the lich empress. He sized her up and whistled.\n\"Heya, brat. Aren't you a looker yourself?\"\nEsen rested one hand on her hips while the other hand covered her mouth. She smirked, \"Ohohoho! How do you like my new appearance? Are you falling for the new me?\"\nLeo glanced down and stared at her chest. Then, he grinned and snorted, \"Grow some milker first, and we'll talk.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen flinched. She glanced at her chest. Although Esen managed to grow taller and bigger, her chest was still as flat as a board.\n\"MUKIIIIIII!!\"\nBeing humiliated, Esen's face reddened. Out of anger, she threw a punch at Leo's face.\nPOW\nInstead of hurting him, Esen hurt her fist.\n\"OW! DAMMIT, GEEZER! What the hell is wrong with you?!\"\n\"That's my question, brat. Who asked you to punch me?\"\n\"…\"\nEsen's eyes got teary as she failed to get back on Leo once again. She stomped away and jumped off from the platform.\nA few seconds later, Leo heard a loud commotion below and a scream from Gao Yan. It seemed that Esen took her anger on the poor guy.\nLeo snickered and shook his head. He looked back at Meowmeow.\n\"Her? My girlfriend?\"\nThe angel shrugged, 'You suit each other.'\n\"Not in a million years, dumbass. She's not my type. I want MILF, not a snotty brat!\"\nMeowmeow widely grinned as if he was looking forward to seeing Leo's reaction in the future. However, he kept the secret to himself.\n'You'll see, master. My prediction is never wrong.'\n\"Sure. Sure.\"\nLeo jumped off the platform and descended toward the alchemy workshop. He had some work to do regarding the sweet dream mushrooms and the world tree.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 146 – Florida Man Defends Bullied Man from Angry Karen by Using Mushrooms, then Mocks Her for Having \"Saggy\" Genitalia.\nLeo came down to the alchemy workshop area. He waited for one of the workshops to be available as he needed to research something.\nWhen a workshop finished making a new batch of pills, Leo stopped the mannequin from continuing the work. He dropped a twig of golden world tree into the pot and researched it.\nDING\n.\nTwig of Sweet Dream World Tree\nThis twig was collected from the Sweet Dream World Tree, which could only be found in a mushroom-infested mystic realm. As it inherits a strong hallucination poison from the world tree, it can be used to upgrade cold weapons or ammunition.\nIf you have a smith workshop, you might find a better usage from this.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Ammunition Coating]\nOne Hundred of Any Ammunition\nOne Twig of Sweet Dream World Tree\nOne Earth Element Catalyst\nEarth Essence\n[Alchemy Recipe – Weapon Coating]\nOne Cold Weaponry\nOne Twig of Sweet Dream World Tree\nOne Earth Element Catalyst\nEarth Essence\n.\nThe recipe was nothing special as Leo got the information from the alchemy workshop. He was slightly disappointed.\n'What's the point of adding a hallucination effect to weapons and ammo? Confuse them? Eh, I'm not into that kink.'\nDespite the thought, Leo rubbed his spatial ring and secretly snapped another piece of twig from the mushroom tree. He added it to the cauldron along with a dented flying sword that he had used to demonstrate a tactical suit the other day.\nThe mannequin seemed to understand Leo's intention. He rushed into a granary and fetched a golden sand banana for Leo to use as an Earth element catalyst.\nAfter getting all the ingredients, Leo closed the lid and spat into the fireplace as usual. Then, a timer appeared.\n59 Minutes, 58 Seconds\nLeo was relieved as the timer was extremely short. With this speed, he could experiment with random weapons that he had stolen from dead cultivators.\nHowever, there was one problem. Had Leo brought out more twigs in the open, those twigs would automatically produce mushroom spores.\nHe needed someone to either suppress the mushroom spores or contain them.\n'Right. Meowmeow mentioned I should ask Esen for help. I should go find her.'\nLeo left the workshop to see Esen next.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen was in a bad mood. After coming down from the mystic realm platform, she visited Gao Yan and Wu Buyi to vent her anger on them.\nGao Yan and Wu Buyi didn't pay attention to her. They were busy studying the pill-making methods from the mannequins.\nUsing the opportunity that both men were careless, Esen stomped toward them. She kicked Wu Buyi's butt and smacked the back of Gao Yan.\n\"You trashy cultivators! No matter how hard you stare at those pots, you won't get better at alchemy! Come and spar with me, and I'll show you how to get better properly!\"\nWu Buyi yelped in pain while Gao Yan's spinal cord was almost dislocated. Both of them were out of commission in one slight attack.\nLooking at the pathetic men, Esen snorted, \"You people are useless. Why is that geezer keeping you around? If I were him, I would have expelled you long ago.\"\n\"???\"\nWu Buyi rubbed his butt and gazed at Esen in confusion. He didn't recognize her as she had changed a lot.\n\"Who are you, little missy? Why did you kick me?\"\n\"Who are you calling missy?! I'm old enough to be your great-grandmother!\"\nEsen kicked Wu Buyi again. The latter screamed as her foot hit the sore spot.\nWhile Wu Buyi got bullied, Gao Yan got back to his feet. He rubbed his back as he was still in pain. Then, he looked at the assailant.\n\"Hmm? Oh. Senior, you've…changed a lot.\"\nGao Yan's face reddened as he found Esen attractive. Her face and blond long hair were so unique that he was at a loss for words.\nHis reaction made Thora angry. She pinched and twisted his right ear.\nGetting pinched out of nowhere, Gao Yan was confused. He screamed in pain and protested, \"What did I do wrong?!\"\n\"Hmph! Getting excited, aren't you?\"\n\"But why are you twisting my ear?!\"\n\"Cause I feel like it!\"\nGao Yan cried as he failed to understand Thora.\nWhile Gao Yan got bullied by his dao avatar girlfriend, Esen turned her attention toward him.\n\"You there!\"\nEsen had long examined Gao Yan's talent and potential. She believed that his potential was on par with Yao Qiqi and Cat. However, he didn't have a proper mentor to guide him. As a result, Gao Yan's combat foundation was extremely weak at his cultivation base.\nHe lacked real experience in combat.\nEssen walked closer to Gao Yan and stared at him up close. Although she was a head shorter than him, her face and voice made him nervous.\n\"When was the last time you trained in combat?\" Asked Esen.\n\"Umm…\" Gao Yan pondered. He wryly smiled, \"Probably before I became an alchemist? I haven't swung a sword for a long time.\"\n\"So, you've become a nascent soul cultivator, but you have never fought anybody at all? Wait, what was your cultivation base before you became an alchemist.\"\n\"… First stage, senior. The muscle tempering realm.\"\n\"You WHAT?!\"\nEsen screamed in front of his face. She pinched his left ear to pull him closer to her.\n\"Are you an idiot?! You have never sparred against anybody at all since then?!\"\n\"OW! OW! OW! PLEASE STOP PINCHING ME!\"\n\"This won't do! You know what? Throw away all your alchemy schedule! I'll be your sparring partner from now on, and I'll personally teach you how to fight! Aren't you the representative of the upcoming tournament I heard?\"\n\"EH!?\"\n\"Don't EH me! Now, come with me! Bring out your stupid artifact sword so you can train with it! I'll be using a tree twig somewhere as a sword, and I'll spar with you! COME HERE!\"\n\"What? Wait… DAAAAAAAHHHH!!\"\nEsen didn't wait for Gao Yan to speak or react. She dragged him by the ear, pulling him to an empty plot, east of the domain. Then, she started smacking him with an iron pine twig, which was harder than a regular pine log.\n.\n.\nLeo came out from the alchemy workshop street and stood in front of his store. He looked around, searching for Esen.\n\"OW! OW! OW!\"\nGao Yan's loud cry came from the east. Leo furrowed his brow as the dude was loud.\n\"Is he delivering a baby or something? Man, dude is squealing harder than Japanese AV actresses.\"\nLeo laughed at Gao Yan. He walked over to see the commotion as he had no urgent job to do.\nUpon getting closer, Leo found Esen and Gao Yan. The latter cackled as she smacked the poor young man with a twig.\n\"PLEASE STOP, SENIOR! I GIVE UP!\" Gao Yan raised his lightsaber to parry the twig. However, he was too slow as Esen masterfully rotated her wrist and hit his chest.\n\"Stop closing your eyes when you get hit, idiot! Open your eyes and look at me!\"\n\"B-But it's scary!\"\n\"Aren't you a swordsman?! What happened to your basic sword skill? Are you a clown or a performer with a sword?!\"\nGao Yan was depressed. He had a main character's mindset, which prevented him from hitting or fighting women, especially attractive girls like Esen.\nLeo observed the two and smirked. He picked a place to sit and brought out another gold branch of the world tree. Then, he chewed on it as if it was a piece of cookie.\nCRUNCH-CRUNCH\nFrom Leo's perspective, the mushroom tree was as hard as an ice cube. Upon being crushed, it melted in his mouth and turned into fresh earth element essence and life force.\nDING\n<You have eaten a Twig of Sweet Dream World Tree.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 250 years.>\nLeo raised his eyebrows and grinned. He looked at the twig in his hand and continued eating it.\n'Instead of using them to coat bullets, I should eat them instead. But if I keep eating them, I won't have enough twigs for alchemy. I need to find a place to grow this tree.'\nAs Leo remembered what he was here for, he stood up and interrupted the two.\n\"Esen, you free?\"\nEsen stopped hitting Gao Yan. She turned to Leo and glared at him, \"What do you want?\"\n\"I need your help.\"\nHearing that Leo needed her help, Esen widely grinned. She tossed away the twig in her hand and strode toward him.\n\"Ohoho. Finally, the invincible geezer shows some weaknesses. What is it, then? What kind of help do you need from the powerless me?\"\nLeo didn't notice the sarcasm. He brought out a twig of sweet dream world tree to show Esen.\n\"Can you control the spore or contain it with your power? These spores can somehow turn people into zombies. You're a lich, right? Can you tame mushroom zombies or the mushroom parasites?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nEsen's smile faded from her face. She looked at the twig as she sensed a scent that belonged to her race and the other undead creatures. She sniffed it and pulled it off Leo's hand.\n\"Where did you get this? Why do you have a twig of undead tree?\"\n\"Oh?\" Leo was delighted as Esen seemed to know something about the tree, \"Can you control it?\"\n\"Who do you think this empress is?\" Esen puffed her flat chest. She waved the twig around, creating a trail of golden sparks. \"I can't call myself empress if I can't use this simple herb!\"\n\"Herb, you say?\"\n\"Yes, herbs! This is nothing but our staple food! My death knights and arch liches loved this. We ate these for breakfast!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Say, where did you find this? Can you grow some on your farm? I don't want to eat yin vegetables. They smell like rotten fish.\"\nLeo didn't know what to say. He probed her with another important question.\n\"What about the spores? Can you do something about them so everybody here won't become undead zombies because of those?\"\n\"Oh, that's simple!\" Esen giggled as she was confident, \"The spores usually come out from the undead trees and mushrooms whenever they feel threatened. But when you have at least one big undead tree and four smaller ones around it, all mushrooms usually stop producing spores.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLeo learned something interesting. He snapped a few more twigs and gave it to Esen.\n\"I have a fledging BIG TREE that you spoke of. Can you somehow turn those twigs into SMALL TREES?\"\n\"HAHAHAHA! This is too simple! Let me show you weakling how it's done!\"\nEsen carried four twigs to the empty plowed land south of the farms. Leo also followed after her to see how she would do to the deadly twigs.\nAs if Esen copied Leo's alchemy technique, she spat on the twigs and planted them in the ground. She placed them in a square formation, leaving the center area empty. Then, she pointed at the twigs.\n\"Pee on them.\"\n\"…Wut?\"\n\"Undead trees require a living creature's urine to grow. Without the urine, they can't grow leaves and graduate from being mushrooms. If you don't want them to spread spores, you have to pee on them.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo was speechless. He walked toward the nearest twig and was about to unzip. However, Esen stood in front of him, gazing at his face.\n\"Erm, excuse me?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Privacy, please.\"\n\"Ha! Why are you being shy? Do you think I'm interested in your limb dick?! I'm already 10,000 years old. I've seen so many dicks in my life!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. Instead of urinating on the twigs, he pointed his finger at them and ordered his cell to spray impurity and dead cells onto the plant.\nZAAAA\nA stream of black water was poured on the golden twig.\n\"…\"\nEsen frowned as she was taken aback. She sniffed at the black water, but she quickly covered her nose in disgust.\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! HOW COME IT SMELLS LIKE HOLY WATER?!\"\nLeo cackled, \"Holy water? Woman, you have never seen REAL holy water!\"\nHe proceeded to water the other three twigs. Then, he spat on every plant to boost their mutation and growth rate.\nAfter he put in his effort, he brought out the sweet dream world tree and planted it at the center of the formation. Leo then grinned.\n\"Your turn. Make sure you contain the spores or disable the spread.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen frowned as she still had countless questions Leo managed to create holy water. She spat at the world tree's trunk and slapped it a few times. Then, she fiddled with her skirt.\nBefore Esen pulled down her panties, she glared at Leo.\n\"Privacy, geezer.\"\nLeo widely grinned. He mimicked Esen's voice earlier.\n\"Ha! Why are you being shy? Do you think I'm interested in your saggy crack?! I'm already 50,000 years old. I've seen them a lot in my life!\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "Chapter 147 Florida Man Earns Millions by Forcing Teen to Eat Black Matsutake Mushroom with Cheese\nChapter 147 – Florida Man Earns Millions by Forcing Teen to Eat Black Matsutake Mushroom with Cheese\nAfter setting up the array, four transparent walls emerged from the ground, trapping the pink spores and the growing world tree inside. The small twigs emitted strong elemental essence and fueled the array as if they were batteries.\nEsen wrote unreadable words on the transparent walls, causing the array to shine. She then explained what she did.\n\"This will prevent the sweet dream mushrooms from spreading outside the array and limit the tree's growth. It's a temporary measure, though.\"\n\"Temporary? Not permanent?\" Leo didn't like what he heard.\n\"You can't simply tell ants to stop reproducing. Even though we can limit their area of influence, we can't stop their growth completely. Look, geezer. Every tree, plant, flower, and fruit all have the same origin. Their ancestors were fungi. Look at how tree branches and roots grow and spread. Don't they look like mushrooms?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had no comment on that as he was not Neil deGrasse Tyson or a modern scientist. He slightly opened his mouth as he was enlightened.\n\"Because we can't stop the fungi from multiplying, we can only prune them. Well, in my era, we can just simply eat away those excess mushrooms. But in your case, heh, I doubt you can eat it.\"\nLeo pursed his lips, \"You sure?\"\n\"No man can survive after eating it! I dare you, geezer. Go ahead and eat it. Then, you will become a mindless Jiangshi!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo shrugged and walked into the array. His body phased through the invisible wall as they couldn't prevent him from entering the restricted zone.\nEntering the mushroom farm, Leo walked closer to the planted world tree. It rapidly grew taller and bigger. On its trunk, pink mushrooms rapidly grew.\nLeo ignored the pink mushrooms. He gazed at several dark spots on the golden tree as new mutated mushrooms emerged one after another.\nHe picked up a black mushroom with white dots on its head. It had the same shape as matsutake mushrooms, but it looked poisonous.\n'New specimen? Welp, research, it is.'\nLeo put the mushroom in his spatial ring to contain it. Then, he pulled a pink mushroom from the world tree and ate it.\nIt smelled like truffles! He chewed it in glee and savored the rich taste.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1 year.>\nThe lifespan reward was disappointing. The only thing good about these mushrooms was the taste. They were a lot better than bland mutated vegetables and bananas as Leo grew sick of them.\nLeo drooled. He then smacked his forehead.\n'I shouldn't have listened to Hua Jiashan. I should have cultivated these mushrooms from the start! I could even make several luxurious dishes with these!'\nHe regretted removing the previous batches of sweet dream mushrooms. He wished that he should have let them grow inside the workshop.\nAddicted to the rich taste and the rewards, Leo began plucking mushrooms from the golden tree and stuffed them in his mouth. His hands never stopped moving as he swiped every mushroom in his reach.\nEsen stood there, staring at the weird scene in a daze. She was puzzled.\n\"Huh? Is he infected?\"\nCurious, Esen walked closer to Leo to check his condition.\nBut Leo suddenly turned around while one of the pink male-genital-like mushrooms was still in his mouth.\n\"Wut? Want some Non-Nom?\"\n\"…\"\nEsen paused for a long time as Leo's expression was weird and vulgar. But when she regained her senses, Leo already finished 50 pieces of matured mushrooms. She even saw him put a long black fungi into his mouth.\nLeo didn't think much of it. He bit the tip off and chewed the mutated mushroom.\nThe pink tasted like truffles, but the mutated one tasted like hot cheese and cooked truffles.\nIt was delicious!\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\nThe boost was not rewarding, but it filled his stomach. Moreover, the smell of hot cheese was never wrong.\nAfter finishing the first black mushroom, Leo plucked the third one and was about to eat it.\nHowever, an intrusive thought and Leo's ADHD acted up. He looked at the thick black mushroom for a moment. He secretly cut the tip, and a drop of white juice leaked. He grinned and pointed it to Esen's face.\n\"Here, wanna eat it? This one is very good.\"\n\"Huh? What is that? I've never seen sweet dream mushrooms in that color.\"\n\"Here, put it in your mouth. It tastes like cheese.\"\n\"What is cheese?\"\n\"Try it first. Open wide.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen realized that Leo was never affected by the mushrooms. She frowned and stared at the fungi. Although she wished to question Leo how he was immune to the mushroom's parasites, her desire to taste a new food overwhelmed her. She opened her mouth and showed her tongue.\nLeo chortled like a villain before he shoved the black long mushroom into her mouth. Then, he squeezed it.\nSPLASH\nThe white juicy liquid in the black mushroom got pushed to the tip. Then, it released the sticky cheese liquid into her throat.\n\"MMM!\"\nThe scene looked straight from a hentai or a porn movie. Leo cackled to the point that he rolled on the ground and laughed in tears.\nMeanwhile, Esen choked. She coughed and spat some of the mushroom cheese from her mouth. Then, she threw the half-eaten mushroom at Leo.\n\"BASTARD! WHAT DID YOU DO?!\"\n\"DAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\"\nLeo pointed at her flushed face. He mocked her.\n\"You look very sexy, brat! You should star in AV movies! I bet Epstein and his customers would love it!\"\n\"What the hell are you talking about?! Wait… Dammit, geezer! You bully me again!\"\nEsen screamed at Leo and kicked his butt several times. Although her kick did nothing to him, Leo feinted getting hurt and then ran away from her.\nAfter Leo had run away, Esen snorted. She turned her attention to the other black mushrooms on the tree.\n'What's so funny about the mushrooms? It's delicious, though.'\nNot understanding the references, Esen plucked a black mushroom to eat it, but she put the tip into her mouth first. Then, Esen started sucking the cheese out before eating the entire thing.\nShe didn't realize that Gao Yan had been watching their interaction, and his face was as red as tomatoes.\n.\n.\nWith Esen's help, the domain got a new manmade farmland, aka the mushroom farm. Although it consisted of a tall golden tree and four short twigs, it continuously produced sweet dream mushrooms and mutated mushrooms every few minutes.\nEsen got a new job. She was in charge of managing the mushroom farm and the world tree. Leo ended up giving her an upgraded barrel, and he taught her how to use it.\nAfter learning the applications of the new cube, Esen played with it. She followed Leo's instructions and created a new crewmate spacesuit to wear. Then, Leo gave her a newly upgraded container for her to collect or store the mushrooms.\nJust like that, Leo gained the first official crewmate to join his cosplay party. Esen painted her suit yellow to match her hair color while Leo continued using his rainbow suit.\n.\n.\nLeo hummed as he brought a few sweet dream mushrooms and the black ones to the workshops.\nOne workshop continued working on dantian pills. Another one was still busy with the Floridian Dantian Pill. As for the third, it was idle.\nLeo had ordered the mannequin to make something from the world tree twig, but he didn't give it a new order. As a result, after the workshop finished making the product, the local mannequin waited for Leo to replenish the ingredients.\nHe went to the workshop and picked up the finished product. He checked the result.\n.\nCugatti, the Flying Sword of Living Death\nThis flying sword has been merged with the Twig of Sweet Dream World Tree. Any opponent being inflicted by this word will be branded with the Undead Curse – The victim will undergo a mutation and die while their consciousness will be controlled by the curse.\n.\nIn short, Leo could use it to turn others into zombies!\nLeo smacked his lips. He found it silly as he never intended to use it as a weapon.\nHe still had a pistol. A Floridian like him didn't need anything else but bigger guns!\nSince Leo had no intention of continuing to use this sword, he looked around, wondering if he could see it to somebody. Then, he came up with an idea.\n\"Right. I can put this in my store as merchandise. The guns, too!\"\nLeo kept the sword to himself for now. He didn't forget what he came here for.\nBringing out the black mushroom, Leo tossed it into the cauldron and researched it.\nDING\n.\nTrue Death Mushroom\nCan only be found in demon realms. This mushroom's spores can strip a cultivator's immortality and life force if the cultivator doesn't have virgin yin or virgin yang essence in their dantian. Can be used in alchemy.\n[Alchemy Recipe – True Death Poison Pill]\nOne True Death Mushroom\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nOne Drop of Virgin Yin Blood\nOne Drop of Virgin Yang Blood\nWood and Earth Crystalized Essence\n.\nThe recipe looked normal, except for the essence part and the catalysts. It didn't require an element catalyst like the others, but it demanded crystalized essences.\nLeo wasn't confident that he could make this pill any time soon as the crystalized essence was new. For the moment, he took notes of the recipe. Then, he checked for a recipe that required sweet dream mushrooms as a material.\n.\n[Pill Recipe – Hope and Dream Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yang Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n[Pill Recipe – Determination Pill]\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nTen Yin Catalysts\nFire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood Essence\n.\nLooking at the recipes, Leo remembered something. He recalled that he once ordered his mannequin to make the hope and dream pill, but he forgot about it.\nAs the mannequins either stored their finished pills in the warehouse or the workshops, Leo searched for the pills. It wasn't hard to find the finished products as they were kept separately in a Tupperware box.\n.\nMedium Grade Hope and Dream Pill\n- Heal Medium Wounds\n- Restore 300cc of Blood\n- Restore Stamina by 30%\n- Enhance Qi and Physical Strength for 3 Hours\n- Induce Sleep for 3 Hours\n.\nFor the first time, Leo received a proper healing medicine. With this, he no longer needed the elixir grain pills, which had too many side effects.\nHowever, this pill's effects were questionable.\n\"What's the point of the buff if you will put someone to sleep?! Is this Sleeping Zenitsu pill?!\"",

After all, all workshops had the same setting.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 9\nActive Cauldrons: (1/5)\nAlchemist Automatons (1/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5)\nProduction Quantity Level – [2/5]\n.\nLeo regretted putting two points to the quantity level. Had he put those points to active cauldrons, he would have increased the production speed by 200%!\n'Should I upgrade my store to level 10? But if I do that, the system protection is going to be…'\nHe deeply sighed. He wished that the threat was just a joke. Thus, he walked to the general store and touched the wall, prompting it to show an upgrade menu.\nDING\n<Would you like to upgrade Humble General Store to level 10?>\n<Warning! Upgrading your Humble General Store to level 10 will unlock the PVP feature and disable your newbie protection domain. Once upgraded, you cannot decrease its level!>\n<Warning! Upgrading your Humble General Store to level 10 will activate Fate Crystal's Main Quests. Please strengthen your base before you start the main quests.>\nLeo closed the menu and grumbled. He thought of the conversation he had with Meowmeow and the other three guardian statues as the new feature was closely related to the entity fate crystal inside him.\n'Damn it all. There's no free meal in this universe. Damn that Entity Fate Crystal! Damn this universe!'\nDuring the past 50,000 years, Leo went through thick and thin. He died and revived several times, and he faced countless tribulations. He should not have been invincible among all his peers.\nHowever, Leo was afraid of the terms \"PVP\" and \"PLAYERS\". He hated the idea that there might be somebody else with a similar system or strength as his.\n'Should I enable it, or should I delay it for now?'\nLeo slowly opened his eyes. His expression turned cold as he thought about a potential war between his people and the unknown forces of PLAYERS.\nAs he had a new goal in his mind, he moved according to his urgent need. Leo rushed to the warehouse and scoured for swords, blades, knives, and other weapons. After fetching a dozen long swords and scimitars, he gathered them in front of the alchemy workshop.\nLeo stared at his workshop for an hour. He repeatedly sighed as he was in the middle of making a harsh decision.\nAfter an hour of long thought, Leo rechecked his lifespan pool.\n<Current Lifespan: 458,443 Years…>\nLeo splurged a bit as he purchased so many modern cars to decorate his store. Still, he replenished some of them back from random caimans that fell from the flying platform.\nHe wanted to save up until he had a million years. However, his patience ran low as the workshops took too long to make pills.\n'Screw it! I'll save up for a few more days. After that stupid tournament, I'll think about it again.'\nLeo managed to suppress his intrusive thoughts. He killed time by bringing out the crashed Ferrari car to practice controlling it.\n.\nSCREEEEECH\nThe enhanced vehicle beamed like a missile, circling around the road course. The loud engine noise and the screeching tires distracted the disciples on the farm and the junkyard.\nHua Jiashan and other elders admired the vehicle from afar as they mistook it as a modified carriage for land travel. They quickly got bored and returned to their duties, cultivating and completing their daily tasks.\nWhile the workers slowly got used to the new ambiance of their workplace, a certain alchemist disciple had bad luck.\nGao Yan, whose combat and cultivation foundation was the weakest among nascent soul cultivators, was forced to take combat lessons.\nIn front of him, Esen held an iron pine branch as if she was holding a sword. As for Gao Yan, he stood nearby, mimicking her posture.\n\"This sword technique is called Terra Swordsmanship. It originates from the Kingdom of Merroc, the home of divine knights! Its strongest point is the firm and minimal movement! Watch carefully!\"\nGao Yan gulped. Although he used to practice the sword saint's weapon techniques from the stone mural, he was interested in this pretty woman's refined sword arts.\nWHOOSH\nEsen changed her posture. She held the branch close to her head and pointed the sword tip to the sky. Using the starting posture as a pivot, she rotated her weapon and swung it.\nHer range was short, but the momentum never ceased. She swiped, thrust, and slashed like how a spear militia always practiced. However, her feet barely moved from the starting position.\nDespite the simplicity of the sword art, each strike from her carried a dao and sword intent. Her movement left behind sharp cuts in the wind, creating scary sounds.\nAfter demonstrating the first three movements, Esen stopped. She pointed at Gao Yan's wooden sword and ordered him.\n\"Now, your turn.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan took a deep breath and mimicked Esen's movements. However, he was a lot slower than her, and his swing didn't carry enough power of a nascent soul cultivator.\nIn short, he still used the speed when he was a muscle-tempering realm cultivator.\n\"Faster! More momentum!\"\n\"O-Okay!\"\nGao Yan repeated the moves. Even though he pushed his body to move faster, he couldn't command his body to move as he wanted.\n\"AGAIN!\"\n\"Y-YES, SENIOR!\"\nOnce more, Gao Yan tried harder, yet his speed didn't improve.\n\"TOO SLOW! REPEAT IT 30,000 TIMES!\"\n\"W-What? T-Thirty thousand?! That's impossible!\"\n\"Shut it and do it! You're the only combatant among the representatives! The others are tamers, so they don't have to worry about the training. But you, silly boy, you don't know jack shit about a fight between nascent soul cultivators. If you go to the competition right now, you will die 100%!\"\nGao Yan's face was as white as a sheet. Although he used to practice the sword saint's technique a few thousand times a day, 30,000 times was a scary number.\n\"Stop hesitating and do it until you drop! You have only less than two weeks to prepare! GET MOVING!\"\n\"Y-YES, SENIOR!\"\nGao Yan cried as he swung the wooden sword in his hand.\n.\n.\n10 Days quickly passed. It was one day before the gathering appointment at the Cauliflower City.\nFive representatives of Leo's domain were ready. Esen, Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, Cat, Taxi, Ricardo, and two girls from the sanctuary brought their belongings and stood in front of Leo's store, waiting for him to take them to the Cauliflower City.\nGao Yan, Esen, Yao Qiqi, and the girls wore the signature tactical suits. Their black clothes, white shirts, neckties, black pants, and leather shoes made them look good.\nCat, Taxi, and Ricardo also got their new clothes. Cat received a green dress, which covered her humanoid torso on top of the big mouth below her. As for the nightmare and the unicorn, Leo equipped them with a saddle, a saddle blanket, stirrups, cinches, bridles, and reins.\nEverybody seemed ready, but Leo was dissatisfied.\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo sized up Gao Yan and others. He wasn't worried about Yao Qiqi and the two extra tamers as Cat and the horses would do the fight for them. He was more worried about the teenager.\n\"How is your preparation going? I saw you trained with Esen in the past two weeks. Are you confident?\"\nGao Yan slouched and let out a long sigh. He then shook his head.\n\"I don't know, senior. In the past 10 days, Senior Esen only taught me three basic movements. I don't think I'm ready to fight any nascent soul cultivator.\"\nHua Jiashan and other elders were in the area. When they noticed that Gao Yan had no self-confidence, they laughed at him.\nWu Buyi smacked the teenager's back.\n\"Look, my silly disciple. Nobody in the tournament will have the same cultivation base as you! At best, a few golden core cultivators from the Situ Clan, Ouyang Clan, or the Imperial family will show up. There's a huge disparity between a golden core cultivator and a nascent soul cultivator. As long as you utilize your dao avatar well, you can't lose!\"\nHan Hao nodded in agreement, \"He's right. There's no way that you can lose. You can use your dao avatar, right?\"\nGao Yan flinched. Then, he sneaked glances at Thora, who had always been following him around.\nThora stuck out her tongue and ensured him.\n'Do you think I'm here for decoration? Be confident, darling.'\n\"…\"\nGao Yan felt a bit better. He then nervously gazed at Leo and Esen.\n\"I-I'll try my best, senior. I won't disappoint you!\"\nLeo scoffed, \"I know. Oh, right. Are you still using that sword?\"\nHe referred to the lightsaber that Gao Yan had. As Gao Yan had been using it, Leo was worried about the battery.\n\"Yes, but I think the energy in my artifact is running out of Qi. The energy sword seems weaker than before.\"\n\"Yeah, I figure as much. Instead of using that, use this.\"\nLeo passed the Cugatti to Gao Yan. The latter received it and sensed a tremendous aura from the sword.\n\"Hmm?\"\nSuddenly, Gao Yan heard a wailing screech from the sword. It sounded as if a haunted spirit inside the weapon wanted some action.\nGao Yan almost dropped Cugatti on the ground. While trembling, he shoved the sword back to Leo.\n\"I-I-I don't think I can use this, senior!\"\nLeo smirked and took it back. However, he tossed it toward Esen.\n\"He's not appreciating a good weapon. Well, you use it.\"\nEsen scoffed and caught the sword with one hand. She ignored the weird noise from the sword as if she was used to it.\n\"Why are you scaring off some powerless banshees and spirits? They're just random noises.\"\nGao Yan was embarrassed. He lowered his head, afraid of looking at Esen's face.\nOn the other hand, the sword elders sweated profusely as they could sense the malicious aura and overwhelming yin element essence in the cursed weapon.\n\"…A cursed weapon. T-That's against the rules,\" Tiger Swordsman's legs were trembling in fear.\nHua Jiashan facepalmed, \"This tournament hosts are going to puke blood after this. Disguising a senior as a teenager is too much.\"\nLeo snorted as he didn't care about the rules. After all, the emperor plotted against him, so Leo had no reason to show respect to the event.\nHe didn't stop there. As Gao Yan rejected his offer, Leo came up with a different idea.\n\"Brat. Show me your artifact. I'll replace the battery real quick.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan was reluctant, but he handed his lightsaber over to Leo. The latter received it and tinkered with it.\nPLOP\nLeo unscrewed a part and shook it a few times. Then, a dimmed essence stone came out. He caught the stone and popped it into his mouth. While chewing the depleted essence stone as a candy, Leo ejected another essence stone and replaced the old one.\nThe stone was also old as Leo took it from a dead cultivator. However, Leo slightly recharged it by rubbing it a few times.\nAfter screwing the part back, Leo flipped the switch and activated the sword.\nBZZZ\nThe lightsaber's energy sword was bright yellow. It emanated the same energy as yellow tribulation lightning.\nLeo smacked his lips before he deactivated it and passed it to Gao Yan. He explained, \"I limit the energy output to yellow for safety. As long as you cut somebody with that, your opponent will instantly turn into a stone or die on the spot. Make sure not to cut yourself, though.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan gulped. He wanted to complain, but he didn't dare offend Leo.\nLeo didn't stop there. He distributed a matchlock rifle to the girls. Then, he taught them how to use it while he distributed boxes, full of sacred wood bullets.\nThe bullets were custom-made. The bullet heads were made from sacred wood while the bottom was attached to a spirit stone, made from the recycling center.\nAt a glance, the ammunition looked similar to modern bullets as it had a cone shape. However, the sacred wood consisted of two parts – the bullet head and the shell. As for the spirit stone, they were the replacement for gunpowder.\nWith a spirit stone, Leo cut the need for matches and fuses. Cultivators could inject their Qi directly into the chamber and ignite the spirit stone inside, mimicking the chemical reaction of gunpowder.\nMoreover, a spirit stone's explosion was stronger than gunpowder's force and it was reusable. After each shot, the used spirit stone would roll out from the smooth bore barrel, and cultivators could recycle them.\n\"This weapon is also for your self-defense. While your monster fights, you should load the gun like this.\"\nLeo demonstrated how to insert a bullet into the chamber. Then, he pointed the muzzle toward the sky.\nBANG\nThe bullet exited the gun barrel, leaving behind a spit of fire and a light shockwave. It shuttled to the sky at the speed of sound and disappeared.\nThe elders, who owned the same rifles, nodded in admiration. They had been using their toys for a while, and they had seen the new bullets before.\nLeo continued explaining, \"This weapon is simple. Load a bullet, take aim, pull the trigger, and repeat. As long as you're accurate enough, you can kill your opponents from afar. It's also very effective against pedophiles that you might run into in the future.\"\nXu Nuan, Dongfang Mei, and the male elders grinned while Yao Qiqi and the girls looked confused.\nThese girls would soon understand the usefulness of these firearms.",

He got out of the car and let out a sigh of relief. He finally mastered the driving technique, including the flight skills.\nAlthough Leo managed to get used to the new car mechanic and handling, he still sensed a crisis. After all, he needed to bring his people to the Cauliflower tomorrow.\nHe needed a bigger vehicle.\nLeo opened the online shopping system. He put in keywords to search for buses, coaches, and trucks.\nThe vehicles were cheap. As Leo had 450,000 YOL in his pocket, he could afford expensive cars and upgrades. He switched his keywords to luxurious motorhomes.\nThe new merchandise appeared. Leo browsed through the list and compared the prices. Then, he widely grinned.\nThe average price tag of luxurious motorhome buses was only 2,000 years of lifespan. Upgrading one of them to level 9 would cost Leo an extra 16,000 YOL. In short, it was affordable.\nWithout hesitation, Leo picked a double-deck motorhome. Then, the vehicle appeared on the plain, and the bus's remote key manifested in Leo's hand.\nLeo grinned. He touched the double-deck bus and upgraded it to level 9. Then, he waited for the changes.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nSCREECH\nThe bus screamed and screeched as the interior underwent a transformation. A minute later, the upgrades were finished.\nLeo swung his remote key and opened the bus's door. Entering the vehicle, he checked the interior.\nThen, he widely grinned.\n\"Perfection.\"\n.\n.\n= Present =\nEverybody got their toys. They were ready to travel to the Cauliflower City. However, there was one issue.\n\"Umm, senior,\" Gao Yan scratched his head as he didn't see any kind of transportation or vehicle. \"So, how will we head there? Do we fly there ourselves? Our Qi might be depleted when we get there.\"\nLeo had been waiting for this question as he had prepared for this issue. He rubbed his spatial ring and summoned a new vehicle, which he had purchased and upgraded yesterday.\nRUMBLE\nA modern motorhome came out from Leo's ring and landed on the road in front of the store.\n\"Whoa!\" Gao Yan and others dropped their jaws. They had never seen this long and weird vehicle before.\nSome of the disciples had been living on the third floor of the general store, and they had seen Leo's collection on the floor below. However, this one looked weirder.\nThe exterior of the vehicle looked the same as double-decker buses. Its windows and glasses were tinted black, which blended with its black paint. The six tires came with the standard 11R22 (11 inches wide and 22.5 inches in height).\nAt a glance, it looked like a regular commercial bus with a better paint job. However, Leo smirked as he was happy with its interior and hidden features. Leo puffed his chest and raised his nose in elation.\nLeo flipped his bus remote and opened the passenger door.\nFWOOSH\nThe electric door automatically opened and extended its golden stairs to the ground. Leo walked into the bus and called the others.\n\"Esen, bring the kids in here. Ricardo and Taxi can come in later. As for Cat, unless you transform or shrink yourself enough, I'll let you ride on the roof.\"\nCat heard it. She pouted.\n\"Meow, Munya!\"\nAs if Cat understood why Leo wanted her to shrink, she closed her eyes and concentrated.\n\"SMASH!\"\n\"SMASH!\"\nSeveral unicorns nearby encouraged Cat. They raised their front hooves to cheer the plant girl.\nUnfortunately, Cat failed her first attempt. Instead of shrinking, she farted.\nBUUU\nHer fart was deadlier than mustard gas. The crowd screamed and dispersed after the yellowish gas came out from her leaves and branches.\n.\n.\n= An hour later =\nIt took Cat 17 attempts to shrink herself. In the end, she managed to transform into a humanoid form.\nCat's new physique was 4 feet tall. She had long black hair, dark skin, green eyes, elven ears, and a slender build. Despite looking like a 10-year-old girl, her chest size was as big as a woman in her 20s.\nEverything about her resembled a young dark elf, except her legs and her stomach. Instead of having two human legs, she slithered around with her four tree roots. As for her stomach, a massive mouth revealed her heinous fangs. It opened and closed vertically, which terrified everybody.\nIn addition, the two parasitic eyes moved to her shoulders. As for her third eye, it moved to her upper chest.\nA new pretty monster girl made her appearance at long last.\nLeo sized up Cat while the latter waved her arms around and played with her hair. When she noticed Leo's weird expression, she grinned.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Food is in the bus. Get in if you want to test your new mouths.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat giggled. She jumped toward Leo to kiss him. However, she opened the mouth in her chest, which split her body apart. Then, the fangs nibbled his head while a thousand barbed tongues licked his face.\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply grumbled as he needed to educate Cat about her weird kissing behavior. He felt like she always tasted his sweat and dead skin.\nGetting enough appetizer, Cat stopped licking and sucking Leo's head. She slithered into the bus along with Esen. Then, the crowd followed them inside.\nAfter getting inside, Cat and others found a large interior of the bus. Similar to what happened to the general store, the usable room of the bus was a lot bigger than normal.\nMeasuring from the outside, the bus was 9 feet wide and 45 feet long. However, the interior was a thousand times larger than the bus's real size. The ceiling was 10 feet high, which was a lot higher than the bus itself. This didn't include the upper deck. As for the width and length, they were bigger than their apartment's room.\nBehind the driver's cockpit was a living area. Sofas, chairs, a massive refrigerator, a kitchen, and a cocktail lounge were the main features of this zone.\nEsen and everybody rested in the area. Like little kids, Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, Esen, and the two girls sat on the leather couches and admired the glass chandelier on the ceiling. As for Cat, she went straight to the bar and opened the refrigerator behind it.\nIn the refrigerator, Leo had already stored some mutated vegetables and fresh thunder caiman meat in there. He even kept some of the yin fluid to feed Cat.\nCat immediately plundered the meat and the vegetables. She stuffed her human mouth and monster mouth in glee.\nTaxi and Ricardo also transformed into their humanoid form. They put on the uniform and calmly got inside. When they saw the exterior, they flinched as well.\nXu Nuan and Tiger Swordsman also accompanied them as they were in charge of babysitting Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and the two girls. When they got on the bus, they had the same reaction as Taxi and Ricardo.\n\"Whoa.\"\n\"Wow.\"\nBecause of their expressions and exclamation, the other disciples and elders also peeked inside. Then, they were astonished.\nWu Buyi was the first to break the silence.\n\"Hahahaha! I knew it! Lord Florida Man is the master of spatial distortion arrays. Look at what he has done to his store and other structures. They all have a wider space inside!\"\nHua Jiashan silently nodded. He revealed a faint smile.\n\"I should ask Lord Florida Man to teach us the spatial dao sometimes. A public lecture for us would be nice.\"\n\"Isn't it?\" Han Hao agreed, \"After this event, let's hold a public lecture event for us to share our dao and insight. This will benefit the juniors, too!\"\n\"Agreed!\" Dongfang Mei widely grinned. She was also curious about Leo's abilities and dao.\nMeanwhile, Leo guided the kids to the middle section of his bus.\nIn the middle section, a straight corridor led to the back of the bus. Along the way, private rooms were located on both sides as if they were private rooms on first-class commercial planes. A total of 10 suites were in the middle section of the bus.\nLeo slid a door open and showed the juniors their room.\nInside the room featured a master bedroom, a living room, a bathroom, and a private kitchen – All fully furnished. Each living quarter was bigger than the small house in the domain.\nEsen was the first to check inside. She swept her eyes through the room and frowned. Then, she looked further into the bus and noticed that there was a large door at the end of the corridor.\nLeo noticed Esen's greedy look. He snorted.\n\"Pick a room you want, but you can't take the last room at the back. That's mine.\"\nEsen smirked, \"You're in charge of piloting this thing. You can't rest anyway, so why don't you surrender that room to me?\"\n\"Don't be greedy, brat. This room is already big enough for 4 people to live in! Over there at the end of the corridor, that's my room. My belongings and clothes are already in there.\"\n\"Who cares? Your room must be bigger than these rat holes. I'm crashing in your room!\"\nEsen ignored Leo's order and ran toward the end of the corridor. She reached the back section of the bus and opened the door. Then, she found a new paradise.\nInstead of calling it a ROOM, it should be called a luxurious condominium suite instead.\nThe ROOM featured two floors. This was the only place that allowed the passengers to access the upper deck area.\nLeo's private quarter consisted of a living room, a dining room, a private bar, a fitness center, a spa center, a chef's kitchen, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms - All were furnished and carpeted.\nThe master bedroom was even more absurd. The walls, flooring, and ceiling of this room were made of transparent glass, which revealed blue water and fish on the other side!\nEsen entered the master bedroom and gazed at the swimming fish in the water in shock.\n\"Wait a minute. Why is this room underwater?\"\nConfused, Esen rushed up the stairs to the upper deck. Then, she found a new world.\nAfter climbing up the stairs, she found an Olympic-sized swimming pool on her left side and the floor, made from rocks and marbles. On the right side was an artificial beach, which featured a shallow sea. The waves and the wind were so real that Esen could smell the salt in the air.\n\"WHAT IN THE FREAKING CORPSE ARE THESE?! HOW THE HELL DID YOU STUFF EVERYTHING IN HERE?!\"\nLeo followed Esen to the upper deck. He glanced at the artificial sand and slightly kicked it.\nThe sand scattered everywhere. But when Leo tried to kick the sand into the lower deck, they vanished and reappeared on the beach.\nLeo snickered as he was happy with the settings. At least, he wouldn't need to clean the sand in his room.\nWhile Leo rechecked the quality of the upper deck, Esen ran to the other side of the upper deck. She found the upper deck cockpit, which was connected to the lower deck area.\n\"Hey, geezer!\" Shouted Esen, \"Give me this freaking room!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes for the ninth time. He yelled back, \"There are two bedrooms. Pick one and be done with it. I'll sleep in the other room.\"\n\"DEAL!\"\nLeo let out a sigh of relief. At least, he wouldn't have to deal with this obnoxious hyperactive lich in a human's flesh. He returned to the living quarters to check on the others.\nThe passengers all chose their private rooms. Strangely, Xu Nuan and Yao Qiqi stayed in the same room while the two girls from the sanctuary wished to share a room as well. Only Gao Yan, Tiger Swordsman, Cat, Taxi, and Ricardo got their own room.\nAlthough there were 3 rooms available, Leo had no intention of bringing the others along. He kicked the non-participants out and bid them farewell.\n\"Take care of the domain for me. I'll be back in a few days!\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei saluted, \"We'll protect your domain, my lord.\"\nLeo waved his hand and closed the shutter door. Then, he sat in the driver seat and started the bus.\nRUMBLE\nDespite being a bus, the engine sounded like a jet's engine. Leo put his right hand on the hand console while the other hand fiddled with a flight stick, which was located between his legs. After checking that the flight stick worked as intended, he reached out to grab a microphone. Then, he spoke to it like a captain of a passenger plane.\n\"Dear, passengers. This is Battle Bus FL69's captain, Florida Man. We will take off shortly. Please be seated, check on your seatbelts, and pack up your belongings. Also, I might call this thing \"BATTLE BUS\", but you aren't supposed to parachute randomly. This ain't Fortnite, so glue your asses inside the bus!\"\nLeo's voice echoed in every room and the lounge. The passengers widened their eyes and looked around in confusion as it sounded like Leo was close by.\nWHOOSH\nLeo gently taxied the bus along the road toward the west, making its way to the temporary airfield road.\nAfter making his way to the northeast corner of the road, Leo U-turned the bus until it looked straight toward the road. Then, he warned the passengers again.\n\"Dear passengers. We're taking off in a few seconds. Last chance to sit the hell down, especially you, CAT! Stop eating and sitting still for once! I can see you murdering my backup food in the lobby's fridge from the mirror!\"\nIn the lounge area, Cat was still on her favorite spot – in front of the public refrigerator. She already devoured 90% of the stored food.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"",

      "content": "Chapter 150 – Florida Man Attends Parent's Meeting at Local Middle School While Bringing Adult Toys to Advertise His Store\nThe battle bus took off and flew north at a cruise speed while the crowd below gazed at the bus in admiration. They were proud that their boss was rich enough to sport multiple unique flying ships.\nHan Hao rubbed his chin and watched the departing battle bus.\n\"Come to think of it, Lord Florida Man has many flying ships. One of them parks near the clothing store while the rest are sitting in the main manor. Say, Wu Buyi, do you think we can ask Lord Florida Man to sell us one of those?\"\nWu Buyi sneered at his friend, \"That will cost you several thousand years of lifespan.\"\n\"Hahaha! I wish it was that cheap! Have you been cultivating? Because of Lord Florida Man's essence stones and his yang flame pills, I think my lifespan is over 2,000 years at the minimum!\"\n\"Pfft. How cute. I got so many commission rewards from past sales, and my lifespan is over 3,000! You're nothing!\"\n\"Ha! Keep bragging. I will surpass you and ask Lord Florida Man to sell me precious artifacts and cultivation resources!\"\nHan Hao pouted and went back to the chili farm, where he usually worked and cultivated.\nWu Buyi scoffed and returned to his alchemy workshop. He also had a lot of work to do as he hadn't mastered the alchemy techniques of Leo's workshops yet.\nEverybody's daily life resumed even though Leo wasn't there to see them.\n.\nLeo lightly tilted the flightstick, turning the battle bus toward the north. After climbing the altitude to 10,000 feet above the ground, Leo set the flight course to the Cauliflower City.\nRUMBLE\nThe autopilot mode was activated. The flightstick was locked, and Leo could get out of his seat. He stood up and turned around to see the carnage in the lounge area.\nCat was still there, emptying the entire refrigerator. As for the others, they were still in their rooms.\nLeo approached Cat to look at her new physique up close. However, it was unsightly. The floor was in a mess as Cat spilled so many juices and scattered vegetable pieces outside the fridge.\n\"Look, Cat. If you want to eat, you have to learn some table manners. I'm gonna ban you from eating food straight from the fridge!\"\n\"MYAAAA?!\"\nCat raised her brows and turned around. She glared at Leo, protesting him with her expression.\n\"No manner, no food. Get up.\"\n\"MYAAAA!\"\nLike a selfish cat, Cat resisted. She swatted Leo's hand away.\nLeo widely grinned. He grabbed her by the nape with one hand while the other hand held one of her roots. Then, he lifted her up and rested her stomach on his knee.\nWhile crouching with one knee and putting Cat's tummy on his leg, Leo raised his hand and slapped her cake.\nPA!\nThe sound was crisp. Cat screamed in pain.\n\"MYAAAAA!!\"\nLeo snorted, \"Naughty girl has to be punished! You have been spoiled rotten already. It's time for you to learn how to act like an adult!\"\nPA!\n\"MYAAAAA!!\"\nLeo lightly spanked her only twice. However, both of Cat's butt cheeks swelled and reddened. She even sensed sharp pain from her pelvis as Leo's light spank almost cracked her bones.\nAfter punishing Cat enough, Leo carried her on his shoulder. He closed the refrigerator and brought her back to her room. Then, he tossed the naked dryad to the bathroom and opened a shower faucet.\nZAAAA\nHot water splashed on the naughty dryad. The latter screamed like a panicking monkey.\nLeo pinned her down on the floor and ejected a toothbrush and a toothpaste tube from his spatial ring. After putting the toothpaste on the brush, Leo forcefully brushed her teeth.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\n\"Shut up and brush your damn teeth, you skunk! You smell worse than Surströmming! Until you take a full bath and brush your teeth, I won't let you leave!\"\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\nCat flailed her arms and roots around as she couldn't compete with Leo's strength.\nThe loud noise and the commotion attracted the others. Esen rushed into Cat's bathroom first and found the weird scene.\n\"Oh,\" Esen grinned. She giggled. \"I didn't expect you to be this forceful. Very well, continue.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo ignored Esen's remarks and moved the toothbrush deeper into Cat's mouth. She resisted for a moment before she bit the toothbrush and ate it.\n\"…\"\nLeo pulled out the broken toothbrush and looked at the piece of plastic for a moment. Then, he stared at Cat, who chewed the plastic toothbrush and swallowed everything.\n\"Am I raising a monster girl or a monkey?\"\nLeo deeply sighed and purchased a new \"BRUSH\". This time, Leo got the hardest toilet brush. He even went as far as upgrading them to level 9 to reinforce their strength and durability.\nAs Cat kept swallowing toothpaste, Leo used the extreme measure. He poured the entire tube of content on the toilet brush and shoved it down Cat's stomach mouth. Roughly but surely, Leo scrubbed the dirt and grime off her monster teeth.\n.\n\"MYAAAAA!!\"\nThe bath time continued while Esen and the onlookers laughed at them.\n.\nAn hour later, Cat was scrubbed clean to the point that a layer of her skin was peeled. Her dark skin got lighter while her long hair looked smoother and silkier because of the shampoo and conditioner.\nAs for Cat's teeth, Leo cleaned them so hard that the tartar no longer existed in her mouth. Her gums still swelled from the excessive force though.\n\"…Meow.\" Cat pitifully cried as she felt like she was violated.\nBecause of mental exhaustion, Leo panted. He cleaned Cat with a towel and tossed her to the bed. He then asked Esen.\n\"Help her put on some clothes.\"\nEsen smirked, \"I doubt regular clothes will do. Her primary mouth is on her body. She will definitely eat the clothes.\"\n\"Tsk. Any idea, then?\"\nEsen shrugged, \"Monster girls don't really wear clothes. They will eventually revert to their original form, so there is no need for that.\"\nLeo frowned and glanced at the other onlookers.\nXu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and the two tamer girls were the only ones there. As for the men and the horses, they were too ashamed to stay in the room. After all, Cat in her humanoid form was in her birthday suit.\n\"This is annoying. Welp. If she wants to be an exhibitionist, so be it. Oh, wait…\"\nLeo remembered something. He opened the online shopping system and searched for a set of swimming suits for women. He then snatched a pair of bikinis and put it on Cat for decency.\n\"Meow?\"\nAfter Leo put the swimming bikinis for Cat, the latter frowned as she felt wrong. She sat up and looked at the bras, which acted as a restraint to her monster mouth.\nBefore Cat could eat the bras, Leo warned her.\n\"If you eat that, I'll throw you into the bathroom again.\"\n\"…\"\nCat jumped up and sweated profusely. Then, she repeatedly nodded in fear.\n\"Good. Haiz.\"\nLeo finally finished with the pet's bath. He stood up and went back to the bathroom to pick up the broken toothbrush and other trash.\nWhile picking up the trash, Leo collected the upgraded toilet brush. He pursed his lips as he was vexed with himself.\n'I'm stupid. I can upgrade almost every modern item with my lifespan like how I upgraded the electric appliances and cars. I should have done this earlier and sold these items at a high price!'\nLeo smacked his forehead and put all the trash in a bin. As for the toilet brush, he carried it around as if it was a mace.\nWhen Leo came out of the bathroom, Xu Nuan stared at the toilet brush with sparkling eyes. She pointed at it and asked Leo.\n\"Senior, is that an artifact as well?\"\n\"Oh, this?\" Leo raised the plastic toilet brush and glanced at it. Then, he realized that the material had been changed.\nInstead of being as fragile as a plastic, its handle was as dark as an obsidian. The bristle looked like barbed wires instead of horse hair. Moreover, it emanated cold air and the scent of mint.\n\"Do you need this?\" Asked Leo.\nXu Nuan dryly laughed and saluted, \"If you could sell it to me, I'm willing to purchase it. Please name the price, senior.\"\n\"Eh…\"\nLeo stroked his beard. The brush cost only one year of lifespan. Upgrading it to level 9 took eight more. In short, its original price was 9 YOL.\nA good merchant had to raise the value of his merchandise. Leo jacked up the price.\n\"90 years of lifespan. It's useless, though. Why do you want it?\"\nXu Nuan laughed, \"Actually, this brush looks so sturdy. I can use it to clean my tamed beasts since those guys also hate water. Could you sell it to me?\"\n\"…Sure.\"\nUnfortunately for Leo, they were outside his shop domain, so they could not complete the transaction on the spot. Because of the inconvenience, Leo handed over the brush \"Good.\"\nto Xu Nuan first.\n\"I'll deduct your lifespan later… You know what? I'll put it on your tab, and I'll deduct your wage accordingly. Is that okay with you?\"\nXu Nuan agreed, \"That's very fair. I'll take it.\"\n\"Good.\"\nThe transaction was completed. Xu Nuan got a necessary artifact to deal with her tamed beast while Leo got some profits and a new inspiration for his future products.\nHis brain went into a Super Saiyan ADHD Mode. He simultaneously thought of 256 things at once to come up with a market plan and potential hot-selling products for cultivators.\n'For women, makeups, facial creams, shampoos, conditioners, perfume, shoes, bags, dresses, trinkets, weight loss food, sanity pads… what else? Wigs, hair dyes, decorations, and beautification stuff. I'll check the list later.'\nLeo purchased a pen and a paper to take notes as there were too many items to remember. Then, he listed the men's goodies.\n'Rough men in the medieval era? It should be those – Porn mags, cigars, condoms, booze, flashy cars, viagra, Zaza, KFC, and… dutch wives? Why am I thinking of Andr*w T*te?'\nFood items, such as KFC, were instantly removed from the list as they cost too much. As for other non-food items, their prices were more reasonable.\nMoreover, guns appeared in his mind, but Leo shut down the thoughts as he didn't want to arm outsiders. The firearm technologies were exclusive to him and his people.\n'I should stick with something nonsense. Viagra, maybe? How is the import price tag?'\nLeo browsed the shopping menu and discovered the price. He widely grinned.\n.\nViagra – 10 YOL per tablet\nCigar – 1 YOL each\nCondom – 1 YOL each\nMagazine – 1 YOL each\nWine and Whiskey – 10 YOL each\nMarihuana – 10 YOL per Flower\nTPE Doll – 10 YOL each\n.\n'This will be VERY profitable. Too bad, I can't set up a store outside of my domain. I should seduce those idiots in the imperial court somehow.'",

Wild Anaconda Got Run Over and Shot to Death.\nChapter 151 – Florida Man Equipped School Bus with Mini-Gun and Drove It on Highway. Wild Anaconda Got Run Over and Shot to Death.\nRUMBLE\nThe battle bus flew over the lava field, north of the store domain. Nobody, including Leo, noticed the movements on the ground.\nEvolved bacteria finally adapted to their new physical form. They emerged as lava badgers.\nAs they were newly evolved and created, they lacked the inheritance of wild instincts. As a result, they waved their arms and legs around, playing with their new bodies. They didn't even know how to let out a sound other than groaning.\nAlthough they were relying on their instinct to grow and evolve, one of them strayed from the pack. It moved out of the lava pool and approached Leo's domain to the south.\nAs it got closer, one of the Life Sword Sect's disciples noticed it. He tilted his head and stared at the monster as if he had never seen it before.\n\"A badger? A badger monster?\"\nThe disciple tried to sense the monster's strength by using his Qi. However, he couldn't measure his strength with his cultivation base.\nAs the disciple was not stupid enough to challenge an unknown monster head-on, he rushed to the elders in the area to report.\nMeanwhile, the lava badger heard the voice of the disciple. As it was the first human word it heard, it tried to replicate the voice.\n\"…bA..Er?\"\nA few minutes later, Han Meng rushed over and found the stray monster.\n\"A badger? Boy, you scared us.\"\nHan Meng burst into laughter as he could sense its strength. It was a merely 1st-stage monster, which was weak enough for a 2nd-stage cultivator to keep it as a pet.\nAs it posed no harm to the local disciples, both elders poked the monster and chased it back to the north.\n\"Leave, badger. If you come further, we'll cut you up and feed you to Cat. You don't want to be eaten by a bigger monster, do you?\"\n\"…Ba..Er?\"\nHan Meng paused as he noticed how the badger tried to talk. He crouched and coated his hand with his fire Qi. Then, he petted it.\n\"Are you trying to talk, badger?\"\n\"…Ad..Ger?\"\n\"Yes, badger. Try again.\"\n\"…Bad…Er…\"\n\"Again. Yes. You're a badger.\"\n\"…Bad..Ger.\"\n\"Nice! Again. Speak after me. Bad-Ger.\"\n\"Bad-Ger.\"\n\"Good. A little clearer.\"\n\"Badger!\"\n\"Perfect!\"\n\"Badger!\"\nThe badger looked at Han Meng's face. It revealed an innocent smile.\nHan Meng found it cute. He wondered if he should raise it. However, he didn't know what this monster usually ate.\n\"What do you usually eat? Snakes? Mushrooms?\"\n\"Badger… nake? Room?\"\nAs if the badger got a little smarter, it tried to learn new words. Han Meng was also patient. He sat there to be the badger's playmate.\n\"New words, eh? Watch my mouth. Snake!\"\n\"Sa-nek?\"\n\"You're a fast learner! Again, snake.\"\n\"Snek?\"\n\"Snake.\"\n\"Snake!\"\n\"Nice! Try again.\"\n\"Badger! Sneak!\"\n\"Awesome!\"\nHan Meng continued teaching it new words. He pointed at stuff and taught it how to pronounce the vocabulary for hours.\nWhen the sun slowly turned dark, the badger turned around.\n\"Badger! It's a mushroom! It's a sneak!\"\nThe badger didn't stop trying to talk. It seemed happy as it waved its arms up and down. Then, it ran back to the lava field outside of the domain.\nHan Meng gazed at the innocent monster going back home. He softly laughed as he found this encounter adorable. He then shifted his attention to the northern red field.\n\"Damn. What should we do with that magma pool over there?\"\nAs Han Meng couldn't voice his complaints to Leo, he turned around and headed back to calm the disciples. He didn't realize that he just taught something to the badgers.\nIn the lava pool further north, the badger returned to its pack. It then stood on the magma and taught its friends.\n\"Badger. Badger. Badger. Badger!\"\n\"???\"\nIt waved its arms up and down innocently and smiled. The others noticed their colleague's expression and tried to copy him.\n\"…A..Er?\"\n\"Badger!\"\n\"…Ba..Ge?\"\n\"Badger!\"\n\"…Bad…Ger!\"\n\"Badger! Badger!\"\n\"…Badger!\"\n\"Badger! Badger!\"\n\"Badger! Badger!\"\nOne after another, they learned how to pronounce the first human word. Then, everybody learned more words and mimicked their teacher.\n\"Badger! Badger!\"\n\"BADGER! BADGER!\"\n\"Mushroom!\"\n\"MUSHROOM!\"\n.\n.\nHovering over the destroyed city was Tang Xuan, who came to investigate the emergence of sweet dream mushrooms and zombies. However, all he saw was the magma pools and destroyed the town.\nNo mushroom was in sight - No zombie, no survivor, nothing.\nTang Xuan gazed toward the south next.\n'Did Senior Florida Man do this? I heard the court wanted to pit the jiangshis and Florida Man in a fight, but it seems he wins. No, it's a total obliteration.'\nA faint smile appeared on Tang Xuan's face. He was glad that Leo got rid of the troublesome parasitic mushrooms and the infected. Even though the Death Sword Sect was sacrificed, it was a good sacrifice as the Death Sword Sect belonged to the unorthodox faction.\nWith Fatui Cult crippled and the Death Sword Sect destroyed, the first and the third price would have a hard time recovering their forces. The Ouyang Clan and the Situ Clan would soon take advantage of this situation to expand their power in court. Then, another political infighting would take place.\nTang Xuan sensed an opportunity. He calculated his schemes.\n'The princes are out of the picture. The Pill Union and the World Tree Sect will surely send their best disciples since the threat of the princes is gone. But Florida Man's faction will be the variable of this power struggle. If his disciples win the tournament, Yan Xiang might change his mind. But if Florida Man's disciples somehow died, Yan Xiang and his sons will surely try to prosecute him and initiate an all-out war with their immortal backers.'\nTang Xuan still had concerns about the imperial court and the two clans' immortals. Although Tang Xuan had already contacted his ancestors and asked them for help, he hadn't received a reply from them yet.\nHe was worried for his clansmen. A war would soon break out, and immortals from the imperial court faction would soon arrive. He needed their assistance ASAP.\n'Tsk. I guess it's do-or-die. I'll gamble everything on him. If he loses, my clan will perish. But if he crushes Yan Xiang and his goons, my clan will survive this calamity!'\nAfter making his decision, Tang Xuan turned around and planned to head home.\nVROOOOM\nThe shadow of a flying vehicle suddenly loomed. Tang Xuan looked up and found Leo's battle bus. He was astonished.\n'A-A flying ship? That's a weird one. I can't even sense its aura or Qi. How does that fly?'\nSecretly, Tang Xuan flew at a low altitude, following the bus in secret. He kept going until the bus reached the river north of the Dragon Mantis City.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe bus ignored the rainbow bridge and kept on going, which was unusual.\nThe massive river, aka the Dragon River, hid the Worm Dragon \"Ship Eater\". It was a 9th-stage monster that lurked in this area, and it had already eaten over a hundred flying ships and countless commoners. The rainbow bridge served as a safe passage of this area as it could repel that monster.\nIt was common knowledge in this area that everybody had to use this rainbow bridge to avoid the 9th-stage monster. Otherwise, they would have been eaten if they got too close to the river. Yet, the bus flew as if it ignored the threat.\nBOOOM\nBefore Tang Xuan could shout and warn the bus driver, the dragon worm jumped out of the water and swallowed the vehicle whole!\nTang Xuan clicked his tongue as he had expected this. He shook his head.\nBut then, something unbelievable occurred. While the worm was about to dive back into the water, its head erupted in an explosion. Then, it spat out the bus!\n\"WHAT?!\"\n.\n.\nLeo's bus flew unhindered. They crossed the former Dragon Mantis City's territory and headed straight toward the Cauliflower City.\nThe crowd on the bus got to relax three hours before the battle bus reached the territory of the Jianghu Alliance. When the vehicle got closer to the city, they discovered a rainbow bridge, which Leo had seen during his first day in this world.\nThe Rainbow Bridge was the public highway, connecting the Death Sword Sect's territory to the Cauliflower Province. A massive river served as a border between both zones. However, nobody was using the bridge.\nLeo returned to the cockpit as he received a notification sound from the bus. He sat in the driver's seat and saw the bridge, which was roughly 2,000 feet below their altitude.\nSince there was no point using the rainbow road, Leo ignored it and kept going… until something jumped out from the river and appeared in front of the battle bus.\nIt was a massive leech worm. Its mouth alone was 200 feet wide, and its length was immeasurable as its tail was still underwater.\nSCREECH\nThe worm opened its mouth, revealing countless fangs inside. Then, it curled toward the bus, trying to eat it whole.\n\"…\"\nLeo calmly and quietly flipped open three switch covers under the cockpit's ceiling console. They had a label, written in English.\nMissile 1 Safety Lock\nMissile 2 Safety Lock\nGun 1 Safety Lock\nAfter Leo opened the covers, he flipped the switches and unlocked his bus's weaponry.\nUnfortunately, the bus's preparation time was too slow. The worm swallowed the vehicle whole and clamped its fangs.\nA loud metallic noise screeched as the fangs scratched the bus's hull and windows. However, it caused no damage to the vehicle.\nBEEP\nWithout a warning, the bus transformed. A minigun came out from the bottom of the bus.\nThree green lights appeared on top of the three lock switches. Leo nonchalantly opened the bus's headlight and repositioned his flightstick grip. Then, he jerked it a little to aim and clenched his index finger.\nWRRRRRRR\nTATATATATATATATA\nThe bus let out a barrage of 30,000 rounds per minute, shooting the 30mm high explosive bullets into the worm's throat.\nBullets exploded upon contact. Flame erupted and illuminated the dark mouth of the worm.\nRUMBLE\nThe worm squirmed in pain because of the explosive rounds. It stopped trying to bite the bus and spat it out.\nThe bus's interior remained the same even though the physical vehicle was back-flipping like it was in the Olympics. However, the front windows showed the rotating scene. Looking at the event, Leo felt like he was playing a realistic flight simulation game in first-person view.\nLeo deeply sighed and pressed his right hand on the hand console. His left hand also pulled the stick to stabilize the bus.\nA second later, the bus stopped spinning and stabilized. Its jet engine roared as it propelled the vehicle forward.\nSCREECH!\nThe worm quickly dove back into the river while its bleeding mouth was still on fire. It left behind a large splash when its large body slammed into the water's surface.\nAside from Leo, nobody realized that the bus was attacked. Everybody was in their room, minding their own business.\nLeo glanced at the rear mirror and noticed that no one was in the lounge area. He grinned and drove the bus in peace.\nHe didn't realize that someone in the area saw how the bus escaped from the worm's mouth. The bus resumed the previous altitude and traveled further until another massive city was in sight.\nIn front of the city, many large wooden ships parked on the empty field. A thousand cultivators wearing flashy robes rode on flying swords, occupying the sky.\n\"Oh, we're here already?\"\nLeo quickly disarmed the weaponry. He turned the safety switches on and resumed the control in manual mode. Then, he jerked his flightstick forward, descending the bus.\n\"Ahem, attention, all passengers. We have arrived at our destination, and we will be landing in a few minutes. Please gather in the lounge area and stop playing around. Also, Cat. if you can hear this, don't eat the food in your room's fridge. If that runs out, I won't have any food to feed you.\"\nAfter gently speaking to the intercom, Leo deeply inhaled and searched for a runway to land.\nAs local flying ships always parked and took off vertically, no runway existed in this world.\n\"…Uh-oh.\"",

It relied on the jet engine, but it defied the laws of physics. Without wings and the correct aerodynamics, it continued flying forward at 500mph.\nAlthough the speed wasn't that high, it still required a runway to land as it didn't come with a vertical landing capability. Because of the issue, Leo smacked his lips.\n\"Hah. Boy, oh, boy. This is gonna be a mess. Ahem!\"\nLeo coughed and pressed on the intercom button, warning his passengers.\n\"Ahem! Ahem! Due to the unforeseen circumstances, we will be crash-landing. We might hit something along with way, so get your asses on the seat and buckle the seatbelts.\"\nNot caring if everybody would understand his words, Leo stopped talking. His eyes swept around, searching for a suitable place to land.\nThe city roads were impossible as they were too narrow and short. The farmlands were viable choices. However, as it was in the planting season, the rice farms were full of water, and many farmers were in the fields. Leo might accidentally harm the commoners had he landed there.\nNot wanting to trouble the innocent people, Leo looked for another place, where the commoners wouldn't be affected.\nLeo glanced at the battleship parking lot for a moment before he looked away. At a glance, that place was full of other vessels and medieval frigates. By common sense, it was impossible to land there as the bus would crash into them.\n\"Hmm?\"\n…Crash into them?\nThe intrusive thought made Leo widen his eyes.\n.\n.\nThe ship parking area of Cauliflower City was mainly reserved for the Jianghu Alliance's members. Many big and small clans commonly stationed their flying ships there whenever they visited the palace or the city. However, things were different when the seasonal gathering of the imperial court's tournament was around the corner.\nTwo big clans, namely the Ouyang and the Situ Clan, reserved the whole parking area for their clan members. Big and small ships of these rich families occupied 80% of the parking space while their clan members drove off others from using them.\nBecause of the two rich and shameless clans, the other sects and families had no choice but to use smaller ships, which were easier to park. As a result, they looked insignificant when they were compared to the two big clans.\nThis was a common scheme of both clans to suppress the others. They made it so that the other clans and sects looked inferior to them. As the Situ Clan and the Ouyang Clan's reputation rose, more ignorant rogue cultivators and commoners were more inclined to join them, raising their clans' military power.\nThe imperial court and other organizations long realized the petty scheme. Thus, they usually came here with mounts and large flying swords, which were easier to maintain and retrieve. With flashy monster beasts as mounts and expensive flying swords, they didn't look as poor as before.\nIn summary, the Situ and the Ouyang Clan members were the only ones in the parking space area.\nFour frigates and five ferry vessels of the Ouyang Clan claimed the west parking lot. A fortress battleship, three frigates, and six galleys sat at the east while the Situ Clan's mercenary companies protected their master's ships. There was no middle gap as both clans squeezed their spaces to the point that their ships almost touched each other.\nOn the deck of a frigate of the Ouyang Clan, Ouyang Ke stood there, admiring the fleet of his clan. Although the fleet was for show, he was elated to be represented as their fleet captain. However, he didn't get to enjoy it for long as he noticed the presence of his rival. His expression quickly turned dark.\nBehind Ouyang Ke was the fortress battleship of the Ouyang Clan. On the deck, there was a watchtower. And on top of the watchtower was an elderly man in blue robes. His clothes were so neat that it looked like it had been freshly ironed.\nThe person was Situ Bai, who was an elder of the Cauldron Gnosis Sect, which was also a part of the Pill Union. As fellow alchemists, Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke had been competing for centuries. Even though their rivalry was without bloodshed, they still hated each other with a passion.\n\"You, know, Ouyang Ke. The World Tree Sect's disciples lost to my juniors in the last Pill Concoction Competition. I wonder if they have enough time to practice any martial arts. I hope your disciples didn't hole up indoors all day and stop cultivating because they lost to MY JUNIORS!\"\nGetting mocked by Situ Bai, Ouyang Ke's face reddened. He turned around and pointed his finger at his rival.\n\"You won because the union was the host of the event, Situ Bai! The Tang Clan will host this year's competition! I doubt you can cheat your way to victory again!\"\n\"Hah! Regardless of the places, your people have no chance anyway. Your disciples can't even make any high-graded dantian pill on time! Look, if your disciples can't complete good pills in two weeks, that's no good at all! We, pill-makers, have to strive for quality and speed. If you can't satisfy our customers, why are you even an alchemist?\"\n\"Ha! Speak to yourself, shameless bastard! For your information, my disciples DID make 20 high-graded dantian pills and TWO superior-grade pills on the 20th day while yours wasted five batches of ingredients to cut the time shorter to make THREE high-graded pills! Talk about quality, you still have a lot to learn!\"\nSitu Bai's expression changed. Ouyang Ke's eyes also reddened. As both old men refused to yield, they continued bantering and jeering each other.\nNone of them saw an approaching bus.\nFrom the south, a certain black bus descended at the edge of the parking lot. As it slowly descended, its speed accelerated instead of decelerated.\nA loud commotion occurred as many cultivators and mercenaries nearby saw the flying bus coming at them. They launched their Qi attacks and swung their weapons toward the bus. However, they failed to stop the vehicle.\n\"STOOOOOOP!!\"\nThe cultivators in the area screamed in desperation, but the bus never slowed down. The bottom of the steel vehicle crashed in between small and medium-sized vessels of both clans.\nThe front bumper of the bus then hit the bows of the ships on the way. As most ships were made from wood, pieces and shards scattered everywhere.\nBecause of the loud impact, Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke stopped bickering. They looked toward the south and found a crazy vehicle coming toward their ships. As it traveled through the center, it hit every ship on both sides.\n\"DAMMIT! WHO THE HELL SEEKS DEATH?!\" Ouyang Ke bellowed.\n\"IMPUDENCE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHO YOU OFFENDED?!\" Situ Bai also yelled.\nBoth super elders jumped in unison and summoned their dao avatars. Two spiritual giants with their faces appeared behind them. Then, they punched downward, aiming to destroy the bus.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nSitu Bai's avatar hit the bus with its left fist while Ouyang Ke's spirit used its right fist. Their unison attack hit both sides of the bus.\nHowever, it didn't cause any damage! Instead, the avatar's expressions changed as their fists shattered and disappeared into smoke.\nThe injuries of the avatars instantly transferred to the masters. Both men flinched as their fists were broken.\nBOOM\nThe bus didn't seem to slow down. Instead, something emerged from the vehicle's ceiling.\n.\n.\nLeo cackled like a maniac as he drove the bus right into the middle of the parking lot. Although he was kind enough to aim at the gap between the ships, his bus crushed everything in its path.\nMoreover, Leo learned a lot of weird knowledge when he was on Earth.\n\"When landing, I must accelerate in preparation to take off if things go south! Therefore, I must step on the gas while landing!\"\nIt was from a navy jet pilot's guidebook that Leo randomly picked up to read. Unfortunately, this logic was only applicable to custom aircraft, which were designed to land on aircraft carriers - Modern aircraft carriers used wires to assist their planes to land, so planes could be instantly stopped. By following this principle, whenever a pilot missed the right wire, he could abort the landing and redo everything again.\nBut in this situation, Leo didn't understand the concept. He simply YOLOed it.\n\"YEEHAW!\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\nLeo enjoyed watching wooden ships explode. He laughed and stomped the gas pedal harder.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nSuddenly, something loud came from the side of the bus. Leo also received a feedback force from the hand console – It lightly zapped him.\nRealizing that the bus might have taken some damage, Leo deeply sighed.\n\"Oh, well. Let's do it this way. The runway should be clear if there is nothing on the runway, right? What if I just blast these useless firewood to smithereens then I'll turn back the bus to land it later?\"\nLeo reopened the safety covers of the missile switches. After unlocking the safety switches, Leo moved his left thumb to a red button on the flightstick while his right hand remained on the hand console. He selected the primary weapon with his mind.\nBE-BE-BE-BEEEEEEP\nThe short and long beep sound indicated that the bus had locked on a target or more. The right windshield of the bus turned dark for a moment before it showed the bird-eye-view of the bus, displaying the locked-on targets.\nWhile the alarm went on, two rocket launchers emerged from the top of the bus – one at the front while another one at the back. Both looked like something from a multiple-missile-launcher-system vehicle. However, each rocket launcher came with nine loaded rockets.\nLeo paid no attention to the targets as the ships belonged to cultivators. Since they were naturally rich, Leo believed they wouldn't mind if one or two of their toys were gone.\nLeo pressed the red button.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nTwo rockets were fired from each launcher. Then, they launched consecutive rockets until they ran out of ammo.\n18 rockets flew in the sky. Then, they curved down and headed toward their targets.\nOne of them was Ouyang Ke's frigate. Another one was Situ Bai's fortress battleship.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nAs soon as the rockets hit, they erupted in mushroom flame.\nMore rockets rained toward the other ships. Even the half-destroyed ships that Leo's bus had run over were not an exception.\n18 rockets set the 18 ships of both clans in flame. The battle bus drove through the flame until it reached the end of the parking lot before it took off.\nLeo pulled the flightstick while he couldn't stop smiling. He didn't know why, but he felt like he had done something good for the community.\n.\n.\nThe sudden ambush from the bus killed hundreds of clan members on both sides. Weak mercenaries failed to leave the explosion radius and got devoured by the mushroom flames.\nSitu Bai and Ouyang Ke flew through the flame and carried two of their disciples out of the mess. Their juniors coughed black smoke. Unfortunately, they suffered from second-degree burns.\nBoth alchemist elders fed their disciples healing pills. Then, they carried the survivors to the city while they glared at the flying bus, which was flying further north.\n\"DAMMIT! WHO WAS IT!?\"\n\"I'LL REMEMBER THIS! JUST YOU WAIT!\"\nSitu Bai and Ouyang Ke silently formed a ceasefire treaty as a common enemy emerged. They vowed to kill the person behind this ambush and destroy the mysterious vehicle.",

He jerked the flightstick to the right and pulled, flying the bus around. The vehicle turned around and reset its course back to the parking lot.\nThe parking lot was drowned in the sea of flame. But from Leo's perspective, he saw a runway. As cultivators fueled their flying ships with essence stones and spirit stones, the explosion caused a chain reaction.\nThe rocket's flame ignited all spirit stones and essence stones as if they were gasoline. The fiery fire lit up like beacons, showing Leo the hidden runway in the middle of the burning parking lot.\nLeo brought the bus back. As he had learned the distance from the previous landing attempt, he pulled back the throttle and decelerated the vehicle as soon as the wheels touched the ground.\nThe bus quietly slowed down and completely stopped in the middle of the burning parking lot. The landing was successful.\nLeo widely grinned as he was proud of himself, but that smile didn't last long. He gazed outside the front windshield and saw the raging flame.\nThe only reason the bus wasn't caught on fire was because of its mysterious upgrades and Leo's system. Had it been normal buses, it would have been charred black.\nLooking at the carnage outside, Leo let out a long sigh. He mumbled to himself.\n'If I open the shuttle door, the flame will get inside. I'm fine on my own, but those girls will complain about the excessive suntan. Well, I guess I have to move the bus further.\nLeo changed the driving mode to a land vehicle and gently stepped on the gas pedal. The bus slightly jerked because of its abnormal engine. Fortunately, it wasn't as fast as Leo's Ferrari.\nThe bus traveled further. It left the burning area and reached the walking street, where commoners and cultivators usually used them for their carriages. As they were for road vehicles, the sidewalks and the stone road were sturdy enough for Leo's bus to travel.\nLeo noticed the small road. He drove the bus to the side until the entire bus was out of the road. After parking the bus on a sidewalk, Leo informed his people.\n\"Attention, passengers. Your freaking battle bus has landed. Pack your belongings and come to the lobby. We need to discuss how we will proceed next.\"\nLeo had never attended the local gathering event or tournaments. Thus, he needed the opinion of the experts. He wondered if Xu Nuan or Tiger Swordsman knew the procedure.\nXu Nuan, Tiger Swordsman, Cat, Esen, Taxi, Ricardo, Gao Yan, and the girls came out from their rooms and gathered as ordered. The boys sat at the bar counter while the women gathered at a coffee lounge.\nSeeing how the crowd gathered, Leo got out of the driver's seat and walked toward Xu Nuan. He asked her.\n\"So, ma'am. What's next? Should we head straight to register our arrival first or should we book a hotel or something?\"\nXu Nuan snickered as she predicted that Leo didn't know the details. She explained the next steps.\n\"We only need to report our arrival at the royal palace and seek an audience with the emperor. We introduce our contestants to him first. After that, the emperor will assign us a place to stay for the night in the palace. Tomorrow morning, the emperor will send someone to guide us to the tournament area. Well, only if we're invited.\"\nXu Nuan paused to give Leo a meaningful look. She affirmed him.\n\"Lord Florida Man, did we get an invitation?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"A suspicious guy by the name of Tang Xuan invited me here.\"\n\"Do you have an invitation letter?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's expression changed. He didn't remember receiving anything of the sort. However, he still had a scroll map that Tang Xuan had drawn for him.\n\"Will this do?\" Leo brought out the map of the imperial palace and the location of the event.\nXu Nuan had a wry smile on her face as she nodded.\n\"Well, this scroll has the signature of Chancellor Tang. Although this isn't the right invitation letter, this will do.\"\n\"Is it?\"\nLeo was relieved. With this scroll, his group should be able to enter the palace.\n\"Welp, let's go then. We'll leave the bus here to head to the palace. Xu Nuan, you lead!\"\n\"…Yes, senior.\"\n.\nLeo and his crew got off the bus. As they had agreed, Xu Nuan guided them to the city.? Leo locked the bus and followed her, pretending to be one of the followers.\nRicardo, Taxi, and Cat still maintained their humanoid physique. Even though Cat had tree roots instead of legs, Xu Nuan covered them with her personal array spell, creating an illusion that Cat had human legs.\nWith Xu Nuan's lead, they reached the checkpoint without a problem. But when they got there, they ran into traffic.\nCultivators ignored the checkpoints and flew in and out of the city in chaos. Loud shouts and the commotion on the ground buzzed.\n\"Water element user! Is there any water element user?!\"\n\"The Ouyang Clan and the Situ Clan are under attack! Someone wages war against them! RUN!\"\n\"Anybody has a healing pill?! Anybody?!\"\nSeveral groups of cultivators from the Situ and the Ouyang Clan tended their wounded members and the survivors from Leo's raid. Some were burnt while many lost a limb.\nEverything seemed depressing and tragic at a glance. However, many onlookers sneered at them. Even commoners who had been queuing to enter the city didn't hide their disdain.\nWhile everybody observed the injured, Leo's sharp hearing sense picked up some hushed noises of gossiping commoners far away.\n\"Suit them right. I wish all Ouyang die a painful death!\"\n\"Yeah. That group robbed my village last month and abducted my neighbor's 15-year-old daughter. When the father went to ask for their daughter back at the Jianghu Alliance, they killed him!\"\n\"Look, mom. Remember those guys? They came to our house a few months ago and stole my piggy bank and daddy's money!\"\n\"The likes of Ouyang and Situ are all crooks. What great clan? What is the Jianghu Alliance? They all are a bunch of kidnappers and murderers. I have to pay them 20 pieces of gold every time I accidentally look at their faces. Can you believe that?\"\n\"Death is too easy for them. Keep crying and suffer more, Situ bastards!\"\nThe public opinion was against the two clans. Hearing the gossip, Leo was surprised.\n'What kind of evil deeds did you do to make them hate you so much?! So, when they get so powerful, they go ape shit and ooga-booga their way to the top? Oh, right. When people are too focused on muscles, their brain cells can be underdeveloped.'\nLeo nodded and crossed his arms, thinking that he understood everything.\nWhile eavesdropping their conversation, the queue proceeded smoothly as the guards stopped checking their tokens and origins. They allowed the travelers to freely enter and leave their city.\n.\n.\nAfter passing the checkpoint, Leo's group came across the main road of the Cauliflower City. However, instead of being greeted by a wealthy town, Leo found a massive field, full of small barracks and fences of military camps. However, no one stayed in the camps.\n500 meters away in front of Leo was another array of walls and a checkpoint. The main road led them there.\nXu Nuan introduced the area, \"This is the military gathering area, Lord Florida Man. Normally, the imperial army set their camps here. But since they are hosting a tournament event, their army moves elsewhere to avoid complications.\"\nLeo frowned as he couldn't understand the local's behavior. Had he been in the emperor's shoes, he would have ordered his troops to fortify the city as there would be more visitors.\n\"Why are they leaving this place empty? Why not fortify this place in case of mishaps? Aren't there many visitors today and tomorrow?\"\nXu Nuan bitterly smiled, \"I used to think like that when I first visited here many years ago. When the tournament starts, you will understand.\"\n\"What? Will there be some hotshots ruining the party?\"\n\"…More like, they are preventing collateral damage from wild elders and cheaters, sir.\"\n\"Cheaters?\"\n\"…You will see. Cheating is common in the tournament, and there will be big fights.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo scratched his head, wondering if the local cultivators were stupid. As it was just a sports event, Leo couldn't figure out why they needed to cheat.\n.\n.\nAfter passing through the empty military field, Leo's group reached the outer city's checkpoint.\nThis was the real gate of the Cauliflower City. A hundred cultivators stood tall on the walls, looking down on the traveling commoners and the visitors.\nLeo's group quietly followed the road and stopped in front of the gate. One of the guards stopped them.\n\"Halt! This gate is for cultivators and visitors from authorized sects and clans. Show me your affiliated token!\"\nLeo paused as he never distributed or created a token for himself. He glanced at Xu Nuan, and the latter nodded at him.\nXu Nuan fetched a token from her robes. It was the emblem of the Amazonian Sanctuary. Improvising, Xu Nuan introduced her group.\n\"We're participating in the tournament tomorrow, sir. Can we pass?\"\nThe guards checked the token and sensed its aura. He widely grinned.\nThe Amazonian Sanctuary was a regular in the seasonal competition. They always sent their tamers to fight for the emperor's rewards. They won several times, and a few of their disciples ended up becoming consort of the imperial officials.\n\"Ah, the fairies from the Amazonian Sanctuary? Welcome. But… I haven't heard that you are accepting men. Why are those people with you?\"\nThe guard stared at Gao Yan, Taxi, Ricardo, Tiger Swordsman, and Leo.\n\"Who are they? Are they your servants?\"\n\"Oh, they're…\" Xu Nuan paused to look at Leo's face as she ran out of ideas. She also asked Leo to improvise with her eyes.\nHowever, Leo disliked lies. He coughed and introduced his group.\n\"We're Floridians!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nXu Nuan, Tiger Swordsman, Gao Yan, and the guards stared at Leo's face in disbelief.\nLeo repeated, \"We're Floridians from the Florida Domain! We have been invited to join the tournament. Let us through!\"\n\"…\"\nThe guards looked at each other as they were confused. None of them had ever heard of the term \"Florida\" before.\nWhile everybody didn't know what to do, the gate guard captain jumped down from the wall and stood in front of Leo. As he was 2 meters tall and wearing full plate armor, he towered over Leo.\n\"Show me the invitation letter!\"\nLeo snorted and tossed him the map scroll that he got from Tang Xuan. The captain received it and opened the scroll to look.\nUpon seeing the map and the signature of Tang Xuan, he deeply frowned.\n\"Is this your invitation letter?\"\n\"Check the signature, boy. Chancellor Tang invited me here.\"\n\"…\"\nThe guard captain gave Leo a meaningful look. Then, he emitted the aura of a nascent soul cultivator, summoning a dao avatar of a giant boar.\nLeo found the captain cute. He smirked, \"What now? Do we fight?\"\nThe guard captain shouted, \"Release your dao avatar and show me your aura. Only soul formation cultivators can pass!\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows as he found the guard captain stupid. He glanced at the other elders.\n\"He's saying I'm weaker than the soul formation whatever.\"\nTiger Swordsman snickered as he could still see Leo's rainbow aura, \"Please don't mind the lowly soldier, my lord. He is still young and na?ve.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo shrugged as the comment was fair. He then closed his eyes and whispered to his cells.\n'Show off a little. When I say little, I really mean LITTLE!'\nAll blood cells of Leo flinched for a moment before they resumed their tasks. Only one of them sacrificed their essence to enhance Leo's aura.\nRUMBLE\nInstead of making Leo's aura more visible to cultivators with a weaker foundation, Leo's rainbow aura shot up to the sky and created an aurora. His dao avatar also came out and transformed into a giant, looking down on every person in the Cauliflower City.\n\"…\"\nThe guard captain looked up and sweated profusely. He could finally sense Leo's Qi and aura.\n\"…You may pass, senior.\"\n\"Mhm. You should have done that earlier.\"\nLeo smiled at the guards. Then, he turned around to affirm his people.\n\"Our domain will be called [Florida Domain] from now on. If anybody asks, tell them that you're Floridians, okay?\"\n\"…\"\n\"Oh, about the ID tokens, I'll make you a new one when we get back. It's going to be a lot better than one of those pieces of firewood.\"\nThe guards retreated and made way for Leo and his people to enter. Leo took the lead and waltzed into the city.\nThe elders and the disciples looked at each other and wryly smiled. They mimicked Leo's shrug and his walking posture. Just like that, a group of black-suited men and women entered the city safely.",

      "content": "Chapter 154 Vegan Representative Challenges Florida Man in Fencing. The Latter Brings Guns.\nChapter 154 – Vegan Representative Challenges Florida Man in Fencing. The Latter Brings Guns.\nThe town was the same as Leo had imagined.\nThe building architecture style was mostly the same. All wooden buildings in the outer town area were either two or three stories big as they served as the commercial area.\nInns, taverns, and shops were packed with commoners and first-stage cultivators. Stronger cultivators who could use Qi suppressed their aura and mingled with them on the street. Stall vendors shouted to attract passing-by travelers.\nTiger Swordsman swept glances at the local people and noticed that cultivators and commoners co-existed here, which was different from the Magpie City.\n\"At Magpie City, we segregate the town into two parts – The cultivator area and the commoner area. That way, we can prevent harming commoners with our natural Qi. This is my first time seeing how a town operates without implicating the commoners.\"\nXu Nuan heard the comment, but she disagreed.\n\"That's not it. If you pay attention carefully, you will notice that most native commoners are actually 1st-stage cultivators. The commoners you see around here are all cultivators. No regular commoners can live here.\"\nGao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and the two tamers nodded as they understood why. As they had been following their nascent soul seniors, their aura sometimes made them uncomfortable – they got suffocated whenever the senior's overwhelming aura disrupted their breathing and Qi circulation.\nMeanwhile, Esen, Leo, Taxi, Cat, and Ricardo belonged to the non-cultivator category. As they had never been affected by random Qi oppression, they thought that Tiger Swordsman and Xu Nuan exaggerated their experience.\nEsen giggled, \"That's why human cultivators are weak and trashy! You can't even endure the breaths of other people. How can they become an immortal with that mindset?\"\nLeo snorted, \"They don't have infinite lifespans like yours. They were born fragile. Welp, I can't say much about humans since I'm no longer one of them.\"\n\"You aren't?\" Xu Nuan, Tiger Swordsman, Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and the girls were surprised. But when they thought about it, they wryly laughed.\nXu Nuan sighed, \"Right. You're an immortal, senior. But still, please don't forget about your origins. You said you WERE once a human, right? Please think of us, the humans, who are still struggling as a mortal.\"\n\"Ah, sorry, sorry. My bad,\" Leo snickered. He didn't tell them that he shouldn't be considered a cultivator after all he had gone through.\nOnly Esen gave him a weird look. She smacked her lips and cursed Leo in her mind.\n'Damn monster.'\n.\n.\nIt took Leo's party two hours to reach the inner city. They came across another checkpoint, where another array of walls separated the outer town from the residences of local aristocrats and cultivators.\nUpon reaching the checkpoint, the guards simply glanced at Leo. Unlike the outer wall gate guards and their captain, all soldiers here were soul formation cultivators.\nThe guards instantly identified everybody's cultivation base. They flinched when they noticed the aura of Leo, Cat, Ricardo, and Taxi as they seemed to be stronger than a soul transformation cultivator.\nThe gate guards remained vigilant. One of them approached Xu Nuan and asked her.\n\"Who is your group's leader?\"\nXu Nuan turned toward Leo and introduced him, \"This is Daoist Florida Man, the Lord of… Florida Domain.\"\n\"Domain? Foo-li-da?\"\nThe guards were confused as they had never heard of this organization's name before. Still, as many experts accompanied the group, they chose not to provoke them.\n\"Please come inside. Also, senior, if possible, could you suppress your aura? Beyond here is the residence of aristocrats and noble families. Some servants are still low-level cultivators. Many children can't withstand your aura…\"\n\"…Hmm.\"\nLeo nodded and deeply inhaled. Instantly, his rainbow aura faded.\nHe didn't suppress his aura. He simply held his breath. Then, all pores of his skin were closed, sealing all holes.\nSeeing how Leo efficiently and effortlessly suppressed his Qi and aura, the guards saluted him in admiration. Tiger Swordsman and Xu Nuan were also elated as their lord displayed amicable and admirable techniques.\nOnly Esen noticed what Leo was doing. She smirked and nudged Leo's side with her elbow.\n\"Geezer, how long can you hold?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and showed her two fingers.\n\"Two? Two what? Two incense sticks? That's short.\"\nAgain, Leo rolled his eyes before he stared at her. Then, the back of his ears moved, revealing the fish-like gills. His voice came out from the gill holes, and a portion of the rainbow aura came out from his ears.\n\"Two incense sticks, my ass. My record is two hundred years, damn brat. Don't make me talk like this. It's uncomfortable.\"\nEsen widened her eyes as she couldn't sense Leo's Qi, voice vibration technique, or telekinesis ability. She heard his voice as if he spoke normally. The others were also surprised, but they didn't speak out.\n\"What the?! What the hell is this technique, geezer?! Teach me!\"\n\"Grow some gills, then I'll teach you.\"\n\"G-Gills? What in the hell…?\"\nEsen frowned and jumped up and down behind Leo. Then, she noticed the source of his voice. Her expression got complicated again as she secretly cursed Leo once again.\n'Damn monster!'\n.\nAfter passing through the inner city checkpoint, they found a new world. Instead of seeing a busy road and a wooden town full of people, they only found a series of long walls and large manors behind them.\nGao Yan, Tiger Swordsman, and Xu Nuan remained expressionless as they had seen many big manors before. Only Yao Qiqi and the girls were stunned by the scene.\n\"Whoa.\"\nCurious, the girls jumped two meters high, peeking inside the walls. They noticed gardens and beautiful courtyards inside.\n\"So beautiful!\"\nXu Nuan rushed toward them and grabbed Yao Qiqi. Then, she reprimanded the two tamer girls.\n\"Stop jumping! These manors belong to the court officials and major clan's cultivators. You'll get us in trouble!\"\n\"…We're sorry!\"\nThe girls stopped misbehaving. Xu Nuan let out a sigh of relief, hoping that the journey to the palace would be peaceful.\nBut someone among them was bored. She let out a noise.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nCat had been following Leo like a pet dog for hours. She wore a thick cloak and a black robe to hide her monster physique. However, she wore a chained choker, and the end of the chain was tied to Leo's belt. Without the leash, Cat would have run off long ago.\n\"MEOW! NOM-NOM MEOW!\"\nCat started to complain. She sniffed and protested Leo.\nLeo turned around and pursed his lips. He inserted his Qi into the ring and ejected a dead caiman, which he had been keeping as backup food for the return trip.\n\"Here's your food. Stop complaining.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat's human mouth was deformed and enlarged. She caught the dead thunder caiman with her mouth and swallowed it whole!\n\"…\"\nEverybody in the party stared at Cat in disbelief. The latter burped and let out a sigh of satisfaction before she poked Leo's back.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo shook his head and continued walking toward the palace ahead.\n\"No, Cat. The rest of the food is for tomorrow. If you eat it all, we won't have anything to eat.\"\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"Cultivators DO eat food, Cat. Stop trying to coax me that the others don't eat food.\"\n\"…Meow.\"\nCat sucked her thumb and looked at Xu Nuan, showing her the innocent eyes. Unfortunately, Xu Nuan had already learned about her character. She didn't fall for the cute eyes trick.\n\"You heard him, Cat. Be patient. The palace should have prepared a banquet for us.\"\n\"A banquet?\" Leo and others were interested.\n\"Yes, senior. At night before the tournament, the emperor always holds a banquet to welcome all clans and sects. Most of the time, the disciples will stay in their rooms while elders like us join the banquet for political talks.\"\n\"Eh?!\"\nGao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and the two girls were disappointed. They thought that they would get to attend a royal banquet.\n\"Sorry, kids. The banquet is for the adults,\" Xu Nuan laughed and patted Yao Qiqi's head.\nLeo snickered and mimicked Xu Nuan's action. He patted Esen's head instead.\n\"Sorry, brat. The banquet is for the adults.\"\n\"Bastard geezer! I'm older than everybody here!\" Esen screamed again.\n\"But you're here as a disciple. No talking back.\"\n\"You…\"\nEsen clicked her tongue and crossed her arms. After being reminded of her role, she still couldn't figure out how Leo would bypass the detection of the other cultivators.\n\"They will find out soon.\"\n\"They won't.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Positive.\"\nLeo widely grinned. As a matter of fact, he looked forward to seeing everybody's surprised face when he introduced Esen to the other contestants.\n\"Before that, you should also suppress your cultivation base… or strength a bit. Make it so that you're a nascent soul like the kid and Gao Yan.\"\n\"…I don't have a cultivation base. I'm a lich, not a cultivator.\"\n\"And how do you use your power?\"\n\"I use my enemy's blood and yin Qi.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had some concerns about Esen. For the moment, he gave her an order.\n\"Don't use your power. If possible, only use your external martial arts.\"\n\"You mean, fists and kicks?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\n\"… Can I bite?\" Esen widely grinned and revealed her four long fangs.\nLeo gave Esen a weird look, \"…Fine.\"\n.\nWalking further for another hour, everybody arrived at the last checkpoint of this city - the palace entrance.\nThe palace gate was made from pure gold. It was even wider than the city entrance. Moreover, a battalion of 1,000 nascent soul cultivators in full plate armor stood on the walls, staring at the people below.\nAs Leo approached the checkpoint, a nascent soul cultivator in an eunuch robe jumped down from the wall. He bowed 90 degrees to Leo as if he had been expecting him.\n\"Welcome, Lord Florida Man. The emperor has been waiting for your arrival. Please follow me.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo turned around to look at Xu Nuan as he was surprised. Then, he gazed at the Eunuch.\n\"Lead the way, then. By the way, do we get a place to rest for the night?\"\n\"Of course, sir. We always prepare the best courtyard for the tournament participants.\"\n\"What about the banquet?\"\nThe eunuch flinched for a moment. His eyes gleamed, \"Of course, we will hold a banquet at night, as usual, sir. But for now, please follow me.\"\n\"Fine.\"\nLeo gestured for the others to follow him. The crowd nodded and was about to enter the palace.\nHowever, the gate guards raised their weapons, blocking their way to get in.\n\"HEY!\" Esen yelled at the guards, \"We are together with him! Why can't we get inside?!\"\nThe eunuch glanced at Esen for a moment before he turned to Leo. As usual, he bowed again.\n\"Until we verify that you are indeed Florida Man of the rumor, we cannot allow your people to enter the restricted area. Could you please inform them to wait, sir?\"\n\"…This is unnecessary.\"\n\"This is for our palace's security, sir. In the past, many imposters tried to get in by impersonating famous cultivators. Most of the time, they chose to act as leaders of new sects or clans. In your case, we need to confirm your identity first. Once we recognize you, your group can enter the palace without the verification procedure the next time.\"\n\"Fair enough.\"\nLeo shrugged and turned around. He gestured to Esen.\n\"Protect everybody. I'm testing the water.\"\nEsen frowned for a moment before she caught the hint. Her expression turned solemn.\n\"Leave some for me. Don't eat them all.\"\n\"I ain't Hannibal Lector. I don't eat people!\"\nNot waiting for an answer or reaction, Leo turned around and followed the eunuch into the palace. He didn't care if this might be a trap from the emperor's side.\n.\nThe eunuch brought Leo into the massive golden palace. They passed through the front palace, which had the same structures and layout as the Forbidden City in China.\nAfter entering the Forbidden City and reaching the inner palace, Leo came across another Forbidden City. However, the building materials were made of white spirit stones.\nLeo had the urge to touch the spirit stone pillar nearby, but he was afraid that it might mutate. He pulled his hand back and kept up the pace with the eunuch.\nEntering the white Forbidden Palace, Leo walked into a large hall. Deep in the hall was a throne, where the emperor had been sitting and watching him.\nIn the throne room, Yan Xiang's top soldiers and experts from various clans stood on the sides, opening the center area for the newcomer to enter. Some of them didn't bother hiding their killing intent.\nAmong the crowd, Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke were there. However, Leo couldn't see Tang Xuan.\nYan Xiang waved his hand, ordering the eunuch to retreat. The eunuch nodded and withdrew from the area.\n\"Come closer, Daoist Florida Man.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his head and walked on the red carpet until he reached the center of the room. He then greeted the emperor for the first time.\n\"I'm Florida Man from Florida Domain. Hello, there, your majesty.\"\nMany eyes turned red as Leo didn't kneel and he sounded rude. Still, Yan Xiang didn't pursue the matter as he had other issues with him.\n\"Well met, Florida Man. Let me get straight to the point since we don't have much time.\"\nYan Xiang leaned forward and released the aura of a quasi-immortal.\n\"Swear allegiance to the Yan Empire, and we will forgive you for killing my son.\"\nLeo tilted his head, wondering what the emperor was cooking. He smirked, \"No, thanks.\"\n\"… I see.\"\nYan Xiang deeply sighed while Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke also brought out their talismans, preparing for an all-out attack. However, Yan Xiang had his own agendas and plans. He offered another proposal.\n\"Let's make a bet, Florida Man.\"\n\"Yes? What bet?\"\n\"I'm hosting a tournament for young disciples tomorrow. I heard you've accepted my invitation and brought your people here. How about we bet on our junior's performance?\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"If your junior wins the tournament, we will forgive you for killing the second prince, and we will acknowledge you as the new citizen of our empire. But if you lose…\"\nYan Xiang glared into Leo's eyes. His voice changed.\n\"You will be expelled from our country, and you cannot establish a new cult, clan, sect, or store ever again. Even if you stay, we will excommunicate you and order all cultivators of our country not to patronize you.\"\n\"Hah?!\"\n\"We know that you're strong, Immortal Florida Man. It's impossible for us to kill or harm you. But that doesn't mean you can bully us forever.\"\n\"…\"\n\"How about it? Will you accept our challenge? Sir Immortal?\"\nLeo finally understood Yan Xiang's intention. It seemed that the emperor was smarter than the thieves and cultivators who raided his store.\nSince the emperor wanted to play it safe, Leo was happy to oblige. After all, he wanted to harvest their lifespan, not murdering everybody here in vain.\n\"Alright. Let's do it.\"",

No Press Has Been Charged.\nChapter 155 – Florida Man Scams Copium-Addicted Senators during Sports Conference. No Press Has Been Charged.\nYan Xiang's assertiveness and passive-aggressive attitude caught Leo off guard. He reluctantly agreed to the unfair bet as he had no intention of eradicating his dynasty just yet.\n'I guess he knows what I did in that world. Welp, I need them to visit my domain, so I can extract their lifespan. Killing them here is a waste.'\nWhile thinking, Leo recalled something that he had planned to ask the emperor. It was related to the reason why Leo readily accepted Tang Xuan's invitation and came here brazenly.\nLeo gazed at Yan Xiang with a solemn expression.\n\"If you agree to my two conditions, I'll accept that unfair bet.\"\nThe corners of Yan Xiang's mouth curved down. Then, he narrowed his eyes, wondering what Leo wanted.\n\"Speak.\"\nLeo paused and took a deep breath. As this matter was related to his power and origins, he was cautious.\n\"First off, I'm a collector. I've come to this world in searching for unique artifacts. Have you ever heard of…Fate Crystal?\"\n\"Fate Crystal?\"\nYan Xiang narrowed his eyes while everybody in the throne room looked at each other and murmured in confusion. They had never heard of this item's name before.\nOn the other hand, Yan Xiang was aware of the existence of this item. His face reddened in anger as it was related to his country.\n\"I know of it. Why do you ask?\"\n\"Aside from what you've offered, I want a Fate Crystal as a part of the bet.\"\n\"Impossible!\" Yan Xiang stood up and shouted, \"Earth Fate Crystal of the Yan Dynasty is the pillar of our continent's protective arrays! Without it, the barbarians from the other continents would have invaded and destroyed us all!\"\nLeo had a wry smile on his face. He silently mocked Yan Xiang as he didn't understand what Fate Crystals were for.\nFrom what Leo had learned from the four guardians of the mystic realm platform, Fate Crystals came in five grades – Earth Fate Crystals, Sky Fate Crystals, Heavenly Fate Crystals, Entity Fate Crystals, and Karmic Fate Crystals. Each grade offered a different power and perks if they were used correctly.\nFor example, Earth Fate Crystals could bless the item owner with the power of \"Luck\". Had a modern human possessed it, that person would have won a lottery every time they bought one. However, aside from material luck, they couldn't influence somebody's lifestyle or change one's life. Moreover, the profound \"Luck\" energy in the crystal could be depleted after a few usages.\nSky Fate Crystal was a bit better. Aside from providing luck to the owner, it could also bring a major opportunity or a fortuitous encounter to the item holder. After giving the owners enough opportunities, it would lose its power.\nHeavenly Fate Crystal was a huge leap from the previous tier. Not only did it bless the owner with infinite luck and opportunities, but it sometimes came with a mysterious \"System\". If it was put inside one's body, the person would gain the \"System\" power. The black-winged angel commented that whoever had it could be considered a \"Protagonist\" of the era.\nAs for Entity Fate Crystal, Leo had two of them inside him. The first one enabled him to use three systems – The Online Shopping System, the Shop Domain System, and the Lifespan System. The second Entity Fate Crystal from the mystic realm enabled him to upgrade non-electrical appliances by using his lifespan. It had other powers, but Leo hadn't fully explored it yet.\nUnfortunately, the Karmic Fate Crystal was something out of Leo's reach at the moment. The angel statue said that it didn't exist in his world.\nIn summary, these fate crystals were the clues that Leo had been searching for as they might relate to \"Players\" and the PVP mode. In addition, the angel statue hinted that he needed to collect as many fate crystals as possible to boost his abilities.\nFortunately, Yan Xiang misused his Earth Fate Crystal. Although the earth-graded one was useless to Leo, he wanted it nonetheless.\n\"If you need a source of energy, I can provide you a better one. Have you ever heard of soul stones?\"\n\"Soul stones?\" Yan Xiang widened his eyes as he had heard of it. They were the rare cultivation resources that his ancestors always desired. \"You have soul stones?!\"\nLeo shrugged. He didn't have one on him at the moment, but he knew the recipe to make some.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stones]\nOne Molg Lich's Bone (Any Piece)\nYin Essence\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stone]\n1,000 Essence Stones\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Catalyst\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Essence\n.\nThere were two ways to make them. The first one required the bones of Esen's dead comrades. The second recipe required 1,000 essence stones and some catalysts.\n\"One of my store's merchandise is soul stone, but we'll talk about the trade some other time. For now, the fate crystal is one of my conditions. Will you agree?\" Leo steered the conversation back to the topic.\nYan Xiang gave Leo a meaningful look. He hesitated if he should continue pressing on the hidden agendas that he and the officials had agreed upon.\nStill, Yan Xiang thought of the death of his son. He pressed on.\n\"Earth Fate Crystal will not be included in this bet.\"\n\"Then, the bet is off.\"\n\"But we can offer something of a similar value.\"\nYan Xiang snapped his fingers. Then, the first prince Yan Luo, who had been hiding behind his father, gestured his subordinates to drag a group of people out from the next room.\nA group of eunuchs carrying multiple golden chests walked out and put the containers in front of Leo. Then, they opened them.\nInside the chests were countless essence stones and spatial rings, which the imperial court had salvaged from the Death Sword Sect and the Fatui Cult. Yan Xiang presented them to Leo.\n\"If you win, we give you the essence stones and the spatial rings inside the chests instead. How about it?\"\nThe crowd's eyes reddened as they were envious of the bet. They wished that they could take some of the chests back home.\nLeo pursed his lips as if he didn't hate this counteroffer. He slightly nodded, \"You are quite a haggler, your majesty. Very well. I accept that. But I still have my second condition.\"\n\"Speak!\"\nLeo widely grinned. He then laid a bait.\n\"If I win, I want you and your court official to pay my store a visit. You can bring your army if you want to. I will not defend or resist if you suddenly attack me or my people.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe ugly smile on Leo's face was so wide and heinous that he revealed his pink gums and 48 teeth. He rubbed his hands and leaned over like a crooked villain.\n\"I'm a merchant, so I want nothing more but customers. Will you agree to my humble condition?\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang grinned while the court's cultivators sneered at Leo. They silently whispered, mocking him for being stupid.\n'Is that a declaration of war? It sounds stupid to me.'\n'Yeah. With that condition, we can just mobilize our armies there as a pretense to visit his stupid store, right? Then, we can just raze that place to the ground.'\n'I have a better idea. Since we have a reason to access his territory, we can secretly set up a killing array to slaughter everybody inside. He can't complain if we suddenly invite some immortals from the higher realms to kill this idiot.'\n'That's what I'm thinking. This immortal is a fool! He's so overconfident in his strength to the point that he forgets about other immortals from the higher realm! Once our ancestors come back, he will surely piss his pants and beg for his life!'\nLeo's ears twitched as he could hear their whispers, but he pretended not to hear them. He kept staring at Yan Xiang, waiting for his answer.\nYan Xiang inwardly agreed with the gossipers. He had no issue with it.\n\"Fine. I'll accept the second condition. Now, bring me a scroll, so we can make this bet official!\"\n\"Alright.\"\nAs if the scroll and brush had been prepared before the conversation, a eunuch among the crowd came out and presented a blank golden scroll to Yan Xiang. The latter picked the brush and wrote on it.\nAfter Yan Xiang was done, the scroll floated by itself. Then, it ejected Chinese words. They instantly multiplied into two and flew into Leo's forehead and Yan Xiang's forehead.\nThe golden Chinese word \"Contract\" appeared like a tattoo.\nYan Xiang snorted and warned Leo, \"With this, the bet is official. Nobody, even me, can go back on our words. Remember, if you lose, you will be expelled from this continent and never come back. If you win, you get to stay and keep those chests.\"\nLeo widely grinned, \"Don't forget the visiting part.\"\n\"…Yeah, that too. Now that you're done here. You can follow the servant outside to the prepared resident. He will tell you where the tournament will be held tomorrow.\"\nSuddenly getting kicked out of the throne room, Leo smacked his lips. He found this emperor uncultured and rude.\nLeo turned around to leave the throne room. But when he reached the exit, he stopped his feet as he remembered something.\n\"Say, Your Majesty.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"What about the night banquet? Can I bring my people to join?\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang frowned while the other cultivators laughed at him. Yan Luo also sneered and mocked Leo.\n\"The banquet indeed will be held here. But for you and your people, I'm afraid that you cannot join us. After all, the invitation only extends to the members of Jianghu Alliance and our allies.\"\n\"…\"\n\"But since you ask for it, we will not be rude and leave you out. You can join us, but we might not have a seat for you and your men, senior. You will have to sit on the ground outside the palace.\"\nThe crowd laughed. None of them hid their disdain expressions.\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply sighed. He admitted that the local people were quite bold. He thought that cultivators respected seniority and stronger cultivators. But here, they didn't hide their hostility.\n'If I were a villain, these fools would have been long dead. I guess I didn't kill enough. Rather, these guys are born stupid.'\nLeo secretly touched the pistol in his suit as he had the urge to shoot Yan Luo's mouth, but it was not the right time.\n\"I'll see y'all in the tournament. See you tomorrow, your majesty. Also, you, the smart mouth…\" Leo turned around and gave Yan Luo a meaningful look, \"I wish you a long life… REALLY long life.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo snorted and let go of his gun. He left the throne room and followed a servant, who had been waiting for Leo outside the room.\n\"This way, please. We'll go and pick up your comrades. Then, we'll head to your designated courtyard.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nBoth men returned to the entrance of the palace checkpoint to regroup with the others.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 156 – Florida Man Breaks into House and Set New Guinness World Record of Longest Poop on House Owner's Bed\nAfter Leo had left, Yan Xiang leaned back in his chair. The back of his clothes was drenched in sweat.\nThe others also let out a long sigh. They thought that Leo would have killed them as Yan Xiang was too aggressive. Fortunately, they didn't need to use the hidden talismans on their bodies.\nYan Xiang had prepared a killing array in the throne room. Had Leo attacked anybody, the array would have activated and unleashed yellow lightning bolts on him. However, by doing so, some of the people here would have died.\nThey were glad that they didn't fight.\n\"That was nerve-wracking. I thought he would have attacked us first.\"\nYan Xiang was relieved. Then, he glared at Yan Luo and reprimanded him.\n\"You and your smart mouth almost got us killed! What were you thinking provoking an immortal!?\"\nYan Luo snorted as he found nothing wrong in his action. Moreover, he was confident in his new weapon, which he had salvaged from the spaceship that he had obtained.\nThe prince pulled out a homemade pistol, which he had replicated it from an old blueprint in the ship. The pistol could only shoot one bullet at a time, and it looked fragile. However, Yan Luo reinforced it with his metal element Qi, and he was confident in his creation.\n\"I wish he attacked us, Father. I would have killed him with this new artifact.\"\nYan Xiang glanced at Yan Luo's gun and snorted. He had seen its firepower, and he was disappointed in it.\n\"At best, it can kill a quasi-immortal if we use a dozen fully-charged essence stones as bullets. I doubt it can kill him.\"\n\"We can try. Actually, we can even test it in the tournament. Yan Zhu will be disguised as one of our representatives and join the tournament, right? We'll let him use it.\"\nYan Xiang thought of the useless third prince, aka Yan Zhu. The latter had been consuming tea of rejuvenation for a long time, and his appearance should be as young as a teenager by now.\nThe other clan representatives also grinned. As this tournament was special, they had been investing in the tea of youth, turning some of their elders into teenagers to join this event.\nYan Xiang massaged his forehead. He prayed that this plan would work.\n\"As we have agreed upon, all sects and clans will disguise their strongest elders as young participants. The agents will kill Florida Man's disciples and representatives to teach him a lesson. I don't care if you send your quasi-immortal ancestor or patriarch there. I want the result!\"\nThe tournament was rigged from the start. Yan Xiang's group plotted to send their strongest fighters to murder Gao Yan and others to get their revenge.\n\"After we use the contract to remove Florida Man from the continent, we will eradicate the Life Sword Sect and send their heads to Florida Man as a parting gift! And once our ancestors arrive, they will deal with him!\"\nThe crowd smiled and saluted their emperor.\n\"You are wise, Your Majesty. This stratagem is perfect. We will surely get him!\"\nYan Xiang nodded in satisfaction. His confidence soared as he wished to see Leo's reaction tomorrow. Also, he reminded his men.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, the servant guided Leo, Esen, and their group to the prepared courtyard.\nHowever, there was an issue. The courtyard's quality was questionable.\nThe rotting wooden buildings smelled like moldy flour. Dust and leaves formed a thick layer on the road and floor. All buildings featured no door or coverable window. Moreover, no furniture remained in any building or courtyard.\nThis place was long abandoned!\nThe servant sweated profusely as he looked at the dark faces of Leo and others. He then repeated what Yan Xiang had told him.\n\"T-The emperor said that your \"banquet\" food is stored in the kitchen, senior.\"\n\"…\"\nCat was the first to react. She rushed toward the general direction of the kitchen. But a minute later, she came back with a bowl, full of moldy grain pills.\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow!!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply inhaled and glared at the servant. He pulled the latter's collar.\n\"So, can you explain what your emperor was doing? Is this bullying?\"\n\"I-I'm sorry, senior! I-I'm following his order! This is not my idea!\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nLeo dropped the servant. He fell on his butt and ran away in fright. Fortunately, Leo didn't directly touch him, or he would have died on the spot.\nEsen, Xu Nuan, Tiger Swordsman, and the disciples looked disappointed. The elf girl crossed her arms and looked at the desolate courtyard.\n\"So, where is our banquet and food?\"\nLeo walked toward Cat and picked up a rotten grain pill. After Leo touched it, the rotten pill shone and transformed into a black pill. Then, he flickered it into Cat's mouth.\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat ate it in glee. She chewed it several times and opened her mouth, waiting for Leo to continue feeding her.\nLeo laughed and picked up more expired pills. He let his radiation convert everything into black pills and tossed them into her mouth.\nWhile feeding Cat, Leo warned Esen and others.\n\"There won't be any banquet. It seems that the emperor doesn't welcome us here.\"\nLeo told everybody about the meeting earlier and his agreement with Yan Xiang.\nAfter hearing the bet, Esen smirked, \"You scammed them, you sick geezer! But why do you want them to visit your domain?\"\nTiger Swordsman and Gao Yan wryly smiled as they had seen how Leo dealt with intruders. Still, he didn't understand how Leo did it.\n\"You wouldn't get it.\"\n\"???\"\n\"You don't have to worry about that. For now, we have to deal with the issues at hand first.\"\nLeo turned around and told the crowd to settle in.\n\"I'll sneak into the palace's kitchen and fetch us food and wine. You all wait here.\"\n\"Oh?\" Esen smirked, \"Can I go with you?\"\n\"Suit yourself.\"\n\"HEHEHEHEHE!!\"\n.\n.\nA few minutes later…\nRacing on an empty road behind the palace were two 1-meter-tall cardboard boxes with small holes in the front. Leo and Esen, who hid themselves in the uncanny boxes with anime logos, moved as fast as cockroaches in a dark kitchen.\nAfter slipping through the unsuspected patrolling soldiers, both of them reached a storehouse behind the palace kitchen. They stopped to scan the area.\n\"Hey, geezer,\" Esen whispered. \"Had we done this normally, we would have gotten the food already. Why the boxes?\"\n\"Shush!\" Leo looked left and right. Then, he lifted the box to show his face. He looked at Esen, who peeked through the cardboard boxes using the two front holes.\n\"This is the ultimate art of Solid Snake, brat. With cardboard boxes, we are John Cena!\"\n\"What the hell are you talking about!?\"\n\"Trust me. It will work.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen was at a loss for words because of Leo's silliness. She grumbled, playing along with his antics.\n\"Fine. Lead the way.\"\n\"Leave it to the Big Boss!\"\nLeo covered his body and head with the large cardboard box. He then crept closer to the storehouse, but he avoided the front entrance.\nInstead of entering the building through the front entrance, Leo stayed behind the building. After getting out of the cardboard box, he touched the storehouse building's brick wall. He linked his Qi with the spatial ring, ordering it to store a portion of the wall in his ring.\nWHOOSH\nThe wall instantly vanished into the ring!\nLeo didn't stop there. To avoid suspicion, he entered the building and put his hand on the previously vanished wall area.\nWHOOSH\nLeo resummoned the wall from the spatial ring. The stone wall appeared and filled the empty hole. However, a few pieces of rock crumbled and fell to the ground.\n'Whoops. Well, nothing is perfect in this world. I should hurry.'\nInside the 100-square-meter storehouse building, Leo only found dry-aged beef, pork, and freshly butchered cows. All meat was stored in a room, surrounded by a formation of blue talismans. Cold air protruded from the array as if it acted as a freezer.\nNext to the freezer array, there were human-sized barrels, containing countless living fish. shrimp, and crabs. Baskets of vegetables and fruits were also nearby.\nOn the opposite side of the building, stacks of wine jars filled out the wall shelves. Leo briefly counted them, but he stopped after he counted to 4.\nThe center of the room was also peculiar. There was a golden chest, which was tied by thick iron chains. Purple talismans on it also emitted a similar aura to the seal talismans, which had been used to seal Esen.\nAs for the front door, it was still closed, and it was locked from the outside. As there was no window, no light illuminated the dark storehouse.\nLeo loved talismans more than anything as he could get a lot of YOL by eating them. He beelined toward the chest and touched it with his finger.\nWHOOSH\nThe entire chest, chains, and talisman vanished into his spatial ring.\n'I don't know what it is, but it's mine now!'\nAfter getting the mysterious box, Leo went around and stuffed everything in the storehouse into his spatial rings. When everything was swiped clean, Leo sneaked out from the way he came from. He used the same cardboard box as a cover and got out of the area.\nLeo came back to Esen, who had been idling on a sidewalk, next to the pile of junk. When Leo came back, she complained.\n\"Are you done? I'm tired of sitting here.\"\nLeo chuckled, \"We have everything. Let's go back to hold our private banquet.\"\n\"So, what do you get?\"\n\"Wines, fish, meat, and stuff.\"\n\"What about blood?\"\nLeo forgot that Esen's primary food was blood. Although she didn't need much, she still required them to sustain her existence.\n\"…Err. I have a few buckets of unknown animal blood with me. Do you want me to turn them to yin fluid?\"\n\"Of course. I don't drink fresh animal blood. At least, you should turn them into blood wine or some sort if you want to satisfy this empress!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Let's look for another place. I don't think we have enough for me and Cat.\"\nEsen took the lead this time. As she had been observing the buildings, she had an eye on a tall pagoda 500 meters away from the royal palace. As Esen got used to crawling, her cardboard box sprinted so fast that she disappeared into the corner of the road.\nLeo sighed and followed after her, using his sensitive nose. After crawling for a few minutes, he reached the back of the pagoda. However, there was a two-meter tall brick wall, preventing Leo from getting closer.\nOn the surface of the wall, Leo noticed the black footprints of Esen's leather shoes.\n'Oh, she must have gone inside already. Welp. Frog-jump, it is.'\nLeo frog-jumped and leaped over the wall with ease. He landed on the other side of the wall.\nZAG-ZAG\nAs the other side was full of bushes, Leo's box slipped out. He quickly grabbed it and stored it in his inventory. While he was at it, he looked around to find the traces of Esen.\nHer cardboard box was also nearby. Leo didn't forget to take it back. Then, he followed her scent.\nThe scent of Esen came from the top floor of the pagoda. Leo looked up and compared its size to the pagodas in Orlando Planet.\n'It's a lot smaller than those pagodas. I guess this should be easy.'\nAfter wiggling his butt like a cat, Leo jumped 200 meters and reached the top floor. He grabbed the ledge of the roof tiles and swung his body onto the top floor's balcony.\nUpon landing, Leo looked inside the pagoda. Then, he found a bedroom and Esen. The lich girl was busy throwing books and random objects out of the bookshelves as if she was searching for something.\n\"Esen, what are you doing?\" Leo got into the room and looked around.\n\"I can smell some good pills in here. It smells like blood.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLeo's nose twitched as he concentrated on his smelling sense. As Esen had mentioned, Leo caught a wisp of the strong iron-like smell of blood and the medical scent of pills. He sniffed a few times before he looked at the ancient stone bed.\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo walked toward the bed and lightly knocked on its surface. However, as he exerted too much force, the bed cracked and was broken in half.\nAfter the bed was broken, the scent got stronger. Esen stopped what she had been doing to turn her attention to Leo.\n\"You've found it?\"\n\"Accidentally, yes.\"\nLeo and Esen removed the outer layer of the stone bed to see the hidden treasure underneath. After removing the obstacles, they found five metallic jars with cloth seals.\nThe strong scent of blood, alcohol, and medical herbs filled the room. Similar to the storehouse, the jars were inside an array of blue talismans.\n\"Jackpot,\" Leo laughed.\nEsen nodded in approval, \"I call dibs on these. You can take one. I'll take four!\"\n\"Hey, 50/50. You take two. I take two. We drink the remaining jar.\"\n\"Geezer, you're not even an undead. You don't need blood. Give me four!\"\n\"But if I have two jars, I can research on it. If I'm lucky, I might be able to find a recipe to mass-produce these!\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen dropped her jaw. For once, she gazed at Leo in admiration.\n\"Deal. You take two. I take two. We drink the rest. But promise me that you will make me more of these!\"\n\"We haven't even tasted it yet, damn brat!\"\nBoth the undying old man and ancient elf laughed. They stored the blood wine in their spatial rings.\nBut as they were about to leave, Leo's stomach growled. He stopped moving for a moment.\n\"What now?\" Esen could hear the growl. She had a bad feeling about this.\n\"You go first. I need to take a dump.\"\n\"Pfft. This is what you get for eating too much meat and random junk. If you eat too much solid food, you need to take a shit often! Even cultivators avoid that!\"\n\"Meh, you don't know crap.\"\nShamelessly, Leo took off his pants and underwear. He hopped on the stone bed as he had no place to drop the bombs.\nEsen's face turned dark in disgust. She jumped off the building first as she didn't want to smell the rotten dung of a 50,000-year-old man.\n.\nA few minutes later, Leo created a glistening ten-meter-long black cake. He admired it for a moment as he couldn't believe that he had accumulated this much in his bowel. After wiping his butt, Leo put on his clothes and left quietly.\nBoth Leo and Esen didn't realize that they were in Yan Luo's bedroom.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 157 – Local Prince Filed Lawsuit against Florida Man as the Guinness Book World Record's Longest Turd Exploded on His Face\nLeo and Esen returned to the abandoned courtyard. When they arrived, they noticed that the yard was a lot cleaner.\nXu Nuan and Yao Qiqi were in the middle of spraying water everywhere. They summoned water with their Qi and washed away the dirt.\nGao Yan also used his wood Qi, commanding small plants and trees to use their leaves as brooms. The trees bent down and scrubbed the floor while it was soaked by Xu Nuan and Yao Qiqi's water Qi.\nTiger Swordsman worked as an incinerator. He created several small fireballs to burn the collected junk and piles of wet leaves. Once they turned into ash, he threw them to the trees, using them as fertilizer.\nAs for the two girls, they climbed into the resident building to repair the roof tiles. Ricardo and Taxi also helped patch the walls so that the wind wouldn't leak inside.\nMeanwhile, Cat did nothing. She sat in the middle of the courtyard, playing with the water. Her cloak and temporary clothes were already wet. In addition, she already emptied the mutated grain pills in the pot.\nLooking at what everybody had been doing, Esen nodded in approval.\n\"Your people are hard working. You need to reward them, geezer.\"\n\"I know. That's why I'll cook the best food for them. Also, I should mutate the blood wine earlier.\"\n\"Save that until the food is ready! Good wines require good side dishes!\"\n\"…You're right. But wait a minute. I didn't know you can drink.\"\n\"Now, you know.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen hovered over the flooded ground as she didn't want to get wet. As for Leo, he took off his socks and leather shoes. After pulling his pant cuffs up to his knee, he walked toward the crowd.\n\"I'll be preparing our private banquet party. If you need anything, come find me in the kitchen, okay?\"\nXu Nuan, Gao Yan, and the girls were delighted as they looked forward to the party. Tiger Swordsman, on the other hand, felt that it was somewhat unnecessary as they rarely ate solid food. However, he couldn't refuse wine and liquor.\n.\nLeo entered the dirty kitchen. Although everybody had briefly cleaned this place, dark spots and moldy walls still smelled rotten.\nLooking at the dark and moldy place, Leo was annoyed. He ejected modern cooking utensils, such as pots, electric stoves, BBQ grilling sets, pans, and a cauldron to cook. He also pulled out several cubes of sacred wood to use as temporary tables for cooking as the kitchen was too dirty.\nAs the electric stoves had already been upgraded, Leo put them on the sacred wood cubes and turned them on. He arranged pots and a pan for each stove. Then, he opened his online system shop to purchase some cooking oil and garnish.\nUnfortunately, the garnish was too expensive. Leo saw the price and changed his mind. He only purchased some cooking oil, spices, salt, BBQ sauce, butter, cheese, and sugar.\n'Alright. I have a bunch of beef. I should start with steak. I'll make the normal ones first. Then, I'll cook a mutated version for myself.'\n.\n.\nThe group kept cleaning the courtyard until the sun went down. When the sky turned dark, Tiger Swordsman summoned a fireball to illuminate the place for others.\nEverybody stopped working as they did the best they could. Although the courtyard was sparkling clean, the interior of the residents needed improvement as they couldn't get rid of rotten wood and half-broken pillars.\nZIIIIIII\nThe sizzling sound and the pleasant smell of freshly cooked meat came from the kitchen. All cultivators and beasts turned their heads, looking at the source.\nCat salivated. She screamed.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\nXu Nuan gulped. She had never smelled something this pleasant before. Even though she had already taken a grain pill, her stomach yearned for the mysterious food.\nGao Yan and Tiger Swordsman were the same. They thought that they had already seen all the good commoner food in the city, but they had never smelled something this seductive. They drooled.\n\"S-Smash…\"\nTaxi, on the other hand, shook his head. As a vegetarian, he disliked the odor. As for Ricardo, he sneered at Taxi as he had become an omnivore species due to Esen's power.\n\"Smash?\"\nTaxi was enraged. He neighed at Ricardo and chased after him. As for the brown guy, he laughed and dodged Taxi's headbutt attacks with ease.\n30 minutes later, Leo brought out the finished dishes. He also called Gao Yan and others to help him arrange the new tables and chairs for everybody.\nGao Yan and Tiger Swordsman rushed to Leo's aid. When they entered the kitchen and saw the food, they drooled a waterfall.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\nCat also screamed. Fortunately, Esen had been holding the rein, pulling Cat from going berserk.\nThe men brought the food to serve everybody. As furniture in Leo's online shopping system was cheap, Leo bought a set of long kitchen tables and chairs for everybody. Each got their chopsticks and utensils for food.\nThe appetizer was baked sweet potatoes and tenderloin steaks with butter and supermarket BBQ sauce. Although Leo's cooking skill was far from chefs or Gordon Ramsey, the food's appearance and smell were enough to stir any stoic vegans or pill eaters here.\nAfter putting all the dishes down, Leo distributed wine to all adults. As for Gao Yan and the girls, they only received orange juice. Esen and Leo, on the other hand, allocated their blood wine.\nThe small BBQ party started.\n\"Let's eat!\" Leo encouraged everybody.\nXu Nuan stared at the food for a long time. She shook her head and averted her eyes as she tried to resist the temptation. But in the end, her human instinct won.\nTiger Swordsman also broke his fasting. He devoured the steaks like a starving man seeing food for the first time. As for Cat, she already finished everything on her plate and waved her dishes around, asking for the second serving.\nLeo laughed and enjoyed his food while he continued cooking.\nThe small banquet lasted until midnight as all cultivators couldn't stop eating. As their digestive system was enhanced by their Qi and high cultivation base, their stomach dissolved the food and demanded more of it.\nIn the end, Leo only managed to eat half of what everybody had eaten as he was the only cook. Still, he loved the party as it reminded him of the good time he had on Earth.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo and his people had fun, the night banquet at the throne room was awkward.\nYan Luo, Yan Xiang, and the court officials looked at the staled chickens on their plates and the dull wine, which their servants got them from the outer city district.\nA dozen eunuchs couldn't stop sweating. As the storehouse was empty, they scavenged every shop in the outer city district to procure the best wine and fresh food ingredients. Unfortunately, most food ingredients at night were stale and old because the shops had put them on display for the entire day.\nAs a result, the food was of low quality. Some of them had a funny smell, which ruined their appetite.\nYan Xiang stopped eating and drinking after the roasted duck on the plate emitted a foul smell. He stood up and cupped his fist.\n\"We are deeply sorry, my subjects. It seems that there's an issue with the palace's granary. We shall head back and rest for the day. You may continue the banquet until morning.\"\n\"…\"\nThe crowd didn't utter a word. Even though the food was not up to their standard, not all cultivators here touched them. After all, they always used grain pills to fill their stomach. They only remained there to enjoy the wine.\nUnfortunately, the wine came from the town. They lacked the rich and deep taste of spirit yeast and Qi from a master brewer. In the end, they lost their appetite.\nOne by one, they excused themselves and returned home. Yan Luo also went back to his pagoda to take a short rest so that he would be in peak condition tomorrow.\n.\nYan Luo arrived at his personal pagoda. Upon arrival, he took off his robes and tossed the clothes at the maids. Then, he walked up the stairs to the top floor.\nEvery floor of Yan Luo's pagoda emitted strong waves of earth and wood Qi. While walking, Yan Luo absorbed the Qi by inhaling it into his stomach. However, by doing so, his body got heavier.\nThe higher Yan Luo climbed, the stronger the suppressive Qi. Yan Luo began sweating as he felt like his weight was already 10 times heavier than usual. His knees started to give in.\nResisting the increasing weight, Yan Luo circulated his Qi. After doing so, he felt a bit better.\nClimbing stairs was a form of training for Yan Luo. He ignored the physical exhaustion and kept on walking.\nUpon arriving at the top floor, the suppression force was gone. Yan Luo deeply inhaled as he expected some fresh air from the high ground.\nUnfortunately, he swallowed a mouthful of foul air into his lungs.\nHe smelled a strong scent of human feces.\nYan Luo frowned and looked around. Then, he noticed that his belongings and shelves were ransacked. Moreover, the stone bed, which he had been using as a cultivation spot, was misplaced.\n\"What the hell happened here?! Why am I smelling shit?!\"\nThe first prince rushed to his bed as he was worried about his secret wine. They were made from 9th-stage monster's blood, rare herbs, and 1,000-year-old spirit yeast. He had been saving them until the wine matured. Then, he would use them as a cultivation resource.\nBut they were gone.\n\"…\"\nMoreover, on top of the bed, an extremely long turd, which coiled like a sleeping snake. It was beautifully and disgustingly glossy and smooth to the point that Yan Luo was speechless.\nIn anger, Yan Luo bellowed.\n\"WHO DID THIS?! WHO THE HELL RUINED MY BEDROOM?! COME OUT!!!\"\nFor an hour, Yan Luo lost it. He kept screaming and cursing the culprit.\nAfter yelling enough, Yan Luo regained his composure. He stared at the black dung and thought of an unpleasant old man, whom he met earlier today.\n\"Was it you, Florida Man?!\"\nInfuriated, Yan Luo imagined a thousand ways to kill Leo and his people. While he was at it, the prince summoned his dao avatar and unleashed a powerful energy strike at his bed.\nBOOM\nThe bed exploded.\nThe turd also exploded.\nBut because the turd exploded, it scattered everywhere. Some of it got stuck on Yan Luo's face and body while the rest splashed on the walls and ceiling.\n\"…\"\nYan Luo's face got even redder.

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 158 – Florida Man Tied Children with BDSM Ropes and Sent Them to School. Teachers Approved While Parents Protested.\n7 AM of the next day, a servant came to fetch Leo and his company to the tournament area.\nAs cultivators rarely slept, everybody but Leo was already prepared. The girls retrieved all furniture and utensils last night, and they stored everything in Xu Nuan's spatial ring.\nAs for Leo, he still had bed hair, and he was in his pajamas. He came out of the building, holding a pillow and a blanket as he was still half-asleep.\nDuring the night, Esen and Cat pranked Leo. Cat sat on top of him while Esen, who was drunk at the time, squeezed Cat's dirty saliva into his mouth. He ended up tying the two naughty children with upgraded ropes and managed to sleep at 4AM.\nBecause of the lack of sleep, Leo's expression was grumpy and dark. When he stared at the servant, the latter peed his pants.\nAs for Esen and Cat, they were still tied by Leo's upgraded ropes in a BDSM style. Their mouths were gagged, and they still struggled to break free. As nobody could untie them, they got stuck in that condition.\n\"Let's go.\"\nLeo yawned and ordered the servant to lead the way. He stored his favorite pillow and blanket in his ring and accompanied the crowd in his pajamas. While sleep-walking, Leo dragged the two naughty girls with leashes as if they were disobedient puppies.\nThe servant shrieked and guided the group to the tournament area. He didn't notice that the abandoned courtyard was strangely clean.\n.\n.\nThe guide brought Leo back to the army camp area outside of the outer city. When Leo and his company got there, many sects and clans were already there.\nInstead of finding a military campsite, Leo found a massive arena platform and spectator stands. Watchtowers that usually appeared in siege warfare surrounded the 1,000 square-meter circular stage. Many strong cultivators stood on the watchtowers, looking down on the people below.\nStrangely, everybody glared at Leo's group. Their cold eyes never hid their killing intent and hatred.\nLeo glanced back at the crowd. Upon sensing their hostility, Leo snorted in disdain.\n\"Well, well, well. This is an away game, isn't it? I should expect this much.\"\nThe guide pointed at a public spectator stand area, which was empty. As usual, Yan Xiang prepared him a bad-looking one.\nWhile the watchtowers and other seats were clean and well-decorated with flags and banners, seats for Leo's group were smelly brown cushions. He gave it a closer look and noticed that they were also soaked with human urine and feces.\nGao Yan and Tiger Swordsman's faces turned dark as they realized the pettiness of the host. The girls shrank back in fear while Yao Qiqi was on the verge of crying. As for Xu Nuan, she was as angry as Leo.\nThis bullying and humiliation were despicable. She was disappointed in the emperor.\nLooking at the trash cushions, Leo's mood was foul. As he was in a sleep-deprived state, he turned around and told his people.\n\"We will change seats with the others. Wait here.\"\nLeo kicked the rotten spectator stand toward the arena. It landed right in the middle of the stage.\nAs soon as it crumbled, the smell of feces and urine spread. The onlooking cultivators covered their noses in disgust. Meanwhile, the agents from the Situ Clan, Ouyang Clan, and the Yan Family shouted.\n\"How dare you disrespect the imperial court?!\"\n\"Who is stirring a commotion before the tournament?! Do you know who's hosting this event?!\"\n\"Is this why we don't welcome a country bumpkin like you!\"\nAs most people here came from the two clans, more people yelled and cussed at Leo. As for the people from smaller clans and sects, they chose to remain silent as they didn't want to take part in this unfair lynching and bullying.\nLeo slowly ran out of patience. He sneered at them, wondering if they were one-dimensional extras from a 3rd-rated web novel or something similar as their comments and behavior were one-dimensional.\nWhy would weak cultivators openly be disrespectful to a stronger cultivator?\nThe reason was simple. They were either blind or stupid.\nLeo shook his head. His mood got a little better after he thought of them as NPCs. Still, for the sake of teaching them a lesson, Leo pulled out his pistol.\nHe marked everybody who had spoken earlier. As if he entered a bullet time, Leo pulled the trigger 20 times in a row without changing his posture. Only his arm and right hand moved.\n20 upgraded bullets found the heads of the noisy cultivators on the watchtowers. 20 yellowish needles flashed and disappeared into the sky. A second later, 20 agents from the three clans collapsed with their eyes wide open.\nAs upgraded bullets were expensive, Leo reloaded the pistol with an essence stone. He then shouted back.\n\"If you think you're better than me, get down here and talk to me to the face. If you keep shouting while hiding like a coward, I'll be coming for you!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe three hostile clans stopped making noises as their brain couldn't comprehend what had just happened. Their colleagues suddenly collapsed and died on the spot, but they couldn't sense or see Leo's attack.\nFear and uncertainty loomed in their mind. They were reminded that their opponent was an immortal while they were merely low-rank servants from the three clans.\nLogically, they would have been killed instantly had they done the same to other immortals. They totally forgot about it as their master had ordered them to do so.\nAs their plan backfired, they shivered in fear, realizing their mistakes. They hid behind the watchtower's short walls, praying that Leo wouldn't notice them.\nLeo looked around for a moment. When everybody stopped making useless noise, he felt a lot better.\nAfter the useless squabble and senseless killing, Xu Nuan brought out the kitchen chairs and table for them to sit on. Everybody rested there and waited for the event to start.\n.\nAn hour later, Tang Xuan and his clansmen arrived. However, they didn't come here as contestants as Tang Xuan refused to dispatch his clan's elders or disciples here. Only Tang Tian and two of their elders followed him to this arena.\nThe remnant of the Fatui Cult also arrived. Only four nascent soul cultivators showed up, and they still dressed in the same black clothes. Similar to the Tang Clan, they came here as spectators.\nRUMBLE\nA golden flying ship of Yan Xiang also arrived. As if they were celestial beings, they rode a massive carriage, which had a small castle on top. Yan Xiang, Yan Luo, and Yan Zhu stood on the deck.\nSurprisingly, the three men weren't the only passengers there. Xu Nuan looked up and noticed many familiar faces on the ship, looking back at her.\nThey were the girls from Amazonian Sanctuary, who had refused to join Leo's domain. Among them, Qi Niu, the girl who once tried to seduce Leo, was by Yan Zhu's side.\nQi Niu sneered at Yao Qiqi and Xu Nuan as she was proud of her decision. While looking down on her former mentor, she mocked them and Leo.\n\"This is what you get for abandoning our sanctuary. You're just a bunch of greedy bitches that wag your tails around an old man! Look at me. I'm now a royal consort of the third prince! But you, what are you right now? I know, a bunch of beggars! Ha! Serve you right!\"\nYan Zhu heard his new wife's remarks. He laughed and pulled Qi Niu into a hug. Then, he groped her chest.\n\"That's right, my wife. Those bastards are nothing to us. Even if he's an immortal from a higher realm, he is just a stray that can't compete with other immortals for resources.\"\nQi Niu was interested in the topic. She giggled and rubbed her chest against Yan Zhu's hand.\n\"Your Highness. What does the immortal realm look like? Why are you calling that old man a stray?\"\nYan Zhu smirked and explained. He intentionally used a voice vibration technique so that everybody in the Cauliflower City could hear his words.\n\"Immortals aren't really fond of entering a mortal realm. Whenever they enter a mortal realm, the heavenly forces that protect all mortal realms always suppress their Qi and aura to a mortal stage. Also, they cannot cultivate or gather Qi from the lower realm! This is why no immortal wants to linger on a mortal realm for too long since it's a waste of time… except…\"\n\"Except?\"\nYan Zhu sneered at Leo. Unafraid of the consequences, Yan Zhu elaborated while he attempted to ruin Leo's reputation.\n\"Stray immortals. My wife. Do you know what a stray immortal is?\"\n\"What are they, husband?\"\n\"Stray immortals are losers of the immortal realm! They fail to set their roots over there and are usually bullied by their peers. Because they can't acquire cultivation resources from the higher realms, they sometimes enter mortal realms to steal cultivation resources from mortals! They're the worst kind of despicable immortals out there! In short, they're cowardly beggar losers that can only bully the weak and run away from the strong!\"\n\"…I see!\"\nYan Zhu and Qi Niu burst into laughter while the spectators gave Leo a weird look. On the other hand, Gao Yan, Tiger Swordsman, and Xu Nuan frowned as they doubted it.\nYao Qiqi pouted and yelled back at Qi Niu.\n\"Liar! Senior Florida Man is not a beggar! He gave us essence stones and artifacts from the higher realm! He never steals anything from us!\"\nLeo scratched his nose as Yao Qiqi was half correct. She was wrong on the \"Steal\" part, though.\nBut thanks to Yan Zhu's explanation, Leo learned a new thing. He wondered if immortals from the higher realm would come down to visit his store one day.\nYan Xiang gestured for Yan Zhu to stop making a commotion although he approved of the message. As they succeeded in ruining Leo's reputation to make their clans look like the good guys, Yan Xiang proceeded to the next step.\n\"My subjects, we've gathered here once again for the seasonal tournament of our young generation. Although not many clans and sects agree to participate this season, we hope to see new rising stars in our empire.\"\nThe crowd cheered and praised Yan Xiang in admiration. Meanwhile, Leo and his people only watched the show.\nYan Xiang continued, \"As usual, we shall proceed with the preliminary round to examine our new rising stars. Bring in the boulder of verification!\"\nSitu Bai and Ouyang Ke came out of the crowd. They burned the messes that Leo had tossed on the stage. Then, Situ Bai ejected a massive boulder from his spatial ring.\nThe boulder was flat on one side. It was 10 meters wide and two meters tall.\nOuyang Ke explained how it worked.\n\"For the sake of our newcomers, this is how we verify our contestants. All tournament contestants will hit the boulder once without using their Qi. Then, the boulder of verification will identify their BONE AGE! As in the past, many clans disguised adults as juniors to participate. We have to use this method to filter out dishonest people from the crops!\"\nWhile speaking, Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke widely grinned. Even Yan Zhu burst into laughter as he knew what they were about to do.\n\"Let's stop chitchatting. How about we let Sir Florida Man introduce us to his juniors! Sir Florida Man, please guide your juniors to the stage. As we've agreed, you may send five juniors to join the tournament.\"\nGetting called, Gao Yan was excited. He and Yao Qiqi got on the stage first while the two tamers reluctantly followed them.\nMeanwhile, Esen's face turned white. She looked at Leo, wondering if their plan would work.\nLeo let out a long sigh. He wasn't confident if his tea would work.\n\"Oh, well. Just go and try, Esen. But you know what? If the boulder is accidentally destroyed, they can't verify your age, right?\"\n\"…\"\nEsen's eyes gleamed as she was enlightened. She widely grinned.\nLeo untied the ropes and permitted Taxi, Cat, and Ricardo to revert to their original form. The monster beasts immediately transformed and revealed their aura.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 159 – Florida Man Identified as Disabled Joins Paralympic Games, Breaks Every World Record.\nRUMBLE\nAs Cat, Taxi, and Ricardo reverted to their original form, their aura exploded. The eerie and ominous yin Qi made the air chilly. Combined with their killing intent, their glares stirred every string of Qi around the arena, causing all cultivators' dantians to churn.\nMeanwhile, Cat exuded the air of an 8th-stage monster. She was a tier weaker than the unicorn and the nightmare, but she was capable of holding her own weight.\nTang Xuan and his people silently observed Leo's group and wryly smiled. He ordered Tang Tian and other elders to be silent.\nOn the other hand, Yan Zhu flinched as he instantly recognized the strength of Taxi and Ricardo. Both horses were 9th-stage monster beasts, and their strength was on par with real immortals!\n\"MONSTER BEASTS?!\"\nThe spectators panicked. As the average strength of spectators was a measly nascent soul stage, aka the 5th stage, their presence and strength were akin to an insect in front of the three predators.\nYan Xiang leaped from his throne and landed on top of the boulder of verification. He glared at the monsters and Leo.\n\"Do you realize what you are doing, Immortal Florida Man?! This is a competition between juniors. Why are you bringing those monsters along?!\"\nLeo lightly scoffed. He pointed his thumb at Yao Qiqi and the two tamer girls from the Amazonian Sanctuary.\n\"You told us to introduce our juniors, so here they are. They will participate in this tournament… or game… or whatever this mental Paralympics is.\"\nYan Xiang glanced at the monsters and yelled at Leo, \"According to the rules, only HUMAN CULTIVATORS with the BONE AGE under 18 can participate in this tournament! No monsters allowed!\"\nLeo smirked. Then, he winked at Xu Nuan, \"You explain.\"\nXu Nuan realized that it was her time to shine. She stepped forward and saluted Yan Xiang, pretending to be polite.\n\"Let me explain, Your Majesty. Indeed, according to the agreements and rules, only cultivators can join this event. However, beast and monster tamers are an exception. Do you remember the special rules?\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang narrowed his eyes as he had seen Xu Nuan's face somewhere before, but he couldn't remember. Qi Niu, who had been clinging to Yan Zhu's side, mocked Xu Nuan to remind him of Xu Nuan's origin.\n\"Old hag Xu, you know nothing! The rules only allow the Amazonian Sanctuary's representatives to bring one monster or beast per person! It doesn't include you, traitors!\"\nXu Nuan looked up. Her eyes met with the former disciple's. She remained expressionless as she lamented.\n\"Alas, Qi Niu. We did everything we could so that none of you would end up as someone's toys or slaves. It seems that we were wrong.\"\n\"That's right! You were wrong, old hag! Look at me!\" Qi Niu laughed and flexed her status. As a royal consort, she obtained new dresses, artifacts, and cultivation resources from Yan Zhu. Her cultivation base improved by leaps and bounds.\n\"Indeed. Even though your cultivation aptitude is downright garbage, you successfully become a prince's toilet. I didn't know that you wished to become a prostitute that badly. Had I known you better, I would have sold you to a brothel and realized your dream earlier.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"My sincere apologies, Qi Niu. Indeed, we are inferior to you, sex-craved gold-digging slut young lady. We can't compare our sexual experience to you, who have experienced so many golden schlongs. In fact, we aren't qualified to have a conversation with you, whose belly has been penetrated by god-know-how-many men.\"\n\"XU NUAN!!\"\nQi Niu was enraged. Her face reddened, and her nose bleed from anger and blood pressure.\nWhile the women launched a firework, Leo inwardly gave Xu Nuan a thumbs up as she colorfully silenced the annoying wench on the flying ship. Still, they hadn't solved their primary issue.\nAs Yan Xiang was the host, he could change the rules anytime. Their scheme might fail.\nYan Xiang raised his hand and looked at Yan Zhu. The latter nodded and pulled his wife away.\nAfter Qi Niu stopped making noise, Yan Xiang did exactly what Leo had predicted.\n\"As she said, woman. Amazonian Sanctuary cultivated beast tamers, not a fighter. That was why we allowed their representatives to bring their pets here to fight in their stead. However, you do not have the same luxury since you aren't from a tamer-oriented sect or clan.\"\nLeo snorted, \"Even though three of them are from the sanctuary?\"\n\"No exception. Only human cultivators can participate in this event. Oh, right. I forgot to tell you. If you don't have five participants, your group will be disqualified from entering this event, thus losing the bed by default.\"\n\"Hohoh? Is that how you are going to play?\"\nOne after another, Yan Xiang kept using underhanded tricks to suppress Leo.\nLeo's eye color changed from green to red. Since Yan Xiang shamelessly tried to cheat his way to victory, he stopped playing nice.\n\"Five representatives, is it?\"\nLeo's eyes shifted toward Esen. He then ejected a dozen barrels of tea from his spatial ring.\n\"Esen.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Could you go and fetch us the REMAINING representatives that are still DEAD sleeping?\"\n\"Remaining representatives? Aren't we… Ohoh?\"\n\"Yeah. Your FRIENDS from your HOMETOWN are still sleeping like CORPSES, right? Why don't you go and RESURRECT them? Oh, don't forget to drown them with TEA so that they can feel ALIVE again!\"\nEsen might be loud and obnoxious most of the time, but she was still a former empress, who used to govern the world. She instantly caught on the hint.\n\"Yeah, I remember them. I'm still carrying their gears in my storage rings. I'll be right back. Oh, I'll take those too.\"\nEsen collected the barrels of tea and flew back to the abandoned courtyard.\nAfter Esen had left, Leo crossed his arms and faced Yan Xiang.\n\"As you wish, she will bring the contestants here shortly. You don't mind waiting an hour or two for my guys to arrive, right?\"\nYan Xiang frowned and glanced at the departing girl. For some reason, he couldn't measure Esen's cultivation base. But since Esen could fly, Yan Xiang guessed that her strength might be at the 3rd or 4th stage at best. After all, she didn't look old.\nYan Zhu also secretly ogled Esen. As Esen was a pretty blond high-elf, her beauty was unique and otherworldly. Her face, her flawless smooth skin, and and her silky hair made Esen a lot more attractive than Qi Niu.\nHe wanted her.\nWhile Yan Xiang contemplated what he should do in this situation, Yan Zhu came up with an idea.\n\"Father!\"\n\"What?\" Yan Xiang looked at his third son on the flying ship.\n\"Let's add a new wager. Since Immortal Florida Man delays the event, we need some compensation.\"\n\"Compensation?\" Yan Xiang raised his eyebrow. He had no idea what his son was cooking, \"What compensation?\"\nYan Zhu's voice was so crisp that everybody could hear it.\n\"We can allow Immortal Florida Man to take the verification test later. But since he made us wait, we will impose a penalty for his group. Of course, we will not do anything to him. But we will add a new wager on top of the previous agreement.\"\nYan Xiang's face turned dark. As he knew the behavior of his lecherous son, he knew what Yan Zhu might ask for, \"What is the wager?\"\nYan Zhu pointed at the girls behind Leo.\n\"They were from the Amazonian Sanctuary, right? According to my concubine, they are the traitors of their sect. Therefore, it is our duty to uphold justice when the members of the Jianghu Alliance request our aid. We will imprison those women, including the girl that has just left.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nOverheard the conversation, Leo raised his eyebrow, bewildered by Yan Zhu's dumb logic. Xu Nuan glared at Yan Zhu in anger while Yao Qiqi and the girls panicked. As for Taxi, Ricardo, Gao Yan, and Tiger Swordsman, they were enraged.\n\"Isn't that a bit overbearing, boy?\" Leo sarcastically laughed.\nYan Zhu sneered, \"I didn't say that we would imprison everybody right away. I said that we would add this condition to the wager. Therefore, we will only arrest those girls if your side loses. Of course, if you win, your crime will be pardoned.\"\n\"I see. Is that how you're going to play it?\"\nLeo deeply inhaled, suppressing the urge to nuke this city to oblivion. He had a thousand ideas on how to murder Yan Zhu as painfully as possible. But for now, he needed to teach these arrogant people a lesson.\n\"Well, since you set the rules, make sure you play by the book, sir. By the way, since my juniors will take a while, why don't you show us how your representatives verify your age with that boulder?\"\n\"Hahahahaha! Sure!\"\nYan Zhu and Qi Niu jumped down from the flying ship. Three men in silver armor also leaped onto the stage while holding the banners of the Yan Clan.\nThe third prince introduced himself. He cupped his fist and saluted every spectator, except Leo's group.\n\"Greetings, fellow Daoists! My name is Yan Zhu, and I'm 17 this year! I'll be joining this season's event as the Yan Clan's representative!\"\n.\n\"Huh?\"\nXu Nuan, Tang Xuan, Tang Tian, and bystanders from neutral clans and sects were confused. As they had interacted with Yan Zhu in the past, they were aware of Yan Zhu's real age.\nIt was definitely not 17!\nHe was over 150 years old!\nWhile the spectators from the neutral faction looked perplexed, the accomplices from the Jianghu Alliance either clapped or praised the third prince.\n\"The prince is very talented. He is only 17, but his aura is very domineering!\"\n\"What is his cultivation base now? Is it the soul transformation stage?\"\n\"17 years old at the soul transformation stage?! The imperial family is really blessed! Hahahaha!\"\nSome of them sounded sarcastic, but nobody pointed out the irregularity of the age and Yan Zhu's cultivation base.\nMeanwhile, Yao Qiqi and Gao Yan were terrified. They thought that they were the chosen ones as they managed to reach the nascent soul stage at a young age. Unfortunately, someone appeared and declared that they were more talented than them.\nXu Nuan noticed their dark expressions. She patted them and whispered.\n\"Don't believe in them. Those liars are making things up. That third prince's real age is 150 or so. It seems that the tournament is rigged.\"\n\"W-What? It's rigged?!\"\n\"Precisely so. Lord Florida Man already told us what happened. Yan Xiang is trying to suppress Lord Florida Man and expel him from the continent. They're using the tournament and the wager contract as a tool to trap him.\"\n\"W-Will we be okay?\"\n\"I… don't know.\"\nXu Nuan couldn't come up with the right words to soothe Yao Qiqi and Gao Yan. She gazed at Leo, trying to guess what he had been scheming or thinking.\n.\nWhile Xu Nuan and others speculated what Leo would do in this situation, Yan Zhu patted Qi Niu's back, ordering her to hit the verification boulder.\n\"You first.\"\n\"…Alright, husband.\"\nBecause of Yan Zhu's help, Qi Niu managed to advance to the golden core stage. Among her peers, she was considered a genius. But when everybody compared her to the old men here, she looked cute.\nYan Zhu brought her along so that she could earn some reputation from the seniors of the Jianghu Alliance. Also, this would be her debut appearance as his official concubine.\nQi Niu mustered her earth element Qi into her fist. Then, she punched the boulder.\nBOOM\nThe boulder shone. Then, words appeared on the flat surface as the artifact confirmed Qi Niu's age and her cultivation base.\n.\nName: Qi Niu\nAge: 16\nCultivation Base: 3rd-Rank Golden Core Stage[1]\nPower Output: 1st-Rank Golden Core Stage\n.\nThe court officials and members from the Jianghu Alliance nodded in approval. Although Qi Niu was a lot weaker than their disguised elders, her achievement was acceptable.\n\"Good! Next!\"\nYan Zhu let his three subordinates hit the boulder. All of them were war veterans who had drunk enough tea of rejuvenation.\nBOOM\n.\nName: Ou Jang\nAge: 14\nCultivation Base: 7th-Rank Soul Transformation Stage\nPower Output: 5th-Rank Soul Transformation Stage\n.\nAs soon as the result appeared, the accomplices grinned while the people from the Tang Clan smacked their lips in disgust.\nThe person was obviously cheating. It was impossible for a 14-year-old boy to be 1.8 meters tall and reach this cultivation rank!\nThe next two soldiers hit the boulder as well. Like the first soldier, the result showed up as a 15-year-old boy having the cultivation base of a soul transformation.\nThen, it was Yan Zhu's turn.\nBOOM\n.\nName: Yan Zhu\nAge: 16\nCultivation Base: 9th-Rank Soul Transformation Stage\nPower Output: 9th-Rank Soul Transformation Stage\n.\nYan Zhu burst into laughter while his accomplices chuckled. It seemed that Yan Zhu drank too much tea that his bone age regressed too much.\nAfter Yan Zhu's team finished their turns, Yan Xiang called other groups over.\n\"Next, the Ouyang Clan! Show everybody how far you cultivated your juniors!\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\n.\n.\nAn hour later, all seven teams of participants finished their turn, except for Leo's team.\nTiger Swordsman, Xu Nuan, and Leo's expressions were dark. Except for Qi Niu, all participants were soul transformation stage cultivators.\n\"What a shameless bunch,\" Xu Nuan grumbled.\n\"These people are despicable, Lord Florida Man! We should void the wagers and go back. There's no point competing with these cheaters,\" Tiger Swordsman was disappointed in Yan Zhu and the Jianghu Alliance's immaturity. He was disillusioned.\nLeo remained silent. He stroked his braided beard, waiting for Esen to finish her preparation.\nUnfortunately, Yan Xiang didn't want to wait. He shouted, commanding Leo to bring his team forward.\n\"It's your turn, Immortal Florida Man! If you fail to present five contestants for this event, your team will be disqualified!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply sighed. He glanced at Gao Yan.\n\"You go first.\"\nGao Yan trembled in fear, \"R-Really? Me? Against all those 7th-stage cultivators?\"\n\"Yeah, you. Go and get this over with.\"\n\"B-But I-I-I might die!\"\n\"You won't. Trust me.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan reluctantly got on the stage. He dragged his feet and looked back at Leo several times before he gave up resisting.\nFacing the boulder, Gao Yan mustered his courage. He closed his eyes as the memory of his past flashed before his eyes. After the short flashback moment, Gao Yan's aura soared.\nRUMBLE\nInstead of exuding the air of a nascent soul cultivator, his Qi volume surpassed that of a soul formation cultivator!\nThen, he threw a punch.\nBOOM\nThe result came out.\n.\nName: Gao Yan\nAge: 16\nCultivation Base: 1st-Rank Nascent Soul Stage\nPower Output: 5th-Rank Soul Formation Stage\n.\nAs soon as the result appeared, Yan Zhu, Yan Xiang, and the people of Jianghu Alliance changed their expressions. They looked at Gao Yan in disbelief.\n\"I-Is he really 16?!\"\n\"H-He is legit, right?\"\n\"That… that's a real talent. He's the true gem!\"\nHesitant appeared in the accomplices' eyes as they coveted Gao Yan. They secretly schemed in their mind, hoping to poach Gao Yan from Leo after this event.\n\"NEXT!\"\nYan Xiang swallowed his astonishment. He pressed on, trying to push Leo to send weaker juniors to fight.\nLeo pursed his lips. He looked at Yao Qiqi for a moment. However, he immediately changed his mind.\nYao Qiqi was too young. As she couldn't use Cat in combat, the fight might be too risky for her. Leo couldn't use Cat either as Yan Xiang forbade him from using any monster beast.\n\"Immortal Florida Man, your next representative?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo slightly opened his mouth and was about to order one of the tamers to jump on the stage. However, his sharp nose caught a mixed scent of Esen and a group of strangers with a similar odor. A wide smile appeared on his face.\n\"They're here.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nAs soon as Leo finished his sentence, Esen descended and landed on the stage. Following her, two girls and one boy also arrived.\nThe boy came with a set of worn-out purple knight armor, carrying a massive bastard sword on his back as if he were inspired by a certain famous manga series. Meanwhile, one of the girls only had a tattered black robe and wielded a long cane. As for the last girl, she wore a black gothic dress. Strangely, they had silver hair, and they wrapped a piece of cloth around their eyes.\nEsen turned around and winked at Leo. She reported her achievement.\n\"As you ordered, I \"resurrected\" them and \"feed\" them those.\"\nLeo let out a long sigh of relief, \"Well, done. Now, show them how it's done.\"\n\"Alright!\" Esen cackled and patted the cane girl, \"You first. Go, Ivy.\"\nIvy, the new girl, smiled at Esen and courteously bowed, \"Yes, Your Holiness.\"\nShe looked up and walked toward the boulder. Then, she lightly jabbed it with the back of her fist.\nBOOOOOM!\nThe boulder got pushed back five meters! A small crack appeared on its surface.\nThen, the result appeared.\n.\nName: Ivy Archlich\nAge: 17\nCultivation Base: 9th-Rank Quasi-Immortal Stage\nPower Output: 1st-Rank Earth Celestial Stage\n[1] Cultivation Base is graded in 8 major realms. Each realm has 9 minor ranks. The grades are as follows;\n1st Stage - Muscle Tempering Stage\n2nd Stage - Qi Condensation Stage\n3rd Stage - Foundation Establishment Stage\n4th Stage - Golden Core Stage\n5th Stage - Nascent Soul Stage\n6th Stage - Soul Formation Stage\n7th Stage - Soul Transformation Stage\n8th Stage - Quasi-Immortal Stage\nAs for the minor ranks, it is graded from low to high.

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 160 – Paralympic Host Refuses to Void Florida Man's World Records as 99% of Athletes Self-Identified as Disabled\nIn this cultivation world, a person's strength was generally categorized into eight major tiers. Each tier was nicknamed as \"Stage\" so everybody could compare their strength with their peers.\nThe eight stages were as follows;\n1st stage – Muscle Tempering Stage\n2nd stage – Qi Condensation Stage\n3rd stage - Foundation Establishment Stage\n4th stage – Golden Core Stage\n5th stage – Nascent Soul Stage\n6th stage – Soul Formation Stage\n7th stage – Soul Transformation Stage\n8th stage – Quasi Immortal Stage\nEach major stage was separated into nine minor ranks. Everybody started at the first rank. After a cultivator accumulated enough Qi, their rank naturally rose.\nThis general knowledge was widely accepted as the world's standard. There could be no other cultivation stage beyond the 8th stage. If there were, the person might be an immortal or someone who practiced an unorthodox cultivation method.\nBut in this case, the name of the new cultivation stage wasn't new to Yan Xiang and the people from the big clans. As their ancestors transcended the mortal realm, they were aware of the immortal realm's standards and cultivation bases.\nUnlike the mortal ranks, the immortals were graded into nine major stages. Coincidentally, the first rank of immortal stages was the Earth Celestial Stage.\n\"An immortal?!\" Yan Xiang was petrified.\nIvy, the blindfolded archlich, silently stared at the boulder. Her tattered black robe fluttered by the wind, revealing her jade white skin and her long legs. She pursed her lips, unsatisfied with the result.\n\"Your Holiness, can I use my full strength? This is humiliating.\"\nEsen smacked Ivy's back. She cackled while her cold eyes glanced at Yan Zhu and Yan Xiang.\n\"That's enough. If you hit it too hard, the others won't have a chance to show their strength. Also, that sly fox will definitely find fault with us and disqualify our people again.\"\n\"… Understood, Your Holiness.\"\nIvy receded and stepped down from the stage. After Ivy got down, Leo gave her a new set of casual clothes as the tattered robe was too revealing. As she went commando under the short black robe, Leo, Gao Yan, and Tiger Swordsman could see almost everything whenever the wind blew.\n\"Little girl, put this on. You're practically naked.\"\nIvy looked up and gazed at Leo. She flinched and paused for a few seconds as if she saw something unexpected. After coming back to her senses, Ivy bowed like a medieval aristocrat.\n\"I'm grateful, Holy One. Your contribution will forever be remembered. The spirit will praise your generosity for millennia.\"\n\"…\"\nSomething was wrong about her. Ivy's speech made Leo cringe. Still, Leo was curious about her. He leaned closer to her ear and whispered.\n\"Are you an arch lich?\"\n\"Yes, Holy One.\"\n\"Can you also summon undead?\"\n\"Yes, Holy One.\"\n\"I see. By the way, why are you calling me Holy One?\"\n\"Because the purity of your Virgin Yang is as clean as newborn babies, yet your shadow hides the traces of death. Heaven's luck gathers around you, but you fail to grasp or use them. You and Her Holiness the Empress have a similar air. Since you are her equal, we cannot treat you the same way we treat cultivators. You deserve our utmost respect and worship.\"\n\"…\"\nShe sounded too cryptic. Leo couldn't understand her.\nWhile Leo sized up Ivy, the next servant of Esen proceeded to the boulder. However, Yan Xiang stopped them.\n\"Halt! You must be cheating! You all are disqualified!\"\nAs Leo had predicted, Yan Xiang attempted to ruin their scheme once again. But this time, Esen confronted Yan Xiang.\n\"That's a baseless accusation. What's the evidence, smart ass?\"\n\"Evidence? It's right here! Do you think I'm stupid?! Who do you think I am? I've been the emperor of this country for over 500 years, and I have met every quasi-immortal on the continent! Someone under 18 can't possibly reach the quasi-immortal stage!\"\n\"Are you sure?\" Esen held back her laughter.\n\"Of course! At the soul formation stage, it usually takes 10 years to complete one soul array to get stronger. Everybody needs at least 10 arrays to stabilize their foundation! Even the smartest and most talented cultivator still needed to spend 2-3 years per array!\"\nThe other cultivators nodded as some of them already experienced such hardship. An average soul formation cultivator mostly spent at least 100 years getting stuck in this stage to refine their foundation before they advanced to the next rank. Thus, reaching the soul transformation stage under the age of 18 was impossible.\nStill, Yan Xiang's words also contradicted his allies, who were his representatives. Everybody was younger than 18!\nEsen caught on to the flaw of Yan Xiang's logic. She crossed her arms and tilted her head. Then, she glanced at Leo.\nLeo had been listening to them. Since Esen didn't bother pointing out the faults, he had no choice but to take the initiative in the conversation. He stopped talking to Ivy and faced the emperor. Then, Leo pointed at Yan Xiang, mimicking a certain famous lawyer in a video game series.\n\"OBJECTION! RELEVENCE!\"\n\"…What?\" Yan Xiang frowned. \"What do you object, Immortal Florida Man? Relevance? Do you think my reasoning is irrelevant?\"\nLeo smirked and stepped on the arena stage.\n\"It is indeed irrelevant, emperor. Do you think everybody in this world has to follow your standard, or else, their achievement is unacceptable?\"\n\"Yes! Look. You are an immortal. Tell me. How long did it take for you to become what you are today? How many years did you spend as a mortal?!\"\nLeo smirked, \"165!\"\nYan Xiang burst into laughter, \"See? You even spent a long time as a mortal!\"\n\"165 years is the time I took I spent training from the 1st stage mortal to THIS!\"\nLeo clenched his fist, and a thunderous sound and black electrical statics erupted from his palm. Then, his entire right arm turned black as his cancer cells charged their energy, getting ready to unleash a black lightning bolt upon his foe.\nThe sky instantly turned black. Dark clouds gathered as if they came here to answer Leo's summon. Thunderbolts of various colors flashed in the sky.\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang and others widened their eyes in astonishment and disbelief. Some of them had barely survived green or purple lightning bolts. However, they saw yellow, orange, red, and black lightning flash in the clouds.\nLeo steeled the topic back to the point. He released his hand, and the tribulation clouds dispersed. His right arm also returned to normal.\n\"You see, Mr. Spineless Kim Jung Un. Although I stagnated for several ten thousand years doing nothing but eating and farming, I only needed 100ish years to become what I am today. Therefore, you cannot enforce your standard to the foreigners, whose standard is superior to your cheap 3rd world country's ass.\"\n\"W-What?\"\nLeo patted on Esen's head. Then, he winked at her.\n\"Esen, when you first learned a cultivation technique, how old were you?\"\nEsen smirked, \"Seven!\"\n\"Then, how long did it take for you to reach your current stage?\"\nAgain, Esen laughed and came up with a random number, \"Seven!\"\nThe crowd widened their eyes in astonishment. They murmured, doubting Leo's reasoning. Everybody still believed that both Yan Xiang and Leo cheated, but they waited to see how Leo would come up with an excuse.\nLeo turned to Ivy next, \"What about you? How old were you when you stopped being a commoner?\"\nIvy remained expressionless. She spoke the truth, \"Ten.\"\n\"And how long did it take from the commoner stage to your current stage?\"\n\"If we count the training period and the baptism period, three years.\"\n\"WHAT?!\" Yan Xiang and his people couldn't believe it, \"Liar! You must be older than 17! You must have drunk a lot of rejuvenation tea!\"\nLeo widely grinned. He turned back and started attacking Yan Xiang's logic.\n\"By your logic, nobody under 18 should reach the soul transformation stage?\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"Then, what in the frozen hell are those guys over there, there, there, there, and there? If I remember correctly, there are a bunch of young brats with that strength. How are you going to explain that?\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang's expression turned stiff. He widened his eyes and touched his mouth, realizing that he slipped up. Yan Zhu, Ouyang Ke, and Situ Bai bitterly laughed as they already realized it long ago, but nobody dared to stop Yan Xiang from screwing himself.\n\"Let me question you again, you idiot sandwich. By your standard, do you think those 14-year-old brats are so talented that they got stronger faster than so many white-haired geezers around here?!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Tell me, donkey emperor! You said yourself that it's impossible to become a soul transformation cultivator by the age of 18. Then, what in the sunny Ohio are those kids?! Did you cheat, donkey docker?!\"\nYan Xiang was at a loss for words. He was aware of his mistake, and he couldn't come up with an excuse.\nSitu Bai couldn't sit still anymore. He stepped up and refuted Leo.\n\"There is no fixed standard, Immortal Florida Man! Our people are just too talented!\"\n\"Then, nobody cheated?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Of course not! How could we cheat in this prestige event?!\"\n\"I see! So, none of you cheated, am I right?\"\n\"Exactly!\"\n\"Good. Now, donkey docking emperor. Are you going to accuse my people that we are cheating?\"\nYan Xiang frowned. He smacked his lips and was about to press on the accusation.\nHowever, Situ Bai jumped up on the boulder and whispered in the emperor's ear.\n\"P-Please stop what you're doing, Your Majesty. If you keep accusing them, they might really kill us all. They're probably the immortal friends of Florida Man.\"\nYan Xiang glared at Situ Bai, \"And what are we going to do? Send our men to their deaths? If we let them enter the tournament, we can't win!\"\nSitu Bai coughed and reminded Yan Xiang of their objective.\n\"You Majesty, we simply need to buy time for our ancestors to arrive. Even though we can't win this tournament, he has already shown his weaknesses. One of them is merely a nascent soul cultivator. As long as we can kill that guy to avenge the second prince, the rest of us can forfeit the tournament. Then, we will have the last laugh since he can't do anything about the dead disciple!\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang disliked the plan as it was pre-determined that their side would lose. Still, facing multiple immortals was too risky. He had no choice but to find a way to save his representatives from Leo's wrath.\n\"Alright,\" Yan Xiang made up his mind. \"We can't judge cultivators by anybody's standard. So be it. Go ahead and show us what your representatives can do!\"\nGetting the permission, Leo was satisfied. He gestured to Esen and the other two to end this farce.\n\"Esen, you go last. Let your subordinates show a bit of their strength. Use the minimum force.\"\nEsen acknowledged the order. She commanded the boy to go first.\n\"Go, Marc. Use one-tenth of your strength like how your sister did.\"\nThe boy knight with a large bastard sword beamed her with a bright smile, \"Okay, Your Holiness. I'll do my best!\"\nHe rushed to the boulder. Without using his sword, he lightly poked it with his finger.\nPU!\nHis finger left behind a hole in the flat surface. Then, the boulder of verification revealed the brief information of the boy.\n.\nName: Marc Dullahan\nAge: 12\nCultivation Base: 9th Rank Quasi Immortal Stage\nPower Output: 5th Rank Earth Celestial Stage\n.\nMarc looked up. Even though he was blindfolded, he could see everything clearly. Upon seeing the result, he gasped.\n\"Whoops. I overdid it.\"\nMarc nervously looked back. Then, he noticed Esen's death glare. He immediately bowed 90 degrees, \"I'm so sorry, Your Holiness! I didn't mean to!\"\nPLOP\nBecause Marc bowed too fast, his head slightly slipped off from his neck. Fortunately, Marc noticed it and immediately grabbed his head before it fell off his neck. Then, he returned to the Ivy's side while sweating profusely.\nEsen slightly shook her head and complained, \"Still an idiot as usual.\"\nLeo laughed, \"He's cute, though. He looks like an innocent boy.\"\n\"You won't laugh at him anymore if you see him fight seriously.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm looking forward to it. What about the other girl?\"\nLeo and Esen gazed at the last silver-haired girl in a gothic dress. As she came here without a storage ring or a weapon, Leo was curious about her.\n\"Death Knight, I assume,\" Leo randomly guessed.\n\"You got it! I'm surprised you know about her.\"\n\"Just guessing. I was thinking banshee or vampire, but she's too silent to be one of those. A stoic knight suits her more.\"\n\"Hahahaha! You're a fan of my Molg Empire, I see. Wanna join my kingdom?\"\n\"Nope. You join mine, not the other way around.\"\n\"Tsk.\"\nThe girl in question silently walked toward the boulder. She gently stroked on its surface. Then, she turned around to leave without looking back at the result.\nRUMBLE\nThe entire boulder cracked, forcing Yan Xiang and Situ Bai to jump down. The result appeared.\n.\nName: Beatrice D. Knight\nAge: 17\nCultivation Base: 9th Rank Quasi Immortal Stage\nPower Output: 1st Rank Sky Celestial Stage\n.\nLooking at the result, the spectators' expressions stiffened.\nSky Celestial?!\nLeo was also curious as nobody had taught him about the immortal stages yet. He asked Esen for some clues.\n\"You've fought with the immortals, right? How many ranks are there in total?\"\nEsen chuckled and walked toward the boulder. Then, she raised four fingers.\n\"Four?\"\n\"No,\" Esen stopped in front of the boulder. Then, she threw a punch. \"Nine!\"\nBOOOM\nThe boulder exploded upon impact. Rocks and debris flew everywhere. Yet, the destroyed boulder still faintly released some words in the air, displaying the result before it quickly faded to smoke.\n.\nName: Esen Sydin IV\nAge: 7\nCultivation Base: Error\nPower Output: Error",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 161 – Florida Man Wins Lottery, Receives Gold Digging Catfisher as Prize.\nYan Xiang, Yan Luo, Yan Zhu, Situ Bai, and Ouyang Ke's faces were as white as a sheet. They were horrified by the presence of Esen's subordinates.\nMoreover, the boulder of verification was known for its durability. Their ancestors once praised that it could withstand a heaven celestial stage immortal's strike. However, Esen and Beatrice easily destroyed it.\nIt was a clear indication that both women were at least at the heaven celestial stage immortal, aka the 3rd level immortal!\nRealizing his mistake, Yan Xiang regretted that he chose to provoke Leo. He turned around to look at Tang Xuan.\nThe former patriarch of the Tang Clan deeply sighed and silently saluted Yan Xiang. He prayed for the emperor's fate and future. Tang Xuan believed he did everything he could, but Yan Xiang ended up seeking demise.\nTang Xuan looked away from Yan Xiang and gazed at Leo, hoping that the latter would not lump him together with the Yan Family and their entourage.\n'I hope Daoist Florida Man will spare my clan after this. I already did everything I could.'\n.\n.\nEsen puffed her chest and strode back in elation. When she was about to walk past Leo, the latter raised his hand. Esen noticed it and instinctively high-fived him even though she had never done it before – Everything came from a muscle memory, which she inherited from Leo's blood.\n\"Well done.\"\n\"Of course. I'm an empress for a reason.\"\nThe five representatives on Leo's side all gathered. Esen, Beatrice, Marc, Ivy, and Gao Yan were ready for the next event.\nYan Xiang's face was still pale. His previously arrogant demeanor vanished. Still, he waved his hand and swept away rocks and debris on the arena stage with his Qi.\nAfter the stage was clean, Yan Xiang stood still for a minute. Once his breathing pace returned to normal, he announced.\n\"All eight teams have been qualified. The preliminary round is over. Now, we will introduce the tournament bracket and the rules.\"\nYan Xiang snapped his fingers. Situ Bai and Ouyang Ke pulled out white talismans and tossed them into the air.\nThe talismans floated and formed a square array, acting as a projecting monitor. Like a real TV screen, it showed five empty tournament brackets. Each bracket consisted of eight participants.\nYan Xiang explained, \"This will be the main theme of this season's tournament. All teams will send one of their members to participate in each bracket. The winners of each bracket will be the finalists, and they will fight in a free-for-all combat in the final.\"\nLeo and Esen nodded as it sounded fair. However, Gao Yan sweated profusely.\nBy these rules, Gao Yan might have to duel against a 7th-stage cultivator at least once. As he was still at the 5th stage, Gao Yan was not confident that he could win.\nGao Yan turned to Leo, asking for permission, \"S-Senior. Can I forfeit before I go up on the stage?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Did you forget the gun and the lightsaber?\"\n\"B-But I don't know any nascent soul techniques or special moves!\"\n\"Just go out there and shoot your opponent. If you miss, just swing your lightsaber. The force will guide you.\"\n\"Force?\"\n\"Use the force, young Padawan. Size matters not.\"\n\"But my techniques…\"\n\"Shut it and be confident in yourself. I heard you have been practicing the Sword Saint's techniques for years. Do you think your hard work means nothing?\"\n\"But the strength gap…\"\n\"Even ants can take down an elephant. You aren't alone. Isn't Thora a part of your strength? She's with you the whole time!\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan finally remembered that he had a sentient dao avatar as his dao companion. As a dao avatar, she was considered as Gao Yan's power. Therefore, she could help him during combat.\nBehind Gao Yan, Thora had been following her boyfriend since the beginning of the journey. Except for Leo, Esen, and Esen's new subordinates, only a cultivator stronger than soul transformation could see her.\nYan Xiang and others long noticed Thora's presence. However, they disregarded her as they mistook her as a common dao avatar, which sometimes came out from their master's body. It was a normal occurrence, and every nascent soul cultivator had one.\nThora gave Leo a thumbs up. Then, she embraced Gao Yan from behind.\n'Be confident, husband. You are stronger than you think. We can defeat those trashy cultivators.'\n\"…\"\nHearing his girlfriend's encouragement, Gao Yan's hope was ignited. He no longer sulked.\n\"…I'll try my best.\"\nLeo snickered, \"You will surely do your best. You're a main character after all.\"\n\"Main character?\"\n\"Never mind that.\"\n\"???\"\nAlthough Leo wasn't 100% certain, from his point of view, Gao Yan appeared to have the qualifications of a main character.\nHe had an abnormal amount of Qi and strength surpassing his actual cultivation base. He had a unique girlfriend, who acted as Gao Yan's mentor and bodyguard. He was a hardworking kid with a humble background. Moreover, he was on a lucky streak lately after Leo had met him.\nIt was a wild guess, but Leo believed he was right.\nWhile Leo and Gao Yan chatted, Yan Xiang began calling the representatives to get on the stage to draw the lottery tickets, deciding which bracket they would be in.\n\"Immortal Florida Man. Could your team come up and draw a lottery ticket for your representatives?\"\nLeo shrugged and gestured for Esen and others to finish this farce.\nEsen and her three subordinates leisurely leaped to the stage and stood along with the other contestants. Gao Yan was the last to arrive.\nYan Xiang explained, \"Each team will send their representative to draw a lottery. All five of you will be on a different bracket by default.\"\nThe emperor gestured his one of his team members to be the example. The person was a 14-year-old soul transformation cultivator. The latter walked up to his emperor.\nA cubic box appeared out of thin air. It came with a circle hole on top, which allowed any adult man to put his hand inside. It floated toward the boy's chest.\nNot thinking much, the cultivator inserted his hand into the box and found eight iron balls. He picked one up and showed it to the crowd.\nIt showed the Chinese number \"8\".\nThe boy passed the iron ball to Yan Xiang. The latter summoned another box and put the ball inside. Afterward, the cultivator's name automatically appeared on the first bracket.\nAfter the soul transformation cultivator showed them how it was done, Yan Xiang elaborated.\n\"Now that the imperial court's team has sent the first representative, their four remaining participants will wait until the first bracket is full. Then, we will move on to the second bracket. But before that, every team has to send one person to enter the first bracket.\"\nThe rules were simple and easy to understand. Every team could choose which contestant to send in a certain bracket. However, it came with a nasty scheme as Yan Xiang immediately called out Leo's team.\n\"Immortal Florida Man. Please select your representative to enter the first bracket. Who will you choose?\"\nLeo and Esen knitted their brows as they sensed something amiss. Although the call seemed random, it hid a certain tactic that they could see.\nTesting the water, Leo ordered Ivy to go first.\n\"Ivy. You're up.\"\n\"Yes, Holy One.\"\nIvy, who wore the spare robes of a tamer girl, walked toward the box and picked an iron ball from the inside.\nThe number was 7.\nThe imperial agent's face instantly turned dark. He lamented to his fate.\nIvy's name appeared on the first bracket. Her opponent was none other than the fake 14-year-old boy.\nThe other teams secretly laughed at Yan Zhu. One by one, they sent their men to pick their lotto.\nAfter the first bracket was filled, it was time for the second bracket. Then, Yan Xiang subtly revealed his nasty scheme.\n\"Immortal Florida Man. Could you please?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo slightly nodded. With just this call, Leo was 50% sure that the tournament was half-rigged. It seemed that they were targeting something.\n\"Marc, you're up next.\"\nThe white-haired boy innocently smiled, \"Yes, Holy One!\"\nHe went up and picked the number \"1\".\nWhile Marc drew the lotto ball, Leo scanned everybody's reactions and expressions. By observing other people, he noticed one thing in common.\nTheir throats vibrated, and they secretly glanced at each other.\n\"Vibrating throats?\" Leo narrowed his eyes.\nEsen also noticed it. She whispered, \"Voice transmission techniques. They secretly talk to each other with a Qi frequency trick. If you adjust your ears a little, you can eavesdrop on their conversation.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLeo slightly grinned and concentrated. His cancer cells adjusted his gills and ears. Then, Leo began to hear strange noises of mixed radio frequencies.\nThe sounds of people became more audible.\n'The boy is not our target. Send another dummy.'\n'Should we send mid-horse this time? He seems weak.'\n'Don't underestimate that white-haired boy. I saw him pierce through the verification boulder with his finger. He's a lot stronger than Gao Yan. We'll send another low-tier horse as planned.'\n'Dodge that boy. Send another weak pawn.'\nAs Leo was new to this technique, he could only hear the voices from the crowd, which had a lower cultivation base. As for the soul transformation cultivators, Leo couldn't hear them yet.\nHowever, the information was enough for Leo to figure out their plan.\n\"I guess Gao Yan is in danger.\"\nEsen nodded, \"Indeed, he is. I'm sure they will send their strongest fighter to join the same bracket as Gao Yan's. Should we order him to forfeit the matches?\"\n\"No. We'll let him struggle a bit. We have necromancers on our side. If things go south, we can resurrect him, right?\"\n\"We can, but he will lose his status as a cultivator. By the way, do you have some healing pills for emergencies?\"\n\"I do. Don't worry.\"\n\"Okay, then. Let's sit back and watch the show.\"\n.\n.\nThe lottery pull continued. After Marc, Yan Xiang ordered Leo to pick a fighter first.\nLeo sent Beatrice to join the third bracket. Then, he and Esen eavesdropped their conversation.\nAgain, everybody chose to send their remaining weakest cultivator to face Beatrice. But strangely, Yan Xiang's team still kept Qi Niu and Yan Zhu in their team.\nNext, it was the fourth bracket. As Leo already figured out Yan Xiang's plan, he boldly sent Gao Yan up.\nAs Leo and Esen had predicted, everybody got noisy. They urged their teams to dispatch the strongest fighter to join the 4th tournament bracket.\nGao Yan got the lucky number \"7\".\nThe draw became a scramble. Yan Xiang's agents and allies competed with each other to draw the lotto next. They even loudly prayed for a certain number. Surprisingly, Yan Xiang sent Yan Zhu to join this bracket.\n\"Let me get that eight!\"\n\"No, mine!\"\n\"Me! He's mine!\"\nBut in the end, a 9th-rank soul transformation cultivator from the Situ Clan got the 8th ball. He would face Gao Yan.\nEverybody on Yan Xiang's side silently rejoiced. Their eyes gleamed, eager to see the demise of Gao Yan even though he had done nothing wrong. Everybody disregarded the last bracket.\nEsen snorted and proceeded to finish this farce. She drew the number 1 and got down from the stage.\nThe remaining representatives lifelessly finished their tasks. Qi Niu, the weakest link among the bunch, got the short straw as she picked up number 2.\nQi Niu trembled as she sneaked glances at Esen. She then rushed to Yan Zhu.\n\"Husband! Can I forfeit the match? I can't possibly defeat that woman!\"\nYan Zhu was still over the moon as he was in the same bracket as Gao Yan. He looked forward to the fight to the point that he disregarded Qi Niu's wellbeing.\n\"Don't worry about it, Niu'er. We told them that the fight was a non-lethal one. That immortal won't kill you. If she does, it will ruin her reputation and her future. There's an unspoken rule among cultivators that no senior should harm or kill a junior no matter the reason. If someone violates this, the other seniors from the higher realm will hunt him down!\"\n\"B-But we did kill a bunch of commoners and weak cultivators.\"\n\"That unspoken rules don't apply to people with backgrounds. Those peasants can rot and die for all we care!\"\n\"…\"\nQi Niu felt a bit better. However, her heart still beat like death metal drums as she couldn't get rid of a bad feeling in her chest.\nShe didn't realize that Esen secretly glanced at her. Moreover, under Qi Niu's foot, a purple shadow slipped into her shadow and coiled around her left ankle.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 162 – Florida Man Sued Doctor for Prescribing Antibiotics Instead of Heroin\nEvery participant's tournament bracket and opponents were decided. Yan Xiang then waved his hand. Then, four additional arena stages were elevated from the ground.\nYan Xiang then reminded everybody of the purpose of this tournament.\n\"Remember, this tournament exists for the disciples and juniors to spar and gain experience. Purposely crippling or severely injuring your opponents is strictly forbidden. Accidents may happen, but you should not fight to kill your opponent no matter what!\"\nThe spectators had a complicated expressions on their faces. It was obvious that Yan Xiang said this to restrain Leo's overpowered immortals from abusing their power.\nLeo scoffed, \"Likewise. I hope there won't be any more dirty tricks. Otherwise…\"\n\"…\"\nIntimidated, Yan Xiang's hands trembled. Still, he didn't give up on his plan.\nUnbeknownst to Leo, when Yan Xiang created the platforms, he inserted some talismans underneath. Those talismans would activate whenever Yan Xiang wanted to, and their effects varied, depending on the chosen talisman.\nThe emperor continued explaining to hide his anxiousness.\n\"The match is decided when a fighter gives up, falls off the stage, or is unable to continue fighting. As we said before, killing your opponent is strictly forbidden. If someone kills their opponent, the murderer will be instantly disqualified and arrested for murder! No exception!\"\nLeo snorted as he didn't plan on killing anybody yet. He looked at his juniors and warned them, \"Don't kill. Leave them alive.\"\nEsen pouted, \"Why should we? They're playing dirty.\"\n\"We can get them later. We can play by their rules for the time being. If they break the rules first, we unalive them.\"\n\"Fair enough.\"\nYan Xiang didn't waste time. He called the contestants to the stages before Leo could find fault with him.\n\"Participant number one and two of all brackets, you may step on the stage!\"\nEverybody stepped down from the main stage while the fighters looked confused at first. But when they found their tournament stage, they leaped to their arena.\nMarc got on the first arena's stage while Esen jumped on the arena number five. As for the others, they observed their opponents and cheered for their allies.\nMarc's opponent was a soul transformation cultivator. He was 6'2 tall, and his muscle was a lot bulkier. Moreover, he grew a full beard. No matter how everybody looked at him, he didn't look like someone under 20 years old.\n\"First match! Marc Dullahan of Florida Domain versus He Man from Mount He Sect!\" The referee announced the name of the contestants and gave the signal, \"FIGHT!\"\nThe muscular cultivator bellowed and summoned two dao avatars. One was an elderly man with bodybuilder-like muscles while the other was a bald barbarian with two great axes. The bodybuilder avatar merged with He Man while the ax wielder avatar manifested its physical body.\nMarc ignored the dao avatars. He slowly pulled the bastard sword from his back and dropped it to the floor. He adjusted his blindfold while he strolled toward his opponent.\nHe Man seized the opportunity. He transformed all his muscles into steel and threw a punch at the boy. At the same time, the giant ax wielder avatar swung its battleaxe, aiming at Marc's head.\nAs if Marc used Situ Nantian's footwork technique, he vanished and reappeared on the right side of He Man. Moreover, the bastard sword that Marc had left on the floor teleported to his hand.\nWHOOSH!\nMarc gently swung the bastard sword, but it stopped one centimeter away from He Man's neck.\nThe muscle man sweated profusely. He couldn't see the swing. By the time the sword stopped, it was already at his neck.\n\"This is my defeat. I lose.\"\nThe referee was also astonished. He stuttered, \"W-W-Winner, Marc Dullahan of Florida Domain!\"\nMarc widely smiled and pulled his bastard sword back. He took a step back and saluted to He Man, \"Good fight, sir.\"\n\"…Y-You too. G-Good fight.\"\nThe innocent smile and Marc's humility stunned He Man. For a moment, he forgot that Marc was an immortal who cheated his age. Had someone told him that Marc was really a boy, he would have believed them.\nBecause of the innocent look, He Man was ashamed of his action. He inwardly cursed his sect master for colluding with Yan Xiang. He lowered his head and stepped down from the platform.\nWhen He Man returned to the other colleagues of the same sect, nobody blamed him for his defeat. On the other hand, they congratulated him.\n\"Good job coming back alive. That was close.\"\n\"Surviving an immortal's strike is already an achievement. Don't be disappointed.\"\nHe Man slightly nodded. Still, he couldn't get rid of the guilt in his heart. He gazed at Marc, wondering if he was really a 12-year-old boy.\n\"Hey, do you think the boy is really 12?\" He Man asked his colleagues.\n\"Of course not! He must have drunk tea of rejuvenation like us.\"\n\"…I see.\"\nHe Man shook his head to forget the thought.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, on the fifth platform, Esen and Qi Niu got on the stage, and the referee signaled the start of the match.\nQi Niu gritted her teeth and pulled out her poison-coated daggers. On the other hand, Esen crossed her arms and stood still, waiting for Qi Niu to make the first move.\nUnlike the boys, Qi Niu and Esen didn't bother about courtesy or manners. They remained silent, refusing to talk first.\nAs Esen didn't make the first move, Qi Niu got nervous. The latter's legs and arms trembled.\nFrom Qi Niu's point of view, Esen's smug smile had a strange vibe. She felt like her soul was being invaded. But in reality, Esen didn't even try. She simply stared into Qi Niu's soul, sizing up her potential and threat.\nBut in the end, Qi Niu's soul was corrupted. Her future growth was mediocre at best.\n\"This is boring, yo.\"\nEsen was disappointed. She had hoped that Qi Niu would have been as talented as Gao Yan.\n\"Come on, come at me, little wench. Here, I won't defend!\"\n\"…\"\nEven though Esen gave up her pride and spoke first, Qi Niu didn't move. Instead, Qi Niu took two steps back.\nAs the opponent didn't dare to move, Esen stopped playing nice. She took a step, but she instantly appeared in front of Qi Niu.\n\"!!!\"\n\"Since you don't move, it's nom-nom time!\"\nIt was too late for Qi Niu to react. The lich empress opened her mouth and sunk her sharp fangs into her neck.\nCHOMP\nEsen bit Qi Niu's neck. Like a vampire, she started sucking her blood.\nQi Niu didn't resist. She stood there, petrified from fear. But after Esen's fangs entered her flesh, pleasure replaced her fear.\nEsen didn't prolong the bite. She let go of Qi Niu's neck, and the girl collapsed to the ground. The lich empress turned to the referee and pointed at the unconscious girl.\n\"Result?\"\nThe referee came back to his senses. He announced, \"W-Winner, from Florida Domain!\"\n.\n.\nYan Xiang watched how Esen and Marc made a quick work of his people. He deeply sighed, unable to let go of the vexing thoughts. He still couldn't give up his pride.\nHe totally forgot about why he wanted Leo dead. Revenge was no longer in the picture.\nIt was about his pride. He simply wished to uphold his reputation and teach Leo a lesson.\n'Just you wait, Florida Man!'\nYan Xiang crossed his arms behind his back, but his fingers moved. He secretly activated five talismans under each platform, but he suppressed its effect for the moment.\n.\n.\nIvy and Beatrice got on their stages next. As soon as the girls came up, some neutral faction's spectators whistled as they cheered for them.\n\"Go, pretty girl! Show us what you can do!\"\n\"Hey, the weird girl with that black dress! You are fine, baby!\"\nIvy and Beatrice ignored the jeers. They waited for their opponents on the stage.\nThe fighters from Yan Xiang's side got up the platform. Coincidentally, they were both from the imperial court.\nBut before the referee allowed the fighters to start, Yan Xiang moved his fingers and activated two talismans under Ivy and Beatrice's arena.\nAlthough the talismans were activated, nothing seemed to change. However, Ivy and Beatrice flinched as their skin was strangely itchy and hot.\nBoth women had a bad feeling about the platforms. As soon as the referees started the matches, they rushed their opponents and kicked them out of the stages.\nThe matches were decided in five seconds. Again, the crowd was astonished.\nIvy and Beatrice didn't wait for the referees to announce the result. They quickly got down from the stages and reported to Esen.\n\"Your Holiness, something is wrong with the arena,\" reported Ivy.\nBeatrice silently pointed at her tournament stage and pointed at her arm.\nEsen and Leo were curious about what got into them. The former inspected Beatrice's skin. Then, she understood what went wrong.\nBeatrice's skin was slightly wrinkled. Black dots appeared on her skin as if they were moles.\n\"Is it itchy?\" Esen asked Ivy.\n\"Yes, Your Holiness. It feels like I'm getting older.\"\n\"You're getting older?\"\nEsen frowned and looked at the stages. However, she couldn't detect anything strange.\nMeanwhile, Leo walked toward Ivy's stage. He leaned over and grabbed on the ledge. As soon as he touched it, he got goosebumps. His cancer cells screamed and activated their power to resist the strange effects.\nLeo tilted his head in confusion for a moment. After keeping his hand on the stage for a few seconds, he noticed something.\nSome of his cancer cells got slightly older. The freshly new blood cells rapidly matured.\nTesting his hypothesis, Leo ejected a piece of half-eaten yin cabbage and threw it on the stage. However, nothing changed.\n\"Odd.\"\nThe hypothesis was wrong. Leo was even more confused.\n\"It's not the aging effect. Then, what is it?\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. Then, he looked at Yan Xiang.\nYan Xiang also looked back at him. The former never hid the disdain in his eyes.\n\"Oh, boy. Tricks after tricks. Schemes after schemes. How come no one has taught them that absolute strength can crush any scheme and tactic?\"\nLeo walked back to his team and warned them about his findings. He looked at Gao Yan, who hadn't taken the stage yet.\n\"That damn emperor is using another underhanded trick again. I think he has done something to the arenas.\"\nEsen also nodded as she managed to figure something from Ivy and Beatrice's reactions. She voiced her opinion.\n\"I think it's something related to time. Is it time ability?\"\nLeo glanced at the piece of cabbage. It still remained there to prove his point.\n\"No. It's not time. If it's time, it would have affected his men, too.\"\n\"Then, what did that emperor do?\"\n\"…I have no idea.\"\n.\n.\nLooking at Leo's reaction, Yan Xiang inwardly laughed. He disabled the two previously activated talismans. Then, he looked at Gao Yan's arena next.\n'It's too late, Florida Man. Since your people abuse the tea of rejuvenation, I will expose your lies and crush you! It doesn't matter how strong they are. As long as the tea's effect is canceled, you will revert to the original self! Then, your true age will be noticeable by all!'\nYan Xiang's talismans didn't have the time acceleration effect. Instead, they were pill toxin purification talismans, which were commonly used to remove impurities and pill toxins in a cultivator's dantian. But in this case, Yan Xiang used them to remove the rejuvenating tea's effects.\nAs the talismans only affected the people on the stages, nobody but the contestants could detect them. Moreover, Yan Xiang only needed Leo's people to stay on the stage for ten minutes to completely neutralize the tea's effect.\n\"Next match! Gao Yan from Florida Domain… Versus… Situ Dong!\"\nWhile Yan Xiang mocked Leo in his mind, it was Gao Yan's turn to fight.\nYan Xiang threw everything to the back of his head. As Gao Yan was a legit junior, he paid extra attention to the boy.\nGao Yan was their primary target. They needed to kill him first.\nThe boy nervously got on the stage while his dao avatar followed after him. Yan Xiang instantly noticed Thora, but he ignored her.\nGao Yan's opponent, Situ Dong, got on the stage. He was a soul transformation cultivator from the Situ Clan. His physical age was 16, but his physique was the same as an adult with a big belly.\nSitu Dong laughed at Gao Yan's quirky demeanor. He also glanced at Thora.\n\"What a sissy. You're a man, but your dao avatar is a woman. Do you want to become a woman that badly?\" Mocked Situ Dong.\nGao Yan's expression changed. He stopped being nervous and pulled out his lightsaber. Then, he stared at Situ Dong.\n\"Keep my dao companion out of your mouth, sir.\"\nSitu Dong burst into laughter, \"Dao companion?! Did you sleep with your dao avatar or something?! Hahahahaha! Hey! If you want to do a woman, you should have gone to a brothel, not bedding yourself! FUAHAHAHAHA!!\"\n\"…\"\nThora's expression turned dark, but Gao Yan's eyes reddened.\n\"FIGHT!\"\nIgnoring the contestants, the referee signaled the fight.\nSitu Dong took the initiative. As the opponent was a lowly nascent soul cultivator, Situ Dong looked down on Gao Yan. He merged one of his dao avatars with his physical body, transforming himself into a 10-meter-tall oak tree with a thousand long humanoid arms and sharp fingers.\nNot concerned about Gao Yan's safety or life, Situ Dong threw a thousand long fists at him.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 163 – Florida Man's Student Accidentally Gunned Martial Artist to Death during MMA Match\n\"DIE!!\"\nSitu Dong was certain of his victory. In terms of strength, nascent soul cultivators were the same as infants learning how to walk while soul transformation cultivators already mastered the dao avatar techniques. Crushing Gao Yan would be a walk in the park.\nGao Yan gritted his teeth and activated his lightsaber. Meanwhile, Thora extended her arm forward, and a yellowish dome of lightning barrier appeared.\nBOOM\nThe fists collided with the barrier. After ten punches, it shattered.\nThe eleventh fist came for Gao Yan!\nGao Yan no longer hesitated or thought of anything. His muscle memory took over as he swung the lightsaber like how Esen had taught him.\nThe sci-fi sword, empowered by Leo's essence stone, sliced through the dao avatar's fist like butter.\nSitu Dong widened his eyes in shock as the damage to his dao avatar transferred to his real body. The cut from the gap between his left hand's middle finger and ring finger extended to the bottom of his palm.\nHis hand was almost cut in half!\nBecause of the cut, 500 fists of the dao avatar vanished. Moreover, Situ Dong lost the feeling in his left hand, and the meridians in his left arm were blocked by an unknown force. His entire left arm withered and thinned, reverting back to its original appearance.\nAfter losing half of his power, Situ pulled back his 500 fists. He took a step back and looked at this dao avatar in shock.\n\"T-This cannot be! WHAT DID YOU DO?!\"\nGao Yan was still in the zone. As he successfully counterattacked with that cut, he took the initiative by pulling the pistol that Leo had given him.\nIn the chamber was a sacred wood bullet. However, Gao Yan injected all his wood Qi into it, betting on everything in this attack.\nBANG\nPulling the trigger, the pistol spat a brown laser beam. At the tip of the beam, the sacred wood bullet pierced through Situ Dong's chest.\nThe bullet entered Situ Dong's chest and crushed the center ribcage. It dug further, grazing his heart and lungs. It crushed the spinal cord because the bullet lost its momentum, getting stuck in Situ Dong's flesh and bones.\nThe attack didn't stop there. As the sacred wood was empowered by Gao Yan's wood Qi, the bullet transformed into a plant seed. It absorbed blood and Qi of Situ Dong to rapidly grow. Instantly, it emptied the host's Qi and depleted his lifespan.\nSitu Dong vomited blood and bent slightly forward. Then, he collapsed to the ground face-first.\nGao Yan lowered his gun and deactivated the lightsaber. He slowly came back to his senses. When he realized that Situ Dong stopped breathing, he panicked.\n\"I-I-I didn't mean to!! I'm so sorry, senior!\"\nGao Yan rushed to Situ Dong and fed him an elixir grain pill that he got from Leo. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to resurrect the guy.\nThe referee and Situ Bai leaped on the stage and checked Situ Dong's pulse. They then looked at his soul for a moment. Then, they glared at Gao Yan.\nThe referee announced, \"Situ Dong has been critically injured. He can no longer fight. The winner of this match is Gao Yan-\"\n\"HALT!\"\nSitu Bai glared at Gao Yan while he thrust his fingers into Situ Dong's back. He pulled out the sprouted seed and bellowed.\n\"Your Majesty! Please arrest this man in an instant. He's using a hidden weapon in the tournament!\"\nYan Xiang frowned as he also wanted to use this opportunity to disqualify Leo's team. However, there were too many eyes from the neutral factions and rogue cultivators among the spectators. He couldn't blatantly cheat or show favoritism at the moment.\nThe emperor declared, \"Weapons and artifacts are considered skills. Gao Yan didn't break the rules.\"\n\"But Your Majesty! Gao Yan killed his opponent!\"\n\"…\"\nYan Xiang narrowed his eyes as if he could use this against Leo and Gao Yan. However, before the emperor could speak, Tang Xuan, who had been lurking in the crowd, suddenly used his Qi to amplify his voice.\nTang Xuan's voice vibrated through the arena and Cauliflower City.\n\"If Gao Yan and his opponent have a similar strength, we can judge that Gao Yan has violated the rules, and his team will automatically be disqualified. However, Gao Yan's opponent is two realms stronger than him. In this case, I think it's an accident.\"\n\"Accident?! You call this an accident?!\" Situ Bai yelled back.\n\"Fists and kicks have no eyes. Accidents are bound to happen in sparring. In this case, Gao Yan can't afford to hold back his strength because of his inferior cultivation base. Situ Dong should be at fault here for failing to react to that last attack. Obviously, he looked down on his opponent, and he died because of his lack of judgment. I repeat, Gao Yan is not at fault for accidentally killing his opponent!\"\nTang Xuan glanced at Leo, hoping that the latter could support his claim, \"Don't you think so too? Immortal Florida Man?\"\nLeo stroked his beard and looked at Situ Bai, \"As he said, bozo. Your guy is indeed stronger than my boy, but he got squashed because of his stupidity. You can't blame my boy for giving it his all while your people purposely throw the match, do you?\"\n\"…\"\nThe neutral faction's people murmured as they agreed to this argument. From their point of view, Gao Yan barely reacted to the first attacks while Situ Dong miscalculated. Had Situ Dong not retreated, Gao Yan would never have had enough time to use his secret weapon.\nIn short, it was Situ Dong's fault for dying to the secret weapon.\nYan Xiang looked around for a moment before he gave Gao Yan a meaningful look. He thought of the weapon that Yan Zhu had. Although Yan Xiang had enough reasons to disqualify Gao Yan, he had no choice but to pardon him in this case. After all, he needed to know how and where Gao Yan managed to get those artifacts.\nThe emperor sent a voice transmission to Situ Bai.\n'Leave him be. Instead, I want you to investigate that boy's background. I want to know where he came from and how he got those artifacts and secret weapons.'\nSitu Bai nodded. He coughed and retreated from the stage.\n\"Fine. That was an accident. Continue the tournament!\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nAfter the commotion, rogue cultivators among the spectators got excited. They whispered among themselves.\n\"That Florida Domain is quite something. They're backed by immortals for sure. Look at that lineup.\"\n\"Obviously, those immortals are elders in disguise. Emperor Yan conspires against Immortal Florida Man first. And now, Immortal Florida Man uses the same trick as them. It's karma, I say.\"\n\"Well-deserved karma, actually. This event is supposed to be exclusive for the youngsters and rising stars. But look at those people from the Jianghu Alliance. They are trying to bully a newly found sect backed by immortals. Now, they're paying the price.\"\n\"I wonder if I can join the Florida Domain. Do they accept new disciples?\"\n\"Those weapons, though. Did you see the last attack? That energy sword seems deadly, too!\"\nAfter Gao Yan showed everybody his secret weapons, many rogue cultivators were interested in Leo's domain. His reputation slowly rose.\nOn the other hand, the imperial court faction was not happy. They gossiped, wondering what Yan Xiang was doing.\n\"Why hasn't the emperor arrested Gao Yan and disqualified Florida Man bastard? He could have done so, right?\"\n\"He could have, but that might give a reason for other cultivators to rebel. Some of the orthodox sects are not happy with His Majesty's decision to embrace the unorthodox cultivators to the Jianghu Alliance.\"\n\"Naturally, fiendish cultivators and orthodox cultivators will always be enemies. It's because of those princes. Without those nasty princes and their cults, His Majesty would have been worshiped by all.\"\n\"Stop gossiping your lord! If you have the energy, go and suppress those rumors about Florida Man!\"\nDistrust and doubts filled the air as they started questioning Yan Xiang's actions. Still, they waited to see the tournament unfold as the winner of this tournament would write a new history.\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian conversed.\n\"Father, why are you openly supporting Florida Man? Are we rebelling now?\"\nTang Xuan stroked his beard. He gazed at Florida Man and confessed.\n\"We will do everything in our power to support Florida Domain and Immortal Florida Man. Time for our clan to recognize a new lord.\"\n\"But why? Haven't we served the Yan Empire for centuries? Why now?\"\n\"If Yan Xiang were a decisive emperor, we would have continued serving him. But since he's been manipulated by his reputation and seeking revenge for the vain revenge, his sand castle empire will soon collapse. We have to jump ships now if we want to survive the turbulence.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Tian still hesitated. He thought of his old friends, disciples, and mentors. However, only the faces of Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei showed up as they were the last people to remain with him when he needed their help.\nThinking of the Life Sword Sect and the Amazonian Sanctuary, Tang Tian gazed at Tiger Swordsman and Xu Nuan behind Leo. He then understood why his father chose Leo.\n\"It's their moral integrity, right?\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan bitterly smiled as the answer was off the mark. It was the strength and influence of Leo that Tang Xuan respected.\n.\n.\nAfter Gao Yan's match ended, the second round of the tournament started.\nIvy got called to the stage first. Again, her opponent was a soul transformation cultivator from a major clan.\nAs soon as Ivy got on the stage, Yan Xiang activated his secret array underneath the platform.\nIvy flinched as she could sense her skin and bones getting older. She glanced at the referee to signal the match.\nHowever, the referee suddenly paused and turned around to look at the emperor. He purposely delayed the match!\n\"Not good,\" Leo deeply frowned at Yan Xiang as he noticed Ivy's dark expression. He rushed toward the stage and got closer.\nAs soon as Leo got too close to the arena stage, his cancer cells screamed. His entire body got itchy as the rejuvenated cells and bones slowly lost their vigor.\n\"START THE MATCH, REF!!\"\nLeo slapped the floor, yelling at the referee.\nHowever, the referee turned around and scolded Leo, \"Noncontestant, please get away from the arena and stay in the permitted area! If you interfere with the match again, we will disqualify your team!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo glared at Yan Xiang and the referee. He then checked Ivy's condition with his eyes.\nAlthough Ivy's skin and face still looked young, signs of aging were apparent. Soon, she might look like an old woman.\n'Damn cheaters.'\nLeo grumbled and looked at the bottom of the platform. He then sniffed like a dog, hoping to find an irregular scent.\nA few seconds later, Leo noticed a weird scent. It smelled like the tea of rejuvenation.\nLeo had an idea what it was. However, as he couldn't openly interfere with the arenas, he turned around and returned to his spectator area.\nHe walked toward Cat, who was bored to death.\n\"Cat. There are weird things underneath the arenas. Can you dig the ground in secret and fetch them for me? When we return, I'll give you extra nom-nom.\"\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\"\nCat stopped being drowsy. She transformed into a humanoid dryad and stood in front of Leo with sparkling eyes.\n\"Yes. Nom-Nom Buffet.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat widely grinned. While standing still, her roots penetrated into the ground. Silently, she curled her roots and made her way to the foundation of all five arenas.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 164 – Florida Man Killed Local Emperor and Two Princes as They Refused to Purchase His Fake Meds\nAs Leo had suspected, Yan Xiang purposely delayed the match while he activated the talismans underneath the arena. He waited for the array to cancel the effects of rejuvenation tea.\n\"This should be checkmate. Once we expose his trickery, he will lose.\"\nNothing could go wrong with this plan. He believed he could force Leo to leave the country like this.\nRUMBLE\nSuddenly, the ground shook, and all five arena stages cracked. Then, the earthquake stopped.\n\"Huh?\"\nYan Xiang frowned as he could no longer sense the talismans under the arena. He raised his index finger and pointed at one of them.\nNothing happened. Yan Xiang couldn't sense anything.\n\"What?!\"\n.\n.\nCat retracted her roots and pulled out a stack of talismans. She passed them to Leo as she couldn't eat them.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo rubbed her head with his hand. He stored the talismans in his storage ring, planning to eat them later. He then looked at Ivy, checking her condition.\nHer complexion looked better. Although she looked slightly older, no one should be able to notice it since she was still covering her eyes with a black blindfold cloth.\nAs everything was under control, Leo shouted at Yan Xiang, \"Why are you delaying the matches? We don't have all day!\"\nYan Xiang bit his lower lip. As he realized that he couldn't use the talisman arrays to the fullest, he resumed the matches.\n\"…Proceed, referees.\"\n.\n.\nThe semi-final rounds were as Leo had predicted. Without Yan Xiang's trickery, Ivy, Marc, Esen, and Beatrice easily defeated their opponents. As for Gao Yan, he seemed to have an epiphany or enlightenment from the previous fight.\nBefore Gao Yan's match began, he readied his pistol while he switched on the energy sword with another hand. As soon as the referee signaled the match, Gao Yan shot his opponent without hesitation.\nHis next opponent was still a soul formation cultivator. As he came prepared, he managed to dodge the first bullet. Unfortunately, he didn't know that Gao Yan's gun was an automatic one.\nBANG\nThe second bullet hit the cultivator's stomach. It wasn't fatal enough to kill. However, the opponent immediately gave up as he was afraid of the unknown effects of the bullet.\nThe semi-final round was over by noon. The next was the final match of each bracket.\nNothing changed in the final. The opponents of Esen and her subordinates forfeited before the fight.\nHowever, Gao Yan faced another wall. His next opponent was none other than Yan Zhu.\n.\n.\nYan Zhu got on the same stage as Gao Yan. He also eyed the black pistol in his opponent's hand.\n\"Brat. Where did you get your weapons?\"\nGao Yan slowly climbed on the stage. After reaching his position, he got into his personal combat stance – Gun and lightsaber in a different hand.\n\"None of your business, prince.\"\n\"If you sell them to me, I'll give you anything – spirit stones, cultivation resources, cultivation manuals, status, women, ANYTHING!\"\n\"Not interested, thank you.\"\n\"I see. That's a shame. I'll pry it from your dead body, THEN!\"\nWithout waiting for the referee to officially initiate the match, Yan Zhu pulled out a homemade pistol, which was preloaded with an essence stone. He aimed at Gao Yan's head and pulled the trigger!\n\"!!!\"\nGao Yan was shocked when Yan Zhu pulled out a similar weapon. He swung the lightsaber at the incoming bullet.\nThe lightsaber contacted with the essence stone bullet. As soon as they touched, the essence stone exploded.\nMushroom flame and black smoke erupted. Half of the arena stage instantly vanished while the shockwave blast destroyed all watchtowers in the area. Some weak spectators were blown away like a ragdoll while court officials bellowed, summoning their dao avatars to protect them.\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHA!!\"\nYan Zhu burst into laughter while he reloaded another essence stone. He aimed his gun at the middle of the flame.\n\"This is what you get for refusing my offer! Now, I'll be prying your weapons from your dead body! HAHAHAHA!\"\nYan Zhu turned to the referee.\n\"Announce the result! The match has ended!\"\nThe referee sweated profusely as Yan Zhu broke the rules. The former hadn't announced the start of the match yet, so the preemptive strike was a foul.\n\"Y-Your Highness, the match hasn't started yet.\"\n\"Are you blind?!\" Yan Zhu yelled at the referee, who was an eunuch of the imperial court, \"Finish the match. I've won!\"\n\"Y-Y-Yes, Your Highness. Alright. The winner is-\"\nBANG\nBefore the eunuch referee could announce the result, a sacred wood bullet cut through the air and pierced through Yan Zhu's mouth. It broke his front teeth and exited through the back of his head.\nThe silhouette of Gao Yan got clearer. He walked out of the flame. His black suit was untouched. However, his skin was slightly red as it got a bit of burn.\nGao Yan readjusted his aim. He pulled the trigger and fired more rounds.\nBANG\nBANG\nThe second shot hit the center of Yan Zhu's forehead. The other pierced through the prince's left chest.\n\"…\"\nYan Zhu was still smiling, but his body stiffened. He fell to the ground and stopped moving.\nThe spectators were in silence. Everything happened so fast that they didn't know how to react.\n\"Wait, what?!\"\n\"T-The match hasn't even begun, but why?!\"\nNo one understood what the prince and Gao Yan just did. Only Leo, his people, and Yan Xiang knew about the weapons.\nYan Xiang silently looked at the lifeless body of the third prince. He was neither sad nor angry. Instead, he was happy that Yan Zhu died. Because of Yan Zhu's death, he had a reason to take advantage of Leo.\nThe emperor announced, \"Fighting before the signal is a violation. Both Yan Zhu and Gao Yan are disqualified from the tournament. Also, the last attack has been committed outside of the tournament event. It will be charged as murder. Arrest that man at once!\"\nCultivators from Yan Xiang's faction moved. They descended and surrounded Gao Yan from all sides.\nLeo deeply sighed. He tried his best to play nice, but he had enough of this nonsense. He warned Yan Xiang, \"I assume this is a declaration of war, donkey emperor.\"\n\"Immortal Florida Man!\" Yan Xiang pointed his finger at Leo, \"Your team has violated the rules over and over again! Your team will be disqualified. No excuses this time! You will be expelled from this conti-\"\nBANG\nLeo pulled out his pistol and pulled the trigger. The upgraded bullet hit Yan Xiang's forehead and exploded, shattering his brain everywhere. His headless body stood still for a moment before it fell to the ground.\n\"YOUR MAJESTY!!\"\n\"EMPEROR YAN!!\"\nYan Xiang's goons rushed to see their leader. But when they saw Yan Xiang's remaining head, they gulped.\nWHOOM\nAlthough Leo managed to destroy Yan Xiang's head, his soul was ejected from his body. Remaining as a spirit, Yan Xiang bellowed and ordered his people.\n\"Immortal Florida Man has attempted to assassinate me! People of the Yan Empire! THIS IS TREASON! THIS MEANS WAR!!\"\nLeo silently gazed at Yan Xiang's soul.\n\"Dafuq? How is he still alive?\"\nEsen crossed her arms and explained, \"Quasi-immortals can detach their souls from their bodies before they die. If they manage to possess a new body in the remaining time, they can self-resurrect. I saw many immortals and quasi-immortals abusing this trick to escape death. Most of the time, they possessed and killed their descendants in the process.\"\n\"Talk about good parenting. Wow.\"\nYan Xiang acted as Esen had predicted. His soul vanished into Yan Luo's body. The latter screamed in shock as he was aware of this technique.\n\"FATHER, NOOOO!!\"\nIt was too late for Yan Luo to realize. From the very beginning, Yan Xiang had been keeping his sons as spare bodies for him to self-resurrect.\nYan Luo's soul was absorbed into Yan Xiang's soul. Then, the emperor took over Yan Luo's body and instantly restored his cultivation base. Moreover, he gained a new power from Yan Luo's dantian.\nRUMBLE\nBecause of the reincarnation technique, Yan Xiang's cultivation soared. His aura expanded, and his elemental Qi summoned clouds of heavenly tribulation.\nOrange clouds covered the sky. Orange thunderbolts descended in front of Yan Xiang.\nBOOM\nThe sudden appearance of orange tribulation thunderbolts scared the spectators and bystanders. Everybody fled the scene, ignoring Yan Xiang and the tournament.\nLeo didn't know what to feel about the villain getting new powerups. He silently pointed his gun at Yan Xiang's new body. Then, he pulled the trigger.\nBANG\nPU!\nYan Xiang, who was still laughing like a lunatic, got hit in the head for the second time. His head exploded once again, and one of the orange thunderbolts hit his body.\nBOOM\nYan Xiang's new body and soul were purged as the emperor attempted to advance to an Earth Celestial Immortal. The body and soul dissipated into dust, never to be reincarnated again.\nAs soon as Yan Xiang died, Esen frowned at Leo.\n\"That's quite rude of you. That man is about to face a heavenly tribulation. You're supposed to wait for him to finish. Anyway, you should have done this ages ago. What's stopping you?\"\n\"…I just wanted customers. I guess I'm not suited to be a salesman.\"\n\"A salesman doesn't kill his customer.\"\n\"Too late.\"\nLeo looked up. The orange clouds slowly dispersed as Yan Xiang died during the chaos.\n\"Let's go home. I think we're done here.\"\nThe yellow tattoos on Leo's forehead vanished as Yan Xiang was killed. There was no one to adhere to the agreement. Therefore, the contract was voided.\n\"What about the prizes?\" Asked Esen.\n\"We'll take them on our way home. Let's send the kids to the bus first. Then, we can ransack this place.\"\nEsen grinned and elbowed Leo's side to punish him for being unnecessarily protective.\nLeo called Gao Yan over. Everybody ignored the city rules and flew back to the bus, which they had parked outside the city.\n.\n.\nSitu Bai and Ouyang Ke were still affected by the emperor's death. They looked at each other for a moment. After seeing each other's white faces, they realized something important.\nWithout an emperor, their clans could rise. It was the time for their clans to mobilize their men to seize the capital city and plunder the palace's treasures.\nAll former servants of Yan Xiang dispersed. Although some of them were sad and shocked by the emperor's death, their greed guided them back to their headquarters to relay the news.\n\"The emperor is dead. It's time for changes.\"\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan was astonished by the abrupt chaos. In a flash, Yan Xiang, Yan Luo, and Yan Zhu died one after another. Tang Tian was also shocked. He was prepared for the Yan Clan's demise, but he didn't expect it to be this fast.\nThe two Tangs consulted each other.\n\"Father, this is chaos! The Situs and Ouyangs will bring their armies here soon. Their immortals will also be here. What should we do?!\"\nTang Xuan closed his eyes and groaned, \"We join forces with Immortal Florida Man. Go tell everybody in our clan and Sixth Element Sect to migrate to Magpie City.\"\n\"Y-Yes, father!\"\nTang Tian and his men flew back to their clan's manor. As for Tang Xuan, he opened his eyes and followed Leo to his bus. He was determined to join Leo's side.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 165 – Florida Man Broke into Stranger's House and Stole Garden Light Bulb\nGao Yan scratched his face. The fire slightly cooked his skin, but the damage wasn't severe. Though, his hairstyle turned into an afro because of the burn.\nHe felt nothing after he murdered Yan Zhu. After all, the third prince tried to kill him first.\nAfter Leo dealt with the emperor, the crowd dispersed in every direction. Gao Yan took this opportunity to steal Yan Zhu's storage rings and his handmade pistol. He picked it up to get a closer look.\nAs Gao Yan had seen Leo's matchlock rifles, he was slightly familiar with the gun structures. Inspecting the gun, he realized its perks and its shortcomings.\nThe weapon depended on essence stones as the muzzle and the structure was off. The hammer looked like a makeshift arbalest without a string, which was used to artificially ignite the essence stone bullet forward. Overall, the gun looked like a metal pipe attached to a handle.\n\"What a lousy weapon.\"\nAs Gao Yan was aware of the firearm's firepower, he hated to see other cultivators using these godlike weapons. He clenched his fist and crushed the fake pistol.\nAfter turning Yan Zhu's pistol into a metal scrap, Gao Yan turned around and walked toward Leo. However, the latter was busy chatting with Esen.\nUnable to interrupt the seniors, Gao Yan turned to Tiger Swordsman. He presented Yan Zhu's storage rings to the elder.\n\"Elder Tiger, I got these rings from the prince. Could you pass it to Lord Florida Man?\"\nTiger Swordsman was surprised that Gao Yan turned the items to him instead of keeping them to himself.\n\"Did you rob those from the prince?\"\n\"Erm, yes.\"\n\"Then, why don't you keep them? You killed the prince, right? You can keep what you killed.\"\n\"But, err,\" Gao Yan looked behind him. He scanned the empty arenas and the carnage.\nIn the sky, a few cultivators still remained in the area, observing Leo and his team. Some rogue cultivators fixated on the corpses of Yan Xiang and Yan Luo as if they were vultures staring at their prey.\nGao Yan might be cowardly and naïve, but he wasn't stupid. He just openly robbed the prince in front of the crowd. Therefore, some of the cultivators in the sky might have a bad idea about him. Moreover, he didn't know if the rings stored something too precious that the other cultivators sought.\nInstead of keeping the treasures and wealth, he might as well contribute something to Leo so that he could get another form of reward. In the future, Should those cultivators capture and ask Gao Yan about the rings, he could just tell them that Leo had them.\n\"I'm still too weak. Keeping something precious with me is like a child wearing a gold necklace and waltzing into a slum area.\"\nTiger Swordsman chuckled and smacked Gao Yan's back, \"You fool. Your weapons are definitely more precious than those rings. You have a weapon that can easily kill a soul formation cultivator and negate their dao avatar's attacks. That alone warrants a bounty on your head. It's too late, now.\"\n\"Eh?!\"\n\"Seriously, if I were one of them, I would have memorized your face, too. You got a target on your back, boy.\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan's eyes were teary. He then turned around to look at Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and others.\nThe girls gathered around Gao Yan to soothe him. One of the tamer girls coyly hugged his arm.\n\"Senior Brother Gao, you might not know, but the girls in the dorm have been talking about you. They said that you're the hottest disciple of Florida Domain, you know?\"\n\"W-What?\"\n\"Lord Florida Man and Elder Wu Buyi favor you. You receive not one but TWO precious artifacts from Lord Florida Man! Everybody is calling you a golden bachelor!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Say, do you have a girlfriend?\"\nThora immediately coughed and glared at the tamer girl. Unfortunately, the tamer girl couldn't see Thora. Only Yao Qiqi could see her.\nYao Qiqi looked back and forth between Thora and Gao Yan. Then, she warned her sisters.\n\"Senior Brother Gao Yan already has a girlfriend.\"\n\"EH?!\"\nThe tamer girls were stunned for a moment. A few seconds later, they squealed as they got a new scoop.\n\"Who is his girlfriend?!\"\n\"Not telling.\" Yao Qiqi laughed.\n\"Boo!\"\nThe disciples laughed and cheered as the tension died down. Tiger Swordsman and Xu Nuan were also relieved as everything went well for their faction.\nThe only thing that troubled them was the aftermath. Without Yan Xiang and his sons, the entire continent would become lawless. Orthodox sects and unorthodox cults would break their peace treaty and start a new war. They wondered what Leo would do in this situation.\n.\nLeo stopped chatting with Esen. He turned around and ordered the crew.\n\"Tiger, Xu Nuan, you two escort the boy and girls back to the bus. Cat, Ivy, Beatrice, Marc, you are the only capable fighters here. Protect them while they are on their way back and wait for me there.\"\nTiger Swordsman nodded, \"What about you, my lord?\"\n\"I and this brat are going shopping. The daddy will come home late. Wait for me at the bus.\"\n\"…Alright, my lord.\"\nYao Qiqi blinked several times before she looked at Esen. She had a funny feeling about both Leo and Esen.\n\"Lord Florida Man, if you're the daddy, who's the mommy?\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody but Leo instantly turned toward Esen. For some reason, both of them had a similar air, and they seemed close.\nLeo caught on to their weird look. He shut down their fantasies.\n\"I ain't dating her in this lifetime. She's flat like paper. What's the point of licking a board? I want real milkers, not sunny-side eggs!\"\n\"YOU WHAT?!\"\nEsen was offended. She glared at Leo and kicked his leg. Again, she ended up hurting herself.\n\"DAMMIT, YOU MONSTER!\"\nLeo cackled and pressed his hand on her head, bullying her again even though she looked like a proper teenager. He leaped forward and vanished into the city.\nEsen screeched in anger. She flew and chased after Leo, wanting to get back at him.\n.\n.\nLeo and Esen arrived at Yan Xiang's palace. As soon as they landed, they found a chaotic scene.\nA hundred eunuchs and servants were already corpses. Cultivators from unknown clans summoned their dao avatars and randomly attacked various buildings. Sounds of women's screams came from everywhere.\n\"Wow,\" Leo was astonished.\n\"Don't look away. You did this,\" Esen snickered and mocked Leo.\n\"I guess even a crooked emperor can be a pillar of a country.\"\n\"This is more like a thief's den. Without a leader, thieves fight among themselves for their loot. All cultivators are a bunch of thieves, scavengers, tomb robbers, and bandits. If you look at them carefully, you will realize that they are all jobless. Some of them are even homeless! Commoners work for food while cultivators only steal from others. Tell me which one is better.\"\n\"…That's rude.\"\n\"It's a fact!\"\nLeo stopped arguing with Esen. As nobody picked a fight with them, Leo rushed into the throne room where he had met Yan Xiang for the first time.\nFrom Leo's memory, behind the throne room were usually the chambers of the emperor and their bodyguards. Sometimes, their concubines and children resided there for safety. If one wished to find something valuable from the emperor, one had to search the emperor's bedroom first.\nSprinting to the throne room, he came across more dead bodies. Most of them were the palace guards, who were all 6th-stage cultivators. A few soul formation cultivators and eunuchs also died here.\nThe wounds of the corpses came from sword wounds. The cut was so clean that it looked like someone killed them with one attack.\nLeo had a bad feeling about this, but he proceeded forward. Esen also followed after him.\nThe palace layout and structure were as Leo had predicted. Behind the throne room was a series of residential areas for Yan Xiang and his concubines. Small rooms within the palace were given to eunuchs, whose corpses were inside every room.\nAs Leo kept proceeding further, he noticed a person in the Fatui Cult's uniform carrying a woman on his shoulder. As the cultist turned around, his eyes met with Leo's.\n\"Ah, pillager.\"\nFor the sake of not wasting a bullet, Leo kicked the ground and instantly appeared in front of the cultist.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nThe cultist was a soul transformation cultivator, who wasn't present when Leo raided its HQ. He thought that he could sneak into the palace during the chaos and snatch some riches that Yan Xiang had left behind. But in the end, he only managed to secure a pretty concubine of Yan Xiang to be his wife.\nIt was too late for the cultist to have a wife. As soon as Leo got in front of the hooded cultist, he kicked the guy to the nuts.\nCRACK\nNot only the balls were broken, the cultist's pelvis was shattered to pieces. The impact was so severe that it dislocated the cultist's spinal cord and crushed his innards.\nUnsatisfied with the light injuries, Leo gave him a love tap with a jab to the face.\nPLOP\nLike a shattering watermelon hit by a hammer, the cultist's skull and head got blasted to pieces. Pink and white flesh came out, splattering the hallway.\nThe concubine girl fell from the cultist's shoulder. She trembled and looked up in fright.\nLeo silently glanced at her, \"Go.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe woman tried to stand and run, but her legs gave in. She wet her skirt while she trembled in panic.\nLeo shook his head and squatted. He looked at the woman's face and asked her.\n\"Want me to help you?\"\nThe woman heavily nodded while she cried.\nUpon looking at the woman's face closer, Leo realized that she was a beauty. Although her long wet messy hair covered half of her face, her eyes, nose, mouth, and facial outline were similar to Lisa from Black Pink.\nUnfortunately, this girl's asset was undesirable for Leo's standard. He glanced down for a moment before he marked her as unwanted.\n\"Tell me where the emperor keeps his treasure, and I'll bring you out of this place.\"\nThe woman gulped. She then raised her trembling arm and pointed at a big room that Leo had ignored.\n\"T-T-The library. T-There's a secret room underground. I don't know where and how to get there, but I know there's one for an emergency.\"\n\"Good job.\"\nLeo widely grinned and turned around. He ordered Esen, \"Bring this woman out of this city for me.\"\n\"What? Why should I?\" Esen was annoyed.\n\"If I touch her, she's dead. You know that my body is special, right?\"\nEsen narrowed her eyes and scoffed, \"Fine, you monster. Half of the treasures you find belong to me, alright?!\"\n\"Deal.\"\nEsen grumblingly walked toward the woman. She carried her on her shoulders in a fireman carry style. Then, she flew away from the palace. However, instead of bringing the concubine outside the city, she brought the woman to Leo's bus.\nAfter Esen had left, Leo proceeded to the library.\n.\n.\nIn the library, everything was a mess. Scrolls, books, and papers were scattered everywhere as cultivators had already searched this place for cultivation manuals. Unfortunately for them, this place only stored government documents.\nLeo toured the library for a few minutes. As all books and scrolls were already on the ground, all shelves were empty. There was no sign of a book-lever mechanism in here.\nAs Leo couldn't find the secret passage, he started using his other senses. He began sniffing like a police dog.\nThe room was filled with bamboo and papyrus-like odor. Leo's nostril ached after he inhaled too much small paper powder and dust.\nA few minutes later, Leo sensed cold air from the floor and the wall. There were two spots that he detected.\nLeo walked toward the north wall. In front of the wall was a series of empty bookshelves. As Leo didn't need the shelves anymore, he pulled the shelf away and hit the wall with his fist.\nBOOM\nThe wall exploded and collapsed, revealing a secret corridor.\n\"There you go.\"\nThe pathway was a narrow stairway to an underground passage. However, Leo sniffed the air and frowned.\nThe air smelled like iron and sour sweat. It was fresh. From Leo's experience, this scent indicated fresh corpses and people who had never taken a bath for centuries.\nSince the destination reeked of blood, Leo turned away from the secret passage. He walked toward the second area.\nIn front of Leo was a golden pillar. It was located at the center of the library. Strangely, no bookshelf was in the way.\nLeo smirked and touched the pillar. He stored the entire thing in his spatial ring.\nRUMBLE\nThe ceiling caved in a little. However, without a pillar, the ladder to another underground area was visible.\nLeo looked down and sniffed again. This time, he detected the scent of plants and medical herbs. Moreover, strange Qi came out from the underground area.\n\"This is the one!\"\nLeo jumped down the hole.\nUpon reaching the bottom, Leo saw a bright light. There was another passage to a bright room.\nLeo entered the room. Upon reaching his destination, he was greeted by a large underground garden of medical herbs.\nOn the left side, Leo found hundreds of ginseng and mandrakes. On the right, a dozen shelves were full of glass bottles of medical pills.\nHowever, at the center of the room, there was an altar.\nLeo's eyes were attracted to the pedestal at the center of the room. He walked closer to check the glowing orb on the pedestal.\nAs soon as Leo got closer, his system reacted.\n<Detecting Earth Fate Crystal!>\n<A new mission has been generated.>",

One Burglar Killed.\n\"Oh, a quest, finally?\"\nLeo rubbed his hands and waited for his system to show him the details.\n.\nFate Crystal Tutorial\nFate Crystals are profound artifacts that created the universe. By collecting at least seven fate crystals of the same quality, the collector can gain new strength, depending on the crystal's quality.\nEarth Fate Crystals are useless to you. However, it will be nice to collect them for future usage. Maybe someone around you can find them useful?\nBe warned. You are not the only one who searches for these crystals. There will be competitors, and they are not your run-in-a-mill pushovers.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/1)\nSecondary Objectives:\n1 – Kill 7 Immortals (0/7)\n2 – Upgrade Humble General Store to Shopping Mall (0/1)\nPrimary Mission Rewards: Gnosis of Earth Fate, True Earth Fate Crystal, Ring of Entity Upgrade Feature\nSecondary Mission Rewards: 7 Lucky Draws, 777 Free Tickets\n.\nLeo paused for a moment. He silently screamed in his mind.\n'A freaking tutorial?! NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?!'\nHis bloodshot eyes stared at the floating window and his alien ring. He had a thousand words to curse at the system for giving him a random tutorial quest.\nLeo had once wished for the system to give him quests when he was on Earth, yet it never responded to his call. Only after Leo started spending his lifespan for new features, quests appeared.\n'Dammit! I should have stayed on Earth and played with the system instead of transmigrating! I could have established a solitude paradise while I watch some live Godzilla porn on a dusty beach.'\nAfter coming to this world, Leo missed the days when he killed time by watching some random mutated monsters humping each other even though they were male. He still remembered how a male Godzilla excreted a massive egg of its offspring, which Leo proceeded to kill the parent and cooked the egg for dinner.\nAside from the hometown's nostalgia, Leo had another issue in life. He didn't have a proper hobby or a source of entertainment.\nThis quest came at a good time. Leo was interested in these new side missions and the lore of fate crystals. Although he had learned it from the statues at home, it felt nice to learn them from another place.\n\"I didn't know they could be merged. Welp, a new hobby, I guess.\"\nLeo reached to grab the crystal on the pedestal. As soon as he touched it, it slipped from Leo's hand and vanished into his alien ring.\nDING\n<You have collected one Earth Fate Crystal!>\nThe quest window updated its quest progress.\n.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (1/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/1)\n.\nIt felt like a game. Leo was satisfied. Still, he realized a new issue.\nHe had no idea where the other fate crystals were. The system never provided him any hint.\n\"Erm, my system. Where is the second or third crystal?\"\nThe system didn't respond.\nUnable to get feedback, Leo stopped worrying about it. He turned around and prepared to leave.\nAs soon as Leo turned around, he noticed a shadow of an adult man, approaching the secret ladder passage. As the crystal was gone, the room was dark, and the mysterious man's shadow blocked all light from above.\nThe mysterious man jumped down into the secret room. After landing, he vanished and reappeared in front of Leo as if he could teleport.\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he had seen this technique before. These movements were the same as Situ Nantian. However, this man looked different.\nBefore Leo could get a good look at the stranger's face, the latter swung his sword at Leo's neck.\nCLINK\nThe sword hit, but it couldn't cut through his skin.\nThe assailant widened his eyes in shock. He pulled his sword and took two steps back. Then, he vanished again. This time, he reappeared behind Leo.\nThe assailant's body turned into an orange humanoid flame. His sword also merged with his body. Using his element physique, he reattempted to cut Leo's neck.\nWithout looking back, Leo raised his hand and blocked the flame sword.\nCLANK\nThe flame sword hit Leo's palm. Again, Leo was unharmed.\n\"…\"\nLeo slowly turned around. He caught the sword and yanked the weapon forward.\nThe mysterious swordsman let go of his flame sword. It instantly vanished and reappeared in the swordsman's hand.\nLeo blankly looked at his hand. He raised his eyebrows in confusion for a moment. Then, he turned around to face the guy.\n\"Dude, what's your problem?\"\nThe swordsman didn't answer. He stared at Leo in solemn.\nAs Leo finally got to see the assailant's face clearly, he was slightly surprised. The swordsman looked like a fire elemental spirit in games.\n\"You…\" The swordsman uttered, \"Hand over the fate crystal, or else!\"\nStunned, Leo raised his brow. Upon realizing that the guy was the \"Rival\" that system once mentioned, Leo smirked.\n\"Over my dead body. Come and get it.\"\n\"As you wish!\"\nThe mysterious swordsman vanished again. A second later, he emerged from the ground below Leo. He flew up and thrust his flame sword at Leo's bottom.\nNothing offended Leo more than a low blow. He stomped on the stranger's shoulder.\nLeo's right leg turned red, and black red cracked. As soon as Leo stomped the emerging guy on this shoulder, the flame physique of the swordsman shattered.\nThe swordsman's real body appeared from the shattering flame. His left shoulder and his left arm were missing after the strike. Despite the lost arm, he glared at Leo.\nA second later, his left arm and shoulder regenerated. Again, an orange flame came out from the man.\n\"I see. You're an immortal, too.\"\nHearing the stranger's words, Leo widely grinned. As the quest demanded him to kill seven immortals, this guy came at the right time.\n\"Hey, dude. Don't ever think of fleeing. Come here.\"\n\"Tsk!\"\nThe mysterious immortal kicked the ground and retreated toward the ladder.\nLeo laughed and pursued. But instead of heading toward the ladder, he jumped and punched the ceiling, breaking the ground, and came out from the underground level.\nThe ground collapsed along with the palace. Leo's body pushed through the collapsing debris and emerged from the falling palace.\nThe mysterious immortal also managed to escape, but he floated 50 meters in the sky. He looked down on Leo.\n\"No matter what your real cultivation base is, you can't defeat me!\"\nThe swordsman bellowed and transformed into a flame spirit again. He then shouted.\n\"DAO DOMAIN!\"\nAn orange dome appeared and covered both Leo and the swordsman. It rose 100 meters high and sealed everything within a 300-meter radius.\nLeo's system also warned him.\n<Warning! Detecting Foreign Domain!>\n<Identifying the domain…>\n.\nDomain of Orange Flame\nEffects: Burn everybody with orange tribulation flame except the caster. As long as the caster is within the domain, he can recover his health and injuries instantly.\nNote: Due to the limitation of the mortal world, the flame's effectiveness is decreased by 90%.\n.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo pursed his lips. This was his first time seeing the system's messages about an opponent's abilities. Reading the effects, Leo was fascinated and interested.\n\"Wow. This is like a game. It has a condition, too?\"\nThe swordsman scoffed at Leo. He pointed his sword and taunted him.\n\"Summon your domain, old man! I know you're in disguise like me. Don't be a coward and use your dao domain!\"\n\"…What?\"\nLeo was puzzled about the dao domain. He tilted his head and rubbed his alien ring to summon a certain someone.\nLeo's dao avatar came out. The green spirit yawned and frowned at Leo.\n'What do you want?'\nLeo pointed at the immortal in the sky, \"Teach me about the dao domain. What is a dao domain?\"\nThe avatar deeply sighed. He taught Leo.\n'Dao domains are the manifestation of one's dao. It's one of many abilities of immortals. For example, if your dao is related to lightning, you can manifest a \"Domain Dome\" that acts as your territory. In that territory, your dao will come to life and help you defeat your opponents.'\n\"I still don't get it.\"\nThe avatar shrugged, 'Fine. Lend me some Qi, a lot of Qi, actually. My power is related to evolution and mutation, so don't expect much.'\n\"Sure.\"\nNot understanding what a dao domain really was, Leo transferred his Qi to the green spirit behind him.\nAbsorbing Leo's Qi and essence, the green dao avatar turned black. He merged with Leo, and a black dome overlapped with the orange one.\nThe black dome continued expanding until it was bigger than the orange swordsman. The latter widened his eyes and gazed at the black dome in shock.\n\"W-Wait a minute. You're not an Earth Celestial! You're a dei-\"\nThe flame swordsman stopped speaking mid-sentence. His orange domain shattered, and he fell to the ground. At the same time, Leo received a system message.\n<You have deployed Domain of Genes.>\n<All hostile foes within the domain will mutate randomly. Regular plants, vegetables, and living organisms within the domain will either evolve or mutate depending on their traits and genes.>\n\"???\"\nThe effects sounded strange and useless. Leo lowered his head in disappointment.\n\"I thought my domain would be something amazing, like getting nine million status points or something. What a letdown.\"\nLeo didn't notice that the immortal swordsman squirmed in pain on the ground. His body swelled and disfigured as his muscle mass and fat expanded. His head bloated for five seconds and then exploded like a shattered balloon, scattering his brain and flesh everywhere.\nA piece of white brain landed on Leo's left cheek. He clicked his tongue in disgust before he swatted the flesh away.\n\"Yuck! Dammit. I ain't Hannibal Lecter or zombies. I don't eat brains!\"\nLeo's dao avatar deactivated the domain. He came out from Leo's body for a moment and taught Leo.\n'That was an effect of my dao domain. If you feed me more Qi, I can expand the domain range wider. Also, if you realize more dao, you can have more abilities.'\n\"Oh, neat. I thought I was OP AF, but I can still get stronger, eh?\"\n'…Don't be overconfident. Your martial art skills are dog crap. Learn some moves!'\nThe avatar vanished into Leo's ring afterward.\nLeo blinked several times before he understood why his supporting spirit dissed him. He smacked his forehead.\n\"Welp. I guess I have to adapt to this world's culture. Anyway…\"\nLeo walked toward the squirming flesh. Even though it lost its head, the flesh was still alive.\n\"I guess I get another source of yin fluid. I hope Cat won't steal this from me.\"\nLeo carried the bloated corpse on his shoulder even though it hadn't finished mutating. Black blood got on his suit and shirt, but Leo ignored it.\nWith a corpse in tow, Leo returned to the battle bus, heading home.\n.\n.\nDING\n<You have killed an immortal!>\n.\nSecondary Objectives:\n1 – Kill 7 Immortals (1/7)\n2 – Upgrade Humble General Store to Shopping Mall (0/1)",

As for the corpse, he had already stored it in his spatial ring as the immortal was already dead.\nUpon coming back, Leo found his people waiting for him near the bus. As Leo was the only one who could open the bus, they couldn't get inside.\nIn addition, a few fresh corpses were nearby. Some of their blood splashed on the bus's windows. Cat was also busy eating some of them. Noticeably, Marc's bastard sword had some bloodstain on it, and Beatrice was busy dissecting one of the corpses.\nEsen was tired of waiting. She pointed at the bus's door and complained.\n\"Open na noor!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo held back his laughter. She sounded drunk because of her boredom.\n\"What the hell happened here?\" Asked Leo.\nEsen crossed her arms and snorted, \"Some idiots tried to rob the bus. Cat and my servants cleaned up the mess.\"\n\"Oh, nice, but…\" Leo looked at Beatrice. The silent blindfolded girl extracted something from a corpse and flickered it toward Ivy. The latter caught it and cleaned it with her water Qi. Then, she offered it to Esen.\n\"My lady. Another one.\"\n\"Thanks!\" Esen giggled and took the little marble. She was about to pop it into her mouth, but she glanced at Leo. Seeing his curious look, she paused for a moment.\n\"Want one?\" Asked Esen.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"A cultivator's crystalized dantian. It's very rich in Qi.\"\nLeo flinched, \"No, thanks. Again, I'm not Hannibal Lecter. I don't partake in cannibalism.\"\n\"Suit yourself.\"\nEsen shrugged and tossed it into her mouth. She chewed it.\nCRUNCH\nThe crunching sound was the same as when someone chewed a hard candy. Leo's teeth itched by just listening to the noise.\nAs everybody was there, Leo unlocked the shuttle bus's door and opened it. After unlocking the door, he invited the others to get in.\n\"Let's go home. Oh, as for the corpses, store them in your rings if you have any. Don't waste your time here.\"\nThe group happily entered the bus. Cat, Taxi, and Ricardo transformed into a human and got on as well.\nGao Yan was the last one to enter the bus before Leo. As he was about to enter, he looked at Leo and asked.\n\"Senior, sir.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Instead of sleeping in that abandoned courtyard, wouldn't it be better if we parked the ship in the yard and rest in the ship instead yesterday?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo silently facepalmed. He thought about it as well, and he regretted not parking the bus in the courtyard.\nSince lamenting for the mistake wouldn't improve his life, Leo chased Gao Yan onto the bus.\n\"Just get in!\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir!\"\n.\n.\nHalf a day later, Leo's group arrived home. He properly landed the bus on the west runway and taxied his vehicle back to the general store.\nWhen everybody arrived, the group was reluctant to get off. After all, the bus was too comfortable to live in. They wished they could use the bus as a resident.\n\"Hey, geezer!\" Esen yelled from the back of the bus, \"Can I and my people live here instead of that shabby house?\"\nXu Nuan and Tiger Swordsman gulped as they also had the same idea. They gazed at Leo, hoping for a positive answer.\nLeo rolled his eyes as he had predicted it. But then, he was inspired.\nHe remembered that he hadn't built a parking lot yet. In addition, Leo could fill the parking lot with upgraded motorhome coaches to house his workers. The prices of the upgrades and the vehicles were also about the same as the apartment building. Therefore, he had some free residential buildings he could use.\n\"Alright. Since you want it that much, I'll give it to you for one condition.\"\nEsen's eyes gleamed in excitement. Xu Nuan and Tiger Swordsman's ears also widened.\n\"What is the condition?\"\nLeo smirked, \"You have virgin yin while I have virgin yang. I need some of your blood for alchemy. Every month, I want you to pay rent with your blood.\"\nEsen's expression turned solemn. She let out a short sigh of relief, \"For a moment there, I thought you would ask for my virginity or something.\"\n\"I ain't a sex-depraved virgin. I'm a cultured stoic super alpha male of my species. I need no women!\"\n\"…But you're a pervert that dreams for big boobas.\"\n\"That's too. I have an on-and-off switch!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Back to the deal, can you pay rent with your blood?\"\n\"…Fine with me. How much do you need?\"\n\"Not much. Just this much.\"\nLeo laughed and purchased a plastic water gallon from his system shop.\nAs soon as the gallon came out, Xu Nuan and others sweated profusely while Esen's face turned dark.\nThat was a gallon!\nEsen yelled at Leo in frustration, \"Are you a vampire or something?! Why do you take so much?! Are you trying to bleed me to death?!\"\nLeo scoffed, \"I can't collect your lifespan. What else can you give me if it's not your virgin yin blood?\"\nEsen puffed her chest, \"Of course, you can get my loyalty. But if you're kinky, you can have me as well.\"\n\"I'd rather hump a sexy tree than hump a corpse. No, thanks.\"\n\"BASTARD!\"\nEsen teleported in front of Leo and kicked him to the nuts. Unfortunately, his precious jewels were too hard, and she hurt her feet once again.\nLeo cackled and exited the bus, leaving the annoying elf behind. Meanwhile, Esen realized that she had been bullied again. She swore that she would get back at him one day.\nIvy came out from her room to console her master. She patted her back.\n\"Master, other couples sometimes quarrel and end up in physical abuse. In your case, Lord Florida Man didn't even try to hurt you, but you hurt yourself. I'm sure he cares for you.\"\n\"WHO SAID WE'RE COUPLES?!\" Esen screeched at Ivy.\n\"Aren't you dao companions? You and him smell the same for some reason.\"\n\"…Same smell? Me?\" Esen sniffed her armpit.\n\"Aren't you staying in his cabin? A man and woman staying in the same bedroom, if you are not his dao companion, why are you staying in his bedroom?\"\n\"…\"\nFinally, Esen realized the cause of the misunderstandings. Esen turned around, hiding her red face. She teleported back into Leo's cabin at the back of the bus.\nThe crowd on the bus saw everything. The tamer girls quietly squealed as they got a new scoop. Xu Nuan and Tiger Swordsman shook their heads and got off the bus. As for Esen's servants, they remained there.\nCat, Taxi, and Ricardo were indifferent on the matter. They rushed out of the bus and reverted to their monster appearances. The trio stretched and relaxed.\n\"SMASH!\" Taxi dashed back to his barn.\n\"…Smash.\" Ricardo nodded at Cat and returned to his group as well.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nCat turned toward the granaries. Like a menacing giant spider, she crept on top of the general store and leaped toward the food storage to plunder Leo's crops once again.\n.\n.\nAfter getting out of the bus, Leo put his idea to work. He opened the domain system menu and purchased the parking lot.\n.\nParking Lot\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 8\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 30 x 30\n.\nThis structure had been sitting in his system for a while, but Leo had been ignoring it. As he could use this to his advantage, he built it right away.\nLeo placed the parking lot west of the clothing store as the west area was empty. The 30 x 30 grits transformed into a flatland.\nNot satisfied with the appearance, Leo upgraded it to level 9. Then, the structure changed.\nInstead of an empty parking lot, a new building appeared on top of the flatland. It was a parking lot building.\nLeo frowned as he didn't expect this. He got closer to check the ceiling height as his battle bus might not fit in there.\nFortunately, Leo's worry was pointless. The ceiling was 10 meters tall, a lot taller than standard parking lot buildings in the modern world. Moreover, it was more spacious than its outward appearance.\nLeo entered the building and noticed a massive space inside. At a glance, the space should be more than 3,000 sq/m. Moreover, there were only four pillars, which was unusual.\nSeeing such a wide space, Leo was delighted. He rushed back to the bus and drove it to the parking lot. But then, he came across an issue.\nThere was no guideline or drawn lines to indicate the rooms.\nSince it was a blank building, Leo had no choice but to use his own judgment. As a civilized man from the modern world, he looked for a parking space for handicapped people.\nOf course, he couldn't find any.\nAs Leo couldn't find any yellow line, he designed to be pragmatic and calculative. He drove the bus to the top floor.\nThe parking lot building came with 9 levels. It took Leo a while to navigate the huge bus up the road. Fortunately, the slops were big enough for buses and giant trucks.\nAfter getting to the top floor, Leo chose the corner-most area and lined the bus along with the edge, facing the door toward the center of the building.\nHis job was finished. Next, Leo began scouting the area.\nAs Leo looked around, he was surprised once again. The top of the parking lot was the same size as its outward appearance. Thus, there was less space than the interior of the building.\nLooking at the scenery from the rooftop, Leo remembered something. He rushed back into the bus and drove it to the 8th floor instead. Then, he parked it at the edge of the floor to save space.\nAfter getting out, Leo rushed to the top floor. He then searched for a metal ramp that he could set on this building.\nHe wasn't disappointed. There were plenty, and Leo managed to pick the right one. He fit one to the south barrier of the rooftop and nodded in satisfaction.\nWith the ramp, he could drive a bike and land on the south farm to complete a rare stunt trick.\nThe South ramp wasn't enough. Leo added another one to the west so that he could drive something to the empty area. Then, he looked at the east, where the clothing store and his general store were.\nAdding one to that area was a stupid idea. Leo didn't want any employee to have a funny idea and crash a car into his shopping mall.\n\"A parking space's rooftop isn't completed without a ramp! Now, what should I do with the limited space here? I need a longer road for a bike or a supercar to get some speed…\"\nLeo wondered if he could build an adjacent building to become an elevated road or a runway. Because of the distraction and his incurable ADHD, he forgot about the fate crystal quest for the entire day.\n.\n.\nFar west, ten kilometers away from Yan Empire's west coast, a white-haired burly elderly man hovered over the ocean, gazing at the fading defensive array of the continent. He wore tiger skin as clothes, and he had four arms instead of two.\nThe old man crossed his lower arms while his upper arms stretched forward. He widely grinned, anticipating chaos and opportunities.\n\"Finally, Yan Xiang's petty array is down. I guess Flame Blade Immortal has already found the fate crystal. It's about time for me to make my moves.\"\nThe old man whistled. A few seconds later, a massive portal appeared behind him, and ten thousand cultivators came out from the other side. All cultivators had four arms like the old man, and their average strength was in the soul transformation stage. Over a hundred of them were quasi-immortals.\nAs for the old man, his rainbow aura and air were similar to the flame swordsman that Leo had encountered. He was an earth celestial immortal disguised as a quasi-immortal cultivator.\nWithout looking at his comrades, the old man announced.\n\"We, the Gorr Tribe, have been hiding for 500 years because of Situ Nantian and Yan Xiang! They intentionally developed sweet dream mushrooms and planted them in our territory! Because of those mushrooms and those cowards, we were driven out of this planet. Wait no more, my brethren! Yan Xiang's precious jewel, the Earth Fate Crystal, has fallen into our hands! We will avenge our fallen comrades and show our appreciation for forcing us to grow in the demon realm!\"\nThe cultivators behind the old man roared like savage beasts. Their iris and pupils were ignited, emitting orange flame. Yellow tribulation flame came out from their pores as they were ready for combat.\nThe old man pointed in front of him.\n\"CHARGE! TAKE BACK OUR DOMAIN! KILL EVERYBODY!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 168 – 100 SQ/M Clothing Store Building Abducted by Florida Man's UFO\nThe new parking lot building caught the attention of the workers. Teenagers gathered around it while Wu Buyi and the elders entered the building to explore.\nAs usual, they found another building with a massive space. They were no longer surprised.\n\"Again, the spatial distortion array,\" Wu Buyi shrugged and left the building.\nHan Hao and Han Meng continued to explore the building. They reached the 8th floor, where Leo had parked his battle bus there.\n\"Oh, it's here. I guess this will be where Lord Florida Man keeps his flying ships. Well, what's on the next floor?\" Han Hao saw the bus and proceeded to the rooftop. Han Meng also followed after his father.\nUpon getting to the rooftop, they found a real-sized parking lot space and two ramps. As for Leo, he was no longer there.\n\"Slopes?\" Han Meng inspected the south ramp and touched its surface. It was smooth and hard.\nHan Hao also checked the west ramp. He crossed his arms in confusion.\n\"What are these for?\"\n\"Who knows?\"\n\"…\"\nThese people never had a slider when they were young. Thus, they lacked imagination. As they lost interest, they leaped down from the building and returned to their duties.\nA few minutes later, Leo came back from the junkyard, carrying two long logs. He placed it vertically, measuring if it could reach the top floor.\nUnfortunately, it was too short.\n\"Bah. I guess I have to use another method. What to do…?\"\nLeo planned to extend the rooftop so that a stunt car could race on it. But since this project was complicated, Leo paused to think. He imagined steel rods, which were commonly used to weave a foundation of a mega project construction.\nHe looked at the iron pine log. Although it had strong durability and toughness, Leo wasn't confident that they could replace the modern steel rods. After all, they were vulnerable to fire.\n\"I have to upgrade the logs and wood somehow. But if I want to do that, I have to upgrade my alchemy workshops to enable more cauldrons. To upgrade those, I have to upgrade my store to level 10…\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He gazed at his general store building.\n\"No choice, eh? Oh, right. Didn't I have a new ability?\"\nLeo thought of his dao avatar's ability – The Domain of Genes. As it only affected hostile people, he could use it to replace the default mechanism of the store.\nAfter making the decision, Leo entered the general store and warned the workers inside, who were resting on the third floor. He forced them to pack their belongings and wait in front of the store.\nThe confused teens and young men gathered their stuff and exited the building through the front door as requested. Then, they gathered in groups, waiting to see what Leo would do to the building.\nAfter everybody had left, Leo didn't upgrade the building right away. Instead, he came out of the building and called the people to follow him to the parking lot.\nThe group proceeded to the sixth floor of the parking lot. Then, Leo opened his online shopping menu. He input keywords.\nRecreational Vehicle, aka RV\nDING\nVans, trucks, trailers, buses, coaches, and motorhome accessories showed up in Leo's menu. He sorted and filtered the list before he chose a brand new Mercedes Sprinter Camper Edition, which cost only 100 years of lifespan.\nWHOOSH\nA black luxurious van appeared in front of Leo. He smirked and touched it. As usual, he ordered his system in his mind.\n'Upgrade it.'\nDING\nThe upgrading fee was the same as its price tag. After upgrading it to level 9, Leo only spent 900 YOL, including the van.\nThe vehicle slightly transformed. Its paint reflected the light like a mirror, and Leo could see himself from the reflection. The tires and the van's width were slightly bigger. The black windows glittered as they absorbed the sunlight to generate Qi for the vehicle.\nLeo slid open the van's door to check the interior.\nInstead of seeing a compact camping van with luxurious seats, Leo found a specious 100 square meter room inside. It featured a kitchen, a refrigerator, a washing machine, two bathrooms, a living room, and two bedrooms. Every room was fully furnished.  The flooring came with basic laminated wood, which looked easy to clean and maintain. Similar to Leo's bus, the driver's cockpit was separated from the living area.\nLeo hopped inside. Although he was inside a van, he no longer needed to crouch as the ceiling was 2.5 meters high. He checked the bedrooms next.\nInstead of finding a foldable bed, Leo found a bunk bed for two, two desks, and two closets. The room was as big as a studio room apartment. Leo checked the other room and saw the same interior. He was satisfied.\n\"Four people? Okay, that will work.\"\nLeo got out of the van. Upon getting out, the crowd gazed at him in anticipation.\n\"I'm reallocating everybody's residents. You will no longer stay in my shopping mall anymore. Instead, I'll let you live in these vehicles that I'm about to build! Well, first… I need to park this thing properly.\"\nLeo got back to the van and parked it at the north edge of the building.\n\"Group up into a team of four!\"\nThe young disciples looked at each other and began forming teams. It didn't take long for hundreds of youngsters to form groups.\nLeo picked the nearest group of four and pointed at the van.\n\"This is your new home. Take your belongings in there and choose your room. Also, you are responsible for your own rooms and van. If it gets dirty, it's on you!\"\nThe four chosen youngsters were excited. They brought their belongings into the camping RV to see the inside. Upon seeing the interior, they weren't disappointed.\n\"Wow.\"\n\"Holy…\"\nLeo frowned at their reaction. He remembered something. Walking back into the van, Leo pulled the car's key. He stared hard at it while he ordered his cancer cells.\n'Duplicate this thing for me. Use the metal Qi or whatsoever.'\nLeo's transparent blood seeped out from his fingertip. When it touched the air and Qi, it turned black and grew bigger. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a black water slime.\nThe slime enveloped the car key for a moment. It slowly split into three and separated from the original. Then, they transformed, duplicating the key's size and shape.\nJust like that, Leo got three additional keys for these guys. He tossed one to each resident.\n\"Don't lose it. That's the key to your home. Also, if any moron tries to drive the car without permission and crashes something, I'll deduct your lifespan for the repair cost. Comprende?!\"\nThe four teenagers repeatedly nodded and sweated profusely. They stored their keys in their spatial rings.\nAfter entrusting the keys to the new residents, Leo repeated the process. He purchased another RV, picking the same brand.\n.\n.\nIn the end, Leo purchased a hundred RVs and parked them on the seventh floor. As Leo left a lot of room for other cars to navigate through this floor to the lower and higher levels, it was 80% full. Although there were rooms to squeeze more vans in, Leo left some empty areas for the boys for creativity.\nAll homeless employees got their new home. Leo could upgrade the store without implicating the bystanders.\nGoing back to the general store, Leo visited the third floor, where the employees used to stay there. As Leo had expected, the floor and the partitioned rooms were full of dirt and footprints. It needed a heavy cleaning.\nLeo shrugged and visited the second floor next. He collected all sports cars into his spatial rings. Then, he touched the floor.\n\"Upgrade Menu.\"\nDING\n<Would you like to upgrade the Humble General Store to Level 10?>\n<Warning! Upgrading your Humble General Store to level 10 will unlock the PVP feature and disable your newbie protection domain. Once upgraded, you cannot decrease its level!>\n<Warning! Upgrading your Humble General Store to level 10 will activate Fate Crystal's Main Quests. Please strengthen your base before you start the main quests.>\n\"Stop whining. Do it!\"\nDING\n<Upgrading!>\nRUMBLE\nThe entire shopping mall trembled. Sounds of glass breaking echoed while the entire building transformed once again.\nThe store gained two new floors while it maintained its interior and spaces. New sets of escalators and a new elevator appeared, allowing shoppers to walk freely in the mall. From the second level to the fifth level, the majority of the floor vanished, transforming the interior floors into balcony floors.\nCompensating for the lost usage space, each partitioned room in the mall got bigger. They looked small from the outside. But when Leo looked closer, each room was about 1,000 square meters, which was quite sizable for a store.\nAfter the trembling stopped, the system prompted him with a new message.\nDING\n<Your Humble General Store has reached the maximum level. To upgrade it further, please evolve the building into a \"Shopping Mall\" by using the store domain menu.>\n<Main Quest has been unlocked. A new quest menu can be accessed via the store domain menu.>\n<Your Newbie Protection has expired. The store building will no longer be protected by the absolute defense domain. If the Humble General Store building is destroyed, your store domain will be deleted.>\n<PVP Mode has been unlocked. You may access this menu via the store domain menu.>\n<Shop Merging Feature has been unlocked. You can now move your store buildings into the Humble General Store.>\n<New Construction Options!>\n\"…\"\nA lot of information flooded Leo's mind. He slowly digested it one by one.\nFirst, Leo wanted to refute the system as this place was no longer a \"Humble\" general store. It should be called empty-mall-level backrooms.\nAs the system gave him a new thing to do, Leo tested it right away. He opened the store domain menu to see the new features.\nNew tabs appeared in the shop domain menu – Merge, PVP, and Quests.\nLeo pressed on it.\nDING\n<Please select the building you wish to merge with your Humble General Store.>\nIn the menu, the screen highlighted the clothing store and alchemy workshops in green.\nExperimenting with it, Leo pressed on the clothing store building.\nDING\n<Please designate the room you wish for the Clothing Store Level 9 to occupy.>\nLeo didn't think much. He picked an empty room on the first floor.\nWHOOSH\nThe clothing store building instantly vanished. The workers in the store, including the cat-eared mannequin, remained behind. They looked around in confusion as the entire building was gone.\nWHOOSH\nAll items and clothes that the mannequin made appeared in the designated room. The interior changed into what the clothing store once had. Moreover, all the clothes and display mannequins sorted themselves, gathering on the new shelves and cloth hangers in the room.\nLeo walked toward the new clothing store in his mall to check. As the store was in the mall, no front door or wall existed anymore. Only a long display window separated this place from the adjacent rooms.\nCurious about what the mannequin had made, Leo checked the products. He noticed several sets of black suits, neckties, long pants, leather shoes, evening dresses, t-shirts, and random clothes that Leo had shown to the mannequin girl. Roughly counting, Leo believed she had at least 2,000 clothes for sale.\nTAKTAKTAK\nThe clothing store mannequin sprinted into the shopping mall. She found Leo and stopped on her track. Then, she saluted.\n\"Oh, you're here.\"\n\"…\"\nThe mannequin seemed to be in a good mood. She rushed into the new clothing store and inspected the interior.\nA few seconds later, the girls, who worked at the clothing store, followed their boss to the mall. When they found the mannequin, they were relieved.\n\"There you are… Eh? L-Lord Florida Man?\"\nThe girls bowed to Leo, \"G-Greetings, senior! Er… Right! W-We have something to report! T-The clothing store has disappeared, sir! The whole building vanishes!\"\nLeo grinned. As the girls seemed confused, Leo explained everything to them.\n\"It's fine. Actually, there will be a big change. A lot of changes…\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 169 – Florida Man Quits His Job to Start New Career as Gamer, Spends All His Savings in Gacha Game.\nAfter settling down the clothing store employees, Leo inspected the shop domain system menu again as there were many new features.\nAfter moving the clothing store into the building, the map highlighted the clothing store, and there was an exclamation icon on it. Curious, Leo pressed on the icon.\nDING\nA new system screen appeared, and it showed the status of the clothing store.\n.\nClothing Store Level 9\nAutomaton Worker (0/5)\nAutomaton Weaver – (1/5)\nWeaver Skills – (5/5) MAX\nStore Quality – (3/5)\n.\n\"Oh, I thought I would get something new. What a bummer.\"\nIt was a shortcut to display the store's status. Leo could use it to upgrade the store without touching it.\nAs the main building was already level 10, Leo upgraded the clothing store without hesitation. Instead of adding more points to the store's quality, he put one extra point to a new weaver to increase the production rate.\n.\nClothing Store Level 10\nAutomaton Worker (0/5)\nAutomaton Weaver – (2/5)\nWeaver Skills – (5/5) MAX\nStore Quality – (3/5)\n.\nA new cat-eared mannequin manifested. She stood straight and gazed at the other weaver for a moment. Then, she approached Leo and poked his arm with her index finger.\nLeo was familiar with these mannequins. As usual, he peeled his skin for the automaton. The weaver received it in glee. However, it kept staring at Leo and tugged his suit.\n\"Oh, I forgot. I haven't assigned you a job, right?\"\nThe new mannequin nodded.\n\"Okay. See the clothes in the store? Make more of those. I don't care which type you make. Just make sure that everything will always be in stock.\"\nThe cat-girl automaton nodded again and walked into the store. She stopped in front of her senior and began communicating by nodding and twitching their heads, sending MOS codes.\nThe tamer girls in the store got scared of the two mannequins. They looked as if they came straight from a horror movie or they were possessed by demon spirits. Fortunately, they didn't start chasing anyone. The weavers continued producing black suits and night dresses as usual.\nBut the system wasn't done with Leo. It gave him a new hint.\nDING\n<Tips: The max level of all buildings is 10. However, you can upgrade them further if you complete Fate Crystal quests.>\n\"…\"\nBeing reminded of the main quest, Leo checked the Fate Crystal Quest menu.\nTwo new screens appeared. The left one showed the number of fate crystals in Leo's possession and their abilities. Leo got to see what his Entity Fate Crystals could do. The adjacent window showed the tasks that Leo needed to complete.\n.\nFate Crystal Quest Introduction\nWhen you assimilated with the Entity Fate Crystal for the first time, a new fate and power have been granted to you. Your first Entity Fate Crystal is specialized in \"Store System\" and \"Lifespan\". Therefore, your fate and quests in the future will revolve around your store and lifespan.\nAs you have experimented with the store system, you already learned about its nature and perks. However, those perks are nothing compared to the true potential of the Store System and your great fate.\nThe following quests shall serve as guidelines on how you can utilize the Store System to the fullest potential. Bear in mind that nothing comes for free. You will need to invest in the system to become the strongest system user in this universe.\n*Note. For further details about fate crystal's abilities, check the Fate Crystal Abilities Menu.\n.\nThe introduction sounded corny and suspicious. Also, Leo already had an ongoing Earth Fate Crystal Tutorial. He wondered what this quest series would be.\nHe scrolled the quest window further down to read.\n.\nQuest Types\nFate Crystal Quests are categorized into four – Main Quests, Repeatable Quests, Side Quests, and Time-Limited Quests.\nMean Quests are your main objectives that you should prioritize over everything else. It consists of 13 phrases and each phrase consists about 10-20 tasks. The tasks can be challenging or tedious. However, the rewards for every completion are abundant and generous. You may find yourself chasing after the main tasks in the future.\nRepeatable Quests have three sub-categories. Daily Quests, Weekly Quests, and Monthly Quests will discipline you and reward you for the chores. The rewards are not as generous as the main quests, but they can accumulate if you don't neglect them. In short, they are the quests to promote hard workers.\nSide Quests are secondary tasks you can unlock as you meet more people or travel abroad. They usually appear when you come across a fate crystal or a fate crystal owner. The content of the quests varies, depending on your compatibility with the fate crystals.\nTime-limited quests are self-explanatory. Nobody can tell when and how to trigger these quests. However, only those who are blessed by luck can receive these quests. It is rumored that the quests' difficulty is higher than the main quests, but the rewards are always worth the effort and investment. Please be mindful of these quests when they appear.\n.\nEverything sounded like the general game systems of modern gacha games or MMORPGs. Reading about it reminded him of the nostalgic past when he was a human.\nThe introduction pages were over. Leo checked the content of the quests.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phrase 1/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phrase.\nPhrase Completion Rewards: 100,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Building), and Increase Sub-Building's Max Level to 12\nPhrase One Tasks (7/10 Completed)\n- Evolve Humble General Store into a Shopping Mall.\n- Move any building into the main store's building. (Done)\n- Set up a new store in the main store's building. (Done)\n- Complete a mystic realm expedition once. (Done)\n- Upgrade any building to level 10. (Done)\n- Harvest at least 10,000 of any crops from Basic Farmlands. (Done)\n- Concoct at least 10,000 pills by using Alchemy Workshop. (3,330 / 10,000)\n- Recycle at least 10,000 items by using the Recycling Center. (4,009 / 10,000)\n- Summon at least 10 automatons to work in your domain. (Done)\n- Sold at least 1,000 products of your store. (Done)\n*For each completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo scratched his head. He did nothing, but seven of ten tasks were listed as completed. As for the task rewards, they hadn't been claimed yet.\nBehind each task, there was a claim button. Leo manually pressed on them.\nDING\nDigital tickets appeared in his shop domain menu. He got 7 building lucky draws and seven automaton lucky draws.\nLooking at the tickets reminded Leo of the blasphemous gacha games in the past. They were the source of all evil, and Leo used to invest heavily in one of those games.\n\"Mah gawd. Should I keep it until I have 10 tickets or what? Will I have a discount or a guarantee system if I pull 10 at once?\"\nLeo laughed and pressed on the flashing ticket icons. Then, the window navigated to a new tab, which he had never seen before.\nIt was a gacha page!\nThere was a gacha system hiding in his shop domain system?!\nLeo widened his eyes in astonishment and disbelief. Still, as he once used a lucky draw and got the gunsmith workshop, Leo quickly came back to his senses.\nHe read the new page, and he was not disappointed.\nImages of fancy miniature buildings floated on the page. At the bottom right, there was a one-draw button and a 10+1 draw button! In addition, it cost 10 gacha tickets to draw 11!\nThe sentence above the buttons ignited Leo's gambling addiction.\n[Guaranteed Rare or higher rarity for every 10+1 draw.]\nIn short, it would be more beneficial for Leo to accumulate 10 tickets to use it at once.\n\"What about the automatons? Will I get 2B or KOSMOS from the gacha or what?\"\nThe automaton page was just a swipe away. Leo pressed the right arrow button on the right edge of the screen, and a new gacha page appeared.\nThis page showed the images of faceless mannequins in the background. However, a beautiful female android and a strong-looking humanoid robot stood in front of the generic ones, acting as their poster guy and girl.\nThe promotion was the same. Leo needed 10 for the guaranteed rare and the bonus draw.\nUnfortunately, Leo couldn't purchase the missing tickets. He pressed the draw 10+1 button to test it, but the system warned Leo that he had insufficient items.\n\"System, can I buy these tickets?\"\nAgain, the system didn't give him another hint or allow him to buy lucky draw tickets.\n\"I guess I have no choice but to complete the main quests. But what about the daily quest thingy?\"\nLeo turned his attention to the repeatable quest tab. He glanced at them. Then, he knitted his brow.\n.\nDaily Quests\n- Sell 1,000 items in your store. (0/1,000)\n- Attract 1,000 customers to your store (0/1,000)\n- Gain at least 1,000 years of lifespan by selling items from your store. (0/1,000)\nRewards (Per Task Completion): 1,000 essence stones\nRewards (Per Full Completion): 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThe quests were impossible for Leo at the moment as everybody in his domain was Leo's employee. After he had absorbed the Life Sword Sect and the Amazonian Sanctuary into his domain, he didn't get any new customers.\nHe wondered where all the customers went.\nThe weekly quests and monthly quests were even more brutal. The quests required Leo to proactively bring in customers to his store. The number also exceeded the daily quests by ten times.\nIn short, without a customer, Leo couldn't complete any repeatable quest.\nRealizing the issue, Leo had a headache. He scratched his head so much that his hair got slightly messy.\n\"Forget it. I'll complete the main quests first.\"\nLeo turned his attention to the shop domain system. He moved all three alchemy workshops into the shopping mall's building, putting them on the fifth floor as they were related to the production. He also moved the gunsmith workshop to the fifth floor as Leo designated the top floor for the production workshops.\nNext, Leo upgraded all of them to level 10 and put one point to new cauldrons. With this setup, the workshop's production rate would double.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 10\nActive Cauldrons: (2/5)\nAlchemist Automaton (1/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5)\nProduction Quantity Level – [2/5]\n.\nWith a new cauldron, Leo could focus on completing the pill-making task. However, he didn't need to do it right away as there were other important things to do.\nLeo hadn't explored the new batch of buildable structures yet.\nHe opened the shop domain system to see the list of the new buildings. Then, he found many interesting structures.\n.\nFood Court\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 10\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – Three Humble General Store's Rooms or Shopping Mall's Rooms.\n.\nEssence Stone Quarry\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 10\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 200 x 200\n.\nYin-Yang Pylon Tower\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 10\nPrice – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 100 x 100",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 170 – Florida Man Invented New Strongest Flashlight, Accident Blinded Himself and His Employees by during Experiment.\n\"Pylon Tower? Is this an electric pylon pole or a Starcraft one?\"\nLeo couldn't help but smile. He rushed outside as he wanted to see what the pylon tower was. As the west district was empty, Leo built the massive pylon tower right away.\nDING\nA steel pyramid manifested from nothingness. It occupied half of the designated land that Leo had sacrificed. A 30-meter-tall diamond-shaped rainbow-color crystal hovered over the steel platform. It rotated clockwise and released cold air.\nLeo gawked at the large pylon crystal in astonishment. While Leo admired his creation, the others also came to see the new structure as it produced something special.\nHua Jiashan was the first to find Leo. He rushed to the latter's side and pointed at the pylon tower in shock.\n\"L-Lord Florida Man! W-Where did you get that Spirit Stone Heart?!\"\n\"Spirit Stone Heart?\" Leo stopped looking at the pylon crystal and turned to Hua Jiashan. He tilted his head in confusion, \"What's that?\"\n\"I-It's the heart of all spirit stones, senior! When I was young, these crystals were what made us cultivators. They fill this realm with elemental Qi while we, the cultivators, absorb its Qi to become immortal. I-I thought the former Yan Emperor took everything with him.\"\n\"So, you're saying, that Eren Yeager's butt plug is a Qi generator?\"\n\"Erm, what?\"\n\"Let me rephrase that. Is that crystal a Qi factory?\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior! That crystal is very important! As long as we have one of them in this realm, our world will be filled with natural Qi, and our people can get strong fast! B-But, there might be an issue.\"\n\"What now?\" Leo crossed his arms and stared at Hua Jiashan.\nThis guy once forced him to give up the Sweet Dream Mushroom farm. Fortunately, Leo managed to import a world tree from the mystic realm and grow some mushrooms, so the project continued.\nLeo was cautious of Hua Jiashan. He didn't want this paranoid old man to ruin his fun again.\n\"S-Senior,\" Hua Jiashan looked around. He spotted a hundred young disciples gathering on top of the parking lot building to admire the new structure. Then, he discovered what he had feared.\nThe disciples on the building had a pale complexion. They were fine in the beginning, but weak ones began vomiting. Some of the young Qi-condensation realm cultivators couldn't handle the dense Qi in the air.\nHua Jiashan faced Leo again.\n\"S-Senior. The Qi of the Spirit Stone Heart is too strong for young cultivators to handle. Please create an array to filter or contain its Qi. Otherwise, our disciples might die from Qi deviation.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo pursed his lips and looked at the crowd around them. Upon gazing at the parking lot, he noticed a hundred young men on the rooftop and the seventh floor, staring at the pylon crystal.\n\"Tsk.\"\nLeo was annoyed. He walked toward the steel pyramid and touched it.\nDING\nThe Yin-Yang Pylon Tower's menu screen appeared, informing Leo what it could do.\n.\nYin-Yang Pylon Tower Level 1\nYin and Yang Essence Production Level (1/10)\nFire Essence Production Level (0/10)\nWater Essence Production Level (0/10)\nWood Essence Production Level (0/10)\nEarth Essence Production Level (0/10)\nMetal Essence Production Level (0/10)\n[Unlock New Element Slot] (0/4) – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nThere was no sign or hint about an array or a filter that Hua Jiashan needed.\nAs the upgrade fee was quite high, Leo rechecked his lifespan to see his balance.\n<Current Lifespan: 361,154 Years…>\nLeo indeed spent a lot in the past few days. Even though he managed to snatch some talismans from the dead cultivators and ate them, the rewarded lifespan was not enough to regain his losses.\nLooking at his current lifespan, Leo was reminded of the Floridian Pills that one of his workshops had been making. He believed it should already be finished and collected.\n'I'll go check those pills later. I hope they can give me some lifespan for the trouble. Otherwise, it would have been a waste of time. Those things took 30 days to make!'\nWhile thinking, Leo upgraded the pylon tower to level 10. He got nine status points to allocate, but he hadn't chosen a status yet.\nRUMBLE\nThe tower froze for a moment. Then, seven yellowish saucer hoops appeared putting the crystal in the center. The hoops rotated in a different direction as if they were an Aerotrim that astronauts usually used to train their balance. However, the crystal didn't move along with the rapidly rotating rings.\nAs the hoops moved in every axis, Qi stopped coming out. Instead, the energy flowed toward the pyramid, and the structure shone.\nWhite lines illuminated and flowed toward the foot of the pyramid. At the same time, the ground around the pyramid elevated, revealing a grey floor, made of unknown steel.\nThe light traveled everywhere on the grey floor like a fluid flowing down from a mountain, following mysterious geometrical circular drainages. As the light expanded, Leo and Hua Jiashan looked at the ground and noticed a pattern.\n\"Circles?\" Leo discovered that the lines of light drawn multiple circles on the ground. Moreover, he could feel warm Qi from the areas in the circles.\n\"I-Isn't this?\"\nHua Jiashan picked a spot and sat inside a circle. He closed his eyes to meditate for a moment. A second later, he widened his eyes and laughed.\n\"Lord Florida Man! Thank you!\"\n\"???\" Leo tilted his head and wryly smiled, \"Er, thank me for what?\"\nHua Jiashan looked around. He pointed at the circles on the ground.\n\"My lord. I can't tell you how much I'm moved. Not only did you contain the Qi for us, but you created cultivation hotspots for young cultivators! I can sense a smooth flow of Qi from these circles! If they sit on it and cultivate here, their progress will improve leap and bound!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo still didn't understand what it actually did. However, he did sense mild radiation from the surface of the ground. He wondered if Hua Jiashan's disciples might develop skin cancer on their butt cheeks if they overused this place.\n\"Welp, suit yourself. Is the leakage issue solved now?\" Leo changed the subject. He wondered if those young men in the RVs could live in there.\n\"No problem, senior! I don't feel the oppressive Qi from before anymore!\"\n\"…Okay. That's good.\"\nLeo was relieved. For once, Hua Jiashan wouldn't ruin his domain development project.\nStill, as the pylon tower was related to the Qi production, he wondered if he should focus on one element or multiple elements. He asked Hua Jiashan.\n\"Say, Elder Hua.\"\n\"Yes, my lord?\"\n\"Which do you think is better? A specialized Qi tower or an all-rounder tower?\"\n\"What do you mean, senior?\"\nLeo let out a long sigh. He confessed, \"I can make this tower produce all five elements essence and yin-yang essence. But if I do that, the quality and the quantity of each Qi type might be low. But if I choose to specialize in one type, I can make the best… Spirit Stone Heart in the universe, maybe.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\n\"Anyway, just tell me which element your people generally prefer. We have Yin and Yang. We also have fire, water, earth, metal, and wood elements.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan's entire body stiffened. He was frozen in time as if Dio Brando activated his power nearby.\nThe old man's brain.exe stopped working.\nHe wasn't the only one who was so shocked that he was petrified. Wu Buyi, Han Hao, Dongfang Mei, and a few elders nearby had been eavesdropping their conversation, and they were frozen in time as well.\nSince every cultivator around him was useless, Leo thought of another old witch that had lived 10,000 years. She might know something.\nLeo jumped to the 8th floor of the parking lot. He got on the motorhome bus and searched for Esen in the master cabin.\nHe found Esen on the second floor of the cabin. Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice were also there with her. The group of undead all wore modern bikini swimsuits and rested on an artificial beach.\n\"Esen, I need your opinion,\" Leo approached Esen, who was in the middle of sunbathing. She lay on her stomach, revealing her bare back.\nLooking at the smooth back of the elf lich, Leo's eyes naturally looked down and found her perky bottom. Although she didn't move, Leo could tell that they would jiggle if someone slapped them.\nHe had to admit. Although Esen's chest was an \"L\", her bottom was a huge \"W\".\nThe intrusive thought and the temptation were dangerous this time. Leo looked away from her white butt cheeks and clenched his right wrist with his left hand.\n'MUST.NOT.SPANK.'\nEsen noticed Leo's arrival. She turned her head and glanced at him.\n\"What's up, geezer?\"\n\"I made a… Spirit Stone Heart. I'm wondering which element I should prioritize. Should I make it a multi-element one or should I specialize it.\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned Spirit Stone Heart, Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice turned around. Although they still wore the blindfolds, they looked interested in the topic.\nMarc was excited, \"Can you make it Yin Element? Undead like us need it the most. If we have that, we can resurrect our colleagues!\"\nIvy agreed. She chimed in. \"Holy One. This may sound selfish, but we need Yin Element. Not only do we benefit from the element, but the nightmares, thunder unicorns, and your pet \"Cat\" will enjoy it. Yin element is the best nutrition we need.\"\nEsen slowly sat up. She covered her chest with one arm while Beatrice brought a towel to cover her front. After covering herself, Esen gave her opinion.\n\"Focus on Yin and Yang, period! Ignore the basic elements. As long as you have abundant yin Qi or yang Qi inside you, you can cultivate every other element!\"\nHearing Esen's advice, Leo was enlightened, \"I see. Thanks for the tips.\"\n\"Hmm! Have you realized my greatness now?\" Esen puffed her chest and pointed her nose to the sky. However, by doing so, the towel fell off, revealing her naked front.\n\"…\"\nLeo looked down and stared at the great plain. He smirked.\n\"You would have been greater had you been blessed with twin mountains. Unfortunately, your RNGesus did your genes dirty. Maybe you were born with low Estrogen. I want to suggest Estrogen injection, but that will surely give you breast cancer. But if you can handle small risks, you can take birth control pills to boost your hormones. I'm sure they will grow bigger, maybe. Oh, by the way, your nipples are erected.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen silently looked at her chest and discovered that she was half naked. Her face reddened in embarrassment.\n\"MUKIIIIII!! I'LL KILL YOU!\"\n\"WHY?! I was just giving you proper advice!\"\nEsen screamed and baby-punched Leo. The latter laughed and ran away while the girl chased after him.\n.\n.\nAfter being chased around the bus for several minutes, Leo purchased a pack of modern contraceptive pills for Esen to boost her hormones. Although they cost 1,000 years of lifespan, it was enough to silence her for the time being.\nLeo returned to the tower. As Esen had suggested, Leo added all points to the Yin-Yang element.\n.\nYin-Yang Pylon Tower Level 10\nYin and Yang Essence Production Level (10/10)\nFire Essence Production Level (0/10)\nWater Essence Production Level (0/10)\nWood Essence Production Level (0/10)\nEarth Essence Production Level (0/10)\nMetal Essence Production Level (0/10)\n[Unlock New Element Slot] (0/4) – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n[Upgrade] – 10,000 Years of Lifespan\n.\nWith the specialized path, the light on the ground illuminated everything around the pyramid. They were so bright that it flashbanged everybody nearby.\nLeo basked in the blinding light from the ground. His trembling hands operated the online shopping system as he purchased sunglasses. After putting them on, he recovered from the temporary blindness.\nHe looked around, wondering how the others fared under the intense light.\nHua Jiashan and the elders all closed their eyes and turned away from the tower. As for the innocent juniors on the parking lot's rooftop, they screamed in unison.\n\"MY EYES!\"\nLeo's expression turned into a pokerface meme. He thought of the prosthetic eyeballs that he created ages ago.\n'I guess I'll have some new customers soon. Those eyeballs are going to sell like hotcakes. Oh, I should add some sunglasses to my store.'",

      "content": "Chapter 171 Florida Man Establishes Meth Factory in Shopping Mall and Offers Meth-Making Master Class as Services.\nChapter 171 – Florida Man Establishes Meth Factory in Shopping Mall and Offers Meth-Making Master Class as Services.\nAfter building the pylon tower, Leo returned to the store. He visited the alchemy workshop on the fifth floor.\nBy the time Leo arrived, the mannequin alchemists already found their working place. A couple nerdy alchemist disciples also followed the mannequins and discovered the new area.\n\"S-Senior Florida Man, what happened here, sir?\" One of the disciples asked Leo.\n\"Nothing much. I just moved the workshops to this place, so you don't have to cramp in a small area.\"\nLeo gazed at the front of the workshops. Instead of calling it workshops, they looked like a tutor center office, where Asian parents imprisoned their kids during holidays because the children failed to become a doctor before the age of 10.\nIn front of the offices, the walkway balcony was wider than the road behind the general store's building. Measuring with his eyes, it was about 50-60 meters wide, a lot wider than the previous road. Many alchemist enthusiasts could have a BBQ party there instead of cramping or competing to stare at boiling cauldrons all day.\nThinking of the cauldrons, Leo reminded himself of the Floridian Dantian Pills. He entered one of the workshop offices to explore the interior.\nAs Leo looked around, he noticed that the interior was larger than it appeared from the outside. He wasn't surprised by the special distortion anomaly anymore.\nThe front office was nothing special. The first noticeable attraction was the front desk counter.\nOn the right, Leo found a coffee lounge area. About 20 round coffee tables and chairs made this zone look like a coffee shop. As for the left area, blank modern glass showcase cabinets formed a square array.\n\"A reception area and a showcase area?\"\nLeo nodded in approval of the system's upgrade. He liked the interior design.\nGoing further in, Leo followed a corridor. A path led Leo toward the production area of the workshop. As he walked along the way, he found five large rooms. Two of them featured a cauldron at the center while the other three were empty. Every room came with a horseshoe-shaped spectator stand and cushions.\nLeo peeked into one of the rooms and found a mannequin alchemist doing his job. He entered the room for a sightseeing.\nUpon getting inside, Leo gazed at the spectator stand and measured the room's size. It was roughly 150-200 square meters, and the ceiling featured several air ventilation duct system as it removed the smoke and hot air from the cauldron. The air circulation and the chilling air were better than the former building.\nAfter checking the place, Leo had a rough idea of how this place worked. Next, he inspected the deepest area of this workshop. He expected a storage area or something similar.\nAt the deepest area of the workshop, Leo found a storage room as he had predicted. Inside the room was the interior of the former workshop's building, where Leo stored some pills and pill ingredients inside.\nIn the room, Leo found some old pills and random leftover materials from the farmlands. He also located what he had been looking for.\nThe finished Floridian Dantian Pills had already been collected and stored in a Tupperware box. The 50 black pills inside were two inches thick.\nAs Leo was about to pick up the box, the alchemy mannequin walked toward Leo and poked him.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo turned around and found the mannequin menacingly staring at him with red eyes. He poked Leo's skin, wanting something.\nLooking at the mannequin, Leo was confused for a moment. A few seconds later, he remembered the trait of the workshop. As Leo had ordered the mannequin to make Floridian Dantian Pills, the mannequin automatically queued the next batch. However, he didn't leave spare materials for the mannequin to continue making them.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Floridian Dantian Pill]\nOne 9th-grade Monster Core of Horned Caiman\nOne Drop of Florida Man's Blood\nOne Piece of Florida Man's Flesh\n.\nThe recipe required his blood and flesh. Obviously, the mannequin couldn't find the ingredients.\n\"I have three more cores with me. Oh, well. I guess I have to hunt a few more to keep the store in stock.\"\nLeo leisurely bit his finger and tore a bit of his flesh and blood for the mannequin. The doll received them and rushed back to work, making a new batch of Floridian Dantian Pills.\nAfter the mannequin was gone, Leo picked up the box and checked the content. As soon as he opened the lid, he received the pending notification message from the workshop.\nDING\n<You have refined 30 Superior-Grade and 20 Pinnacle-Grade Floridian Dantian Pills.>\n.\nSuperior-Grade Floridian Dantian Pill\n- Increase firearm weaponry compatibility by 5,000 years' worth of training.\n- Increase poison, lightning, and wind element essence by 5,000 years' worth of cultivation.\n- Increase lifespan by 1,000 years.\n- Grant immunity to Crimson Heaven Tribulation.\n.\nPinnacle-Grade Floridian Dantian Pill\n- Increase firearm weaponry compatibility by 10,000 years' worth of training.\n- Increase poison, lightning, and wind element essence by 10,000 years' worth of cultivation.\n- Increase lifespan by 2,000 years.\n- Grant immunity to Black Heaven Tribulation.\n.\nLeo was disappointed. He thought that it would give him a lot of lifespan for the trouble. Unfortunately, the best pill only offered 2,000 years of lifespan. If Leo consumed everything, he would only get 70,000 YOL back.\nHe couldn't sell them either. After all, nobody in this world could live more than 1,000 years. Selling them for cheaper than the base value would be a stupid idea.\nSince Leo couldn't sell them, he might as well eat them. If he felt generous, he could distribute a few to his promising juniors, such as Gao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and Esen's subordinates.\n\"I guess it's too late to stop the mannequin. Oh, right. I have three extra cauldrons. I can allocate them for other pills.\"\nLeo stored the pill box in his spatial ring. He walked toward a free cauldron.\nAs Leo reached the free cauldron, the workshop mannequin was already there. However, it didn't do anything to the cauldron as Leo hadn't assigned this cauldron to make any pill yet.\nAs true immortal pills granted the same YOL compared to the Floridian dantian pills while they required only a week to make, it would be wiser to invest in true immortal pills instead.\nPutting the plan into action, Leo ordered the mannequin to make the true immortal pills.\nAs soon as the mannequin received the order, it rushed into the storeroom at the back to gather materials. But when it realized that it didn't have enough, it rushed out of the building to visit the warehouse outside.\nSeeing the mannequin's frantic action, Leo noticed the inefficiency in the building's settings and location. He opened the domain system menu, hoping to move the warehouses and granaries into the general store.\nUnfortunately, both buildings were highlighted in red. When Leo pressed on them, he received a notification message.\n<Required Shopping Mall.>\n\"…\"\nThis message reminded Leo that he could evolve the max-leveled general store into a proper shopping mall. Moreover, the main quest and side quest demanded him to upgrade the store.\nSince Leo needed to transform the building, he changed his plan. He pressed on the general store building to see its status.\nA [Evolve] button appeared at the bottom. Also, the texts on top informed Leo of a piece of bad news.\nCost – 100,000 Years of Lifespan\n\"RIP-OFF! THIS IS A SCAM!\"\nHe just spent 100,000 YOL upgrading Pylon Tower to level 10, and the system wanted another 100,000! Leo's kidneys, liver, spleen, intestines, and heart churned upon the fact that everything was expensive.\nAs optimistic as Leo was, he adjusted his mindset. He counted his fingers and contemplated.\n\"If a cauldron can make 50 immortal pills every week, I can get about 50,000 to 100,000 YOL of weekly income. But if I assign three cauldrons to make them, my income will be 150,000 to 300,000 YOL! I just need to work hard on eating pills and providing materials for the mannequins! Spending a week's worth of income to invest in something inevitable is not a waste!\"\nHyping himself, Leo felt better. He pressed the evolve button.\nRUMBLE\nThe entire building shook. Although the interior didn't change, Leo received a series of notification messages.\n<Your Humble General Store has evolved into \"Humble Shopping Mall\".>\n<New Construction Options!>\n<The Underground Parking Lot has been unlocked.>\n<Underground Storage Warehouse has been unlocked.>\n<You can purchase building gacha tickets with your lifespan.>\n<You can purchase worker gacha tickets with your lifespan.>\n<You can infinitely expand your domain territory with your lifespan.>\n<Storage Buildings can be linked to underground storage.>\n<You can assign free workers jobs in Humble Shopping Mall, such as Security, Clerk, Manager, Cashier, and etc.>\nLooking at the messages, Leo was surprised. He didn't expect to see new toys to entertain him.\nStill, Leo didn't get sidetracked this time. As he focused on getting his lifespan back, his mind was full of the pill-making plan and his factory.\nHe needed to upgrade the workshops.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 10\nActive Cauldrons: (2/5)\nAlchemist Automatons (1/5)\nProduction Quality Level – (5/5)\nProduction Quantity Level – [2/5]\n.\nLeo simply needed to upgrade all workshops three more times. However, he couldn't upgrade it further.\nAs Leo needed the sub-structures to be at a higher level, he checked the \"Shopping Mall\" menu if he could raise its level right away.\nDING\nHumble Shopping Mall Level 10 (MAX)\n\"DAMMIT!\"\n.\n.\n.\n\"HAHAHAHA!! KILL!\"\nFour-armed cultivators emerged from the west. They laid siege to the first coastal city. Although they ran into soul formation and soul transformation cultivators there, these demonic savages outnumbered them.\nWithin half a day, the defensive arrays crumbled. Hordes of demons entered the city and slaughtered townsmen, commoners, and cultivators.\nAfter getting the city fell, everybody celebrated their success. Men rushed into houses and dragged women outside. A few also abused their perks of war and committed war crimes.\nThe leader of the Gorr Tribe, Qiang Baidu, was once a cultivator from the Yan Empire. After the sweet dream mushroom incident, Situ Nantian branded them as the \"Infected\", and their tribe had to be eradicated.\nBecause of what Situ Nantian did, Qiang Baidu swore to get his revenge. So far, he managed to rebuild his clan and amassed troops of 10,000 demonic cultivators.\nHis target was the Cauliflower City. However, before he could get there, he needed to travel northeast.\nOn the way to Cauliflower City, there were multiple cities that he had to go through. The first major city was the lair of the Fatui Cult, the Frozen Fire City. Then, further north, there were small cities on the way.\nMagpie City was one of them.\nQiang Baidu gazed toward the northeast. He bellowed, assembling his men.\n\"We rest for the night! Tomorrow, we head northeast! Our next destination is the Fatui Cult!\"",

He visited all three workshops.\nThree cauldrons would be making True Immortal Pills to steadily supply Leo with lifespan income. One cauldron was dedicated to the Floridian Dantian Pills. One was for elemental grain pills as Leo could quickly mass-produce a batch of pills every hour.\nAs for the last cauldron, Leo left it idle so that he could research new stuff. He inspected all the random items that he had been collecting in the past months.\nA massive gemstone-like rock still sat in one of Leo's spatial rings. As he couldn't take it out inside the building, he exited the store and ejected the entire thing on the road.\nBOOM\n.\nSuperconductor Obsidian of Holy Lich\nThis 10,000-year-old mineral is the crystallization of a dead Archlich's dantian core. As the former master of this dantian crystal was as strong as a celestial king, this mineral inherited his physical strength. If it's used to make weapons, it will surely be extremely durable.\nCannot be used in alchemy.\nCan be used to make weapons or converted into metals\n.\nThis was something that Leo had extracted from the ground long ago. He already researched it, but he hadn't shown it to the gunsmith workshop mannequins yet.\nBecause it was too large, Leo karate-chopped the huge obsidian into smaller pieces and stored them in his spatial ring. He then transported them to the gunsmith workshop.\nUpon arrival at the gunsmith workshop, Leo discovered that it also had a front desk office like the alchemy offices. When he got inside, the layout and the structure appeared the same as the alchemy workshop's interior.\nLeo walked straight to the storeroom and dropped all the obsidian there for the mannequins to do something about them. He also checked the room and discovered a dozen cubic blocks of sacred wood. However, he also spotted a hundred matchlock rifles and sacred wood bullets.\n'I should upgrade this workshop's technologies. Matchlock and flintlock rifles are outdated. At least, they should make the breech-loader ones. I wish the mannequins could make the modern guns.'\nLeo opened the gunsmith menu and assigned one extra point to the technologies.\n.\nGunsmith Workshop Level 10\nGunsmith Mannequin (1/1)\nHandloading Mannequin (1/1)\nFirearm Technology (3/6)\nProduct Quality (2/6)\nStructure Quality (3/6)\n.\nAfter putting an additional point to the technology, changes occurred in the storeroom. Leo also received notification messages.\n<Firearm Technology has been upgraded. The workshop will stop producing outdated weapons.>\n<Would you like to upgrade your outdated firearms and ammunition to a new version? You have 146 outdated weapons and 6,500 ammo in your storeroom. The upgrade fee is 7,960 years.>\n<Please be advised. The outdated weapons outside of the workshop's storeroom cannot be upgraded. Please bring them back to the workshop's storeroom.>\nLeo was overjoyed. Even though the upgrade fee was expensive, he agreed, \"Do it!\"\nDING\nAll rifles on the weapon rack transformed. Instead of changing into flintlock rifles according to the world's timeline, it skipped the musket era to the Civil War period.\n146 breech-loading rifles glittered as if they had been freshly assembled with brand-new parts. The models looked similar to M1819 Hall, but they emanated mild metal, wood, and earth Qi.\nThe ammo section was also changed. They got slightly longer, and the wooden bullet head was coated with unknown black material.\n\"Hoh, boy. What the hell did my system do?\"\nLeo rubbed his chin. He thought of feeding a Floridian Dantian Pill to everybody and distributing these guns to them. If they had 10,000 years' worth of training from the pill, wouldn't they all become John Wicks?\nInspired by the idea, Leo grabbed one of the rifles, and some bullets, and rushed out to find his guinea pig, aka Gao Yan.\n.\n.\nBANG\nBANG\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman were at the makeshift shooting range, playing with their flintlock rifles. A dozen tamer girls were also there with them as they were also interested in the firearms.\nGao Yan became a new member of the shooting range. After the tournament, he realized how important the firearms were. Without Leo's artifacts, he would have never beaten Yan Zhu, who was two major realms stronger than him.\nBANG\nBANG\nGao Yan practiced shooting with his pistol, using the rubber ammo that Leo had given him. His posture was firm when he held his gun with both hands.\nAfter emptying a magazine, Gao Yan lowered his gun. He reloaded the magazine and changed his posture. Instead of holding the pistol with both hands, he only used one hand.\nGao Yan visualized Yan Zhu in front of him. Then, he shot the invisible enemy.\nBANG\nHis hand, wrist, and arm never moved. As the vanilla CZ 75 model had a low recoil, the upgraded version improved the feature by miles. While using regular ammo, Gao Yan didn't feel anything.\nThe trigger felt as light as a feather.\nBut as soon as Gao Yan added his Qi to the bullet, things changed.\nBOOM!\nThe pistol became a cannon. Gao Yan's arm bounced, and he lost his posture.\nGao Yan gasped for air and held his wrist. His entire arm trembled as he couldn't withstand the recoil.\nHan Hao took the gun off Gao Yan's hand and helped him sit. He also passed Gao Yan a canteen of cold water.\n\"Take it easy, Gao Yan. What gets into you?\"\nGao Yan wryly smiled and received the canteen from the elder. He then told Han Hao what he experienced during the tournament.\nListening to the boy, Han Hao and Han Meng were impressed. They also glanced at the pistol in envy.\n\"I see. That's why you're putting more importance to the weapon skill and accuracy.\"\nGao Yan nodded, \"Yes. The accuracy and aiming parts are easy. But when it gets real, it's very hard to aim accurately and adapt to the recoil. I just injected 10% of my Qi into the gun, and it became like that. Also, it has a lot of weaknesses. If it were me, I could have dodged every attack from the guns.\"\n\"Yeah. Your opponents can just dodge the bullet if they pay attention to where the muzzle is aiming at. That's why you shouldn't be overly relying on it, but you can't neglect gun skills either.\"\n\"That's why I'm training hard. I'm planning to keep this as a trump card in the future.\"\n\"Good choice!\"\nThe elders liked Gao Yan even more while the girls secretly admired the young man.\nWhile everybody exchanged their insight, Leo walked toward them and interrupted their conversation.\n\"I've finally found you.\"\nThe tamer girls, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and Gao Yan stood up. They saluted Leo.\n\"Greetings, senior.\"\nLeo pursed his lips and gazed at Gao Yan and Tiger Swordsman.\n\"You two have just returned, but you're here training. Aren't you tired?\"\n\"Of course not, sir!\" Tiger Swordsman laughed, \"I didn't get to do anything.\"\n\"What about you?\" Leo looked at Gao Yan. \"You got burnt back then. Are you alright?\"\nGao Yan's face and skin were already healed. He didn't look like someone who got hit by an explosion.\n\"I'm perfectly fine, senior. My dao avatar healed me.\"\nLeo wryly smiled and glanced at Thora, who had always been behind Gao Yan. Somehow, Leo envied the boy for having a caring waifu.\nAs everybody was energetic, Leo revealed his new item. He flickered a superior-grade Floridian dantian pill to Gao Yan.\n\"Eat that and get some rest.\"\n\"Err, eh?\"\nGao Yan caught the black pill and gazed at it in astonishment. It was twice larger than standard cultivation pills. Moreover, it emanated a strange aura.\nThora instantly recognized Qi. She exclaimed and told Gao Yan.\n'That's lightning Qi! There are wind and poison Qi, too!'\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\n'That's a precious cultivation pill! You should hurry and thank him!'\nGao Yan was shocked. He stood stiff and bowed 90 degrees, \"T-Thank you very much, Lord Florida Man! I-I'll work even harder to meet your expectations!\"\nLeo waved his hand and dismissed the boy. He turned toward the elders next and tossed them a breech-loading rifle.\n\"Give me your guns and use this instead. Actually, I forgot to bring extra. Try to get familiarized with this and the new bullets.\"\n\"???\"\nLeo didn't bother explaining or teaching them how to use a new weapon. He collected the old rifles and ammo. Then, he returned to the main store's building.\nHan Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Gao Yan, and the girls looked at Leo and the new gun in confusion for a moment.\nHan Meng was the first to seize the opportunity. He picked up the rifle and inspected it. At first, he didn't understand the loading mechanics. But after playing around with it, he realized that he could pull the hammer and reveal a new hold to reload an ammo.\nHan Meng ejected a spirit stone from his spatial ring. He inserted it into the hole and closed the breech. Instead of using gunpowder, Han Meng injected his fire Qi into the gun and pulled the trigger at the same time.\nBOOM\nCLANK\nThe spirit stone bullet hit dead center at the iron pine log target. It also blasted the wood to pieces.\nThe firepower was similar to the old model. The recoil was the same as the matchlock. However, Han Meng felt a lot more comfortable than the old gun.\n\"Hey, this gun is more accurate than the old one. I think it's easier to reload, too!\"\n\"Hmm? Let me see.\"\nHan Hao and Tiger Swordsman inspected the new toy. They flipped the breech part and played with the new reloading function.\nEverybody loved it. They didn't have to carefully push a spirit stone or a sacred wood ball into the muzzle anymore.\nThe group took turns shooting with the new weapon for a few minutes. The tamer girls also got the boons from being there as the elders taught them how to shoot as well. Although the tamers were reluctant to use their spirit stones as a bullet, they managed to borrow a few sacred wood bullets from Gao Yan to try.\nSeveral minutes later, Leo returned with a new arsenal. Upon seeing that everybody had fun with his new weapon, he was delighted.\n\"Nothing feels better than the sounds of gunshot, huh? Here, take your new weapons and ammo.\"\nEverybody was surprised when Leo suddenly tossed them rifles. Leo passed guns and ammo to the tamer girls as well. After distributing new toys to his workers, he turned his attention to Gao Yan again.\n\"Gao Yan, stop training for a day and get some rest. Don't forget to eat the pill I gave you.\"\n\"Erm…\" Gao Yan was reluctant to rest. He still wanted to train more, \"But I still wish to train.\"\n\"You will thank me later. Don't waste your time in the shooting range. Instead of wasting your ammo, eat that pill and go train with Esen.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Trust me.\"\nGao Yan deeply sighed. Since this was Leo's order, he had no choice but to comply, \"Yes, sir.\"\nThe guy sulked and dragged his feet to his home. He wasn't aware that the pill's effect would change his mind later.",

      "content": "Chapter 173 Game-Addicted Florida Man Sued Game Company as Game’s “Quest” Forced Him to Touch Grass\nChapter 173 – Game-Addicted Florida Man Sued Game Company as Game's \"Quest\" Forced Him to Touch Grass\nAt night, Leo was still inside the shopping mall, rearranging the first floor's goodies. All shelves and showcase refrigerators were concentrated on the northeast corner, leaving the other area empty.\nHe did this for a reason.\nAfter the shopping mall upgrade, a new area opened up at the back of the shopping mall – A large cargo elevator emerged, connecting to the underground warehouse zone. It became easier to transfer items from granaries and warehouses to the shopping mall.\nWith this setup, Leo could directly resupply his \"supermarket\" goods without leaving the shopping mall.\n\"Whew. Next!\"\nLeo chose not to sleep for the day as he had a hundred tasks to complete. He entered the cargo elevator and descended to the shopping mall's underground warehouse.\nGetting into the warehouse, Leo discovered four closed shutter doors and a massive empty room with a tall ceiling. On the shutter doors, labels told Leo where the doors would lead him to.\n[Granary 1]\n[Granary 2]\n[Warehouse 1]\n[Warehouse 2]\nIt wasn't hard to guess. Leo opened the \"Warehouse 1\" door.\nOpening the shutter door, the interior of Leo's first warehouse building was in front of him. He inspected the warehouse's items and collected weapons, clothes, and pills that he and his subordinates had plundered from the dead cultivators.\nAfter gathering a bunch of junk items in his spatial rings, Leo walked toward the exit. When Leo came out, he appeared outside of the first warehouse building.\n\"Alright. Neat! What about the security?\"\nLeo looked around and searched for a volunteer to test the security feature. It wasn't hard to find a trustworthy guy around here.\nThe first warehouse's mannequins and a disciple helped each other pushing a large trash bin full of iron pine barks toward Leo's warehouse. When they saw Leo, they stopped to greet him.\n\"Hello, senior!\" The Life Sword Sect's disciple politely cupped his fist. As for the mannequin, it creepily stared at Leo's face.\nLeo waved his hand and called the disciple, \"I have a favor to ask you. Can you go into that warehouse and try to get inside the new area over there?\"\n\"New area, sir?\"\n\"Mhm. I'll give you an essence stone for the trouble. Can you do it?\"\nHearing that he would get an essence stone for a simple job, the disciple repeatedly nodded in excitement, \"Of course, sir!\"\n\"Good. Now, go in there and return if you can enter that area.\"\n\"Is that all, sir?\"\n\"Yup!\"\nThe disciple cheerfully rushed into the warehouse. When he reached the deepest part of the building, he discovered a new shutter door, which led to a new area.\nHe was astonished and excited. After all, he always worked around here, helping the warehouse mannequin storing goods from the harvesting team. He knew this warehouse like the back of his hand.\n\"Wow.\"\nThe disciple cautiously walked toward the open area. But as soon as he reached the boundary of the underground shopping mall's warehouse, he hit an invisible wall.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe disciple was confused. He reached out toward the new zone and tried to get there. However, he touched a transparent wall instead.\nHe panicked. He thought that Leo wouldn't give him an essence stone if he couldn't enter the area. Thus, he tried to punch it.\nBONK\nThe punch bounced back. He felt like he hit a bouncing rubber instead of a hard wall.\nConfused, the disciple tried again. Second attempt, third attempt, tenth attempt, he failed to break the invisible barrier.\nIn the end, he gave up. The disciple was crestfallen as he returned to Leo. He reported his failure.\n\"…Sir, I couldn't get inside the new area. I'm sorry.\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows. Instead of being disappointed, he was overjoyed.\n\"Really? Okay. You did a good job. Here is your bonus.\"\nHe tossed an essence stone to the disciple. The latter caught it and blankly stared at the stone for a moment. When he came back to his senses, he deeply bowed to Leo.\n\"THANK YOU, SIR! I'LL WORK EVEN HARDER!\"\nLeo waved his hand and dismissed the young man.\nAs long as no one but Leo could access the warehouse from the other entrances, the shopping mall warehouse was secure. However, Leo might have to manage the entire warehouse himself.\n'This might be a headache. For now, I don't need to restock my supermarket. I'll leave it empty for now unless Cat threatens to empty the granary again. How much does she eat every day?!'\nLeo wanted to go check the granaries to see the carnage. However, he stopped the thoughts as he had another thing to complete. He returned to the alchemy workshop. Then, he ordered the mannequin to use the sixth cauldron to make more grain pills.\nAlthough Leo planned to keep this cauldron to research other materials, he postponed the idea. After all, his main quest's first phrase was almost completed.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phrase 1/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phrase.\nPhrase Completion Rewards: 100,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Building), and Increase Sub-Building's Max Level to 12\nPhrase One Tasks (8/10 Completed)\n- Evolve Humble General Store into a Shopping Mall. (Done)\n- Move any building into the main store's building. (Done)\n- Set up a new store in the main store's building. (Done)\n- Complete a mystic realm expedition once. (Done)\n- Upgrade any building to level 10. (Done)\n- Harvest at least 10,000 of any crops from Basic Farmlands. (Done)\n- Concoct at least 10,000 pills by using Alchemy Workshop. (3,380 / 10,000)\n- Recycle at least 10,000 items by using the Recycling Center. (4,057 / 10,000)\n- Summon at least 10 automatons to work in your domain. (Done)\n- Sold at least 1,000 products in your store. (Done)\n*For each completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo needed two more to complete the first set of quests. Then, he could enjoy the two batches of lucky draws. Moreover, there was something new in the gacha section.\nAside from the building and the automaton, there was a new banner that Leo could try his luck.\n[Gnosis Lucky Draw]\nThis feature had been unlocked after Leo evolved the general store into a shopping mall. This was foreshadowed in chapter 106. However, like the other gacha banners, it required lucky draw tickets, and Leo couldn't purchase it with his lifespan.\nAlthough the system gave Leo multiple restrictions and forced him to work, it was not heartless enough to not give him hints. Under the 10+1 draw button, there were tiny texts underneath.\n<Gnosis Lucky Draw Tickets can be obtained from the PVP mode.>\n\"…\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes after reading the hint. He deeply inhaled, preparing his heart to explore the unknown. While walking toward the recycling center, Leo opened the menu that he had never explored yet – The PVP tab.\nDING\nWhen Leo pressed on the PVP tab, a tutorial screen appeared.\n.\nPVP Mode\nWelcome to the PVP Section, where you can enjoy competing against other fate crystal bearers and comparing your strengths. You can climb ladders in the ranking matches or spar against your friends in a private lobby. At the end of every season, you will obtain many rewards based on your rankings.\nThis feature has three subcategories – Offline Ranking, Real-Time Ranking, and Casual. Only the Offline Ranking Mode and Real-Time Ranking Mode offer rewards.\nOffline Ranking Mode lets you fight against shadows of crystal bearers from the past and present. Every week, you can participate in a ranking match once. Every time you defeat your opponent, you can obtain one gnosis lucky draw.\nReal-Time Ranking Mode allows you to match up against fellow crystal-bearers of your peers in real time. Both you and your opponent may wager your wealth in the match if both sides agree to the terms. In addition, combat in this mode yields five times more rewards than the offline mode due to its high mortality rate. Please be advised. Killing is not forbidden in this mode. Similar to the Offline Ranking Mode, you can participate in the ranking match once a month.\nAs for the Casual Mode, it is for private matches. If you have friends, we suggest you try this out to have fun. Of course, this mode is 100% safe as no one can die during the fight.\n.\nLeo was skeptical about this feature. Even though the participating right was limited to one fight per week or month, he wasn't that interested in the activities. Instead, he only checked this feature because he was curious about the lucky draw tickets.\n'This is the same as those evil gacha games. If you don't PvP, your progress will fall behind the others because you can't get the exclusive rewards. This is where the P2W part comes in. But does system allows P2W?'\nWhile reading the tutorial screen, Leo arrived at the recycling center. He gazed at the acid pool, where the workers disposed of junk.\nStanding near the pool, Leo rubbed his spatial rings, which he had used to store junk items from the warehouse earlier. Old clothes, regular grain pills, old weapons, and random tools were poured into the pool.\nEverything was instantly dissolved. Then, the machine hummed, producing hundreds of spirit stones.\nLeo ignored the machine and kept pouring more items. After Leo had removed all clothes and junk items from the spatial rings, he checked the quest progression.\n.\nRecycle at least 10,000 items by using the Recycling Center. (7,133 / 10,000)\n.\nThey were not enough. Leo needed more junk to dispose of.\nHe turned around and placed all spatial rings on the ground, piling into a small mountain. Roughly estimated, about 1,000 rings were in front of Leo.\nAfter putting everything in place, Leo rechecked everything one by one.\nAll empty storage rings were tossed into the pool behind Leo. He kept scanning and tossing it away when he was done.\n10 rings, 50 rings, 100 rings, Leo kept discarding them. He didn't show remorse for throwing such precious items away as he had too many.\nWhen Leo checked the 138th ring, he found a storage, full of books and furniture. It seemed that the previous owner was a librarian or a book enthusiast.\nLeo mercilessly ejected the books to the ground and dumped all the bookshelves into the pool. Then, he skimmed through the books.\n\"Come to think of it, my place doesn't have a library. Should I keep these?\"\nLeo flipped a random book. The pages showed images of humans doing various poses. At the side of each image, Chinese texts described the techniques.\nReading the martial arts manual, Leo tilted his head to the side as he found the poses weird and illogical. He closed the book and checked another one.\nWhen Leo reached out for a new book, he finally looked up to check how many books he had ejected earlier. Then, he noticed the anomaly.\nThe pile was a lot bigger than the small mountain of spatial rings. The total books and scrolls were more than enough to fill the entire acid pool.\n\"Oh, boy. I guess I can dump these to complete the quest. But is that really a good idea?\"\nLeo looked around, but he couldn't find any elder. Without a choice, he shouted, calling Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei over.\n.\nThe two portal guards rushed down from the flying platform. They arrived at the recycling center and found a mountain of books, which was taller than them.\n\"Senior, what are these?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\n\"Books, of course.\"\n\"I know, but where did you get these?\"\n\"I forgot. I killed too many people, and one of their rings contains these. Well, help me sort these things. Throw every useless book into the pool and keep the useful ones.\"\n\"W-What?!\"\nHua Jiashan gulped. He rushed over and picked a random book nearby. After flipping a few pages, he was astonished.\n\"Swift Monkey Footwork?! Isn't this the Beggar Sect's technique?\"\nHearing Hua Jiashan's comment, Dongfang Mei was astonished. She waved her finger and pulled a scroll to her hand. Opening the scroll, she read it out loud.\n\"Mountain Cleaver Strike Technique. This is a blade technique from the Death Sword Sect! Wait, that too!\"\nBoth elders were shocked and excited as their organizations lacked resources to collect as many technique books. They looked like nerdy children who had seen a bookstore for the first time.\nLooking at the duo, Leo pursed his lips. He thought of another business model.\n\"I guess I have to add a bookstore to my wish list. I hope the building gacha will grant me this.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 174 Florida Man Found Drunk Naked Woman Sleeping in His Bed, Cuddled with Her, Kicked Her Out in the Morning, and Refused to Elaborate.\nChapter 174 – Florida Man Found Drunk? Naked Woman Sleeping in His Bed, Cuddled with Her, Kicked Her Out in the Morning, and Refused to Elaborate.\nWith Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei's help, Leo managed to filter useful books from junk. Duplicated books, ledgers, and random diaries were thrown into the acid pool.\nIn the end, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei secured 500 technique books and 20 cultivation manuals. They volunteered to build a temporary library to store the books.\nAfter clearing the first batch of books, Leo resumed cleaning his spatial rings. He ejected more books for Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei to audit while he tossed away regular grain pills and clothes.\nSometimes, Leo found shining flying swords and random weapons. The ones in good condition were thrown into the junkyard as they might be useful for his workers. As for rusty and worn-out ones, he dumped them all.\nHua Jiashan's heart ached when he saw Leo throw a dozen artifacts into the acid pool. Even though they were old, they still could fetch a thousand spirit stones in the market.\n\"L-Lord Florida Man. C-Could you stop throwing away artifacts?\"\nLeo stopped checking his spatial rings, \"Why?\"\n\"You might not need those artifacts, but they are still valuable in the market. If we put it on sale, we can fetch over a thousand spirit stones each. I think it is wiser to put it in your store, sir.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nLeo pursed his lips and nodded. He stopped discarding useless weapons into the pool.\nThree hours later, Leo finished cleaning his spatial rings. He wiped his sweat and admired the junkyard, where he gathered a bunch of material, random artifacts, and tree logs.\nIn addition, Leo completed his goal.\nRecycle at least 10,000 items by using the Recycling Center. (19,581/ 10,000) (Done)\nWith that quest gone, Leo only needed to complete one more task. However, it might take a while since it took time for alchemy workshops to produce grain pills.\nHe rechecked the remaining quest progress.\nConcoct at least 10,000 pills by using Alchemy Workshop. (3,730 / 10,000)\nIt progressed at a snail's pace according to Leo's standard. The upgraded workshops seemed to produce 100 grain pills every hour, so he would need 73 hours or three days to fulfill the requirement.\nAs there was nothing Leo could do to finish the quest faster, he called it a day. He bid farewell to Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei and returned to his battle bus to get some sleep.\n.\nEntering the bus, Leo walked straight to the master cabin. He entered the room and headed straight to the bathroom.\nAfter a quick bath, Leo dried himself and threw his weary body onto the bed without wearing any clothes. Upon landing, his body hit something, and it caused a weird noise.\nBecause of the mental exhaustion, Leo tugged himself into the bed and shut his eyes. He then reached out to hug his favorite body pillow.\nStrangely, it was hairy.\nLeo's consciousness drifted off to Namek Planet and dreamed of the iconic fight between Goku and Frieza. He didn't notice anything weird in his bed.\n.\nFour hours later, Leo yawned and stretched by squeezing his body pillow.\n\"!!!\"\nAgain, strangely, it squeaked. Also, instead of sensing the soft cotton cloth sheet and the fluffiness of the pillow, Leo's left hand found joints and bony shoulders. As for his right hand, it touched something soft and jiggling.\n\"…\"\nLeo frowned while his eyes were still closed. He deeply sighed.\n\"Why am I feeling like I'm getting myself into a rom-com situation?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo slowly opened his eyes. Then, he found Esen, lying naked in his arms. Her arms were in front of her, trying to push Leo away. However, because of Leo's absurd strength, she couldn't break free.\nLooking at Esen's face, Leo nonchalantly greeted her.\n\"Good morning, little brat.\"\n\"LET ME GO, YOU PERVERT GEEZER!\"\nLeo was neither flustered nor was he shy away from the weird situation. He stroked Esen's naked back and teased her.\n\"And why in the Mordor are you sleeping naked in my bed? Are you trying to take my virginity?\"\n\"SCREW YOU AND YOUR VIRGIN DICK! RELEASE ME!\"\nLeo laughed and gently smacked Esen's perky butt and released her. She jumped off the bed and carried the blanket to cover herself.\nIn the room, Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice had been sitting on a couch, watching Leo and Esen all night. Expressionless, they gazed at Esen and Leo, unable to intervene.\nLeo sat up and looked at the crowd.\n\"Oh, I didn't know we have spectators. I should have sold you the tickets.\"\n\"…\"\nThe two undead girls didn't react, but Marc fidgeted because of the awkward situation.\nMeanwhile, Esen was enraged. She threw furniture and stuff at Leo, but he caught them and stored everything in his spatial ring to avoid damage.\n\"BASTARD! PERVERT! MONSTER! LEECHER! LOWLIFE! LOLICON! SCUM! MANACE OF SOCIETY!\"\nLeo retorted, \"And why the hell were you in MY BED, and why are you NAKED?!\"\n\"SHUT IT! I CAN'T SLEEP IF I WEAR CLOTHES! I'M A LICH! AND WHY DID YOU CREEP INTO THE BED WHEN I WAS SLEEPING?! ARE YOU TRYING TO VIOLATE ME?!\"\n\"Oh, please. Lower your voice. I have a low blood pressure in the morning. Your voice is too loud.\"\nLeo got out of the bed. He tugged the bed sheet in Esen's hand and stole it, causing Esen to lose the only cover of her bare body.\nEsen's face was redder than a tomato. She thought that Leo was serious about her.\nThe next moment, Leo turned around with the blanket. He hopped back to the bed to continue sleeping.\n\"Imma go back to sleep. I haven't slept 9 hours yet today. Unless you are thirsty, don't wake me up.\"\n\"…\"\nA few seconds later, Leo started snoring, leaving the crowd speechless.\nEsen was still flustered, embarrassed, and angry. She jumped on the bed and punched him a few times. Unfortunately, she ended up hurting her fist as his body was too durable.\nAs she failed to get her revenge, she turned around and glared at her subordinates.\n\"You three were with me! Why didn't you stop him?!\"\nMarc trembled and confessed, \"W-We can't possibly intervene, master. The Holy One doesn't have ill will against you. He simply wanted to sleep.\"\nIvy nodded, \"We have been watching, master. He didn't do anything to do, so there was no point for us to stop him. Moreover, I think you benefited from the night since his virgin yang Qi and your virgin yin Qi moved in sync. I believe your Qi circulation has improved.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen flinched and rechecked her body. After Leo blessed her with a new physique, she grew a dantian, and she could still use the necromancy. When Esen sank her consciousness into her dantian, she discovered that there was a miniature solar system in her dantian.\nThe sun of her solar system was pitch black. However, faint strings of Leo's virgin yang Qi orbited around the black sun, providing light and warmth to this small universe.\nEsen was stunned. She had never seen something like this before. After she pulled back her consciousness to the real world, she asked Ivy.\n\"Why is there a universe inside me? I thought I only had a black sea.\"\nIvy revealed a faint smile and surprised her.\n\"Congratulations, master. You are no longer a celestial emperor. You are officially a true immortal.\"\n\"…Wait, WHAT?!\"\n\"If I may suggest, please continue sleep-hugging the Holy One whenever you have a chance. If better, please dual-cultivate with him, and your strength will rapidly grow!\"\n\"YOU…W-WHAT?!\"\n.\n.\nAfter nine hours of sleep, Leo was refreshed. Despite being 50,000 years old, he still got a morning wood.\nWhen Leo woke up, Esen and her minions were not around anymore. Also, it was already noon.\nWhile getting out of bed, Leo checked his quest progress. As he had predicted, it went up a little.\nConcoct at least 10,000 pills by using Alchemy Workshop. (4,680 / 10,000)\nAs Leo had nothing else to do, he decided to check the PVP Mode to see what he could gain from this dangerous feature. He opened the menu and browsed the Offline PVP Ranking.\nLeo's name appeared at the bottom of the list. He was ranked as (-) as he had never fought anybody. However, above him, the number of rankings seemed suspicious.\nThe lowest rank was the 11527th rank, not counting the unranked people with zero points.\nThe lowest rank was a guy by the name Z'Ton. Aside from his total points of zero, his profile picture was in grey. The others above were also in a similar portrait style.\nAfter looking at the bottom of the food chain, Leo peeked at the top rankers. The number one guy was a massive wolf, and his name was \"Lucky\". However, his portrait was in full color.\nThere was something strange here. Leo wondered why their portrait color tone was different.\n'Are the grey portraits dead people? Is that the case?'\nLeo pursed his lips. He closed the ranking screen and entered the Offline PVP mode to see how it worked. Browsing the menu, it showed the 10 people that Leo could pick as an opponent.\nThe list showed the 10 guys with zero points of Offline PVP mode. At the right of their portrait and rank, a button \"Challenge\" was available for Leo to press.\nLeo chose the Z'Ton guy as he tried to play it safe.\nAs soon as Leo pressed it, the environment around him changed. He was directly teleported into a blank enclosed cubic room. In front of him, his opponent's shadow emerged from the ground.\nLeo's opponent was an angel with eight white wings. He wore gold plate armor and wielded a lunar crescent spear. However, his face was clouded by black gas as if it were censored.\nBEEP\nThe room turned red, and Leo's legs and arms stiffened as if they were petrified. His opponent also changed his expression as his entire body was restrained by an unknown force.\n5…\n4…\nA countdown began. Judging from the pattern, it was not difficult to guess what it was for.\n3…\n2…\n1…\nFIGHT!\nA loud male voice echoed in the room. As soon as the voice came out, the restricted forces released both of the contestants. The angel vanished and appeared behind Leo. He swung the halberd at his neck.\n\"Oh?\"\nCLANK!\nThe halberd directly hit Leo's nape, but it failed to cut through him.\n\"!!!\"\nThe angel flinched and fluttered his wings to retreat. But Leo turned around and smiled at him.\n\"About the same strength as Esen, I guess. Well, thanks for the ticket.\"\nLeo stomped on the ground and leaped toward the angel. Before the latter could unleash his true strength, Leo punched the guy in the chest.\nThe punch exploded and pushed the angel's ribcages, heart, lungs, spleen, and innards through the back, creating an eight-inch-wide gaping hole. Looking through the hole, Leo could see the other side of the room.\nThe angel stuttered. Before the angel collapsed, he detached eight wings from his body, and the wings transformed into eight men with the same gold armor and weapon. As for his original body, it transformed into blue crystals in a humanoid shape.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo was surprised by the weird ability of the angel. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.\n\"Mah, gawd. Are you a ninja, bro?\"\nThe angel didn't reply. They all summoned their soul avatar, and their bodies merged with them. Eight ball-headed giants with halos hovering over their heads appeared.\nEvery blue giant had four humanoid arms and four legs. On their shoulders, two attached cannons were armed, and they pointed at Leo. Although they had humanoid limbs, their chests and stomachs were made of blue crystals.\nTheir halos span. Then, the giant angels screeched.\nLeo plugged his ears with his fingers because of their loud noise. Annoyed by the giants, he jumped at one of them.\nLeo's left fist found the stomach crystal of the nearest giant angel.\nCLANK\nThe crystal shattered, and the giant was broken in half. Its arms, legs, and heads turned into blue crystals and remained there.\nBut seven pairs of cannons unleashed their barrage. Seven blue beams came for Leo and they hit him.\nThe beams were burning hot. Leo frowned as it had the same temperature as blue tribulation lightning, but it had the destructive force of red lightning bolts.\n\"Yeah. You're not a crystal bearer for nothing. I understand now.\"\nLeo stopped playing around. As soon as his feet touched the ground, he vanished. A split second later, he turned into a human bullet, blasting through another giant golem. He front-flipped and planted his feet on the wall. Then, he bounced toward the next target.\nThe giants might have a supreme firepower, but their movements were slow. After bouncing six times, all seven giants were destroyed.\nLeo stopped jumping around. He gazed at the piles of blue crystals while he searched for his spatial rings. Fortunately, some rings remained on Leo's fingers and clothes.\nWithout hesitation, Leo stored the blue crystals in his spatial rings. After all, this guy seemed special.\nDING\n<Congratulations. You have defeated Z'Ton. You have gained three Offline Ranking Points.>\n<You have obtained one Gnosis Lucky Draw Ticket.>",

      "content": "Chapter 175 Florida Man Wrestled a Pig in a Professional Wrestling Match. The Pig Owner is Confused.\nChapter 175 – Florida Man Wrestled a Pig in a Professional Wrestling Match. The Pig Owner is Confused.\nAfter receiving the ticket, Leo found himself back on the bus, sitting on his bed. It was as if he had never moved at all.\nLeo looked around to make sure that he returned to his bus. Confirming that he was safe, he opened the Gnosis Gacha page to see what he could get from it.\nThe banner also featured the 10+1 promotion. Looking at the discount, Leo was tempted to collect nine more.\n\"Right. I still have the real-time thingy.\"\nHe laughed and selected the Real-Time PVP Mode. A new screen appeared, showing Leo's current ranking. As usual, he was unranked.\nHowever, the ranking was a lot shorter than the offline one. Only a thousand portraits appeared on the list. Moreover, the number of points seemed suspicious.\nThe lowest rank had 142 points while the guy with a higher rank had 175 points. The gap between ranks was even more severe at the top level. For example, the top guy \"Lucky\" had over five million points while the second rank \"Shuri\" was three million points behind.\nOn top of the ranking, the screen revealed that it was Season 65,536, and it would end in 20 years. In addition, the season page revealed the prizes that top rankers would earn when the season ended.\nThe top rank would get two billion years of lifespan, including a hundred lucky draw tickets of any category! As for the bottom rankers with one point or more, they would get one lucky draw ticket as a consolation prize.\nLeo gulped. He remembered that he wasted 2,147,483,647 years to transmigrate to this cultivation world. Thinking of getting those precious YOL back made Leo salivate.\n\"Here goes nothing! What can go wrong?\"\nConfident in his strength, Leo pressed the auto-match button at the bottom. Then, his system screens were closed.\nLeo found himself in a similar cubic arena. However, he didn't find an opponent. Instead, He discovered the audience outside of the transparent cubic arena.\nOutside the arena was a humongous stadium, far larger than every Earth's sports stadium combined. It looked like a condominium complex inside a massive dome stadium and spectator stands.\nThe spectators were strange as well. Leo couldn't find any human in the crowded stadium. On the other hand, humanoid beastmen, giant creatures, and monsters gathered in groups, forming a territory on the stands.\nAs Leo looked around, he noticed a group of familiar creatures. They had round heads, cat ears, cat faces, and tentacles like one of his guardian statues. These guys came in a group of 100, watching Leo from a VIP box. However, they were far bigger than the statue, and their room was as big as the Tokyo Dome Stadium.\nThe sheer size of this place and the humongous monsters made Leo feel like an ant. He wondered if he slipped into the MIB Universe.\nWhile checking the spectators and the stadium, two unreadable words were displayed.\nUnfortunately for Leo, he could not read the numbers as it was in a different language. He could hear the conversations from the crowd, but he couldn't figure out what they were talking about. Everything sounded gibberish.\nAfter waiting and standing idly for a few minutes, a large monster appeared in an arena.\nHe was a three-meter-tall green orc. His lower jaw was bigger than the upper part, and his two canines extended outside of his mouth. His muscular chest, arms, and legs were full of scars.\nThe orc turned around and stared at Leo. He put his hand on his face, and a tribal mask appeared from thin air, covering his ugly face. A full leather armor appeared and covered his half-naked body while two hammers manifested and landed on the ground in front of him.\nHe calmly equipped his gear and grabbed his hammers, getting ready to fight. However, he didn't step forward.\nLeo stroked his braided beard and wondered if this guy was stronger than the previous angel. He pulled out his pistol to test the water. Unfortunately, Leo couldn't pull the trigger.\nDING\n<This is your first time participating in a real-time PVP combat. The system will teach you about the local customs.>\n<Before every match, the lower-ranked player may wager their items, slaves, fate crystals, gnosis, or lifespan. After putting on the wager, the higher-ranked player must wager anything of the same value. This forced wager cannot be declined or canceled.>\n<However, if a lower-ranked player chooses not to wager anything, the opponent has the right to wager anything, and the other party cannot decline. Vice versa, the lower-ranked player has to wager something of the same value as the declared bet.>\n<Other than the personal wager between players, any participant may join the arena gamble house and bet on themselves. No participant is allowed to bet on their opponents.>\n<The match ends whenever a player is unable to fight, stripped of their fate crystals, or dies. No one is allowed to forfeit or give up during the match to prevent cheating and fixed matches.>\n<Tips – While you're in this arena, the universal language translation feature will be automatically enabled so that you can communicate with the other players and the audiences.>\n\"…\"\nAlthough Leo was not into gambling, he never hated it. Since this place wished for him to make a bet, he might as well follow the local customs.\nWhen in Rome, act like Romans.\n\"Ahem!\"\nLeo coughed and gazed at the orc. He tried to speak.\n\"This is my first time here. May I bet my puny lifespan and one Earth fate crystal?\nLeo chose not to reveal his two entity fate crystals to avoid attention. As he was new, he needed to gather info and avoid trouble.\nHe might be a laidback person when he dealt with other cultivators. However, at a higher stage, Leo couldn't afford to behave the same way. He didn't trust PLAYERS and fellow system users.\nThe orc heard the translated version of Leo's words in his language, and he was disappointed. He dropped his hammers and crossed his arms.\n\"I thought a newcomer has at least a heavenly fate crystal, SCHWEE! What a letdown, SCHWEE!\"\nLeo snickered, \"I take that as a yes, right?\"\nThe orc snorted and poked something invisible in front of him. Then, a screen appeared in front of Leo.\nThe screen showed the orc's portrait and grid boxes. A few seconds later, an icon of a piece of Earth Fate Crystal appeared in one of the grid boxes. In addition, the bottom of the grids showed the lifespan that the orc had.\n[641,510 Years]\nThis orc had a long life!\nLeo rubbed his hands. He checked the other side of the screen, which showed his information and portrait. Aside from the fate crystal icons that he had, Leo found a button to add his lifespan into the wager pool. He also checked his current lifespan.\n[161,154 Years]\nLooking at his current lifespan, Leo regretted investing in the Pylon Tower and shopping mall. Had he saved up, he would have 200,000 years more to gamble.\nSince Leo only had this much, he allocated 100,000 YOL to the wager pool, forcing the orc to bet the same amount.\nAfter putting one piece of earth fate crystal and his lifespan into the wager pool, Leo glanced at the scoreboard once again. It showed the betting odds between Leo and the orc.\nIt was currently in favor of the orc, and the rating was -750. For example, a gambler had to put $750 betting on the orc. Should the orc win, the gambler would get their $750 back and make a profit of $100.\nOn the other hand, Leo's rate was +600. Thus, he could profit a lot for little investment.\nSince everybody thought of him as a pushover, Leo explored his system and noticed a tab on top of the screen.\n[Gambling House]\nWithout hesitation, Leo pressed on it. The new page showed similar grids and lifespan labels. Also, there was an instruction.\n[Please input the amount you want to bet on yourself.]\nIt was easy to understand. As Leo still had 61,154 YOL in stock, he bet 60,000 YOL without saying anything. With this amount, he could profit 360,000 YOL and get his wager back!\nLeo snickered and rubbed his hands, looking forward to collecting his profits.\nStrangely, after the bet, the odds didn't change. Normally, the gambling houses in his homeworld always change the rate whenever someone put a huge bet on a team or someone.\nSince nobody changed the rating, Leo didn't protest. He closed the menu and gazed at the orc.\nThe orc was also busy looking at his invisible system screen. He fiddled with it and closed the system menu.\nWhen both sides were ready, Leo and the orc stared at each other. The latter grabbed his hammers and got ready to fight.\nBEEP\n5…\n4…\nThe warning sound alerted them that the countdown had begun. Their bodies turned stiff as they were restrained by an unknown force.\nAs soon as the countdown began, Leo heard someone speaking to him directly to his mind.\n'Win for us, munya! I have a feeling that you are my lucky star today!'\n\"Munya?\"\n3…\n2…\nLeo could only rotate his eyes. He glanced at the group of catopuses in a VIP box and managed to catch a glimpse of an orange catopus. I waved its tentacle at Leo and smiled.\n'PAY ATTENTION, MUNYA!'\n\"Oh, right.\"\n1…\nBEEP\nBy the time Leo looked at the orc, the countdown finished. A blunt hammer was already one centimeter in front of Leo.\nBOOM\nIt was a direct hit. For the first time, Leo's head tilted backward, and he took two steps back.\n\"What?!\"\nThe orc frowned after he smashed Leo's face with his hammer. Nobody had survived his hammer attack before.\nLeo regained his balance. He lowered his stance and tackled the orc. After grabbing the orc's legs, Leo lifted the huge guy up and slammed him with a spine-buster.\nAlthough Leo managed to touch the orc, his victory wasn't guaranteed. Many people and creatures resisted his gene mutation power before, so he didn't expect the orc to mutate and die with a single touch.\nThe orc remained expressionless. He glanced at his thighs as he sensed the wiggling cancer cells inside him. Ignoring the mutating cells, he shouted.\n\"PROVIDENCE DOMAIN, WAR GOD SKIN!\"\nThe green orc's skin reddened. He kicked Leo away and sat up. All cancer cells earlier were crushed by his green blood.\nLeo rolled on the ground and pulled out his gun. He fired a round at the orc.\nBANG\nThe bullet hit the orc's chest, but it failed to penetrate his skin.\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He injected his Qi into the upgraded bullet and tried again. This time, a black lightning beam came out.\n\"!!!\"\nThe orc widened his eyes in shock and raised his hammers to block the beam. However, he was swallowed in the darkness.\nWhen the black light subsided, the orc was left with a set of red bones and his internal organs. Although his muscle, skin, and flesh got melted by the black beam, he was still alive.\nThe skin and flesh of the orc slowly regenerated. Even his melted eyes were repaired in a second.\n\"You're not just a True Immortal. You're a god as well, I see.\"\nSeeing that the orc was about to restore his body, Leo summoned his dao avatar, preparing to use his ultimate technique. However, before Leo could do so, the orc let go of his hammers and sat down.\nBEEP\n<Congratulations! You have defeated The Orc God, Acku'Schweelu.>\n\"Huh, wait a second.\"\nLeo was taken aback. He thought that he hadn't won yet, but the system stopped the match.\nThe orc smirked at Leo. He then pointed at his stomach, full of his innards and internal organs.\n\"Surprised, newbie, SCHWEE?\"\n\"Of course, I'm surprised. How did I win? I haven't done anything to you yet?\"\n\"Hahahaha! You already destroyed my providence domain, SCHWEE. My flesh and muscles are gone, and I can't use Qi until I recover my body, SCHWEE. Since I can't continue fighting even for a minute, I've lost, SCHWEE.\"\n\"… Wait. That's it?\"\n\"Cracking your opponent's domain, especially a providence domain is enough to decide the match, actually. Anyway, good fight, human god, SCHWEE.\"\n\"…\"",

However, the system didn't return Leo back to his bus right away. Instead, it teleported him to a contestant's locker room. As for the orc, he vanished.\n\"???\"\nLeo looked around in confusion. He found himself alone in a giant locker room. The benches and lockers were megalophobia-inducing humongous as they were 20 times larger and taller than average lockers on Earth. Just by standing on the bench, Leo felt like he was a small insect in a human world.\n\"Umm, where am I?\" Leo scratched his head.\nFortunately, the system gave him another hint.\n<Tips: After every real-time PVP match, you will always be either sent to a locker room or an infirmary, depending on your health condition. You can find your locker in this room and claim your extra prizes.>\n<Tips: Spectators in the stadium may leave some messages or donate some items, local currency, or lifespan if you perform well during the match. All gifts are contained in your locker, and nobody can claim them except you. If you accidentally meet an unfortunate end, the stadium host will transfer your items to your descendants.>\n\"…\"\nLearning about his personal locker, Leo scanned the massive room.\nBEEP\nThe system was helpful this time. The window screen transformed into a streak of light, guiding Leo toward his locker. He walked on the massive bench and followed the blue light.\nAfter walking for 10 minutes, Leo came across a glowing black locker at the bottom row, 561st from the right and 345th from the left. It had Leo's portrait picture on it. However, the stadium labeled him with a different name.\n[Florida Man, the Nu'Earthe Champion]\n\"Nu…Earth? New Earth?\"\nLeo was puzzled by this new nickname. It would have been more understandable if the name was \"Earthling\", \"Floridian God\", or \"Human\". But in this case, it sounded strange.\nIgnoring the portrait and his weird nickname, Leo jumped down from the high bench and approached the massive locker. He touched the gold locker wall.\nDING\nA system screen appeared, showing a grid inventory of his items. At the left side of the screen, log messages of various people donating random items to Leo kept appearing.\n<Miao Meolord has donated one Abyssal Anglerfish to you.>\n<Miao Meolord has left a message, \"Excellent fight, munya! We are rich because of you, munya!\">\n<Kat Katerina has donated one Abyssal Anglerfish to you.>\n<Kat Katerina has left a message, \"Awesome debut, munya! We've earned a lot, munya!\">\n<Miao Damao has donated one Abyssal Tuna and 100 tuna eggs to you.>\n<Miao Damao has left a message, \"I won 60 million years of lifespan thanks to you, munya! Now, I have enough cash to propose to my girlfriend, munya! GOOD JOB!\">\nThere were other messages and gifts, but most of them simply gave Leo a handful of spirit stones. Only these three gave him interesting information and items.\nLeo tabbed on the icon of the fish to see its detail or item name. Fortunately, this system screen was more generous than Leo's system. It showed the backstory of each creature, and Leo didn't have to put them in his alchemy cauldron to identify them.\n.\nAbyssal Anglerfish\nStrength: Quasi-Sage\nSize: 1,133 km\nWeight: 27,500 tons\nThis massive galactic creature lives in the Abyssal Constellation Star Sector of the famous Overlord Xiaomao. It was one of many livestock that Overlord Xiaomao had been rearing to feed his disciples and their Cathulhu friends.\nIt is said that its meat contains the providence of gluttony. Many chef sages are willing to sell their kidneys to get a hand on one of them as its meat is extremely delicious and can bestow the providence of gluttony to anybody who eats it.\n.\nAbyssal Tuna\nStrength: 7-Star Constellation\nSize: 2,760 km\nWeight: 65,000 tons\nThis massive galactic creature lives in the Abyssal Constellation Star Sector of the famous Overlord Xiaomao. It was one of many livestock that Overlord Xiaomao has been rearing as a primary merchandise of his star sector.\nAbyssal Tuna is the most sought fish in the Abyssal Galactic Sea due to its extreme nutrition and its bones. Abyssal Tuna's bones are known to be one of the rarest materials in the universe that can store the Providence Qi of gods. Deities commonly convert abyssal tuna bones into Qi storage for emergency usage.\n.\nLeo was astonished by the sheer size of the fish. Each one of them was so large that Leo couldn't imagine how he would store these. He might have to chop them into smaller pieces before he could send them to his granaries.\nAlso, there were 100 eggs of the Abyssal Tuna. Leo wondered if he could hatch them and create a fish pond of his own. Still, their absolute size shattered his dream as it was impossible to grow one of them on his planet.\n'What the hell are those cats thinking? Do they think that I can process these? Oh, dear.'\nLeo counted the number of spirit stones from the locker. He pulled the spirit stone icon out of the screen, and small marble balls gushed out. Without letting the spirit stones touch the ground, Leo stored everything in his spatial rings.\n10,000…\n20,000…\n30,000…\nLeo looked at the screen. Although the match had ended, the donations kept coming for an unknown reason. He wondered why.\n30 minutes later, the donating train stopped. Leo counted the spirit stones in his 15 spatial rings and tallied 750,000 in total.\n\"What am I gonna do with you? Turn you into essence stones?\"\nLeo deeply inhaled and pondered what he should do with the essence stones. Then, he recalled that he could turn them into soul stones by using the alchemy workshop.\nWhile Leo was in the middle of a daydream, Acku'Schweelu the Orc God appeared in the locker room. He then walked toward the locker adjacent to Leo's. The orc ignored Leo and touched his storage.\nA few seconds later, the orc god bitterly smiled. He withdrew some spirit stones and essence stones, which his friends and fellow orcs gave him as a consolation. After packing everything, he looked at Leo.\nTheir eyes met. Then, they politely nodded at each other.\n\"I see. You're healed already,\" Leo praised Acku's tenacity.\n\"My regenerative power is nothing compared to your physique, SCHWEE. I still can't believe that you weren't even injured after getting hit by my full-powered providence hammer, SCHWEE.\"\n\"Likewise. This is the first time I see someone other than me surviving that black beam.\"\nBoth men smirked. They silently fist-bumped, showing each other respect and admiration. Leo also liked the orc as he seemed educated and well-mannered, unlike the arrogant cultivators at home.\n\"Say,\" Acku glanced at Leo's locker and read his name, \"Florida Man, SCHWEE. I'm curious. You're definitely a high-ranked deity, but how come I haven't heard about you before, SCHWEE?\"\n\"Am I supposed to be famous?\"\nAcku's expression turned dark, \"Have you checked my ranking, SCHWEE?\"\n\"???\"\nLeo raised his brow for a moment before he opened his system menu, checking the real-time PVP ranking. Then, he searched for Acku's name.\n.\n[Acku'Schweelu, the Orc God]\nRank: 99th\nBattle Record: 11,273 Wins, 121 Draws, 577 Loses\nKill Count: 752\nPoints: 176,812\n.\nThere was a lot to digest. Looking at Akcu's record, Leo was astonished.\n\"Whoa. You fought a lot.\"\n\"What can I say, SCHWEE? I started out around season 35,000, so I raked up some experience, SCHWEE.\"\nAfter checking Acku's record, Leo inspected his. He wondered how many points he got from the previous fight.\n.\n[Florida Man, the Nu'Earthe Champion]\nRank: 1,346th\nBattle Record: 1 Win, 0 Draw, 0 Lose\nKill Count: 0\nPoint: 3\n.\nThe title got Leo every time he looked at it. He was annoyed that he was called by something strange.\n\"Say, friend Acku. What's Nu'Earthe?\"\nThe orc frowned. He pursed his lips, hesitating to speak the word.\n\"Can I say that word in front of you, SCHWEE?\"\n\"What? It's not like you're one of my easy-to-offend-politically-corrected Americans. That's an N-word, right?\"\n\"…\"\nThe orc didn't understand half of Leo's words. He flinched for a moment. Then, he mustered the courage to tell him what he knew.\n\"I guess you have been living under a rock for 10,000 years, SCHWEE! Nu'Earthe is a slang word that the Fenrir Overlord Lucky invented after he had lost to Overlord Xiaomao in a fight 100,000 years ago. In their language, Nue means \"without\" or \"not have\". Eer means fur, and dhee means tail, SCHWEE. When they speak quickly, it becomes Nu'Earthe. When Fenrirs say it, it sounds like they mock a human or other races for having no fur and tail. It's… a racial slur, SCHWEE.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's weird knowledge increased.\n\"Back to my question, SCHWEE,\" Acku changed the topic. \"Were you in seclusion, SCHWEE? Someone with your strength should have been famous in the heavenly court. Where have you been hiding, SCHWEE?\"\nAcku wondered where Leo came from. After all, Acku's strength was in the top 100 among all fate crystal bearers, and he was considered one of the top dogs in the universe. Only the elusive sages and entities could threaten his life.\nIn addition, as a long-living god of the orc race, he had met many deities of the other races in various competitions, tournaments, events, and wars. He had memorized the names and faces of his rivals, friends, and peers.\nDespite his connection and knowledge, Leo, who was stronger than Acku, suddenly showed up in the Fate Crystal Bearer arena out of nowhere. His existence shook his confidence in his information network.\n\"Nothing much,\" Leo shrugged. \"As you said, I was in seclusion for 50,000 years. I just come out.\"\n\"I see. That explains a lot, SCHWEE!\"\nAcku nodded in understanding. He, too, sometimes spent a few thousand years training in seclusion.\n\"One more thing, SCHWEE!\"\nCurious about Leo, Acku wished to know about the former's base of operation or headquarters. As all deities had their own religion or governed their country, Acku believed that Leo should have a domain of his own.\n\"Can we exchange our contact, SCHWEE? Maybe, we can exchange some students or followers to learn from each other, SCHWEE!\"\nLeo's eyes sparkled as he loved that idea. If he could attract visitors from a higher realm, they might purchase some of the expensive goods that other mortals couldn't buy with their lifespan.\n\"Of course! But how?\"\n\"I guess you're really new, SCHWEE! Have you unlocked the friend system feature, SCHWEE?\"\n\"Friend feature?\"\nLeo rechecked his system menu. Unfortunately, he didn't have the feature yet.\n\"I'm sorry. I don't think I have it.\"\n\"Ah, shame, SCHWEE. Well, if you unlock it, be sure to add my name first, SCHWEE! Once we're officially friends, we can locate each other's location in the universe, SCHWEE! Also, if you have a kingdom-building-type system, you can build a travel portal that connects to your friend's domain, SCHWEE!\"\n\"Wait, what?!\"\nLeo heard something interesting. He rubbed his hands and widely grinned, \"Yes, of course. I'll add you once I unlock that feature! Actually, my domain specializes in shops, and I sell good pills.\"\n\"Are you an alchemist, SCHWEE?\"\n\"I'm somewhat of an alchemist myself…\"\n\"Nice, SCHWEE! We, orcs, lack cultivation resources. We'll be grateful if you sell us cultivation pills, SCHWEE!\"\nLeo couldn't stop smiling. He felt like a salesman, who succeeded in persuading a potential customer to a major deal. He wondered how much YOL and perks that he could get from the orc race in the future.\n'Dear, oh, dear. I came here for gacha tickets, but I got myself a big shot as a customer. Boy, I'm good.'",

      "content": "Chapter 177 Florida Man Saved Feral Dog, Brought It Home, and Killed It for Food\nChapter 177 – Florida Man Saved Feral Dog, Brought It Home, and Killed It for Food\nThe boys chatted for a few minutes before the orc excused himself. He vanished from the locker room.\nIt was also time for Leo to leave. He glanced at the following system screen.\n<Would you like to return to your world or teleport to the stadium?>\nLeo planned to return, but the new option was too tempting. He chose to prolong his stay as he might attract new customers to his shop. As a shop owner, self-marketing was one of his responsibilities.\nAfter pressing the button, the surrounding environment changed. Leo found himself in a queue in front of a long counter. This area was not as massive as the locker room as the ceiling was only five meters tall, and the people around him were less than 3-4 meters in height. He still looked small compared to other aliens around him.\nIn front of Leo was a strange creature. It had six arms behind his back, but he had a snake-like lower torso. Its spike spines were also long. Looking at the creature from behind, Leo had goosebumps.\nThe queues next to Leo were also special. Leo noticed blue goblins, a muscular man with a fish head, humanoid ants, a walking roper tree, giant wire-like stickmen, and werewolves. Everybody minded their business and ignored Leo. Only the group of werewolves sneaked glances at him before they scoffed in disgust.\n\"Tsk, this place stinks! Who let a dirty Nu'Earthe here?!\"\nLeo clearly heard the remark from a werewolf. He turned around and glared at the rude guy.\nThe werewolf was 8 feet tall, wearing nothing and revealing his private parts. He had a wide shoulder and muscular build. As for his prideful grey fur and long fluffy tail, they were moist and dirty. From the smell alone, he didn't look like someone who occasionally took a bath.\n'What's his problem?' Leo wryly smiled. He didn't know what he did to offend the guy.\nIf possible, Leo planned to avoid trouble in this strange place. He pretended to not hear anything.\nUnfortunately, Leo's action made the werewolf cocky. He kept talking.\n\"The Fate Stadium really needs someone to strengthen their security system! This sacred arena is a gathering place for prestige fighters and strong warriors, not a place for thieves and the likes of Nu'Earthe weaklings!\"\nAlthough Leo wasn't bothered by the jeer, he disliked arrogant and cocky people. This werewolf's action reminded him of the Karens on Earth. Because of the muscle memory, Leo failed to stop his running mouth.\n\"Yeah, humans are weak, but your puppy god lost to a human, to the point that he was so salty that he invented a racial slur to cuss humans out of spite. That's not something a STRONG and PRESTIGE fighter commonly does. In my town, we call that behavior BITCHING. Oh, wait! No pun intended. Was your god a SHE or a SISSY? Oh, wait. He might literally be a BITCH!\"\nMURMUR\nThe crowd heard Leo's words, and the stadium automatically translated his language. Everybody looked at the werewolf and Leo.\n\"Whoa. Big words!\"\n\"Who is that guy dissing Overlord Lucky?\"\n\"I don't know. He's a human. Maybe, he's related to Overlord Xiaomao?\"\n\"Humans and Fenrirs have been at odds ever since Overlord Xiaomao stomped Overlord Lucky 100,000 years ago. They never change.\"\nThe bystanders continued observing, yet none of them made way for Leo and the werewolf to confront each other as they had no intention of surrendering their queue.\nMeanwhile, a few people recognized the werewolf.\n\"Hey, isn't that Grurok, the Untouchable? He's an outer disciple of Death Pack Court right?\"\n\"Ah, he probably is. A descendant of Overlord Lucky runs that court. Aside from Overlord Xiaomao and the Cathulhus, nobody survived after messing with them.\"\n\"Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Had Overlord Lucky never stolen an entity fate crystal from Cathulhu Overlord Miao Maomao, Overlord Xiaomao would have continued reigning the universe. That Fenrir can't possibly run his mouth for long.\"\n\"SHHH!! Stop badmouthing a Fenrir. You're asking for trouble!\"\nAlthough Grurok was in the wrong for insulting Leo and humans, nobody bothered correcting him. Grurok ignored the cowardly bystanders and broke his queue. He stomped toward Leo and pulled the latter's collar.\n\"WHAT DID YOU SAY, NU'EARTHE WEAKLING!? DID YOU JUST DISRESPECT OUR OVERLORD?! YOU MUST BE COURTING DEATH?!\"\nLeo glanced at the wolf's hand. He grabbed it and stared into the wolf's eyes.\n\"Yeah, go tell your overlord to suck his own penis and lick his butthole like a good doggy as he is. As for you, a dirty rabid feral puppy, you're the one courting-\"\nThe werewolf didn't allow Leo to finish his sentences. He threw a sucker punch at Leo's face.\nPOW\nIt hit Leo's left cheek. However, compared to Acku's destructive power, this guy's punch was as soft as a toddler punch. Leo felt nothing, and he didn't move an inch.\nGrurok widened his eyes as he sensed a sharp pain in his fist. He growled and bore his fangs. Then, he bit Leo's neck while he hugged Leo and clawed his back with his long nails.\nUnfortunately, Grurok's fangs couldn't even put a dent in Leo's skin. His nails also failed to cut through his tactical suit, which was made by the clothing store mannequin.\nLeo deeply inhaled. He looked around and pointed at the wolf while he asked the bystander.\n\"Guys. I'm new here, and I have a question. If I kill this fool, will I break the laws?\"\nThe six-armed snake man in front of Leo turned around and glanced at them. He snickered.\n\"I guess you don't know. If you have a dispute with someone, you can challenge them to a duel or a life-and-death match in this arena. And if you're a fate crystal bearer, you can forcefully teleport anybody into the arena if they attack you first. Don't kill anybody outside the arena, though. You'll get arrested no matter what.\"\nLeo nodded at the snake guy, \"Many thanks.\"\n\"My pleasure. I suggest you go to the counter and get your match fixed. Don't hurry and kill that fool too fast though. Let me bet on you and get some pocket money.\"\n\"Hahahahah!\"\nAfter interacting and observing these aliens, it reminded him of good old Florida as that place was full of wholesome people, educated people, funny people, extroverts, and mental morons. This place was similar to his hometown even though the alien moron here was a competitive racist.\nSince this werewolf wanted a piece of him, Leo gladly obliged. He seized Groruk's neck and dragged him to the front counter.\n\"!!!\"\nGroruk was taken aback by Leo's raw strength. Moreover, he sensed countless tiny creatures creeping into his skin and pores. When he inspected them with his essence, he found the intruding parasitic cells. Although slowly, the cancer cells corrupted and rewrote Groruk's blood cells and tissues. By the time Groruk tried to remove them, one of the cells entered his bone marrow.\nMeanwhile, Leo already reached the counter desk. Behind the counter, a female lamia with six bountiful milkers in bikinis gazed at him. Her face was as pretty as Esen, but she had snake scales on her cheeks. The woman then glanced at the werewolf and nodded at Leo as if he understood something.\nThe lamia flickered her snake tongue and asked Leo.\n\"Are you here to challenge that werewolf, sir?\"\n\"Yes. This feral dog bit me, so I want to challenge him to a life-and-death match in the arena. How do I do it?\"\n\"Are you a fate crystal bearer, sir?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Well, yeah. It's my first time here.\"\n\"I see. Then, please open your system screen and go to the real-time PVP tab. When you're in the domain of the Fate Stadium, you can see a new feature called \"Dispute Challenge\". After you press the button, you can forcefully transport the person you wish to challenge into the life-and-death arena or a casual duel arena with you. Also, please take note that defeating your opponent with this method doesn't give you system rewards. However, your arena points and fight record will be affected.\"\nBecause of the detailed explanation, Leo figured out how this place worked. He winked at the sexy lamia and ogled her beautiful chest.\n\"Thank you, ma'am. By the way, has anybody told you that you're pretty?\"\n\"I have 7 kids from 7 different fathers, and all the fathers are in my belly. Do you want to be my 8th?\"\n\"…Never mind.\"\n\"Have a good day, sir,\" the lamia giggled and bowed. Then, she returned her attention to the customer in front of her counter.\nAfter learning a new trick from the lamia, Leo opened his system menu and navigated to the real-time PVP screen. As the lamia had explained, there was a new button [Dispute Solver].\nLeo pressed on it, and a list of people he could challenge appeared. Unfortunately, only Groruk's name appeared as nobody else had a conflict with Leo outside the arena.\n.\nGroruk, the Untouchable\nRank: None\nBattle Record: 0 Win, 0 Draw, 0 Lose\nKill Count: 0\nPoint: 0\n.\nLooking at Groruk's blank status, Leo wondered how this guy got his nickname. He sneered at the werewolf.\n\"Untouchable? Well, I'm touching you right now.\"\nGroruk punched and kicked Leo. However, he didn't budge.\n\"BASTARD! UNHAND ME!\"\n\"Well, well, well. Look at the consequences of someone's action. Who could have thought that the untouchable Groruk would provoke a fate bearer first? Oh, right. Feral dogs are idiots. They need to be culled for a reason.\"\nLeo selected Groruk as his opponent. Next, the screen showed Leo three arenas to fight.\nThe first one was called [Friendly Sparring]. Small texts explained that it was for friendly duels or non-lethal fights between friends. Nobody could wager anything, and the fight would be unranked.\nThe second one was the bland and lame [Grudge Solving] mode. In this arena, fighters were not allowed to kill their opponents, but they were expected to solve their grudges through friendly duels. Again, this mode was unranked.\nThe last one was what Leo loved. [Life-and-Death] arena fit him perfectly as he could kill his opponent while he could farm some arena points. Leo's match could also be listed in a gambling house for other spectators to bet. Aside from the system rewards, all rules were the same as the real-time pvp matches.\nLeo picked the third arena without hesitation. Then, he and Groruk were teleported into the stage arena, where Leo had fought Acku.\nWhen Leo and Groruk appeared on the stage, the latter was free from Leo's grasp. He roared and yelled at the former.\n\"Bastard! Do you know who I am?! I'm the son of Gromsell! He's an elder of Death Pack Court! If you offend me, the entire court will come after you!\"\n\"As expected of a dog - all bark but no bite. Go ahead, idiot. Bet your lifespan when you have a chance.\"\nLeo laughed and opened his system menu. Unfortunately, Leo's ranking was higher than Groruk's, so he had to wait for the werewolf to finish his offer first.\nWhile waiting, Leo looked at the scoreboard to check his odds.\nThe gambling house was quick. Numbers rapidly changed as spectators had seen Leo's abilities. The odds favored Leo.\nGrurok's odds were +1,500 while Leo got -1,000. As usual, the house gave an unfair rating.\n\"Damn! Minus a thousand?! This is a rip-off! Welp, money is money.\"\nLeo crossed his arms and waited for Grurok to finish. However, the werewolf never had a system before, and he totally ignored the floating screen in front of him.\nBEEP\nThe timer ran out after five minutes of waiting. Groruk continued yelling and insulting Leo as he couldn't move from the spot.\nAs Groruk forfeited his right to make the bet offer, Leo had the right to force a bet. He checked the werewolf's lifespan.\n5,253 Years\nLeo was disappointed. He thought that the so-called UNTOUCHABLE would be an almighty powerhouse. Instead, he was just a small fry.\nAfter inspecting the werewolf's YOL, Leo checked his.\n<Current Lifespan: 621,154 Years…>\nThat was a lot! He laughed in a merry mood as this arena brought him wealth.\nLeo wagered 5,253 YOL, planning to deplete the guy's stock. Then, he switched to the gambling house screen and bet 610,000 YOL on himself.\nAfter the wager was completed, Leo waited for the timer to run out. The spectators continued to put their money on Leo and worsened the odds.\nFrom minus 1,000, it became minus 2,000. Nobody seemed to bet on Groruk for some reason even though his odds became +3,000.",

      "content": "Chapter 178 Cops Called on Florida Man for Hoarding Infected Dog Corpses in His Backyard for Science Experiment?\nChapter 178 – Cops Called on Florida Man for Hoarding Infected Dog Corpses in His Backyard for Science Experiment\nIn front of the counter where Leo and Groruk had been, a hundred men and women of various species finished talking to the clerks – They purchased an entrance ticket to enter the Fate Stadium.\nVisitors and tourists from faraway galaxies and solar systems usually come here to spectate or play in this arena. This was also the only place where they could witness battles between famous immortals and gods, especially the elusive fate crystal bearers.\nIn addition, this place was popular among regular cultivators and monsters as this arena was the only place they could browse their remaining lifespan. They could also gamble or trade their lifespan for exotic items that the facility featured.\nAt that moment, everybody gazed at the TV screen above the ticket booth counter as it revealed the recent updates of upcoming matches. Among a few life-and-death arena matches, Leo and Groruk's match was shown.\nThe gambling house revealed the footage of Leo's match against Acku as a reference. On the other hand, Groruk's information was based on rumor. When the betting odds appeared, it quickly shifted toward Leo's advantage.\nThe crowd smirked as they brought out their tablets to wager their lifespan on Leo. Some who didn't have the tools rushed toward the betting booths to purchase bet cards.\nAmong the aliens, the snake man with six arms laughed and looked at his status. He wagered all 4,000 YOL on Leo even though the pay rate was abysmal. The others also did the same. Even the lamia receptionist secretly glanced at the TV monitor behind her counter and wagered her lifespan on Leo.\nThere was no easier bet than this. No matter how everybody looked at it, Groruk couldn't win.\n\"The house is gonna lose a lot of lifespans,\" The snake man's six arms crossed.\n\"Hardly,\" the lamia receptionist giggled. \"If you compare at the rate carefully, you will realize that the house will always make money no matter who wins.\"\n\"Right. I can tell. But this time, I doubt anybody will bet on that Fenrir.\"\n\"Some stupid dogs do.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nBoth snake monsters smirked as they glanced at the crowd of werewolves, who yelled at the clerk behind the betting booth that the gambling house insulted their comrades. They also blindly bet on Groruk to protect their pride.\nSeeing their behavior, the two snakes shook their heads.\n\"They're the best fish we can have.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n.\n.\nEven though Leo completed his bet, the odds kept changing, and the payout rating kept getting worse. His winning rate dropped to minus 2500.\n\"Ah, this is depressing.\"\nRealizing that his 610,000 YOL would only reward him with 24,400 YOL, he wondered if not betting at all would be a greater choice.\nMeanwhile, Groruk had never fought in this arena before. He struggled to move his legs, but the stadium's mysterious power restricted his movements.\n\"COWARD NU'EARTHE! RELEASE ME!\"\nLeo closed his system windows and deeply inhaled. He silently waited for the betting period to end.\nThe clock slowly ticked down. Both men had to remain in that position for five additional minutes so the spectators could finish their betting.\n\"HOW DARE YOU IGNORE ME!? SAY SOMETHING!\"\nThe werewolf never stopped yelling and trying to get Leo's attention. The latter pretended not to hear it and closed his eyes, counting seconds in his mind to meditate.\nAfter shutting his eyes and his mind, the outside noise no longer bothered Leo. He paced his breath and counted every second. However, his rhythm was slightly off.\nBEEP\nFive minutes quickly passed by. Leo opened his eyes after the warning sound, and he found everything in a light blue tone. He felt refreshed and calm.\n3…\n2…\n1…\nBEEP\nThe fight signal began. Leo and Groruk were no longer restrained.\n\"HAHAHAHA! I'M FREE!!\"\nThe werewolf cackled and transformed into a massive wolf, occupying half of the stage. His lustrous fur shone in grey, but black fur slowly replaced them.\nLeo glanced at the black hair on the large wolf's body. He pursed his lips, dissatisfied by the slow mutation progress. He thought that Groruk would die in minutes, but he already lasted more than 15 minutes.\n\"Wow, you're tough,\" Leo praised Groruk's endurance and immune system.\nGroruk still didn't realize that his bone marrow was compromised and that he would soon mutate into something else. He roared.\n\"NOW, YOU NU'EARTHE TRASH, DIE!! WOLF PACK DOMAIN!!\"\nGroruk howled. Then, a hundred werewolf clones manifested from the ground and surrounded Leo. Each clone carried a large blade and a tower shield.\nAll clones charged at Leo and swung their blades at him from all sides.\nLeo didn't move. He rubbed his chin and pondered.\n\"I forgot to ask that snake girl if I can take my opponent's corpse home.\"\nCLANK\nCLANK\nCLANK\nAll blades hit Leo's body, but they broke upon impact.\nGroruk didn't give up. He raised his front leg and slashed Leo with his claws. As for the clones, they leaped back to get out of the way.\nLeo didn't bother dodging. He let the claw hit him.\nCLANK\nAgain, Leo didn't budge. He muttered, calling his sentient dao avatar.\n\"Gene dude. Time to mutate something.\"\nThe sentient shadow spirit of Leo came out from Leo's alien ring. He crossed his arms and complained.\n'I have a name. Call me by my name.'\n\"It doesn't matter. I forgot about it. Anyway, mutate everything for me.\"\n'Hah. Fine.'\nThe dao avatar vanished into Leo's shadow. The next moment, a black dome expanded, devouring Groruk, his clones, and the entire arena.\nThe black dome domain only lasted for a few seconds. The spectators in the stadium lost sight of Leo and Groruk for a second. But when they could see everything again, changes occurred.\nAll werewolf clones initially had grey fur. But after Leo's domain touched them, their fur turned black. Groruk's real body also lost all his grey hair.\n\"What?\" Groruk looked at his body in confusion because he didn't feel the changes. He paused for a moment and laughed.\n\"Hahahahaha! Is that your domain power?! How pathetic! I thought you would blind me or disable my eyes, but you only painted me and my clones black! What a useless domain ability and dao!\"\nLeo crossed his arms. He uttered the iconic quote.\n\"You're already dead.\"\n\"???\"\nGroruk was confused, but he still smirked at Leo. He slowly raised his front leg and gathered his elemental essence into his claws.\nBut as soon as Groruk tried to use his Qi and essence, his stomach churned. His arms and legs felt stuffy and heavy for an unknown reason. In addition, his entire body was tingling as if a billion parasites within him moved through his blood vessels.\nAll clones of Groruk began bloating. Their heads and limbs swelled as their muscles rapidly expanded like a water balloon. As their skins couldn't expand any further, they erupted, exploding and splashing flesh and blood all over the arena. Instead of spewing red blood, their blood was black.\nThe massive Fenrir lost the strength in his legs. He collapsed and foamed his mouth, having a seizure. His eyes rolled around and fixated at Leo.\n\"W-What did you do to me?!\"\nLeo ignored Groruk and walked toward the clones. He collected their mutated and disfigured corpses to one of his empty spatial rings.\n\"So much precious Fenrir's meat, eyeballs, and yin fluid. Oh, right. I need more liver and innards. I haven't touched those for ages. I need them for alchemy.\"\nAlthough Leo didn't understand how and why Groruk's clones didn't disappear after death, he collected everything he could as their blood and flesh would be useful for some pills that Leo rarely made.\nGroruk slowly extended his front paw toward Leo, wanting to say something. Unfortunately, his throat was bloated, and his respiratory system ceased functioning. His consciousness slowly faded while staring at Leo.\nPOOF\nPOOF\nThe massive Fenrir's bloated skin and flesh popped like a swelled yellow zit being squeezed. Black blood gushed out like fountains, but the corpse kept growing bigger. As the mass grew, the black fur fell.\nLeo turned around and gazed at the new loot. He nodded in approval.\n\"Alright. I should have enough yin fluid and Fenrir's innards for alchemy. Good job, me.\"\nDING\n<Congratulations. You have defeated Groruk, the Untouchable.>\n\"…Untouchable, my ass. He's trash. I thought he was a speedy type.\"\nLeo collected the body. He rechecked his lifespan balance again.\n<Current Lifespan: 650,807 Years…>\nWith this much, Leo had enough funds for future projects. He believed he played enough here.\nWHOOSH\nHe was teleported to the same locker room. It was time for Leo to recheck the donation from the crowd.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo was playing in the other world, the Frozen Fire City was under siege. Four-armed cultivators massacred everybody in the massive town. They also raided the underground headquarters of the Fatui Cult, killing every cultist they found.\nAlthough the city quickly fell, the army of the new force didn't rush toward another city or town. They dragged survivors from the Fatui Cult for interrogation.\nFive young disciples were thrown to the ground in front of Qiang Baidu, the leader of the Gorr Tribe. The latter stared at the young men in black clothes.\n\"Brats. Who is the strongest cultivator on the mainland?\"\nQiang Baidu's purpose was simple. He needed information about the current top experts of the Yan Empire.\nThe young men looked at each other. Everybody hesitated if they should speak first.\nQiang Baidu snorted. He picked a rock and flickered it toward one of the prisoners.\nBOOM\nThe poor golden core cultivator's head exploded upon impact. His blood and brain splashed on his colleagues nearby.\nThe tribal chief asked the same question.\n\"Who is the strongest cultivator in this world!? Answer or you will suffer the same fate!\"\nOne of the prisoners trembled as he tried to answer.\n\"I-It's Emperor Yan Xiang, sir!\"\nQiang Baidu scoffed as he had expected it. However, one of the prisoners revealed a piece of interesting information.\n\"Idiot. Yan Xiang is dead! Didn't you hear the cult's announcement?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nQiang Baidu leaned closer to the speaker. He asked the guy.\n\"Tell me more. How did Yan Xiang die? When did he die? Who killed him?\"\nThe third prisoner gulped as he realized that he screwed up. He lowered his head and confessed.\n\"T-This is a rumor, b-but I heard from the cult's elders that Yan Xiang and his sons died during the seasonal tournament. Someone from a new sect killed him.\"\n\"Hah?\"\nQiang Baidu was disappointed that he didn't get to kill Yan Xiang with his own hands. However, he was fond of the guy who murdered the emperor in his stead.\n\"Tell me more about THAT new sect. What is their name, and who is their sect master?\"\n\"Umm…\"\nThe young men didn't speak this time. They only heard vague information from others, so they didn't know about Leo.\nLooking at the cultists, Qiang Baidu realized that they didn't know everything. He changed the topic.\n\"Do you know how strong that new sect is?\"\nHearing the new question, everybody nodded, \"We know, sir. That new sect… what does it call? I'm sorry, I don't know their name. But that sect won the seasonal tournament.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nQiang Baidu grinned. He patted the young man's head, \"Well done.\"\nThe young cultists looked at the tribal chief, \"A-Are we free now?\"\n\"Of course! You're free.\"\nQiang Baidu burst into laughter. He unleashed his domain power, creating a void hole under the prisoners. The four cultists screamed in shock as bloody hands from the void hole dragged them to the red abyss.\n\"You're free to suffer in hell for eternity, that is. Hahahahaha!\"\nAfter the tribal chief laughed, his underlings started laughing. They enjoyed murdering cultivators and helpless commoners.\nA few minutes later, they stopped celebrating as all their men gathered after plundering the entire city. As Qiang Baidu acquired the news of Yan Xiang's death, he turned his sight to the remnant of the Yan Empire.\nHe ordered his men.\n\"Separate our troops into 10 platoons. We're going to clean up the continent and secure our foothold on the west coast. Once the west is free of human cultivators, we will proceed to the north next. Remember that Death Sword Sect is built on a fortress city and a spirit stone heart. They are the strongest sect, second to the imperial court. Even if Yan Xiang's family all died, they can't be underestimated! Their daos are dangerous!\"",

She had nothing to do and no one to play with.\nEsen was still inside Leo's bus while Cat went hunting alone in the South Canyon River. Xu Nuan was also busy cultivating after the trip. Thus, Yao Qiqi had no playmate.\nWithout anything better to do, Yao Qiqi walked aimlessly around the store. Because she was absentminded, she bumped into Wu Buyi. The latter also didn't look at the way as his eyes focused on the smartphone in his hand.\n\"Ow!\"\nYao Qiqi wasn't hurt. Instead, it was Wu Buyi who hurt his legs. The latter felt like he kicked a steel plate instead of a little girl.\nBecause of the pain, Wu Buyi's phone slipped out of his hands. It fell on Yao Qiqi's head and bounced off to the ground.\nYao Qiqi's quick reflex kicked in. She grabbed the phone before it hit the ground. Then, she looked at it in curiosity.\n\"Umm, what is this?\"\nShe flipped the smartphone around and saw the moving pictures on the phone's screen. It was a VDO of a female band. Surprised, she accidentally touched the screen and pressed a recommended VDO that the screen showed.\nA new song appeared. A blond anime girl holding a child-protection alarm buzzer was shown on the screen, and a song of a foreign language sounded.\n'Lonely rori-rori kami kourin, Kane o naraseba kono touri,'\n\"EH?!\" Yao Qiqi's eyes sparkled. She found this object interesting, and she kept watching.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi finished rubbing his legs. He searched for his favorite smartphone and discovered that Yao Qiqi had it. He walked toward her to take it back.\n'SEI-NO! Sawattara TAIHO! Kyoku Chu de TENKO! ICHI-NI-SAN-SHII? (GOMEN NASAI!)'\nBut the song was too catchy. The animation was also eye-catching. As the blond little girl sang and danced.\nYao Qiqi got goosebumps. Although she didn't understand a word, she wanted to dance like the anime girl on the screen.\nWu Buyi was also interested in this song. He continued watching along with Yao Qiqi until the end.\nWhen the song was over, Yao Qiqi pouted. She wanted to listen to it again, but she didn't know how to make the smartphone replay the old VDO.\nWu Buyi coughed, \"Ahem. Little girl, that's my artifact. Can I have it back?\"\nYao Qiqi jolted. She turned around and wryly smiled. Realizing that she was holding the senior's artifact, she bowed and politely returned the phone to Wu Buyi.\n\"I-I'm sorry, senior! I didn't mean to use your artifact…\"\nAlthough Yao Qiqi returned the phone to the old alchemist, she was dejected. She hoped that she could watch that VDO again. Her eyes were teary as she wanted to cry.\nWu Buyi took the phone back. But seeing how sad the girl was, he deeply sighed and crouched. He patted her head.\n\"You know what? It's my day off today. How about we watch some VDO together? Oh, once we meet Lord Florida Man, I'll try to ask him to give you the same artifact that I have.\"\n\"R-Really?!\" Yao Qiqi was so glad. She stopped crying.\n\"Of course. Do you think I'm a liar?\"\nA few passing-by disciples overheard the question. The corners of their mouths curved up as they knew how sly Wu Buyi was. However, for the sake of the girl, they didn't expose him.\n\"Umm,\" Seizing the opportunity, Yao Qiqi asked the senior. \"Can I watch that previous girl again? I want to hear that song one more time.\"\n\"Again? Sure!\"\nThe senior and the little girl grabbed a sacred wood block and sat on it. Then, they replayed the VDO and watched it together.\n.\nAfter watching the same song 20 times in a row, Yao Qiqi had heard enough. She thanked Wu Buyi and returned the phone to him. Then, she hummed and danced her way to the rooftop of the general store. After that, she began dancing and singing the iconic song.\nAs Yao Qiqi was enlightened by the song, she acquired a new dao avatar. A spirit of Yao Qiqi with the same clothes and hairstyle as the anime girl in the VDO emerged.\nThe girl smiled and tried a new move.\n\"QIQI BEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAMU!\"\nZAAAAP\nA purple tribulation lightning flashed out from Yao Qiqi's eyes. People on the farm saw a purple laser beam coming from the rooftop toward the south. Everybody flinched for a moment before they shrugged.\nThey got used to strange things around here. Nothing surprised them anymore.\nAs for Wu Buyi, he took notes of the song's lyrics and planned to ask Leo about its meaning later. However, that song became an earworm that Wu Buyi couldn't get rid of.\nSince Wu Buyi realized that he couldn't forget the song, he started singing it.\n\"Lonely loli-loli kami ko ou rin!\"\n.\n.\nSouth of Magpie City, a patrol unit of the Gorr Tribe flew toward the north to map the area. This team of 10 soul transformation cultivators all had four arms as they had stayed too long in a demon realm.\nThe group stopped at the Canyon River north of Frozen Fire City to resupply their water. Two of them took off their clothes and jumped into the large river.\nTheir leader screamed at his subordinate, \"Hey! We're not here to play! Restock the water and get moving!\"\nThe two playful men laughed while they floated in the water, \"Relax, boss. It's not like cities can fly.\"\nThe leader rolled his eyes. He pointed toward the north, where he could see a flying continent on the horizon. It was the domain of Leo, which was hundreds of kilometers away.\n\"Open your eyes wide and look in that direction! There's something over there, and we need to scout it before Lord Qiang Baidu does! If he finds out that we ignore that place and fail to report its existence to him, our heads will roll!\"\n\"Bah, why so serious? Our lord said he wanted to strengthen our foothold toward the west and the south. He won't march north anytime soon. Yan Xiang is dead, so he doesn't need to rush anymore.\"\nThe leader prayed that his subordinates were right. Without Yan Xiang, they only needed to worry about Situ Nantian and the lurking immortals from Yan Clan, Situ Clan, and Ouyang Clan. As for the other quasi-immortals, they were trash in their eyes.\nAfter 10 minutes of refreshing and resupplying their water resources, they packed their belongings and traveled further north to check Leo's domain. The scout team flew along the canyon river so that they wouldn't be ambushed by random creatures from the forest.\nAlong the way, the two playful guys admired the scenery. They flew at a low altitude to look at their reflection in the transparent river.\n\"You know, this river is so nice and transparent. I can see everything at the bottom.\"\n\"Yeah. The demon realm's rivers are all muddy and rotten. Had no one awakened the water attribute, we would have died back then.\"\n\"Nah. It's thanks to our lord. His blood element protected us.\"\n\"True. Lord Qiang Baidu's blood domain is invincible. Even earth celestials aren't his opponents!\"\nWhile the two conversed, their teammates heard the conversation. They also gazed at the water.\nEverybody admired the clear water, except their leader. The latter frowned as he found the transparent water unusual.\nAlthough he had been stuck in the demon realm for centuries, he wasn't na?ve and uneducated. From his point of view, natural small streams on a mountain or a forest were common. However, clear rivers were extremely rare due to mud and other substances in the water.\nA massive river in the canyon was too transparent! It seemed too unnatural!\nSuspicious of the river, the team leader circulated his Qi to inspect his internal organs and dantian as everybody drank a lot of water from this river. Then, he discovered something dreadful.\nThe water was not as clean as it seemed. It contained unknown microorganisms, and they already infiltrated his bone marrow!\n\"TEAM! STOP AND CHECK YOUR BONE MARROW! WE DRANK POISON WATER!\" Shouted the leader.\nThe other nine soul transformation cultivators froze on the spot. They circulated their Qi and discovered countless black cells in their circulatory system and bones. A few parts of their bones already turned black and spreading.\nEverybody was confused and shocked. They landed on the ground and sat cross-legs, meditating and removing impurities from their bodies.\nThe black cells got pushed out of their pores. Some of them coughed black blood as they drove the bad cells out through their mouth. Unfortunately, the corrupted bones couldn't be healed instantly. They needed time to recuperate.\n\"Dammit!\"\nThe two guys that dove into the water were in a worse condition. Their skin was full of rashes, and the burning pain annoyed them. They didn't realize that their faces were full of pus and spreading black moles. Aside from the skin cancer, their bloodshot eyes started bleeding.\n\"WHAT IS GOING ON?! WHAT IS THIS POISON!?\"\nThe two men screamed and brought out their healing pills and antidotes to eat. After eating everything, they fought against the unknown disease.\nBecause of the scary symptoms, eight healthy cultivators chose to stay away from the duo and refused to help them. They kept their distance, watching them from afar.\n\"LEADER, HELP!\" One of them cried.\nNo one moved. Their leader shouted, \"We don't know what the poison is! Stay there! We'll head back to call for aid!\"\nAfter driving off most of the bad cells from their bodies, the 8 healthy scouts flew back to the Frozen Fire City to report to their lord. As for the two mutating cultivators, they struggled to remove the bad cells from their bodies.\nTwo minutes later, the two were left alone in the foreign forest. No one uttered a word as they prayed for their lord to come and save them.\nZAG-ZAG\nWhile they were struggling to survive, the bushes and trees behind them shook. Then, a massive shadow crept closer to them.\nThe two soul transformation cultivators turned around.\nZAAAAAAAAP\nA purple beam flew by, but it didn't hit anybody. However, the lightning beam flashed and revealed the appearance of the approaching entity.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nIt was Cat who had been hunting wolves and small animals outside of Leo's domain. She widely grinned and drooled, hoping that they would give her something tasty to eat.\nHer body was soaked, and droplets of water dripped from her body. A few minutes ago, Cat swam in the river, and she just defeated an injured thunder caiman, which \"Kitten, the Fisherman Guardian Statue\" threw out from the permanent mystic realm portal.\nCat grew up by absorbing Leo's radiation and contaminated water. Thus, she evolved and became similar to Leo, who could mutate most people upon touch. Although Cat couldn't instantly kill cultivators with her fluid, her cancer cells and poisonous saliva were still deadly.\nBecause of the recent activities, the river was contaminated with Cat's poisonous fluid, and the men drank it!\nThe two men were oblivious to the culprit. They glared at the monster plant and summoned their dao avatar.\n\"S-Stay away, monster! HAMMER DOMAIN!\"\n\"GET LOST, FIEND! LAVA FLAME DOMAIN!\"\nA massive metal hammer appeared in the sky and descended upon Cat. At the same time, the ground under Cat became moldy lava.\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nCat ignored the hammer and the lava in disappointment. Her eight roots lifted her body up, and she lifted two of them.\nOne spike root stabbed into the hammer guy's chest. As for the other, a bulky root smashed the lava guy into a meat paste.\nBONK\nThe hammer hit Cat's head, but she felt nothing. It was a lot lighter than Leo's paper fan slap.\nCat threw the mutating hammer guy into her mouth. Then, she scooped the meat paste from the ground with her branches and put them on the plant's head.\nThe humanoid torso of Cat laughed. She waved her fingers and lifted every drop of blood and flesh toward her. After that, she devoured the freshest corpse in glee.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"",

He reappeared in front of the Fate Stadium, standing at the back of the ticket booth queue again.\nHe didn't want to go back anytime soon. He had too much fun in this stadium as he could farm more lifespan from the gambling house.\nWhen Leo reappeared, a few Xeno creatures glanced at him as they recognized him from the previous fight. The majority of the crowd was still oblivious to his fame, though.\nThis time, no one mocked or tried to get into trouble with Leo. He managed to reach the front counter.\nThe same six-breast lamia looked up and nodded at Leo for returning.\n\"Welcome back, Florida Man. I guess an explanation is in order.\"\nAs the lamia knew that he was new, the lamia explained the rules of this stadium.\n\"As you're experiencing it now – After you finish your businesses in your locker room, the system will teleport you here if you haven't reserved a residential ticket yet. Also, there are five types of tickets you need to know.\"\nThe Fate Stadium operated similarly to the sports stadium on Earth as guests could purchase a ticket to enter the stadium to watch the sports inside. However, there were five types of tickets that the stadium offered.\nThe first type was the regular one-time-use spectating ticket. Anybody could purchase it, and the customer could view the fight from the front spectator stands. The price varied, depending on where the seat was.\nThe second type was the seasonal pass ticket. This perk granted free access to the stadium for a year, and customers with this pass could come and go as many times as they wanted.\nThe first two types existed on earth. However, the others were unique. The third was called \"Fighter Pass\", which granted access to buildings and facilities inside the stadium, such as hotels, clubhouses, restaurants, cultivation centers, etc. This was a common pass that many fighters loved as they could live in the stadium without worrying about the outside world. All services were not free, but all fighters could enjoy a big discount.\nHowever, this pass could only be extended by participating as a fighter in the arena at least once a month. Otherwise, the pass would be expired.\nThe fourth pass was called the \"Veteran Fighter Pass\". Only regular fighters who had fought in this arena at least 10 times could purchase it. This pass had no expiry date, and the pass holders could live inside the stadium as long as they could. However, this pass did not include other service fees of other facilities.\nThe last one, \"Crystal Bearer Pass\", could only be obtained by verifying their fate crystals to any stadium representative. However, the crystal's quality had to be at least Entity Fate Crystal. Inferior crystals were not enough to qualify for this pass.\nThe perk of this so-called VIP Pass was the treatment and the free services of the stadium's employees. They could take shelter there permanently, invest in real estate inside the stadium, and take part in various exclusive events. All food and facility services were free. In addition, the stadium permitted VIPs to build their system structures in their purchased properties, such as teleportation devices, farms, and others.\nAfter the lamia finished explaining, she gave Leo a meaningful look. She directly asked him.\n\"Sir, by chance, are you in possession of any Entity Fate Crystal? If you do, you can verify your ownership with me, and we will issue you the Crystal Bearer Pass.\"\nLeo frowned as he had a bad feeling about this. His cancer instinct cried that the stadium's people were up to no good, and he shouldn't disclose the sensitive information yet.\n\"No. I don't,\" Leo lied.\n\"I see. So you have a heavenly fate crystal then?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\n\"Alright, sir. Which type of ticket would you like to purchase? A regular ticket, season pass, or the fighter pass?\"\n\"How much for the fighter pass?\"\nThe lamia widely grinned, \"10,000 Years of lifespan, sir.\"\nLeo was taken aback. He thought that the clerk would ask for essence stones or spirit stones like other cultivators.\n\"You take lifespan? Can I pay with essence stones?\"\n\"We only take lifespan, sir. But if you don't wish to pay with lifespan, I suggest you purchase a regular ticket. It only costs 10 essence stones for the common seat. The VIP lounge is 10,000 essence stones per hour.\"\nThe corners of Leo's mouth twitched. This place was quite expensive. Still, Leo decided to pay 10,000 YOL for the fighter pass as he wished to return here regularly to advertise his store.\nConfirming the purchase, the lamia summoned a system screen in front of Leo. She, too, could view his lifespan and detail.\n.\nName: Leo [Redacted]\nTitle/Alias: Florida Man\nRace: [Redacted]\nAge: [Redacted]\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: [Redacted]\nRemaining Lifespan: 650,807 Years, 5 Months, 17 Days, 17 Hours, and 12 Minutes.\n.\nThe lamia frowned at the same time as some of the details were censored. The latter's throat vibrated, sending telepathic messages to her superior officers and inquiring them about the weird censorship.\nAs for Leo, he didn't flinch or say anything. He already knew why it showed up this way, but he didn't say anything about it.\nThere was no need to disclose his private information, especially his true strength.\n\"Sir,\" asked the lamia. \"What is your true race? Are you really a human?\"\nLeo smirked and teased her, \"Can't you tell that I'm a Nu'Earthe.\"\n\"…Please be serious, sir.\"\n\"I'm from the same race as Overlord Xiaomao.\"\nThe lamia and the people behind Leo gave him a meaningful look when he mentioned the legendary expert. Although they both looked like humans, these people were aware that they might not be from the same home planet. After all, human cultivators were like cockroaches of the universe – They bred and multiplied everywhere in every galaxy.\nSince Leo refused to disclose his information, there was nothing the lamia could do. She received the order from her superior to ignore the errors and proceed.\nDING\n10,000 YOL was deducted from Leo's lifespan pool. Then, the system gave him a notification message.\n<The Real-Time PVP Feature has been updated.>\n<You can now freely access the stadium for one month. You may extend the time limit by participating in any life-and-death fight or accept challenges from non-fate-crystal holders.>\nIt sounded simple. Still, this update told Leo something concerning – The Fate Stadium's owner was powerful enough to manipulate his system!\nHaving one's fate under the thumb of someone else was not a pleasant feeling. Leo wondered if he could break free from this restriction and interference one day. Fortunately, he already had a clue. He asked his dao avatar in his mind.\n'Hey, Genes. What do you think about our system?'\nLeo's dao avatar remained inside his ring, but he replied as if he had seen everything.\n'Don't be concerned about something trivial. You have a superior version of entity fate crystal. No other crystal owner can manipulate your system.'\n'Uh, but they are doing it right now. Look at my Real-Time PVP menu!'\n'That's a common system that every fate crystal bearer has, but all systems are different. A leveling system cannot access the store system that you have. A cultivation system cannot interfere with a domain shop system. Vice versa, your store system cannot influence other system users. The power of systems comes from the fate crystals in your soul, not the universe or someone else.'\nLeo felt a bit better, knowing that his privacy was secured. He bid farewell to the lamia and entered the stadium to see the facilities that the stadium had to offer.\n.\n.\nAfter Leo had left, the lamia put a signboard \"Taking a Break\" on her counter. She turned around and changed shifts with another employee. Then, she entered a staff room to rest.\nWhile resting in her office, she talked alone, communicating with her superior officer through voice transmission.\n\"So, you're saying, Florida Man has an Entity Fate Crystal, master?\"\n'Censorship and information redaction are the common traits of entity fate crystal's owners. They're either full-fledged entities or fated-to-be entities. The universe and heavens are on their side. We can't do anything about it.'\n\"Then, should we proceed as usual, master?\"\n'…Not now. Let him roam free for a while.'\n\"But, what if he grows stronger?\"\n'We don't know how strong he actually is. Do not provoke him until we discover his true strength. We also don't know what kind of system he has. If his system grants him something like the karmic severance ability like Overlord Xiaomao, we'll all die if we offend him.'\nThe lamia sensed a shiver running down her spine when she thought of a certain human overlord, who easily trampled the strongest system user \"Overlord Lucky\" without relying on any system power. She also thought of the cute \"Cathulhus\" who had similar abilities.\nFearing that Leo might have a similar ability as the Cathulhus and Overlord Xiaomao, the lamia stopped plotting against him.\n'Keep monitoring him for now. Don't make any rash move, you hear?'\n\"Understood, master.\"\n.\n.\nLeo walked inside the stadium. Aside from the observation stands and the arena, there was a city inside the whole ginormous structure.\nCondominiums, skyscrapers, shopping malls, theme parks, simulation centers, and unknown facilities offer various kinds of services. Leo's eyes sparkled like a kid in an arcade as he looked around.\nAs a shopping mall owner, his first tourist spot was the local shopping malls. He entered a place called \"Tulakom\".\nThe mall was different from Earth. Instead of having small stores inside, it featured a massive multi-floor supermarket. All products were arranged into sections – Food, drinks, and entertainment were allocated to the front. Pills, meds, and health-related products were in the middle. As for the back, it was full of weaponry. No kitchen utility or furniture existed here.\nLeo walked around and browsed the items. He was attracted to colorful pills, wondering what they were for. He picked a pink bottle and read the label.\n[Aphrodisiac Pill]\n\"Nope.\"\nLeo put it back. He then picked up another one.\n[Succubus Hymen Restoration Pill]\n\"Double nope!\"\nLeo facepalmed. He looked up to see the aisle label.\n[Female Products]\nLeo double-facepalmed. He walked away from the aisle and went for another one in the pill and meds section. Then, he came across an aisle of alchemy cauldrons.\nThe cauldrons on the shelves were all portable, and they came in a small size. Looking at the series of cauldrons, Leo thought of his alchemy workshops.\n'The cauldrons at home are all too big. I wish my system had some of these.'\nLeo picked one up and looked at the price tag.\n[500 Essence Stones]\nIt seemed cheap for Leo's standard, yet he put it back on the shelf as he didn't need it. He explored the other area next.\nAfter checking a hundred pills and cauldrons from the medical section, Leo visited the second floor of the shopping mall to see what they had. Then, he was astonished.\nThe second floor was dedicated to vehicle dealerships as all products on display were spaceships!\nLooking at the spaceships, Leo wondered if the one he found on Earth was for sale. He searched for the model that he wanted.\nAlthough the real spaceship was not parked there, there was a dealership with a poster of the model. Leo rushed toward the store.\nSurprisingly, the bald salesman looked like a Caucasian man on steroids, except he had a long monkey tail. He was 8 feet tall, and his bulky muscles were larger than Mister Olympia that Leo had seen. Fortunately, he didn't wear a scouter, or Leo would have called him Nappa by accident.\nThe white man smiled at Leo and approached him. Then, he offered to fist-bump Leo.\n\"What's up Nu'Earthe! What ride ya looking for?\"\n\"…\"\nHearing an N-word from a white dude here gave a different vibe from when the werewolf called him. Leo almost uttered the forbidden word, but he shut his mouth and fist-bumped the big dude.\n\"Hello, sir. May I ask if that thing on the poster is for sale?\"\n\"Oh, Stellar Model 3? Ya a fan of nuclear-powered low-ride, Nu'Earthe?\"\n\"…\"",

Florida Man Scammed Him and Bought It for $1,000.\nChapter 181 – Scammer Attempted to Sell Second-Hand Tesla as Brand New. Florida Man Scammed Him and Bought It for $1,000.\nThe giant monkey-tailed man guided Leo to his store and showed him a portal. He gestured for him to go in.\n\"Where will this lead to?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Ya gonna be teleported ta da ride. Hope in, and I'll show ya.\"\nLeo was skeptical about this. He was afraid that he might be teleported to another planet, and he might not be able to return to the stadium. Still, this spaceship was the clue to the origin of his first entity Fate Crystal. Leo chose to bite the bullet.\n\"Alright.\"\nHe entered the portal. After crossing to the other side, Leo found himself on the bridge of the spaceship. The salesman also followed Leo to show him around.\n\"@#$!%%!@#$\"\nThe guy's speech became incomprehensible after they entered this place. Leo frowned and tried to communicate with hand sign language.\n\"I-Don't-Understand-You.\" Leo moved his mouth and moved his hands around.\nThe salesman slapped his forehead. He wiggled his fingers and gestured for Leo to go back. Leo agreed and crossed the portal back to the stadium.\n\"Ma bad, Nu'Earthe. I forgot that the translating system only works here. Anyway, I'll show ya the hologram of da ride instead.\"\nThe language barrier was still a thing. Without the stadium's mysterious influence, no one could communicate or trade around here.\nThe salesman guided Leo to a large table, whose surface was a hologram projector. After a few seconds of typing, the projector displayed a hologram of a spaceship in the posture. He then invited Leo to stand on an observer platform to inspect the ship from above.\nThe observer platform was a transparent floor above the hologram projector. Leo hopped on it and gazed at the spaceship hologram below.\nThe spaceship design was a combination of a U.S.S. Voyager from Star Trek and Gundam Series. The oval front looked similar to a saucer UFO but the middle and the back featured a bridge control tower, cannons, guns, and even a hangar for shuttles and smaller ships.\nHowever, noticeably, there were many cargo rooms. This ship looked more like a cargo plane or a commercial plane than a battle spaceship.\nThe hologram displayed the interior of the spaceship, including its specs and descriptions.\nThe salesman introduced the perks and exciting parts of this mothership.\n\"Ya ain't getting this classic from elsewhere, dawg. Those freaks from Divine Stellar Court… excuse me, da Nu'Earthes from Melon Eusk Galaxy… mass-produced dis to invade the Cathulhus. Ya can guess what happened. Those cats called 'em to pull up and beat their asses! Da rest is history!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, dis is a remnant of that war. Dis one got smuggled before the war began, and it got passed down to ma hands. Of course, the mileage is only less than a thousand light years.\"\nLeo wanted to retort that a thousand light years as a mileage was quite a distance. However, this was a spaceship, so Leo couldn't refer to a car's mileage standard.\n\"How much?\"\nThe salesman grinned. He showed four fingers.\n\"Four… what?\"\n\"5,000 Soul stones, and it's yours.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows, surprised by the cheap price tag. He thought that the salesman would ask for lifespan like the stadium clerk did.\nThe salesman paused for a moment as he noticed Leo's unhappy expression. He lowered the price.\n\"If ya can pay in cash, I can give ya a promotion, Nu'Earthe! How 'bout 3,500 SS?\"\nLeo leered at the bald giant, \"Is this ship damaged?\"\nThe salesman sweated profusely. He shook his head, \"No way! I got dis brand new! Ya can check its condition later!\"\nLeo pursed his lips and coughed, \"Excuse me. Give me a minute. I need to check something.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nLeo walked away from the salesman. He opened his online shopping system and searched for the same spaceship model. Also, Leo filtered the search and narrowed it down to only spaceships and motherships.\n[Stellar Model 3 – Standard]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Long Range]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Performance]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Transporter]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Star Orbiter]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Star Carrier]\n[Stellar Model 3 – Star Destroyer]\nIn the list, Leo noticed many alternative models. Some were designed to be a commercial spaceships while the latter ones were customized to be battleships.\nLeo managed to roughly memorize the spaceship's outline and the number of guns. As the salesman's spaceship had too many blank rooms inside, he figured that it might be either the transporter model or the commercial one.\nHe checked the price tags next. Then, he almost vomited blood.\nThe commercial one cost a million YOL. The other models were even more expensive.\nThe top-of-the-line, Star Destroyer Model, had a whooping price of 20 million YOL! This didn't include the upgrade fees in the future.\nLeo closed his system screens. He turned around to look at the salesman.\n\"1,000 Soul stones?\"\nThe salesman rejoiced that Leo wanted it. However, he was reluctant to sell it at that price. Thus, he haggled.\n\"Can't do, Nu'Earthe. But I'm feeling generous. If ya really want it, I can do 4,800!\"\n\"I see. Well, maybe later. Thanks for showing the sightseeing.\"\n\"Wait, wait, wait!\"\nThe salesman sweated waterfall. He rubbed his hands and hunched his back while his ugly suspicious smile disturbed Leo.\n\"I can't go that far. How about 4,500? I need to eat, ya know?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"My resources are limited. I can't afford that.\"\n\"Err…\"\nThe salesman scratched his head. He gave Leo a meaningful look into the latter's eyes.\n\"How much da ya have on you?\"\nLeo widely grinned, \"1,000.\"\n\"DAMMIT! Can't you give more? I'll be in under if I sell ya at dat price!\"\n\"Like I said, I can't afford it. But if you can lower it to 1,000, maybe I can come back with cash in a month or two.\"\n\"R-Really?!\"\nThe salesman grumbled and scratched his head again. His bald head was slightly red because of the intense scratches. After a serious contemplation, he made another counteroffer.\n\"Can it be 4,000?\"\n\"Do you think I can procure 3,000 additional SOUL FREAKING STONES without two months?!\"\nUsing past knowledge and experience about the cultivation world and alchemy, Leo believed nobody, even in the higher stage, could obtain as many soul stones within a limited time. After all, essence stones were still a currency within this stadium's domain.\nFurthermore, Leo had a way to obtain soul stones.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stones]\nOne Molg Lich's Bone (Any Piece)\nYin Essence\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Soul Stones]\n1,000 Essence Stones\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Catalyst\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth Essence\n.\nIf he wanted to, he could allocate all six alchemy cauldrons to mass-produce soul stones. Then, he might get 1,000 soul stones in a month or two if the production time wouldn't take long.\nWhile the salesman seemed reluctant, Leo turned away from the store, \"I'll be back in two months. If you are willing to part with that for 1,000, I'll bring the cash here.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo left the store and visited the other shops in the area. As for the salesman, he remained quiet as he didn't dare to lower his price again.\n.\n.\nThe Kong Race originated from the same galaxy as the Divine Stellar Court. Nazz, the salesman, was originally one of the court's marines. However, Nazz stumbled upon a remnant of the war during his patrol, and he deserted the troops along with this spaceship and his past collections.\nAs he managed to flee here and qualify for the veteran pass, he settled down in the Fate Stadium City and opened a spaceship dealership to sell old junk that he collected throughout the years. So far, he managed to swindle a dozen rookies and got a sizable amount of essence stones for a living.\nWhen Nazz found Leo, he thought that the latter was just another pushover. He dragged him to the spaceship, which he had roughly repaired. Then, he tried to sell it for soul stones.\nThe real price tag of this spaceship was 50,000 Soul Stones for a brand-new transporter model. As Nazz was aware of its real value, he instinctively haggled to boost the price. However, he forgot that he stole this spaceship from an abandoned planet.\nUnfortunately, Leo's reaction terrified Nazz. He looked like a veteran in this field as he suddenly dumped the price. Then, he refused Nazz's counteroffers as if he had seen through the conditions of the ship.\n'Dammit! 1,000 SS is too low! But I can't keep it with me for too long. If I don't sell it soon, the Divine Stellar's marines will surely find me here, and it will be confiscated! I should have just accepted the offer!'\nNazz hoped that Leo would come back and take the stolen spaceship out of his hands soon.\n.\n.\nLeo continued his tour in the Fate Stadium City's shopping mall. He visited other spaceship dealer stores and collected a large stack of brochures. Unlike Nazz's store, the other dealerships offered legit brand-new spaceships from their factories.\nThe standard price of battleships was also intimidating. Some dealers asked for a million YOL as their bosses had a similar lifespan system as Leo's. The other dealerships wanted 10,000 soul stones at the minimum, which was too expensive for Leo's pocket at the moment.\nLeo thought to himself.\n'I should just get that second-handed ship from that Nappa. It doesn't matter if it's a smuggled ship or an illegal one. As long as I get to investigate my origins, it should be fine.'\nPutting the matter to the back of his head, Leo proceeded to the third floor of the mall to see other exotic goods. He wished to learn more from his rival shopping mall.\nThe third floor looked a lot more like a modern department stores. A thousand luxurious shops lined up along the walkway, and most of their products were clothes, armor, artifacts, and trinkets.\nAlthough most stores offered combat gear for cultivators of various races, not many stores featured clothes for humans. Instead, they prioritized massive gears for giants and big creatures. Even armor and weapons were massive even though the shops and walkways were designed for creatures under five meters tall.\nAfter touring deep into the back alley of the third floor, Leo found a weapon shop for a humanoid-sized creature. He went in to see what they had to offer.\nAs soon as Leo walked into the bright store, he found a group of floating octopus-cats in the store, holding long swords. One of them held 8 broad swords with 8 tentacles and waved them around.\n\"These are kinda light, munya!\"\nThe store owner was a stout old man with red skin. He was only 4 feet tall, but his arms and muscles were superior to average adult humans. Strangely, he had 9 fingers and two thumbs on each hand.\nFor the first time, Leo encountered an alien dwarf.\nThe dwarf yelled at the small Cathulhus in his store.\n\"Hey, Miao Meolord! Stop playing with constellation-killer swords for a second! You'll hit the other customers!\"\nThe \"Cathulhu\" who held 8 swords was a brown cat-octopus. He also had three eyes and long cat ears. While floating, the catopus yelled back.\n\"You ain't getting new customers aside from us anyway, munya! Let me play with these immortal-graded swords for a second. Maybe, I'll buy them, munya!\"\n\"Bullshit! You stinky Cathulhu never bought shit from my store! Only your brother did!\"\nThe white cat-octopus behind the brown cat wryly laughed. He turned around and noticed Leo's presence.\n\"Ah! Our benefactor, munya! Aren't you Florida Man, munya?\"\nHearing the white cat's voice, the others looked at Leo. The latter also remembered them.\nThe three cat-octopus creatures were the guys who cheered for Leo when he first arrived at the stadium. However, Leo wasn't aware of these guys' real names.\nThe white Cathulhu introduced himself.\n\"Hello, Florida Man, munya! I'm Miao Damao, munya! This is my elder brother and my fiancé, Kat Katerina, munya!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 182 Florida Man Stormed into Gun Store, Threatened Store Owner, and Robbed a Pen\nChapter 182 – Florida Man Stormed into Gun Store, Threatened Store Owner, and Robbed a Pen\nLeo was slightly confused. He had seen them in them in their giant forms, but at the moment, they were no bigger than a human's head. They looked like something from the Pokémon Series.\nMost importantly, their speech reminded Leo of the giant cat ball statue back home. The statue also loved to meow \"Munya\" like these guys.\nDiscovering the kin of that statue, Leo was curious about them. He introduced himself and cupped his fist, mimicking cultivators.\n\"Yes, I'm Florida Man. Nice to meet you, fellas.\"\nThe three Cathulhus saluted like modern soldiers with their tentacle arms. Their innocent eyes and happy smile showed their friendliness and carefree attitude.\nThe floating cat \"Miao Damao\" waved his tentacles and showed Leo a ring made of catnip vine and leaves. He bragged, \"Look, Florida Man. This is my engagement ring, munya! I bought it from the lifespan I got from your fight, munya!\"\nLeo was taken aback. He still remembered that this guy said something about earning ten million YOL. He wondered how much the ring cost as it seemed cheap.\n\"What did you pay for it?\"\n\"Only a million years of lifespan, munya!\"\n\"@#$!%\"\nLeo almost swore to the Cthulhu for giving birth to this stupid variant, who just got scammed for no reason.\n\"I hope that has hidden features or power. Otherwise…\"\n\"I'm not stupid, munya!\" Miao Damao laughed, \"This works as a storage ring, an energy battery, and a life-saving tool, munya! As long as I charge this ring's battery to the fullest, it can block any attack from a sage once, munya!\"\n\"A sage?\" Leo was curious about the strength standard and tiers in this universe. He already learned what the mortal's strength was, but he was still clueless about the immortal stages and beyond.\n\"That's right, munya. You don't know anything about sages, munya?\"\nLeo shook his head, \"Could you explain it to me like I'm a toddler?\"\n\"Of course, munya!\"\nMiao Damao took his time to explain the cultivation base, strength, and power scales of the universe.\nThe lowest tier of the universe was the mortals. Their strength, cultivation methods, and standards were different, and it was impossible to compare them. Some mortals were capable of using the power of \"Domain\" when they were only a nascent soul cultivator while many were incapable of gathering Qi.\nThe next bottom tier was the immortals. Similar to the mortals, they had different scale and cultivation methods, such as constellation method, internal star method, or celestial body method. Xeno-based creatures also had their own ways of gaining strength, and their cultivation ranking names differed.\nThe next stronger tier was considered common in this Fate Stadium. People called them \"Deities\". Although their foundation was unique to their own race and cultivation method, they had one thing in common – Followers. These deities often built a country, a religion, or an organization to protect weaker immortals and mortals. These people obtained the power of faith through their good deeds, making them worthy of being called a god.\nAs for the sage, it was a realm higher than the deities.\nLeo pondered as Acku mentioned something about him being a deity. He was still puzzled as he didn't remember creating a religion.\n\"Anyway, munya. Are you here to commission new weapons, too? You have good eyes, munya! This store makes the best immortal-killing treasures, munya!\"\nThe dwarf coughed, \"Correction, Constellation-Killing weapons. They're designed to cripple immortals with stars in their dantians.\"\nHe glanced at Leo and sized him up. A few seconds later, he frowned as he couldn't measure or appraise Leo's true strength due to his weird physique.\nThe dwarf introduced himself, \"I'm Crimson Nineteen. You can call me Nine-Fingered-Red. Which planet are you from? Oheelu? Duffony? Or Snu Paradise?\"\nLeo had a bad feeling about the world called Snu Paradise. He hoped that it wouldn't involve something under the belly, and he didn't want to know about the local culture.\n\"None of those. It's Earth.\"\nThe cats froze while Nine-Fingered Red's face twitched due to the name – It was too similar to the N-Word that they didn't want to utter. The latter coughed and changed the subject as he didn't want to pry into the subject.\n\"Ahem. Say, what are you looking for, Florida Man? Maybe, I can custom-make a weapon of your need.\"\nLeo rubbed his chin as the weapon racks and the products here all looked fancy and colorful. Instead of having only dull steel weapons, many swords, spears, lances, blades, and halberds had their glows.\nThis shop's weapon racks had a theme. Each section was full of weapons of the same color. For example, red blades, swords, and halberds were arranged close to each other while another section had similar items but with green.\nLeo looked around for a moment before his eyes were attracted to a black stick in the deepest corner behind a red weapon rack. He pointed at it.\n\"Can I see that black stick?\"\nNine-Fingered Red raised his eyebrows. He wiggled his finger, and the black stick floated toward them.\n\"I forgot that I put that broomstick there. It's a useless stick, though. Do you really want that thing?\"\nLeo gave it a closer look. As a cultured man, he was attracted to a smooth and straight stick. In addition, this stick was a meter long and suitable for holding and swinging. He reached out to grab the black stick.\nAs soon as Leo touched it, the stick shrank and transformed into a pen.\nLeo liked this pen-stick, \"How much for this?\"\nThe dwarf deeply sighed. He waved his hand, \"100 essence stones are enough. It was a broom that I made long ago. Aside from the shrinking and enlarging power, it has no other perk.\"\n\"What about its durability?\"\n\"Depends on the user. Inject your blood into the ink tube of the pen and try to revert it back to the broomstick. You'll know.\"\nCurious, Leo opened the pen's back lid. Then, he bit the tip of his index finger. He squeezed his transparent blood into the empty tube.\nMiao Meolord and the dwarf widened their eyes when they noticed Leo's blood color. They broke a sweat and lowered their heads. As for Miao Damao and Kat Katerina, they didn't notice anything.\nThe pen absorbed Leo's blood. Originally, it was already black. But after taking in Leo's blood, it got even blacker. No light reflected from its surface.\nLeo waved it around. A few seconds later, it transformed back into a straight stick. Unlike before, it didn't look like a wooden broom or a plastic broom.\nThe stick's surface was too smooth and sturdy to be called a broomstick. It might as well be called a metal short spear as one of its tips looked like a pen's head.\nLeo tried smacking his arm and shoulder with the stick.\nBONK\nIt sounded hollow on impact. However, the strike made Leo flinch as he could feel a numbing pain. He then checked the condition of the stick, wondering if something had broken.\nBetraying Leo's expectation, it was intact. No sign of damage appeared on its surface.\n\"Nice! I'll take this, please.\"\nThe dwarf shrugged, \"Well, that's to be expected. Weapons don't make a master. Only the master makes weapons work.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\nLeo paid the dwarf in full. He ejected 100 essence stones from his spatial ring.\nThe dwarf was an expert. He lightly snorted and forced all ejected essence stones to float toward him. But when he noticed the quality of the stones, he faintly grinned.\n\"Thank you for business, Your Holiness. Anything else particular you're looking for?\"\n\"Nah, I'm happy with this.\"\nLeo slightly jerked the short spear, reverting it into a pen. He then put the pen in his suit's inner pocket. He didn't notice that the dwarf changed Leo's pronoun.\nDue to his tight schedule, Leo bid farewell to the dwarf and cats. He stopped exploring the third floor and went to the 4th floor.\n.\n.\nAfter Leo had left, Miao Meolord and the dwarf looked at each other. They wiped away the sweat on their foreheads.\n\"That was scary, munya.\"\nNine-Fingered Red deeply sighed, \"I think my lifespan is shortened by 10,000 years just now. Where did that MONSTER come from?! He's definitely not a human!\"\n\"That's what I want to know, too, munya!\"\nWhile the two seniors complained about something, Damao and Katerina were puzzled. They had no idea why they were shivering in fear.\n\"What's the matter with you, munya?\" Asked Damao.\nMiao Meolord deeply inhaled. He smacked the head of his little brother and yelled, \"You fool, munya! THAT MONSTER is not a human! He's….\"\nMeolord opened his mouth, but he couldn't utter the next word. His voice got stuck in his throat.\nThe dwarf also tried to say the word, but his voice didn't come out as well. They looked at each other as they realized something.\n\"Power of Redaction, munya!\" Meolord was shocked.\nThe dwarf gulped. He pulled out a brown towel and wiped his pale face. He then stared at the three cathulhus.\n\"No one tell a word about today's encounter! No one!\"\nDamao and Katerina were still clueless. Meolord grabbed his brother and sister-in-law and whispered to them.\n\"Never mention anything about that MONSTER to anyone if you don't want to die, munya.\"\n\"Eh? Why, munya?\"\n\"To sum it short, he's a predator, munya!\"\n\"Predator?\" Damao and Katerina still couldn't understand.\n\"It means, he's the same as our master, munya!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe duo finally realized something. They sweated bullets.\n.\n.\nThe fourth floor of this mall was a red-light district, which Leo disliked. He skipped it to the next floor.\nThe fifth floor was similar to what Leo had envisioned for his shopping mall. Tutoring centers and schools were the theme here. Thousands of children and teenagers of various races loitered in this place and gathered around food stalls and resting areas.\nLeo walked around to admire the names of schools and training centers in this place.\n\"The Way of Berserker, Sentinel Rearing Center, Chess Guardians, Leveling by Snu-Snu…Hold up! Why is there a perverted school over here? There are children around! Dafuq?!\"\nLeo was tempted to visit every school to get a brochure of their curriculum, except the sexual ones.\nAfter exploring the school area for an hour, Leo stumbled upon an arena. However, the surface was the arena was an 8x8 chess board. At the moment, 16 children stood on the stage as if they were chess pieces, facing off against the other team.\nEverybody put on helmets of their pieces. The pawns stood in front of major pieces while rooks, bishops, knights, kings, and queens positioned behind the frontline pawns.\nStrangely, one side was a group of human-like children, who had long monkey tails. As for the other team, they were all werewolf children.\n\"Oh? A human chess?\"\nThe last time Leo played chess, his ELO was merely 1400-1500. He learned enough openings and middle-game, but his overall vision and pattern recognition still needed improvement.\nAt the side of the stage, their parents hovered, observing the game. They also sneaked glances at their kids, cheering for them.\nLeo mixed in with the crowd, but he couldn't fly. He climbed a spectator stand and sat at the back.\n\"PAWN E4!\"\n\"PAWN E5!\"\nThe game began. Oddly enough, they were playing an international chess game.\nThe first move of each side was normal. However, the monkey-tailed humans utilized a bad opening.\n\"QUEEN H5!\"\nLeo almost snickered. He slightly shook his head as this game might either end prematurely.\n\"KNIGHT C6!\"\n\"BISHOP F3!\n\"PAWN G6!\"\n\"QUEEN F3!\"\n\"KNIGHT F6!\"\nThe game went on. Everything looked fine as both sides hadn't blundered any major pieces yet.\nBut as the game went on, they started trading pieces. But instead of removing the taken piece, a stunning and disturbing event shocked Leo.\nThe human child, who acted as a White Pawn, slashed an opponent's Black Pawn representative with a real sword. The werewolf child whimpered and opened his jaws to retaliate. However, he couldn't bite the human child.\nThe white pawn boy stomped on the werewolf boy and stabbed him in his chest. He gauged the heart of the wolf out and laughed.\nThe parents of the werewolf only frowned, but they didn't bother coming down to help their kids. Everybody silently observed the game without uttering a word.\nLeo was disgusted by this game. He stood up and was about to jump on the stage to stop this nonsense. However, a guy next to him grabbed Leo's arm and pulled him with great force.\nLeo flinched as he sensed the strong force from the guy. He looked back.\nThe person was a muscular green orc. He hushed Leo and shook his head.\n\"Don't interfere, human. This is a death chess for forsaken children. Don't ruin their ritual.\"\n\"Hey, a kid just died.\"\n\"They are all death-row criminals.\"\n\"Aren't they just children?!\"\n\"For your standard, maybe. But for the Werewolves and Oheelians, those men are over 100 years old, and they disgraced their ancestors. This is where they give their descendants a second chance in life after the death sentence. The winning side will live on while the losers will be executed.\"\nThis was a custom of this place. Whenever the trainees or juniors committed great crimes and were sentenced to death, they put the prisoners on this stage. The only way to survive was to win the chess game.\nHowever, there were flaws that Leo hated.\n\"What about the dead kid that got killed during the game? Can anybody revive them?\"\n\"No. Nobody can do anything about it.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Before the game even starts, the match has already begun. Everybody's roles and chess pieces are pre-chosen by the judges. The worse crimes they committed, the weaker piece they get. The one that controls the king piece acts as their leader. As for the other pieces, they have to move according to their king's order no matter what.\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 183 – Professional Wrestler \"Florida Man\" Fired From WWB After His Debut Match Got Interrupted Due to Technical Difficulties. The Executives Claimed Florida Man's Gimmick Was Too Overpowered.\nThe game went on, and more youngsters murdered each other. As blood got into their eyes, the leaders of both sides failed to find efficient checkmate sequences. Instead, they focused on capturing more pieces, killing more opponents in the process.\nAfter 60 moves, they traded most pieces, leaving only Kings and a few pawns. They continued pushing the pawns to the other side of the board to promote the pieces into Queens.\nLeo shook his head as he lost interest in the bloodbath. He was disgusted and too disturbed to stay.\nAs Leo left, the green orc earlier deeply sighed, \"See you later, human. I hope you won't end up in a death game like this.\"\n.\n.\nAfter witnessing the untasteful and unnecessary bloodbath, Leo was no longer in the mood to continue shopping. He exited the shopping mall to get some fresh air.\nAs soon as Leo came out, he was greeted by a cyberpunk-styled billboard TV on the opposite side of the road. The screen showed the stadium arena and a new pair of fighters in the middle of the ring.\nThe fight already ended. The winner was a giant silver werewolf. As for the other party, it was a centaur, whose guts were ripped out of his stomach.\nThe werewolf stared into the monitor as he gazed at a hidden camera of the stage. He then cut his promo like a professional wrestler.\n\"Residents of Fate Stadium, you have been sitting here, watching us \"the Fate Crystal Holders\" kill each other for entertainment. We're glad that you enjoy watching us struggle in tears, sweat, and blood while the gambling house milks us dry for gambling profits! We love you! Although we, the proud Fenrirs, are being mistreated left and right because of those pathetic haters and stinky fisherman gay lovers, we love you all, including the haters! But we arbor cowards and bullies…\"\nLeo shrugged as he was disinterested in professional wrestling promotions and trash-talking. It was none of his business.\nAs Leo opened his system menu to teleport home, the wolf suddenly mentioned his name.\n\"FLORIDA MAAAAN!\"\nLeo's hand paused. He frowned and glanced at the TV screen.\nThe Fenrir werewolf continued barking, \"A junior of mine was just a 370-year-old immortal. However, a Nu'Earthe scumbag forced him to fight in a death match against his will! That Nu'Earthe's strength is concealed, but I can tell that he's either a deity with at least a billion followers! Do you think it's fair for a god to bully a newborn immortal junior?! TELL ME, FLORIDA MAN!\"\nThe crowd in the arena cheered and booed as if they were wrestling fans. Some of them were informed about what happened at the ticket lobby, but the majority of them weren't aware of the backstage drama.\nMeanwhile, Leo raised one of his eyebrows like a certain famous professional wrestler. He was amused.\nAs if the Fate Stadium had prepared for such a promotional event, a floating camera appeared in the sky above Leo. It pointed the camera lens at his face and zoomed in.\nThe next moment, half of the screen showed Leo's reaction. Everybody in the stadium city could see him.\nPeople around him kept a distance away from Leo while they observed the situation in glee. Some of them smiled as they were interested in this feud.\nLeo frowned. He had no intention of playing along since he wouldn't gain anything worthwhile. He scoffed at the Fenrir on the stage.\n\"Get a helmet and toughen up, puppy boy. Instead of barking and bitching about your junior's death, why don't you go and educate your Chihuahua juniors not to pick a fight or provoke a senior? In this universe, there's this little thing called \"Fuck around, and find out\" karma.\"\nAs soon as Leo finished his sentences, he heard a loud boo from the arena. People around him also pointed their thumbs down, disliking Leo's response.\nAs if the wolf had been prepared for this, he smiled and opened his arms, establishing his righteous dominance.\n\"See? Nu'Earthes are immoral, crude, uneducated pieces of trash that can't be recycled. Trashy gods like you have to be purged! The fate crystal on you is a waste!\"\nLeo faintly smiled and shrugged, \"And?\"\n\"Because you're trash, it's my duty to clean up the mess! Come up on the stage and accept my challenge, trash! I might have used up the monthly quota as a player, but that doesn't mean I cannot challenge you into a life-and-death match!\"\n\"Why should I accept? I'm done here. I'm going home.\"\nAgain, Leo laughed. Even though he might have played a role as a villain here, he didn't hate it. It had been a long time since he last watched a WWE show, and he always wanted to try acting like a wrestler.\nThe wolf's expression grimaced as he realized that Leo could easily dodge his challenge. He pulled out a Veteran Fighter Pass badge and shouted.\n\"I hereby exert my rights and the privilege of VF Pass and an earth fate crystal player! I wish to force Florida Man into a death match!\"\nAs soon as the wolf said that, Leo's shadow glowed in silver light. The next moment, it enveloped him and teleported him to the arena stage, the same stage as the big Fenrir werewolf.\n\"…\"\nLeo pursed his lips. He didn't know that someone else could force a death match on him out of the blue. Frustrated by the stadium's power, he rolled his eyes.\n\"Oh, boy. Another time waster.\"\nFortunately, there was a price that the werewolf had to pay. Leo's system informed him of the benefits of the challenged fighter.\nDING\n<You have been forcefully challenged into a life-and-death match with the player, Anuraku, the Liver-Devouring Fenrir God.>\n<Anuraku, the Liver Devouring Deity is forced to wager all his fate crystal, lifespan, and assets. You have the right to reject or adjust the wager as you wish.>\n<Please note. Removing the entire bet will not cancel the match. You will be forced to fight anyway even though no wager has been set.>\nA window screen showed icons of Anuraku's items and earth fate crystal. The bottom label also revealed his lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 54,012 Years…>\nHe was quite rich in materials and life force. Leo couldn't refuse this free offer. Returning the favor, Leo allocated item icons in his possession to the wager inventory, allowing the system to use them as gamble chips for the wager.\nAfter finishing the deal, Leo glanced at the scoreboard. As usual, the gambling house adjusted the odds based on the total bet.\n- Florida Man: -200\n- Anuraku: +150\nThe odds were quite close although the house favored Leo.\nSeeing such favorable odds, Leo salivated. He dumped 596,000 YOL to bet on himself, leaving 795 YOL after all the wagers.\n'If I win, I'll have 1,002,819 YOL! Man, I'm so lucky. Idiots keep coming and offering their YOL to me.'\nLeo thought of the universal language translation and the spaceships in the system store. At this rate, those items would be in his reach soon.\nMeanwhile, the referee and the stadium staff removed the corpse and cleaned the blood on the stage, preparing for the next fight. Spectators and other fighters from the arena filled the stands as they were interested in the match between players.\nBoth Leo and Anuraku couldn't move as the stadium froze them again. They stood there, waiting for the others to finish their betting.\nWhile waiting for the official signal to fight, Anuraku and Leo's status windows were displayed on the scoreboard, comparing both fighter's records and strength.\n.\nName: Leo [Redacted]\nTitle/Alias: Florida Man\nRace: [Redacted]\nAge: [Redacted]\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: [Redacted]\nFight Record: 2W 0D 0L\n.\nName: Anuraku\nTitle/Alias: The Liver-Devouring Fenrir God\nRace: Fenrir Werewolf\nAge: 13,155\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: 381-Star Deity\nFight Record: 36W 1D 3L\n.\nWhen the menu revealed that Leo's status was concealed, the crowd murmured. Then, the odds on the screen rapidly changed.\n- 300\n- 450\n- 600\nBy the time Leo blinked twice, the odds were already minus 900!\nLeo had a heartache. At this rate, his profit would be minimal.\n'Dammit! Why?! Is it something about my status?!'\nAnuraku also saw their statuses on the scoreboard. Although he couldn't move, his face was pale.\n\"BASTARD! YOU TRICK ME!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"I didn't do dog crap. You were the one forcing my hands. I was about to go home, mind you.\"\n\"YOU NU'EARTHES ARE ALL THE SAME! YOU COWARDLY TRASH!\"\n\"Blame yourself for bringing me into the ring. Oh, by the way, thanks for your lifespan.\"\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHH!!\"\nAnuraku was so enraged that his silver fur turned red, yet he couldn't do anything under the stadium's influence.\nBEEP\nAt long last, the signal began. The timer slowly counted down.\n5…\n4…\nLeo licked his lips as he prepared to finish this fight early. As for Anuraku, he gathered his strength and prepared an all-out attack.\nBZZZ\nSuddenly, the entire stadium turned red, and the countdown stopped. A second later, one of the staff announced on the microphone, sending his telepathic voice to everybody in the stadium city.\n\"Dear fighters and honorable guests from far galaxies. The Fate Stadium has been hit by a rift vacuum because some idiot gnomes activated an outdated hyperspace jump without authorization. Please turn off all elemental devices, artifacts, and ship components or they will be fried by the stray dark matter's radiation from the hyperspace. All fights have been canceled, and all system teleportation abilities are disabled. If you made a wager, we will refund everything. Please stay put until our staff pull us away from the vacuum. Thank you for your understanding.\"\nIn short, someone screwed up this massive complex stadium to the point that all businesses were forced to temporary close.\nLeo could move again. He opened his system menu to check if he could return home.\nAs the staff mentioned, the teleport home button had a big red cross on it. He couldn't use it or press it at the moment.\nAnuraku seized this chance. He ran away from Leo with a tail tugging between his legs, not looking back.\nWHOOOO\nThe lights of the stadium were turned off. The crowd in the stadiums started using their night vision tools or relied on their natural nightlights to see in the dark.\nLeo's green eyes also glowed in the dark. He looked around and found many pairs of eyes on the stand.\n\"Hah. I guess my luck is bad today. I should have returned home when I had a chance.\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile\nCat floated on the canyon river, chilling and relaxing after a big meal. She hummed and meowed.\n\"NYA-NYA-NYA NYA-NYA-NYA-NYA-NYA-\"\nWithout realizing it, Cat sang the Nyan-Cat song. She didn't know how she knew the song, but it was with her when she was born.\nWhile singing, the transparent river's surface gradually turned rainbow. Waves of colorful water spread, but they became transparent when the water flowed away from Cat.\nZAAAA\nMore thunder caimans were thrown from the flying platform to the canyon river. Giant Tarantulas and cockatrices also fell along the waterfall. When their bodies sank into the river, they swallowed the contaminated water.\nThunder caimans were immune to Leo's touch. Thus, the contaminated water was nothing to them. However, land creatures like Tarantulas and cockatrices got infected by a mutating virus, and they squirmed in pain. After a few minutes of struggling, they became floating corpses on the river.\nAs Cat stopped eating random food, the corpses remained in the river for a while.\nAn hour later, a dozen mannequins from the recycling center arrived. They traveled along the river and trapped the corpses with logs and long sticks. Then, they pulled them to the shore. With determination, they carried everything back to the granaries.\nWhile they worked, thunder caimans attacked the mannequins. However, none of the monsters managed to damage the wooden dolls of Leo.\nA giant caiman swallowed one of the mannequins. Achieved a minor victory, It smiled and dove into the water.\nHowever, the mannequin tore through the caiman's stomach and emerged out from its back hole. After coming out, it swam and dragged the dead caiman back to the junkyard as it was pre-programmed.\nAfter the first batch of mannequins brought monsters and beasts back to the domain, the employees there noticed the commotion. They tried to help the mannequins, but all of them shook their heads, refusing their aid.\nMoreover, the dolls made a sign, warning the locals about the poisonous water.\nThat day, one of the mannequins put a radioactive symbol sign and a biohazard sign to warn the cultivators for the first time.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 184 – Viral Footage of Frightened Florida Man Running Away From Chasing Pastor Becomes New TikTok Challenge. Local Sheriff Warns Floridians to Avoid Pastors on Street Until Further Notice.\nAs the entire structure's power went down, Leo had no choice but to leave the arena. He exited the stage and found himself in a backstage hallway.\nThe long hallway was wide and tall enough for a T-Rex to set a parkour course here. But for Leo, it was a massive empty room. The dark hallway and monsters walking in the dark reminded Leo of a creepy-pasta legend, namely the backrooms.\nAssuming a fearless attitude, Leo strolled along the hallway, searching for an exit. His glowing green eyes shone like a will-o-wisp in the middle of the night. As he walked further, Leo sensed countless eyes watching him.\nThe backstage was usually a gathering place for local fighters and their disciples. Aliens formed groups of the same race like herds while they traveled through the backstage hallway.\nAs Leo was alone, he attracted a lot of attention, yet nobody sought trouble with him. In fact, they maintained a distance from him as if they were wary of this Nu'Earthe.\nLeo glanced around and sensed cautiousness in their eyes. As he had no time to bother with these aliens, he avoided them and left them alone.\nUnfortunately, not all races avoided Leo. A few groups challenged his eye contact.\nA hundred Fenrir werewolves occupied an area in front of a locker room, which was designated for their people. Unlike other races, they refused to wear clothes. A dozen wolves leaned on the wall and glared at Leo while the rest continued smoking like a group of teen gangsters.\nThe werewolves squatted and huddled, smoking something stinky. They puffed orange smoke in the air, but the vapor didn't float up. Instead, the smoke fell to the floor as if their particles were heavy.\nLooking at the smoke, Leo glanced at his feet. He still sensed a mild gravity force from the floor while he walked. He wondered if this place was a planet or an artificial star.\nAs soon as Leo looked away from the group of werewolves, the gang bore fangs and growled at Leo for a moment. However, Anuraku rushed out of the locker room and dragged his people inside.\nLeo smirked at the coward werewolf and shook his head. Since the wolves seemed to be afraid of something, Leo took this opportunity to proceed further.\nAs Leo kept going, he noticed another group of ethnic. While standing in the dark, their eyes transformed into silver-blue fireballs, floating in their eye sockets. They had sharp eyes, pointing upward. Aside from their eyes, ears, purple hair, and purple skin, they looked identical to humans. Most of them wore tight body suits, highlighting their figures and muscle curves.\nThe group consisted of five females and 30 males. The males had toned muscles and tall physique. Their average height was 6'6, which made them look thinner than usual.\nAs for the females, they had the perfect curves and figures that adult men fantasized for. Everything about them was perfect for a dream mother, except for their unusual height. The shortest one was about 6'3.\nAs Leo was a man of culture, he couldn't help but check on the bodies of these sexy humanoid aliens. Moreover, their tight body suits outlined their camel toes and mountain peaks, adding fuel to Leo's suppressed flame.\nFortunately, the men's suit killed Leo's boner as they also flexed their manhood. Looking at the banana outlines under their clothes, Leo wished he could bleach his eyes to forget the cursed view.\nAs Leo was about to mind his business and leave them be, a tall man from their group approached him.\nThe purple man put one hand on his chest and the other hand behind his back. With his legs closed, he bowed like a noble.\n\"Greetings, sir. Could I have a couple minutes of your time to talk about Lord Molg?\"\n\"Molg?\"\nThe name interested Leo. As Esen called herself the empress of the Molg Empire, he wondered if they were related to her.\n\"Tell me more.\"\nNoticing the enthusiasm in Leo's tone, the purple man was delighted. He raised his head, stood straight, and leaned backward. His expression was solemn while he introduced himself.\n\"My name is Orhan Mahabanana Schlong-Longlong. I'm an elder of Kutrish Planet, and I'm governing five moons. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Sir Florida Man.\"\nHis posture highlighted the bulky pants and the outline of his sword. The combination caught Leo off-guard, making him choke.\nLeo covered his mouth to suppress his laughter. He tried his best not to change his expression while he averted from the weird name subject.\n\"…You know me?\"\n\"Your previous fights left us astonished, sir. Oh, silly me. I'm supposed to introduce you to my companions, juniors, and the greatness of Lord Molg.\"\n\"…\"\nThe weird purple guy slowly introduced everybody in his group one after another. Instead of being brief, he narrated the deeds and achievements of his juniors and friends.\n30 minutes later, the introduction of the men was finally over. Leo almost died from suppressing his laughter due to their quirky names.\nMusa Rachanuts Ball-Blueblue\nHasim Peapenile Whitewater-Comecome\nAslan Graceliquid Pizboy-Peepee\nThe whole introduction process was torturous for Leo. He felt like the purple guy trolled him. Still, Leo believed that the system's translator did a poor job converting their proper names into Google-MTL insults, so he maintained his smile and continued to listen. However, his shoulders and lips trembled.\nThe names were too weird and immature. In normal circumstances, Leo wouldn't laugh at these childish jokes. However, Orhan telling their names while maintaining a serious face and pointing at their private parts made Leo lose it. Moreover, these guys bent their back backward, flexing their groin area, which made it worse.\nSeeing the wide smile on Leo's face, Orhan was overjoyed that Leo seemed friendly. He proceeded to introduce the girls next.\n\"Next is my daughter, Aisha Mahatetten Uraus-smolsmol.\"\n\"PFFT!\"\nThe woman behaved the same as the men, back-bending and highlighting her hump.\nLeo couldn't handle it anymore. He turned around, crouched, facepalmed, bit his arm, and cackled in his throat. He was in tears.\nThe culture shock was too much for Leo.\nA few seconds later, Leo turned around. He wiped his teardrops and brightly smiled, looking refreshed. He nodded at Aisha.\n\"Nice to meet you, young lady.\"\nOrhan kept on going. He pointed at the other girls, and they did the same as Aisha.\nLeo maintained his pokerface throughout the ordeal. When the introduction was over, he let out a long sigh of relief. He then confessed.\n\"Excuse me. I don't know anything about your culture. Is it normal to push your crotch closer to the other person you're speaking with?\"\nOrhan laughed, \"Of course. This is how we display our sincerity and trust in others. Lord Molg taught us that showing our reproductive organs to guests is the best way to break the ice and reveal everybody's hidden sides during a conversation.\"\n\"O-Oh.\"\nLeo couldn't deny that. He recalled how Esen reacted when they slept together naked. She behaved like a virgin maiden in romance stories, revealing her unexpected side. Vice versa, had a pretty sexy six-breasted woman stripped in front of Leo, he might have jumped her with no hesitation. On the other hand, had Esen tried to seduce Leo with her flat chest, he would have vomited.\n\"And, of course, we do this to get rid of embarrassment and shame. Our productive organs are what nature created for us so that we can conceive babies. It is wrong to be ashamed of showing one in public since it's just a part of our body!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo broke a sweat. This guy sounded crazier than Leo's fellow Floridians at home!\n\"This is Lord Molg's teaching, Sir Florida Man. Since you're such a respectable man, would you like to grant us an honor and be a part of us? Lord Molg and his apostles will surely welcome you with open legs.\"\n\"…I'd rather see them with open arms, not legs.\"\n\"It's the same, though?\"\n\"Anyway!\" Leo coughed and changed the subject, \"I'm so sorry. I'm an Atheist. God forbid, I don't think I can follow your culture and traditions.\"\n\"Oh, you don't have to worry about that,\" Orhan laughed. \"Even if you aren't interested in following Lord Molg, you can always be our friend.\"\nLeo was relieved. At least, this guy was reasonable.\nBut the next words of Orhan changed Leo's mind.\n\"Let's start by having you massage my daughter's hump first to get us closer. When you're comfortable, we can massage yours-\"\nLeo ran away without hesitation. These people were sick!\n\"WAIT! SIR FLORIDA MAN! DON'T RUN AWAY FROM OUR LOOOOOORD!\"\nOrhan tried to chase after Leo, but the latter was gone.\n.\nAfter ditching the weird cult, Leo found himself at a hotel district outside of the coliseum zone. He wiped his sweat and grumbled.\n\"This is what happens when liberals take over the world. Damn.\"\nLeo entered the closest hotel building to book a room to rest. Although the entire district also experienced a power outage, they still operated as if it wasn't an issue.\nHe prayed that he could get home soon. He had enough of this weird place.\n.\n.\nAt noon\nIt had been six hours since Leo had gone missing. Nobody had noticed it yet.\nAlthough Cat encountered the invaders from the Gorr Tribe, no men came to find the missing unit.\nOn the other hand, the domain gradually expanded as Xu Nuan and the tamer girls paid the northern lava field a visit. They flew over the field to check on the rumor badgers.\nThe lava badgers noticed the women's arrival. They waved their arms and danced.\n\"Badger!\"\n\"Badger!\"\nXu Nuan descended and hovered over the burning field. Despite the extreme temperature, she seemed unaffected.\n\"Hello, little friends. Want some food?\" Xu Nuan offered them yin cabbages from Leo's farm.\nThe badgers cheered and received them. After devouring everything, they waved their arms again.\n\"Badger!\"\n\"Badger!\"\nXu Nuan's disciples giggled as they found them funny. However, Xu Nuan didn't let her guard down since these little critters were stronger than they looked.\n\"I heard you were newborn 1st stage monsters, but I can only see 3rd stage. This growth rate is too fast for regular monsters.\"\nShe wished that Yao Qiqi was here with her so that the latter could practice their taming techniques on them. But since Xu Nuan came here with the other disciples, she had no choice but to let them try.\nThe group of young tamer girls stood on their flying swords while they approached the badgers. Mimicking Xu Nuan, they offered them yin cabbages to befriend them.\nSome of the badgers were full, and they denied the cabbages. Fortunately, a few accepted their gestures.\nThe girls quickly deployed a taming array around the creatures to connect their thoughts with them.\nA dozen circle formations appeared and quickly vanished. Everybody succeeded in connecting their thoughts with the designated monsters.\nOne of the lava badgers jumped into the arms of a tamer girl. The latter panicked. However, as soon as she caught the monster, she noticed that their lava physique didn't harm her.\nXu Nuan explained, \"When a creature is successfully tamed, you will gain some of their abilities and immunity. But be careful, though. Once your creature dies, you will lose that ability and immunity! Be sure to protect your pets and cherish them! Raise them as if you're raising your children!\"\nThe girls nodded. One of them jumped into the lava field and discovered that the moldy liquid could no longer burn her. She laughed and chased after other badgers, who also played with her.\nXu Nuan nodded in approval as these girls managed to grasp the basics. Still, she couldn't get rid of her worries.\n'How did these monsters grow so fast? What caused them to evolve? The lava shouldn't have enough fire Qi for all of them.'\nWhile Xu Nuan was deep in thought, one of the badgers sang.\n\"BADGER-BADGER-BADGER-BADGER-MUSHROOM-MUSHROOM!\"\n\"!?\"\nXu Nuan widened her eyes as soon as she heard it. She thought of the white tree that Leo had planted, south of the farmlands. There was also a protection array that Esen managed, which trapped the sweet dream mushrooms inside from spreading outside.\n\"M-Mushroom? D-Did they eat that?!\"",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 185 – Florida Man Called Cops to Offer Surrender Claiming He Abducted Alien Princess in His Dream\nXu Nuan and her disciples returned to Leo's domain. She also brought a dozen lava badgers with them so that the tamers could bond with them. However, that was not her only intention.\nShe brought everybody to the mysterious white tree that Leo and Esen had planted. The array still sealed the sweet dream mushrooms inside. Unfortunately, the mushrooms kept reproducing spores, creating a fog and blocking their vision.\nThe badgers twitched their noses as they sensed the delicious mushrooms. The critters drooled and sprinted toward the array barrier. Using their claws, they scratched the dome, but they failed to get inside.\nUpon realizing that it was impossible to get in, they turned their attention to the ground and started digging. But again, the array barrier extended to the subterrain. None of them could enter.\nThe badger whimpered. They turned around to look at their new masters with their puppy eyes.\nXu Nuan's disciples felt bad for these little monsters. They begged their master.\n\"Master, can we ask senior Florida Man if he could share the mushrooms with us? My pet told me that he needs it.\"\nXu Nuan sighed, \"I guess we have to go ask him. Come with me.\"\n.\nThe team brought everybody to the parking lot building as they planned to visit Leo at his battle bus. To show respect to Leo, they chose not to fly and land on top of the building. Instead, they entered the building and walked up the stairs.\nThe 7th floor of the parking lot building became a village of these young cultivators. As Leo's domain never encouraged competitions but field jobs, these former Life Sword Sect's disciples either trained or rested when they had free time. As a result, the environment was peaceful and quiet.\nWhen the girls passed by the floor, the boys all turned and gawked at them in silence. But when they saw Xu Nuan, they looked away.\nThe girls giggled as they found these young men quirky and funny. It had been a while since they lived in the same domain, but they still couldn't get used to their presence.\nUpon reaching the 8th floor, they found the lone bus at the corner. They gathered in front of the bus, and Xu Nuan knocked on the door. She then sent a voice transmission to the residents inside.\n\"This is Xu Nuan. I wish to seek an audience with senior Florida Man.\"\nA few minutes later, the door was open. Ivy came out to greet the visitors.\nThe blindfolded hooded girl turned left and right as if she could see through the black clothes. Upon sensing the cute monsters, Ivy smiled.\n\"How cute. Are they new employees?\"\nXu Nuan coughed, \"They're new pets of my disciples.\"\n\"How nice. Right, what business do you have with the Holy One, young lady?\"\n\"…\"\nXu Nuan blushed. Most people called her grandma or aunt, but nobody called her \"Young Lady\" anymore. Being praised as a young lady made her embarrassed.\nStill, Xu Nuan recovered her senses instantly. She realized that Ivy's real age might be a lot older than her since she treated her as a junior.\nXu Nuan minded her manner and lowered her head, \"We would like to request a few sweet dream mushrooms to feed these pets.\"\n\"Sweet dream mushrooms?\" Ivy frowned, \"My master and Holy One said that the mushrooms are poisonous to mortals. If you eat it, you will die. Only we, the undead, can consume those. Also, there are True Death Mushrooms in there. Even my master and I aren't capable of consuming those.\"\nIvy was concerned about the mutated mushrooms that Leo secretly cultivated. Esen and her colleagues once inspected the true death mushrooms and discovered that they could disintegrate their souls. Thus, they had been avoiding the true death mushrooms and keeping the array sealed. Only Leo could enter and leave as he wished.\n\"I know. But these creatures seem confident.\"\nAs if the badgers understood Xu Nuan's words, they puffed their chest and waved their arms up and down.\n\"Badger-Badger Mushroom-Mushroom!\"\n\"…\"\nIvy gave the badgers a meaningful look. She raised her finger, \"Give me a moment. I'll go ask my master.\"\n\"Many thanks.\"\n.\nA few minutes later, Esen, Beatrice, Marc, and Ivy came out. Everybody dressed in black suits that the clothing store mannequin had supplied them. As usual, the three subordinates of Esen wore black blindfolded clothes.\nEsen swept her eyes and glanced at the lava badgers. The creatures flinched. Afraid of Esen's death glare and her suppressive aura, they hid behind their masters.\nThe disciples also trembled in fright as Esen still maintained her aura as a quasi-immortal. They could barely breathe and stand on two legs.\nEsen looked at the shaking girls and realized her mistake. She suppressed her aura.\nThe girls were relieved. They fell on their knees and broke a cold sweat.\n\"What's up, human?\" Esen turned to Xu Nuan next.\nXu Nuan coughed and retold what she had said to Ivy.\nEsen pursed her lips. She gave the badgers a meaningful look, walked toward the nearest creature, and picked one up. She brought it closer to her face and sniffed at it.\n\"You stink. Are you a skunk or a badger? Pick one.\"\nThe badger squealed in fright. It waved its arms and legs, trying to break free.\nEsen put it down and gestured for Xu Nuan and others to follow her, \"Come along. Since you ask for it, I'll test one on them. If they can eat sweet dream mushrooms and survive the mutation, I'll keep feeding them. But if they accidentally eat True Death Mushroom, you can say goodbye to them. Even I can't eat those.\"\nXu Nuan and the girls gulped, wondering what kind of poisonous mushroom Leo was cultivating.\nThe group flew to the white tree array to check on the mushrooms and experiment on the badgers next.\n.\n.\nSouth of Leo's Domain\nThe Gorr Tribe finished demolishing useless buildings and integrated the Frozen Fire City as their new home. The men repaired and rebuilt array towers to defend against potential raiders and local cultivators.\nMany dispatched teams also returned after a brief scouting. They rushed to see Qiang Baidu to report their findings. A few teams brought back war trophies, such as women, slaves, essence stones, spirit stones, and storage rings. Then, they gave everything to their leader as tribute.\nQiang Baidu was pleased with the progress. He ordered the men to keep young women as their seedbeds and kill all other prisoners, including children and elders.\nBlood spilled in Qiang Baidu's throne room. Women screamed in desperation as the four-armed men dragged them to their new dens.\nEverything went according to his plan, except the one variable. Qiang Baidu walked out of his castle and gazed toward the north.\nHe still had no clue who Florida Man was.\n'I sent a team to scout the north, but they haven't come back yet. Should I dispatch troops to check it out?'\nAs everything about Florida Man was mysterious, Qiang Baidu chose to play it safe. Instead of sending large troops to attack Leo's domain to the north, he called one of his best generals to visit him.\nLate afternoon, a female mutant arrived. Her figure was as sexy as a Japanese gravure model, but she had four arms like them. In addition, she had two pairs of breasts instead of one, and her skin was green.\nThe mutant put on a new dress, which she had stolen from the local commoner's cloth shop. Her pink robes fluttered as if she was a fairy.\n\"Sister, you're here.\"\nThe woman was Qiang Qiang. She was the princess of the Gorr Tribe, and she was also a quasi-immortal like her brother.\n\"What are you calling me for? Are you bored?\" Qiang Qiang grumbled as her brother interrupted her shopping spree. She hadn't plundered enough clothes.\n\"I want you to bring your team north. The prisoners said Magpie City of Life Sword Sect was there. Go and destroy it for me. Also, if you run into the team that I sent earlier, drag them here. They have been slacking.\"\n\"Oh? I'm a vanguard this time?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Sweet! Do you mind if I claim the whole city as my own? I need more clothes!\"\n\"Suit yourself. I have a second order, though. I want you to find out about Florida Man. The Magpie City should be close to that guy's domain. They should know something.\"\nQiang Qiang raised her eyebrows as she was surprised. As Qiang Baidu was usually cautious when he dealt with strong foes, she realized that the rumored man might be the toughest opponent that they had to face soon.\nHer expression turned solemn, \"Alright. I'll gather information for you.\"\n\"Good. Be sure to hurry back. I have a bad feeling about this.\"\nQiang Qiang nodded and rushed to her barrack.\nAfter leaving her brother, Qiang Qiang gathered her troops. Instead of bringing a small team with her, she rallied 1,000 soul formation and 500 soul transformation mutants with her. The unit flew north, heading straight toward Leo's domain.\n.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nHigh above the clouds, Qiang Qiang and her 1,500 men headed north without looking below.\nQiang Qiang's troops were experienced in siege warfare and wars. Flying above the clouds and hiding their presence were their favorite tactic. Using this method to approach their enemies, they could launch a surprise attack on any city, sect, and dens undetected.\nWithout realizing it, they bypassed Cat's line of defense. They flew over the canyon river and got close to the mystic realm platform of Leo. They were one kilometer away from the platform.\nQiang Qiang remained vigilant. She raised her fist, signaling her troops to stop going further.\n\"Our objective is the Magpie City, not the domain of the mysterious guy. We'll detour around it and launch a surprise attack on the Life Sword Sect. After that, we'll retreat before that guy launches a counterattack.\"\nThe men saluted and flew away from the flying platform. Qiang Qiang acted as a rearguard and followed after her troops.\nWhile Qiang Qiang retreated, the black-winged statue's eyes moved. He glared at the mutants for a moment before he fixated his sight on the woman.\nThe statue \"Meowmeow\" licked his lips while the three women statues around him frowned at their husband.\nMeanwhile, the other two statues shook their head. The giant wolf rolled his eyes while the \"Cathulhu\" statue snickered.\n\"We will watch over the domain, munya. Meowmeow, you go and have fun. Be sure to come back before master returns, munya.\"\nMeowmeow gave the Cathulhu a thumbs up.\n\"I'll be right back, Mu-Nyang.\"\n\"It's MUNYA, not MUNYANG!\"\n\"It sounds the same. Anyway, peace out!\"\nWHOOSH\nThe black-winged angel statue vanished, leaving his three wives behind.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo was still trapped in the stadium city.\nAfter running away from the sicko alien cultists, Leo returned to the hotel and took a break. He lay on his bed and tried to get some sleep.\nWIGGLE\nSuddenly, his thighs and groined got itchy. His shadow under him moved by itself. However, the darkness hid the shadow's movements.\nLeo failed to detect the moving shadows. He fell asleep. However, he had a weird dream.\nHe dreamed that he had become a black-winged angel, and he had been following a hostile sexy four-breast woman. At first, he let the body move around by instinct. A minute later, Leo remembered that he was dreaming.\nAware of the lucid dream, Leo got bolder. He rushed toward the sexy four-arm-four-breast woman and groped her. Using his superior physique and strength, he dragged her away from the others.\nWhile Leo dreamed, his shadows moved on the wall, displaying the exact scene in his dream. The angel caught the woman and covered her mouth. The next moment, the two shadows returned to Leo as if nothing had happened.\nThe tranquility of silent night was broken by the graceful pitched tent. The wet tent and his satisfied smile revealed the mission accomplished.\nSeveral hours later, Leo woke up and discovered his misdeed. He screamed and smacked his forehead, ashamed of himself. He then spent an hour, washing his pants and underwear.\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nThe black-winged angel returned to the platform after a quick deed. He also brought back another statue with him.\nThe new statue was a four-armed woman with four milkers. Like the others, she had no clothes on.\nThe Cathulhu and Fenrir statues leered at their colleagues. The latter scoffed in disgust.\n\"Another one, woof?\"\nMeowmeow dragged the new captive and put her on his lap. He nodded in confirmation.\n\"Yes. Another one.\"\n\"Does master know, munya?\"\n\"He controlled me earlier and temporarily robbed me of five senses. I don't think he's aware of his power, though.\"\n\"…\"\nThe guardians stared at the victim, who was turned into a fellow statue. Although she was just converted, the mutant statue seemed lifeless.\n\"What about her soul, munya?\"\n\"Devoured. Deader than dead. She's inside our master, now.\"\n\"Ah, so what are you going to do with that soulless doll, munya?\"\n\"What else? Returning her to our master, of course!\"\nHearing the plan, the wolf and the cat snickered. They looked forward to seeing Leo's reaction.",

NOW!\" Said Grandma to Grandpa During the Ceremony.\nA minute earlier\nAfter ordering her men to detour around the mystic realm platform, Qiang Qiang followed her troops as a rearguard. While retreating, she stared at the floating island without blinking, making sure nothing escaped her sight.\nSuddenly, a strong wind blew, and a speck of dust entered her eyes. She blinked once.\nWHOOSH\nSomething vanished from her vision. She frowned and rechecked the platform.\n'No one is there. Just statues.'\nAs the floating island was far away, she couldn't remember everything she had seen earlier. She didn't notice that there were three statues instead of two.\nUnable to detect the anomaly, Qiang Qiang flew backward, following after her companions. As her back faced her subordinates, she didn't notice that an extra person was behind her.\nAfter flying further away from the island, Qiang Qiang turned around.\nWHOOSH\nAgain, the mysterious person vanished before she could even detect him.\nWing blew against her face again. Qiang Qiang disregarded it as natural wind as she was above the clouds, and she didn't notice a lurking shadowy figure behind her.\nWIGGLE\nThe shadow stalked closer to Qiang Qiang every second.\n\"We're here, Lady Qiang!\" One of the troops turned around and reported their arrival. Then, he noticed the shadow figure behind Qiang Qiang.\nHis eyes met with the shadow's eyes. The corners of the shadow's mouth curved up into a crescent moon as he struck the target. He extended his hands and groped Qiang Qiang from behind.\n\"!!!\"\nQiang Qiang widened her eyes. She opened her mouth and was about to scream. That was when the shadow's left hand covered her mouth.\n\"WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!\"\nThe underling of Qiang Qiang shouted while he rushed to save his leader.\nThe shadow's expression turned solemn. His entire body transformed into a liquid and swallowed Qiang Qiang. When the woman was covered in black fluid, the shadow vanished into the clouds.\n\"CHASE!\"\nThe men followed after the shadow into the clouds. All troops roared and summoned their dao avatars. 1,500 spirits manifested and transformed a 1500-man unit into a 3000-man unit.\nBut as soon as they entered the white clouds, they lost sight of the shadow. They accidentally descended lower the clouds and found no one.\nNone of them noticed the wiggling movements on the ground. Below the mutants was the Magpie City. Hiding in the shade of the city wall was the mass of black liquid.\nStrange fluid entered Qiang Qiang's orifices and melted her clothes. It only took seconds before the cancerous cells of the shadow took over her entire body.\nHowever, a quasi-immortal couldn't be killed that easily. After losing her body, Qiang Qiang's soul attempted to break free from the vessel. Her spirit ejected from her fleshly body.\nShe managed to get her head out of the black mass. But as soon as she came out, a rainbow humanoid spirit also emerged from the black liquid slime and hugged her from behind.\nQiang Qiang looked back and found the assailant's face. He was a handsome Caucasian man with a refined jawline and toned muscles. Like her, he was in his spiritual form, and they were both naked.\nThe unknown man grabbed her head and her shoulder. Without saying anything, he put her inside his spiritual physique.\n\"!!!\"\nQiang Qiang extended her spiritual arm to escape from the mysterious rainbow guy. However, the sensation of tranquility, quietness, and numbness overwhelmed her. For an unknown reason, she felt at peace.\nHer consciousness shut down. She fell asleep while her soul got stuck inside the unknown spirit's physique. Her age rapidly regressed until she was reduced to an embryo.\nThe rainbow man smiled and returned to the black liquid mass. When the Caucasian man's spirit disappeared, the water slime vanished.\nThe next moment, it reappeared on the mystic realm platform as the black-winged angel and the new woman statue. The rest was history.\n.\n.\nLeading the unit in Qiang Qiang's stead was her fiancé, Dugu Ying.\nDugu Ying was a mutant like Qiang Baidu and Qiang Qiang, except he had a wide mouth full of fangs without lips. If he shaved his hair, he would look like Baraka from Mortal Kombat Series. Fortunately, he wore a ninja-like helmet and a face mask, covering his heinous face.\nHe was only a soul transformation mutant, but he killed many 8th-stage monsters and a 9th-stage monster before. In terms of strength, experience, and foundation, he was as strong as 10 quasi-immortals.\nThe sudden ambush angered Dugu Ying. He bellowed and gave his troops a new order.\n\"Search for that bastard! Kill everybody in the city and flush him out!\"\nThe men shouted and charged toward the city below.\n.\nMagpie City was once the territory of Hua Jiashan and his Life Sword Sect. Although the sect merged with Leo's domain, cultivators and commoners still lived there as if the sect still existed.\nThis day was Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei's day off. They visited the sect to reminisce on old memories and cleaned the buildings.\nThe two elders laughed as they chatted about the naughty deeds they had done when they studied under Tang Tian and Tang Xuan. For hours, they never stopped talking until they arrived at a lone plum blossom tree in an elder's courtyard.\nThis place was where Hua Jiashan met Dongfang Mei for the first time. Looking at the pink tree, Hua Jiashan bitterly smiled. He confessed.\n\"You know, Mei.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"I always had a crush on you when I was young. I still do, actually.\"\n\"…Oh, my.\" Dongfang Mei giggled, \"Have you finally mustered your courage after all these years?\"\nHer reaction wasn't within Hua Jiashan's expectations. His face reddened.\n\"Ahem! What do you mean by all these years?\"\n\"Stupid old man. Your face and eyes gave it away. I always knew you had a feeling for me.\"\n\"!!!\"\nDongfang Mei cheerfully laughed, \"Why do you think I always rejected suitors? Dense fool, I was waiting for you, but you never opened up for me.\"\n\"W-Wait, what?!\"\nHua Jiashan was so shocked that he knelt in front of Dongfang Mei's wheelchair.\n\"R-Really? All this time, you were waiting for me?!\"\n\"Aiya. Think of my status. I had to break ties with my parents so that I could be with you. But you silly idiot suddenly went missing after the sweet dream mushroom incident! I thought you died, and I even mourned for you!\"\nDongfang Mei smacked Hua Jiashan's head with her fist. The latter yelped and shed a tear of regret and joy.\nThe old woman's eyes were also moist. She leaned closer to Hua Jiashan and touched his cheeks.\n\"Old fool, when I heard that you were alive and succeeded the Sword Saint, I rushed here to see you. At the ascension ceremony when you succeeded the sect master title, I tried to talk to you, but you kept pushing me away. Do you know that I cried for days because I thought you had a new dao companion?\"\n\"Err… I never marry though.\"\n\"Exactly! I was stupid, too. I thought you married Sword Saint's daughter, so I stopped thinking about you. And now… you confess to me.\"\n\"…\"\nThe elders bitterly smiled and gazed into each other's eyes. Hua Jiashan stood up and embraced Dongfang Mei.\n\"I'm sorry, Mei. I kept you waiting.\"\n\"Umm.\"\n\"Marry me, Mei?\"\nA tear dropped from Dongfang Mei's eyes. She admired Hua Jiashan's wrinkled face and stroked his right ear. Then, she slightly nodded.\n\"I want seven kids.\"\n\"What the hell?!\" Hua Jiashan was taken aback, \"You sound like women at brothels!\"\n\"FIVE FREAKING HUNDRED YEARS I'VE BEEN PROTECTING MY VIRGINITY FOR YOU! I DREAM OF BEARING YOUR CHILDREN AND HAVING A FAMILY WITH YOU! I WANT YOUR SEED! BED, SEX, NOW!\"\n\"AAAAAH!!\"\nDongfang Mei suddenly summoned her dao avatar. A giant spirit of a graceful woman emerged and dragged Hua Jiashan into a building. After throwing the old man into an empty room, the avatar merged with Dongfang Mei.\nThe old lady reverted into a charming young lady in her 20s. She strode while she moved her hips, seducing the old swordsman.\nHua Jiashan remembered Dongfang Mei in her prime. He dropped his jaw as his youthful instinct was resurrected.\n\"…You're as beautiful as ever.\"\n\"SHUT IT! OFF WITH YOUR PANTS! WE ARE WEDDING, RIGHT NOW!\"\n\"AAAAAHHHH!!\"\nAlthough Hua Jiashan moaned, he didn't resist Dongfang Mei's approach. Instead, he smiled as he loved this sexually aggressive childhood friend with all his heart.\nBOOM\nUnfortunately, before they could seal the deal, an explosion erupted nearby.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei's faces turned dark. They frowned for a moment and looked at each other.\n\"Continue or go out?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\n\"Tsk. It's close. Let's go check it out.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"But remember, SEVEN KIDS!\"\n\"…\"\n.\nBoth elders put back their clothes and rushed outside to see the commotion. As soon as they came out, they found the army of invaders. As the invaders emitted killing intent and Qi, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei discovered their cultivation base.\n\"Soul transformation and soul formation cultivators?!\" Dongfang Mei gasped.\n\"Those are not ordinary cultivators! They're demonic cultivators!\" Hua Jiashan pointed out the four arms that they had.\nHua Jiashan summoned his dao avatar and merged with it. His age instantly regressed, and his appearance reverted to a long-haired handsome youth. His white robes and long sword glittered, emitting the white aura of a sword saint's disciple. As for Dongfang Mei, she already transformed.\nAlthough both elders were cultivators who trained in a different martial art style, they pulled out rifles and sacred wood bullets from their spatial rings. Their nimble hands loaded a bullet into the rifle's chamber and closed the breech. They took aim in unison.\nTheir targets were two soul transformation cultivators. Their fingers injected Qi into the shell and pulled the trigger.\nBANG\nBANG\nA loud gunshot mixed with the sound of an explosion nearby. Two flashing yellow needles shuttled through the sky and pierced the two soul-transformation mutants from below. One bullet blasted out the innards of a mutant while the other entered through another mutant's crotch and exited through his head.\nThe couple elders didn't bother admiring the result. They reloaded another ammo and aimed at other mutants.\nBANG\nBANG\nOne shot, one down. Two shots claimed two additional lives.\n.\nDugu Ying swept his eyes across the Magpie City. He ordered his men to bombard it to the ground.\nMutants unleashed their skills. Fireballs appeared in the sky and descended upon the town. The first target was the structures of the Life Sword Sect, where Dugu Ying suspected that the assailant might be in hiding.\nBOOM\nA disciple dorm exploded. However, nobody reacted.\nDugu Ying narrowed his eyes. He made a new order.\n\"I want ten platoons to attack the sect. As for the rest, kill every commoner and townsman!\"\nA thousand men rushed toward the Life Sword Sect while the other 500 flew toward the city, where the commoner lived.\nBut as soon as Dugu Ying commanded his men, changes occurred in the city. Two cultivators flew out and carried their trademark weapons.\nTang Xuan and Tang Tian appeared. Below them, the people of Tang Clan erected a dome shield to protect the townsmen.\nTang Xuan, as a quasi-immortal, was never afraid of soul transformation mutants. He shouted while he summoned his dao avatar.\nPurple fog emerged, enveloping the entire Magpie City. Some of it also transformed into a purple mist dragon, baring fangs at the intruders.\nTang Tian brandished two of his purple swords. Behind him, five hundred clones of himself manifested from the purple fog that his father created, holding similar weapons.\nThe two Tangs glared at the intruders and shouted at them.\n\"WHO DARES HARM THE COMMONER OF MAGPIE CITY?!\"\nDugu Ying flinched as he noticed the aura of Tang Xuan. But as he realized that Tang Xuan was the only quasi-immortal there, he believed he still had a chance to kill him.\nThe mutant bellowed back.\n\"BOOTLICKERS OF YAN EMPIRE, RETURN MY WIFE OR DIE HERE!\"\n\"IMPUDENCE!\" Tang Xuan snorted and charged toward Dugu Ying.\nDugu Ying sneered. He flew backward and pushed his four arms forward.\nBANG\nBANG\nSuddenly, two gunshots echoed, followed by two yellowish flashes of something small shuttling through the sky. Then, two of Dugu Ying fell.\n\"What?!\"\nBecause of the distraction, Dugu Ying looked away from Tang Xuan.\nTang Xuan smirked, \"Pay attention, brat!\"\nBOOM\nTang Xuan instantly teleported and appeared behind Dugu Ying. A purple fist found the latter's spine.\nCRACK",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 187 – Florida Elder Gunned Down Flash Mob Looters Attempting to Ransack His Store. \"Welcome to Florida, Suckers!\" Said Elder during the Interview\nBANG\nBANG\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei kept shooting the mutants in the sky. Unfortunately, they only had two guns. After firing the third shot, the mutants found them.\n\"OVER THERE!\" One of the four-armed tribesmen pointed at the couple.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei kicked the ground in unison. As their cultivation base was weaker than their foes, they chose to rely on the godly weapons of Leo and kept their distance.\nThe elders flew backward, kiting the pursuers. While flying, they aimed and pulled the trigger.\nEvery bullet coming out of the muzzles claimed at least one life. The fourth shot of Dongfang Mei penetrated through the vanguard mutant and accidentally blasted another mutant's head. Only then, does the bullet lose its momentum.\nAlthough the firepower was amazing, the couple had no time to admire their artifact. They allocated 90% of their Qi to accelerate their flight speed.\nThe pursuers knew they were stronger than the duo. They also accelerated to get into their attack range. Little by little, they got closer to Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei.\n\"Jiashan! To the domain! We can ask for the guardian's help!\" Suggested Dongfang Mei.\nHua Jiashan nodded without looking at her. The couple changed their flight course, heading east.\n\"YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY!\"\nOne of the mutants reacted to their movements. Although he hadn't caught up with the duo yet, he threw his axe to intercept their flight course. The axe then transformed into a burning flame wheel.\nSensing the pending crisis, Hua Jiashan reverted to his roots. While aiming his rifle at the assailant, he ejected a flying sword from his spatial ring along with his sword dao avatar.\nThe spirit merged with his sword, transforming it into one energy blade. It swung at the flame wheel.\nUpon contact, the wheel and the energy sword exploded. However, the wheel blasted through the sword.\nThe mutant scoffed at the duo.\n\"FOOL! Do you think weaklings like you can block a strike from a soul transformation cultivator like me?! DIE!\"\nThe mutant bellowed and controlled the flame wheel toward Hua Jiashan.\nHua Jiashan widened his eyes and raised his arms to block the attack.\nBOOM\nIt was a direct hit. The wheel continued rotating, slashing Hua Jiashan's arms a thousand times.\n\"JIASHAN!\"\nDongfang Mei rushed in and kicked the wheel away. She then turned to look at her husband-to-be.\n\"Huh?\"\nHua Jiashan blankly gazed at his arms as not a scratch was left behind on his body. He looked at the black suit that he had been wearing.\nBlack suits, white collar shirts, long pants, leather shoes, and white socks were the new uniform of Leo's domain. The latter forced everybody to get their clothes from the clothing store, and nobody could leave the domain without wearing one.\n\"How am I alive?\" Hua Jiashan laughed.\nSeeing how Hua Jiashan survived a soul transformation cultivator's attack unharmed, she gained inspiration. Instead of continuing to run, she reloaded her rifle with Leo's essence stone. Then, she aimed at the axe-wielding mutant.\nShe pulled the trigger. But instead of firing a regular bullet, she unleashed a beam cannon at the crowd of mutants.\nBOOM\nA yellow lightning beam devoured seven mutants in its path, including the Axeman earlier, vaporizing them to smoke.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHua Jiashan surviving the strike already baffled the Gorr Tribesmen, but the sudden beam attack shocked them.\nSeeing the result of her weapon, Dongfang Mei advised her darling.\n\"Jiashan, mix in essence stone bullets with the regular ones! Invest your essence stones and spirit stones!\"\n\"But that's my cultivation resource and money!\"\n\"What's the point of having those after you die? If you can use them to kill soul transformation cultivators, use them!\"\n\"Dammit!\"\nHua Jiashan loaded a spirit stone into his rifle. He injected his Qi into the chamber and pulled the trigger.\nBOOM\nThe firepower was 90% weaker than the yellow lightning beam. However, it punctured through a soul transformation mutant, whose body had merged with his dao avatar. His body and soul perished together.\nMoreover, Hua Jiashan received feedback from the bullet, and he could control it. As he had mastered the art of flying sword, he realized the bullet acted the same way as a flying sword.\nTesting the water, Hua Jiashan waved his finger like how he controlled his dao avatar sword.\nWHOOSH\nThe bullet moved as Hua Jiashan wished. Although it was already far away, he could still order it to turn around and fly toward another mutant. Unfortunately, the spirit stone bullet quickly lost its momentum and fell to the ground.\nThe experiment was enough for Hua Jiashan to come up with a new technique. He loaded another spirit stone into his rifle chamber and took aim while he flew backward.\nWHOOSH-SWISH\nAfter applying the flying sword technique to the bullet, it became a homing and penetrating round. The bullet head pierced through a mutant's heart. Then, it curved into another mutant's head. Once the skull and brain shattered, the bullet went pursued the nearest target.\nHua Jiashan burst into laughter while he loaded another spirit stone. He loved this rifle and his new skill.\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?! SCATTER!\"\nThe mutants panicked as none of them could defend or dodge the bullet. By the time the bullet lost its momentum, another flew toward them.\nBOOM\nThat was not all. Dongfang Mei never stopped unleashing hell upon them. While retreating, she blasted another yellow lightning beam toward the crowd.\nThe former Amazonian Sanctuary master was not without skills either. Seeing how Hua Jiashan used spirit stones as bullets and applied his technique to them, Dongfang Mei also applied a forbidden technique that she could never use on her tamed beasts and monsters.\nInstead of shooting a beam, she fired the essence stone round as a regular bullet. However, there was a deadly effect.\n\"DETONATION!\"\nIt was a suicide bomb technique. But in this case, Dongfang Mei ordered the essence stone to explode when it reached the crowded area in the sky.\nA yellowish flash of explosion engulfed 30 soul transformation mutants at once. The radius of the blast covered only 200 meters, but all lifeform inside instantly turned into stones. The 30 stoned mutants fell to the ground and shattered to pieces upon impact.\n\"W-WHAT ARE THESE CULTIVATORS?! WHAT ARE THOSE WEAPONS?!\"\nWitnessing unknown weapons of destruction at work destroyed their willpower. Half of the mutants fled while the others were frozen in fear.\nAs they stopped pursuing Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei, both elders disengaged and fled to Leo's domain to call for help.\nWhile retreating, Hua Jiashan mocked the mutants.\n\"WELCOME TO FLORIDA, SUCKERS! HAHAHAHA!\"\n.\n.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nAbove Magpie City, Tang Xuan leisurely fought the invaders. After destroying Dugu Ying's spinal cord, he threw the guy to Tang Tian. Then, he crushed a purple pill, which summoned a purple mist.\nPurple mist summoning pill was Tang Xuan's signature product as his dao and combat techniques synergized with the pills. When pills manifested, his dao avatar merged with the clouds and transformed into a hundred humanoid fog spirits. The poisonous clouds rushed toward the invaders.\nFour-armed mutants flung their weapons and fists against the mists, but they failed to destroy or disperse them. Instead, the mist entered their bodies and corroded them from the inside.\nOne after another, Gorr Tribesmen's mouths foamed, and their skins turned purple. A few seconds later, their bodies dried up. As the wind blew, their bodies dispersed into purple dust.\nUnfortunately, this technique couldn't kill their souls. The tribesmen's souls ejected from their bodies and fled back to base.\nTang Xuan didn't bother pursuing the fleeing souls. He focused on killing active tribesmen before they could harm the innocent civilians in the city.\nFive minutes into the chaotic fight, half of Dugu Ying's troops died. The rest realized that they weren't Tang Xuan's match, and they promptly retreated.\nTang Xuan floated alone in the sky above Magpie City. He crossed his arms and snorted.\n\"Damn demons. They haven't learned, have they?\"\nTang Xuan was relieved that he brought his clan members and his family to Magpie City before the raid. Although it took him a while to convince everybody to join him, he managed to bring them here, hoping to surrender to Leo and establish their new headquarters in his domain. Then, his clansmen ran into the Gorr Tribesmen by chance and got entangled in this fight.\nAfter driving the intruders away, Tang Xuan descended and removed the array barrier around the city. He came down and suppressed his aura and Qi so that the people wouldn't be too uncomfortable.\n\"It's done.\" Tang Xuan relayed news to Tang Tian and the commoners of this city.\nHearing the good news, the commoners in the city cheered and celebrated. Many old farmers and children came out from hiding and kowtowed to the Tang clan members.\n\"Thank you, immortals! Thank you!\"\n\"We were worried because the Life Sword Sect migrated east. Thank you, Lord Immortals!\"\nMany clansmen dryly laughed as they didn't contribute anything to the fight. On the other hand, Tang Xuan refused to take the credit.\n\"It was nothing. As a cultivator, my job is to protect the weak from selfish cultivators… like them.\"\nThe crowd cheered louder as they loved Tang Xuan's demeanor and promise.\nTang Xuan raised his hands and gestured for the crowd to stop getting too excited.\n\"The situation is under control. All non-combatants should go home and reunite with their families. We'll mop up the battle and clean the bodies.\"\nAgain, the commoners never stopped cheering and praising Tang Xuan. They pestered the Tang clansmen for hours.\nMeanwhile, Tang Tian and his men silently dragged the demon cultivator Dugu Ying to their courtyard. They destroyed his meridians and crippled his dantian. Then, the men started interrogating the guy.\nWhile Tang Xuan worked as the clan's spokesman and poster boy, Tang Tian took on a dirty job. He tortured Dugu Ying for an hour and extracted some information from him.\nAfter getting enough information, Tang Tian killed Dugu Ying and crushed his soul.\n.\n.\nAt night, Tang Xuan, Tang Tian, and their people finished collecting spatial rings and weapons from the dead mutants. They crushed the stone corpses until none of them resembled a human so that the townsmen wouldn't be frightened by them.\nIn the middle of the city, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian gathered inside a courtyard house. They put all spatial rings on the table to filter the loot.\nTang Xuan didn't say anything. He focused on eliminating the remnant Qi of the ring owners, unlocking the rings. He collected useful spirit stones and essence stones in one of his storage rings. As for clothes, weapons, food, pills, and random items, he poured them out so that Tang Tian could sort them.\nTang Tian grumbled while he sat on the floor, sorting weapons and pills from the pile of trash. He kept doing it under their room was full of spiritual weapons.\n\"Father, what are we gonna do with these? It's not like we can use them, right?\"\nTang Xuan smirked, \"Tributes.\"\n\"Tribute?\"\n\"Yes. We're planning to migrate to Florida Man's territory, so we need to prepare the right gifts for him. To be honest with you, I had trouble finding the right tribute for Florida Man. Those people came at a good time.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Tian pursed his lips. He thought of the prisoner that they had captured earlier.\n\"Say, father.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"About intel that we got from that prisoner, should we inform Florida Man, too?\"\nTang Tian already squeezed information from Dugu Ying and learned about the Gorr Tribe's objectives. Though, they were surprised that their leader was an immortal, and many quasi-immortals were among their ranks.\nTang Xuan had already heard everything from Tang Tian. He let out a long sigh.\n\"This is not a battle that we can fight alone. Although it's disgraceful, we need to rely on him.\"\n\"What if he doesn't want to be involved in this mess?\"\nTang Xuan snickered, \"I doubt he will ignore us and the commoners of the Yan Continent.\"\n\"How so?\"\nTang Xuan flickered an essence stone toward his son.\n\"Florida Man is a businessman. He seeks life force, not material wealth.\"\n\"Life force?\"\n\"Yes. Life force.\"\n\"Then, why…oh.\"\nTang Xuan laughed. He poked Tang Tian's forehead.\n\"That's right, stupid Tian'er. I met him, and I learned enough about his personality. He doesn't senselessly rob people's lifespans unprovoked. He will definitely offer us some of his artifacts in exchange for our LIFE FORCE! He wants CUSTOMERS!\"\n\"???\"\nTang Tian was still confused. He tilted his head, wondering how his father was so sure about it.",

      "content": "﻿\nChapter 188 – Drunk Florida Man Wrestled with Stray Cat Using WWE Moves, Discovered Cat Was Actually Adult Man Cosplaying as Tiger, Got RKOed and Sent Home.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei rushed to the store. As soon as they arrived, they sent mental messages to everybody in the area.\n\"We're under attack! Elders, bring your weapons! Disciples, gather and hide in the main building!\"\nAll workers froze when they heard the unexpected news. Male young disciples left the farms and their vans, sprinting toward the main store building. The girls also relayed the messages to the thunder unicorns and nightmares, telling them about the incoming crisis.\nTaxi and Ricardo moved. The former gathered 50 9th-stage thunder unicorns around the store to protect the youngsters. On the other hand, Ricardo and his nightmare platoon took flight, floating in mid-air and getting ready for combat.\nDongfang Mei reverted to her usual appearance so that her people could recognize her. As she had left behind her favorite wheelchair at the Life Sword Sect's courtyard, Dongfang Mei straightened her back and endured the back pain, flying toward the main store building to meet Xu Nuan and others.\nHua Jiashan also searched for Wu Buyi, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman to get them ready.\nThe swordsmen trio reacted as Hua Jiashan had expected. They brought their new weapons along and met up with Hua Jiashan in the sky.\n\"Sect master? What happened?\" Asked Han Hao.\n\"Demon cultivators! They attacked Magpie City just now.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nThe trio was shocked. Their small city had never been attacked seriously as there was nothing for invaders to gain except their small sect's treasures. Even Death Sword Sect, which always bullied and humiliated them, never really tried to take over the city.\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman hesitated for a moment. But when they gazed at Hua Jiashan's black suit, they started laughing.\n\"What? Why are you laughing?\"\n\"Sect master, you see.\" Han Hao smacked the back of Han Meng's head to stop him from laughing. He explained. \"You forgot that Lord Florida Man's cloth armor can't be destroyed by anybody under the immortal rank, right?\"\n\"Huh?\" Hua Jiashan frowned. Then, he remembered that he got hit by a flame wheel earlier, and he came out unharmed.\nHan Hao pointed at their clothes, which looked the same as Hua Jiashan's black suit. Then, he pointed at everybody around him.\n\"Look, sect master. We all are wearing the same uniform, including our disciples. I don't think we are in danger.\"\n\"But what if we get hit in the head?\"\n\"Well, if they're that accurate, we're dead.\"\n\"See? We shouldn't get cocky because we have invincible cloth armor!\"\nAlthough Hua Jiashan's words made sense, Han Hao and others seemed relaxed. They brought out their guns.\n\"But we have these, right?\" Han Meng brightly grinned.\n\"We can just keep our distance and shoot them from far away, sect master.\" Tiger Swordsman suggested.\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan thought back to his previous fight against the mutants. Then, he realized that he was never in danger. Realizing how panicked he was, Hua Jiashan smacked his forehead.\n\"I guess I'm old.\"\nHan Hao laughed and patted Hua Jiashan's shoulder, \"Relax, sect master. Have you forgotten how many strong backers Lord Florida has? Look around carefully. We have fifty 9th-stage thunder unicorns, fifty 9th-stage nightmares, an 8th-stage plant monster pet, and four immortal friends of Lord Florida Man. This doesn't include the lord's stone guardians on the flying island. If push comes to shove, we won't lose.\"\n\"…\"\nHua Jiashan closed his mouth and nodded. Nothing sounded more assuring than having good protection gears and weapons.\n\"Say,\" Hua Jiashan counted the heads of his former subordinates. He didn't see Wu Buyi around. \"Where's that greedy alchemist?\"\nHan Hao shrugged, \"In his house looking at Lord Florida's artifact, I think?\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody gave up on Wu Buyi as he changed a lot after getting his hands on a smartphone. Then, Hua Jiashan searched for Esen and her crew.\n\"Where's Lady Esen?\"\nHan Meng shrugged. He pointed at the white tree. \"Over there, maybe. They're experimenting with something.\"\n\"Alright. I'll go find her.\"\nHua Jiashan ordered the trio to patrol the domain along with the nightmare platoon. He visited Esen next.\n.\nWhite Tree Array\nSurrounding the white tree array was a group of lava badgers. They were already 4 feet tall, and they had evolved one more time.\nIn their mouths, they chewed sweet dream mushrooms that Esen plucked for them. Strangely, they weren't affected by the zombification poisoning. Instead, they grew larger.\nAfter eating mushrooms for hours, these tamed pets became 5th-stage monsters. They were already stronger than Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, and Wu Buyi.\nXu Nuan gazed at the badgers in astonishment. She wondered where these guys came from. On the other hand, Esen shook her head in disappointment.\n\"In the end, they avoid the true death mushrooms.\"\nThe badgers refused to eat true death mushrooms as if they knew what their effects were. They also kept their distance from the white tree when Esen allowed them to go inside the array.\nThe feast time was over. At the moment, these creatures simply ran and played like innocent children.\nWhile everybody observed the little monsters, Hua Jiashan flew toward Esen. He landed behind her and cupped his fist.\n\"Lady Esen, there have been changes at Magpie City. We need your help.\"\nWithout looking back, Esen snorted, \"I heard you. That city is being attacked, right?\"\n\"Yes. Could you help us if our domain is under attack next?\"\n\"If that happens, I'll be the first one to lead the troops… If that really happens.\"\n\"???\"\nHua Jiashan raised his eyebrows, confused, \"What do you mean?\"\nEsen rolled her eyes. She turned around and stared into his eyes.\n\"Look here, mister dense-dumb-dork. When you retreated from that city, is there any pursuer?\"\n\"Erm… no.\"\n\"Right. You drove them away, right?\"\n\"Err…yes.\"\n\"From the very beginning, you have the power to drive away intruders. Are those weapons that you got from Florida Man for show?\"\n\"O-Of course not. They were very useful!\"\nEsen snorted. She turned around and patted the head of the clinging badger. Then, she advised him.\n\"Instead of worrying about this place, you should bring troops to Magpie City to help the commoners. Also, arrange another unit to scout the perimeter around this place. Use those ponies. They have been eating and sleeping all day.\"\n\"Y-You're right. I'll be going.\"\nHua Jiashan was ashamed. He was too panicked, and he didn't think this through. After bidding farewell, Hua Jiashan went to pick up 20 thunder unicorns and Taxi so that they could visit Magpie City.\nAfter Hua Jiashan left, Esen glanced at Ivy.\n\"It's probably time for us to resurrect our former comrades. That geezers have most of our people's bones, so we can't do anything about them. But we have collected some armor and weapons of the royal guards. We should be able to awaken their souls.\"\nIvy bowed without saying anything. She vanished, heading back to the battle bus to pick up the collected bones and artifacts that they had stored inside.\nEsen turned to Beatrice next.\n\"Beatrice, you go back to our former home. There should be Immortalium steel remaining inside that cave. Go collect them and bring them over. We can refine them into new weapons for our units.\"\nBeatrice quietly bowed. She, too, vanished, rushing toward the Frozen Fire City, where the Gorr Tribe had taken over.\nEsen turned to Marc next. The Dullahan boy clenched his fists, waiting for an instruction.\n\"As for you, Marc…\"\nEsen paused and frowned.\n\"Y-Yes, master?\"\n\"Go fetch me tea of rejuvenation and some golden sand bananas from the granary. I'm hungry.\"\n\"…\"\nMarc was dejected. He hunched his shoulders while he walked to the local granary to fetch food for her master.\nAfter sending Marc off, Esen pursed her lips and deeply sighed. She scanned the domain, searching for Leo's whereabouts.\nUnfortunately, she couldn't find him anywhere.\n\"Where the hell does that geezer go?!\"\n.\n.\nMorning, Fate Stadium\nLeo finished drying his pants and underwear. He put his clothes on and opened the curtains of his room.\nThe scenery was the same. The power was down, and his system's teleportation feature was disabled. None of the street lights was on. Only the artificial light balls, created by the local residents, illuminated the city.\nLeo grumbled in a bad mood. He was still ashamed that he had wet his pants because of a stupid vivid dream. He exited his hotel room and walked to the stadium to kill time.\nWhile walking back to the stadium, he encountered the werewolf group again. As usual, they still gathered in front of their tribe's locker room.\nLeo sneered at them. Then, he walked away as he had no business with these mutts.\nAfter coming back to the stadium, Leo discovered that a match was in progress. Another Fenrir immortal contested against a giant orange cat-octopus.\nIt was a match between a Cathulhu and a Fenrir. It was literally a dog versus cat match.\nLeo frowned as he found this unfair. His match was canceled, but the stadium allowed them to fight. He stomped toward the nearby staff to complain.\n\"Hey! My match was canceled yesterday, but how come these guys can fight when the power is down?\"\nThe staff was a furry rabbit woman. She politely bowed to Leo and explained, \"Our deepest apology, sir. Your match yesterday was a life-and-death one, so we need all technical teams to monitor and record your match. However, the current match over there is a friendly sparring match between two private parties. Since no technical staff has to work, we allow them to play.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo was still mad, but he forgave them. He excused himself and observed the match.\nThe fight was weird as the catopus toyed with the dog. He slapped, tossed, and threw the werewolf around like a cat playing with an empty bottle cap.\nThe spectators burst into laughter. Most of them cheered for the cat.\nLeo also smirked as he hated those racist werewolves. Still, he was curious how they managed to initiate the friendly match.\nBOOM\nWhile Leo was in deep thought, the giant catopus slapped the dog senselessly. The latter collapsed on the floor and stopped moving.\n\"WINNER! Nyan Meo!\"\nIt ended in an anti-climactic fashion. Leo pursed his lips and inspected the cat-octopus monster.\nThe winner was from the Cathulhu race as expected. He seemed smaller than Miao Damao and his family when they were inside the VIP box. However, he emitted the aura of an immortal.\nThe cathulhu, Nyan Meo, bowed to everybody in the arena. When he was about to leave the stage, his eyes met with Leo's. He smiled and pointed one of his tentacles at the latter.\n\"You there, munya!\"\nLeo blinked twice. He pointed at himself.\n\"Who? Me?\"\n\"Yes, you, munya! Wanna fight for fun, munya?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Sure. But I'm stronger than you, though. It won't be fair.\"\n\"Don't worry, munya! Even if you're a sage or an entity, your strength is meaningless when you face an elite cathulhu, munya!\"\nLeo wanted to laugh, but he couldn't. The guy's tone seemed disrespectful, but he reminded him of the cathulhu's overall strength and potential. After all, from the rumors, they seemed to be the only ones who could proactively provoke \"Overlord Lucky\" and his minions.\n\"Alright, stupid cat. Friendly match, right? Nobody can die, am I right?\"\n\"Yes, munya! Come here! Let's go, munya! Let me humble you!\"\n\"You cocky cat. You asked for it!\"\nLeo leaped from the spectator stand to the arena stage. As for the cat, he remained in his place, taunting Leo by wiggling his tentacles around.\nThe staff on the stage improvised on the spot. He used his voice amplification technique instead of microphones, announcing the next friendly spar match.\n\"Next! We have the rising star player FLORIDA MAN versus the veteran of the DOGE-CAT War, the War God himself, NYAN MEO!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows as he doubted his ears. He looked at the cathulhu and asked the guy.\n\"You? A war god?\"\n\"Surprise, mother-dogger, munya! Do you think I'm a weak immortal? You've been tricked, munya!\"\nNyan Meo's grin widened. He released his rainbow aura, which was similar to Leo's. Also, black sparks came out from his orifices.\nThose were black tribulation thunderbolts that Leo also had!\n\"Ready your butt cheeks, munya! I'm gonna clap you so hard that you will moan from pleasure, munya!\"\n\"…\"\nThe cathulhu didn't wait for the match signal. As the stadium had no power to restrain them, he made the first move.\nA 50-meter-long and 5-meter-thick tentacle came from above, attempting to squash Leo to meatpaste.\nBOOM\nThe cathulhu hit the stadium floor. But he didn't sense the feedback of squishing Leo to death.\nBOOM\nA sharp and painful impact hit Nyan Meo's round face. Leo's leather shoe found its way to the cathulhu's head and sent it to the other end of the stadium.\nThen, he stopped moving.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo frowned as he found the match disappointing. He thought that the cathulhu was a lot stronger than that.\n\"Match over! Winner, Florida Man!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo scratched his head in confusion. He opened his palms and protested the referee.\n\"Is that it?\"\nThe referee waved his hand, gesturing for Leo to leave.\n\"Hurry and go before that cat wakes up. Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.\"\n\"How?\" Leo still couldn't understand why the referee warned him that way.\nHe didn't need to think long. Nyan Meo slowly rose back to his feet. He stood up with his tentacles and patted his face.\n\"That hurts, munya. I thought I was sturdy, but your kick was even harder than Overlord Shuri's slap, munya!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"TIME FOR ROUND TWO, MUNYA! Let's get at it again, munya!\"\nThe cathulhu charged at Leo. Before the latter could react, the cathulhu grabbed him with his tentacle and pressed him against the ground outside the stage arena.\nThe referee shrugged, \"I've tried to warn you. In a friendly sparring match, nobody can die. Even if the system is down, none of you can be killed. Therefore, both parties can keep fighting until one of you is exhausted mentally and physically. Well, I guess it's too late. Good luck, Florida Man!\"\nIndeed, the warning came too late. Leo lifted the cathulhu's tentacle up and yelled at Nyan Meo.\n\"BEHAVE, DAMN CAT!\"\n\"NYAHAHAHA, MUNYA!\"\nLeo then swung the cat around while he held the latter's tentacle. He slammed Nyan Meo left and right like a cartoon character. Unfortunately, he couldn't deal any damage to him.\nThe cathulhu's eyes spun as he was dizzy. But after a few seconds, he regained his senses and attacked Leo with his slaps. Again, Leo counter-punched and kicked the cat, pushing him away.\nThe battle lasted for six hours and nobody gave up. In the end, Nyan Meo got exhausted first and stopped fighting.\nBLINK-BLINK\nBy the time Leo and Nyan Meo ended their match, the light returned to the arena. Then, they heard the long-awaiting announcement from the stadium host.\n\"We are sorry for the inconvenience. We have recovered the power, and the system is back online. We will make sure that nothing similar will happen again!\"\nFinally, Leo could return home. Without waiting for Nyan Cat to challenge him again, Leo opened his system menu and pressed the return button.\nWHOOSH\nLeo's body vanished from the Fate Stadium arena.\nNyan Meo pouted. He grumbled as he hadn't played enough yet.\n\"Lame, munya! I was having fun, munya!\"\nLeo didn't notice Nyan Meo's ranking in the life-and-death arena. He was in the top 10, and his stage name wasn't just Nyan Meo.\nHe was called \"Overlord Nyan Meo\". In addition, his real strength didn't belong in the mortal, immortal, or deity realm.",

All Dead Bodies Found in Florida Man's Refrigerator Marked as \"Cat Food\".\nAt night, routed troops of Qiang Qiang returned to base. They rushed to Qiang Baidu and reported their failure. As only a few hundred men managed to come back alive, it raised a commotion in the camp.\nQiang Baidu glared at the kneeling men in front of his palace. He walked down the stairs and sat next to one of the captains in a low voice.\n\"What happened there?\"\n\"I-I'm so sorry, my lord!\"\n\"Calm down and take a deep breath. I won't punish you. We're family, okay?\"\n\"Y-Yes, my lord.\"\nThe captain narrated what he had seen at Magpie City. He retold the event from when Qiang Qiang got ambushed to the appearance of Tang Xuan and two strange cultivators with long-ranged weapons. He also reported how Dugu Ying got captured by a quasi-immortal.\n\"A quasi-immortal?\"\n\"Y-Yes, my lord.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nQiang Baidu patted the captain. He kept his promise of not harming his soldiers.\nBut when he turned around, a hundred quasi-immortals came out from the palace. They cupped their fists, saluting Qiang Baidu.\nThey were the bodyguards that had been companying him.\nQiang Baidu ordered them.\n\"Treat the wounded and let them rest. Then, gather everybody. Finish it before midnight.\"\nThe quasi-immortals nodded. They rushed to pick up the wounded and the troops.\nQiang Baidu rubbed his throat and sent his voice transmission to every subordinate.\n\"Assemble troops. Tang Xuan and his Tang Clan have mobilized his little army to face us. We'll trample them and set an example for those heinous cultivators! Then, we'll use this momentum and probe Florida Man next!\"\n.\n.\nAt midnight, the one hundred quasi-immortal mutants rallied the rest of their troops. They left behind a few people to guard the base, but 8,000 soul transformation mutants and 100 quasi-immortal bodyguards were ready for another big war.\nQiang Baidu gazed at his tribesmen. He nodded at them.\n\"Let's go! We'll strike them at night and turn Magpie City into a bonfire! We'll roast and eat humans and cultivators like cows and horses! Tonight, WE FEAST ON THE TANG CLAN!\"\nThe four-armed people raised their arms and roared. None of them rebuked or complained about cannibalism or human flesh as they no longer considered themselves as one of the local people.\nThey were demons. They had already sold their souls to the demonic realm's ruler, who was also an apostle of Fenrir race's overlord.\nQiang Baidu took flight. The rest of the troops kicked the ground and flew to the sky, flying north.\n.\n.\nCanyon River\nAs Leo hadn't returned home yet, Cat continued to chill in the river as the contaminated water was delicious and fresh. She floated freely on the surface, pretending to be an aquatic plant.\nWHOOSH\nA shadow from the north flew over Cat's head.\nCat flinched as she failed to follow the shadow's movement. She widened her eyes and was about to chase after the mysterious being.\nFortunately, the shadow turned around and flew back. She stopped in front of Cat to show her appearance.\nThe shadow was none other than Ivy. The blindfolded girl in a black hooded robe faced Cat and smiled at her.\n\"Hi, Cat.\"\nCat recognized an ally. She waved her branch to greet her.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"No. I don't have anything to feed you at the moment.\"\n\"Meow…\"\nCat sulked. She thought that she could get some exotic night snacks.\nIvy laughed, \"Well, I have a task to do at the south. Will you come with me? Maybe, we might catch something you can eat.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\" Cat regained her energy. She repeatedly nodded.\n\"Alright. Come with me!\"\nIvy resumed her task. She flew at a low altitude and lowered her speed. As Ivy matched her speed with Cat's, the latter managed to follow after her.\nCoincidentally, their flight path collided with Qiang Baidu's troops.\n.\n.\nQiang Baidu and his men had trained in a harsh environment for 500 years. Their constitutions changed, and they gained many new abilities. Nightsight was one of the necessary skills that everybody was forced to learn.\nAll 8,100 soldiers formed a square formation in the sky, hiding under the shadows of night clouds. Still, they never stopped scanning below for rogue cultivators or enemy units. Everybody stared at the Canyon River.\nQiang Baidu also gazed at the river. He recalled that one of his scout units went somewhere north and never returned. He wondered if they ran into Tang Xuan or something in the river.\nWHOOSH\nWhile Qiang Baidu was in deep thought, two shadows moved along the river, flying at a low altitude. Their destination seemed to be their base.\nQiang Baidu narrowed his eyes as he inspected their cultivation base.\n\"An 8th-stage plant monster and a hidden master?\"\nQiang Baidu couldn't see through Ivy's strength as he couldn't detect her Qi. However, judging from the movements of the monster, it seemed to follow after the hooded person peacefully.\nOne of Qiang Baidu's bodyguards asked him, \"Your order, my lord?\"\nQiang Baidu pondered hard as he didn't remember any prominent monster tamer. He vaguely remembered a gorgeous young lady who tagged along with a quasi-immortal of the Dongfang Clan. However, according to his memory, the Dongfang Clan migrated to the immortal realm before the sweet dream mushroom calamity. Their descendants or disciples shouldn't be in this world anymore.\n\"Meh, I'm overthinking things. Send five elites and a 100-man unit after them. The rest will continue north!\"\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\nThe bodyguard's throat vibrated, sending secret messages to five colleagues of his. Five quasi-immortal mutants dove down and a hundred soldiers followed them, chasing after Cat and Ivy.\nQiang Baidu gazed north. He glared at the flying island on the horizon.\nLooking at the mystic realm island, Qiang Baidu narrowed his eyes. He changed his plan.\n\"That place seems to be too close to Magpie City. Change of plans, troops! We'll eliminate the variables first! It doesn't matter if Florida Man is an immortal like me. We'll remove them and get rid of Tang Xuan next! We shouldn't forget that we're here for Yan Xiang's Earth Fate Crystal!\"\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nIvy and Cat calmly flew along the river as usual. But as they passed under the 8,100-man army above, they glanced up.\nSure enough, a hundred men above dove down and turned around. They flew after Cat and Ivy.\nCat turned around and laughed, preparing to extort some nom-nom tax. However, Ivy pulled Cat and threw her further south. Then, she hovered in front of the plant monster.\n\"Five quasi-immortals are among them. You aren't their opponent, Cat.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" Cat tilted her head and gazed at the 100 soul transformation cultivators behind their leaders.\n\"You can take on their minions. I'll take on the big guys.\"\n\"Meow <3\"\nCat nodded. She then dove into the river and vanished from plain sight.\nIvy pulled out a wane and a cane from her spatial ring. She rotated them and held the sharp bottom tip upward like daggers. Then, she lowered her stance.\nOne of the quasi-immortal mutants silently merged with his dao avatar and transformed his arms into wolf heads. The heads extended and lengthened as if they were tentacles, shooting toward Ivy.\nFour silver lines after images flashed, but Ivy's cane and wane didn't look like they moved. However, red bloodstain got on the sharp edges.\nA second later, four wolf heads fell to the river, leaving the assailant's four amputated arms.\nThe quasi-immortal mutant didn't flinch. His severed arms regenerated, and he continued his pursuit. His four colleagues caught up with him and unleashed their abilities.\nOne of them transformed into a four-armed werewolf. The second quasi-immortal became invisible. The third summoned a hundred 9th-stage flame wolves while the fourth transformed into a flame spirit.\nIvy was unperturbed. She tilted her head to the side, finding them cute.\n\"No domain ability? Then, rest in pieces.\"\nIvy ejected a long staff from her spatial ring. Glowing in purple light, the staff generated a small purple dome, covering all five quasi-immortal mutants and her inside. Then, the dome shrank.\nPOOF!\nEverybody inside the purple dome vanished!\n\"!!!\"\nThe 100 soul transformation mutants froze as they were taken aback by the abrupt chaos. They could no longer sense Ivy and their leaders.\nCat was also confused. However, she never missed an opportunity to strike. While being underwater, she flipped upside down, pointing her roots upward. Then, she created spike bullets with her roots and branches.\nGreen bullets shot out from the river like a machine gun. All sacred wood bullets from her were radioactive, and they carried a weaker version of Leo's cells.\nThe bullets pierced through half of the men's bodies!\nThe wounded mutants screamed in pain and pulled the bullet heads out of their bodies. As they already sold their souls to a demonic Fenrir, their flesh and blood were tainted. Thus, the sacred wood burnt their flesh and blood the same way they burnt undead creatures.\nSensing a threat, the remaining mutants dispersed and dove into the water to chase after Cat. As for the injured, they remained above the river to recuperate and recover. Little did they know that they fell into Cat's trap.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\"\nAs if Cat was a marine creature, her roots and branches slithered into the water like eels. They snatched a dozen mutants in the water and pulled them toward her monster mouth.\nThe mutants sneered and summoned their dao avatars. But as they were about to unleash their Qi and essence, contaminated water got into their stomach and mutated them from the inside.\nThe others also felt the changes. Their skins corroded, and their eyes ceased functioning. Everybody in the water became blinded. Even their dantians, meridians, and Qi were blocked as their DNA was destroyed and altered.\nRed rashes rapidly spread, and their muscle bloated and distorted. Let alone fighting, they could no longer swim or maintain their balance underwater.\nCat took her time, collecting her food. She brought out a storage ring, which she had stolen from Leo's warehouse.\nShe had been getting smarter. She already learned how spatial rings worked!\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\"\nCat gently pulled one of the mutants to her mouth. She bit his head off. Then, she stored the corpse in her storage ring.\nCLINK\nAs storage rings couldn't be stored inside another spatial ring, a few rings remained in the water.\nCat pouted as she found multiple rings annoying. Still, she used one of her small branches to insert the rings. Afterward, she turned her attention to another mutating mutant.\nThe nom-nom festival began.\n.\n.\nThe 50 injured mutants still hovered over the river, looking at the blood-tainted water. They tried to communicate with their friends, but no one answered.\n\"What the hell are we fighting?!\" One of them asked their colleague.\n\"I don't know! Isn't it supposed to be just a plant monster? It's only at the 8th stage!\"\n\"Can an 8th-stage plant monster really fight underwater?!\"\n\"Like I said, I don't know!\"\nThe troops panicked. They looked at each other, unable to make decisions.\nThe quasi-immortals mysteriously vanished, and half of their unit lost contact with them. They started panicking.\nOne of them turned toward the main army. He fled the scene and shouted to others.\n\"I'm going to call for help! Don't just float there and watch! Keep attacking even if it's random!\"\n\"…\"\nThe men frowned as they didn't have to listen to the guy's order. However, his words made sense.\nEverybody summoned their dao avatars. They utilized their unique techniques and threw various projectile skills at the river.\nA barrage of fireballs, flame hurricanes, earth meteors, and lava beasts fell into the river, causing random explosions.\nThe river boiled. Bubbles burst on the surface while explosions and fountains erupted one after another.\n\"MYAAAA!!\"\nThe trick worked. Cat leaped out of the river and fled toward a forest nearby.\nThe mutants sneered. They stopped attacking and pursued after Cat.\nWHOOSH\nA purple dome reemerged behind the group. As if it became a portal, Ivy slipped out of it.\nBehind her were five purple four-armed men. They lifelessly followed after her as if they were mannequins.\n\"Oh, you're still here.\"\nIvy deeply sighed as she was slightly disappointed in Cat's performance. She thought that Cat could handle all of them on her own. Unfortunately, the creature still lacked experience in combat.\nThe lich girl waved her cane, pointing at the injured men.\n\"Go and unalive your former colleagues.\"\nThe five purple four-armed mutants widened their eyes. Instead of having eyeballs, purple flame lit inside the eye sockets while a part of their skin was reduced to the bone.\nThe quasi-immortal mutants had been converted into undead!\nThe mutants roared and started using their skills at their former friends. The latter screamed in fright before the stampede devoured their lives.\nA minute after Ivy's return, the remaining mutants were wiped out, except one guy who had fled earlier.\nWhen the ordeal was over, Cat ran back to Ivy's side. She moaned and cried as her plant body was burnt and scarred because of the barrage earlier. Even though the wounds slowly healed, she kept yowling.\n\"Meow! Meow!\"\nIvy shook her head. She sat on top of the monster's body and patted Cat's human head.\n\"It's okay. The fight is over. We're safe.\"\n\"…Meow?\"\n\"Yes. I got rid of them. Nobody can hurt you anymore.\"\n\"…\"\nCat stopped crying. Then, she beamed at Ivy with a sly grin.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nIvy's expression changed. She crossed her index finger.\n\"No, Cat. My new soldiers are not your food. You can eat what you killed, but you can't take my spoil of war.\"\nCat lowered her head. She then crawled back to the water to fetch the corpses.\nIvy bitterly laughed. She wondered what kind of teaching Leo had given to Cat as she was spoiled rotten.",

      "content": "Chapter 190 – Pedophile Tourist Attempting to Sexual-Harass Girl during Halloween Event Shot By Florida Man Cosplayed as Pedophile Bear.\nBZZZ\nWhile monitoring the lava badgers, Esen heard the voice transmission from Ivy. Her voice seemed excited.\n'Master, I spotted an earth celestial immortal, 95 quasi-immortals, and a bunch of insects flying your way.'\nEsen raised her eyebrows. She turned around and planned to deliver a telepathic voice to Leo. Unfortunately, he hadn't returned yet.\nAs Leo was not around, Esen had no one to shove the responsibility away.\n\"Meh. How troublesome. Oh, wait. We can do this.\"\nEsen was confident that she could easily crush every Earth Celestial immortal with ease as long as they fought individually. But suddenly, she remembered that she hadn't tested Leo's new toys yet.\nShe replied to Ivy.\n\"Proceed as planned. Go pick up our comrades from home. I'll babysit that geezer's pets.\"\n'Yes, master.'\nIvy and Cat continued heading south as planned. As for Esen, she stretched and yawned. Then, she informed everybody, including the badgers and tamer girls.\n\"Listen up, humans! Some death-seeking crap-stuck-on-their-butt idiotic immortals will launch a full-scale assault here tonight. Instead of patrolling everywhere, tell everybody to form ranks and gather south! You girls and these critters go hide inside that geezer's pointless store. Tell the adults to get their guns ready!\"\n.\n.\nQiang Baidu arrived at Leo's domain border. He ordered his troops to stop marching forward.\nIn front of him, the mystic portal island stood tall, leaking waterfall to the canyon river. Small and big creatures poured out from an erected gate and fell along the natural water slide. Thunder caimans, cockatrices, rare fish, and dead land animals came out once every minute.\nBelow the flying island, a faint layer of fog covered the entire domain. The remnant force of heavenly tribulation clouds lingered in the area, empowering the fog with mild static electricity. However, green, purple, yellow, orange, and even red thunderbolts occasionally flashed inside the clouds underneath the flying island.\nHovering fearlessly under the tribulation clouds were the 50 nightmare horses, led by Ricardo. They remained in their beast form, concealing their true abilities. They all gathered at the south of the domain border, facing Qiang Baidu's troops.\nOn the ground, 50 unicorns formed ranks, standing together in a square formation. The leader of this unit, Taxi, had already transformed into a human. He stood on the rooftop of Leo's general store.\nBehind Taxi, Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Xu Nuan, Dongfang Mei, Tiger Swordsman, and the lazy dork Wu Buyi brought out their new arsenal.\nInside the general store hid the young disciples from Life Sword Sect and Amazonian Sanctuary. They peeked outside while standing behind the glass windows. Among them, Yao Qiqi and the newly recruited lava badgers hid there, serving as the last line of defense.\nAs for Esen and Marc, the former rested on a beach bed, next to the white tree array while Marc served as a human fan, generating breezy wind toward Esen with his Qi while mixing a cocktail drink for his master. He awkwardly blended a golden sand banana, arctic yin tomato, immortal grasses, and yin fluid to create a rare chilly drink. The duo didn't seem to be disturbed by the invaders.\nOn the guardian statues pretended to be lifeless. However, their eyes curved up, mocking the approaching mutants.\nMeanwhile, Qiang Baidu gave the thunder unicorns and nightmares a meaningful look. All these 9th-stage monsters were a threat to his quasi-immortal unit. Only he could defeat them.\nHowever, what concerned Qiang Baidu the most was the two youngsters near the south farmland. They seemed too relaxed, and Qiang Baidu couldn't measure their combat strength.\n'Are they immortals? That can't be possible, right? I don't think this mortal plant has enough cultivation resources to nurture an immortal, let alone a quasi-immortal. If they had, Situ Nantian and Yan Xiang would have ascended long ago.'\nQiang Baidu shook off their theory that Esen and Marc were immortals. He believed they had an artifact, which concealed their cultivation base.\nHe scanned the domain and found interesting buildings, such as the Crystal Tower, parking lot building, apartments, and the shopping mall. He was interested in the spirit stone heart the most.\n'That spirit stone heart… I see. That should be Immortal Florida Man's work. Does Florida Man here?'\nProbing the domain, Qiang Baidu empowered his voice with his Qi, roaring.\n\"I AM QIANG BAIDU OF THE GORR TRIBE! BRING ME YOUR LEADER!\"\nHis voice vibrated in the air, causing an earthquake. The horses flinched because of the intense voice. As for the weak elders, their ears bled, and everybody on the rooftop of the shopping mall collapsed to the ground.\nThe recycling center's mannequins rushed to work. They fetched new healing pills, the pinnacle-graded \"Hope and Dream\" pills, to feed the injured elders. Everybody took one and fell asleep on the spot. Even Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei couldn't withstand Qiang Baidu's voice.\nThe mannequins brought them into the shopping mall via the back door, and let them rest. Then, they visited the gunsmith and fetched finished rifles inside. After arming themselves, they went back to the rooftop, replacing the defensive forces.\nNot only did the recycling center's mannequins react to the intruders, but the warehouse and granary mannequins reacted as well. However, instead of joining the fighting forces, they served as logistic officers, carrying necessary food and items to the shopping mall.\nA minute later, no one from Leo's side came out. Only the ponies remained vigilance.\nSeeing that nobody replied, Qiang Baidu believed that Leo might be in hiding or had already run away.\n'Is he not here? Or rather, is Florida Man one of the two?'\nQiang Baidu glared at Marc. He had heard about Leo before, and the intel said he was an elderly man with a long white beard and white hair. However, this boy seemed to be in his teens, which didn't fit the description.\nStill, anything could happen in this world. Qiang Baidu guessed that he might have consumed age-reduction medicines from the Tang Clan.\n'I need to make sure they aren't immortals. I'll grab them myself.'\nQiang Baidu descended and landed 50 meters away from Esen and Marc. The former stomped toward the duo.\n\"Brat! Where is Florida Man?!\"\nEsen, who had changed her clothes to the domain's uniform, casually rose up. She put on a black suit and adjusted her breast pads before she faced Qiang Baidu.\n\"Who's asking?\" Asked Esen.\nQiang Baidu gave Esen a meaningful look. As he managed to see her face under the moonlight, he noticed the otherworldly beautiful face of a high elf. His eyes automatically moved to her chest, which bulged under her shirt and suit.\nThe mutant drooled. He wanted her.\n\"Little girl. Which sect are you from?\"\nEsen rolled her eyes, \"You didn't answer my question.\"\n\"Ha! I'm Qiang Baidu, the chieftain of the Gorr Tribe. You, little girl, should surrender to me when you have a chance. I'll even make you one of my concubines and guarantee your status and wealth!\"\nMarc's expression turned dark. He almost pulled out his blindfold clothes because of anger.\nEsen raised her hand and stopped the Dullahan boy from taking action. She continued toying with Qiang Baidu.\n\"You? Taking me in? You should at least look at yourself in the mirror and clean your eyes with piss water. Do you think an ugly geezer like you deserve me?\"\nQiang Baidu liked Esen's tone. He looked forward to breaking Esen's mind on their first wedding night.\n\"You might not know, but I'm an immortal. I have transcended this world's limitations and laws! Now, you have two choices. Be my concubine willingly, or I'll chop off your four limbs and use you as my personal toilet!\"\nEsen deeply sighed. She shook her head.\n\"Seriously, men are the same everywhere. Well, except that geezer.\"\nThinking of Leo, Esen faintly smiled. She found it comfortable freeloading in his domain. Moreover, he never tried to force himself on her.\nEsen didn't realize that her happy smile aroused Qiang Baidu even more. He laughed and walked closer to her.\nSHINK\nMarc suddenly pulled out a giant bastard sword from his storage ring and slammed it on the ground between Esen and Qiang Baidu. The blindfolded clothes failed to conceal bright light from Marc's red glowing eyes.\n\"Stay away from my master, demon!\" Marc glared at Qiang Baidu.\nThe mutant chieftain found the boy amusing. He laughed at Marc, \"Are you Florida Man?\"\nMarc snorted. Because of various emotions, he yelled, \"What if I say I am?!\"\n\"Good!\"\nBOOM\nA fist found its way to Marc's face. Qiang Baidu punched him and knocked his head off his shoulders.\n\"…\"\nQiang Baidu frowned and looked at his fist. The feedback from his punch was weird as he didn't sense any Qi or defensive force from Marc.\nUpon noticing that Marc's head was missing, Qiang Baidu laughed.\n\"What a showoff! If you're a mortal, you should have stayed outside of our business! Well, it's too late for you, though.\"\nQiang Baidu turned his attention to Esen next.\n\"Your boyfriend is dead, girly. Come to me obediently.\"\nEsen crossed her arms. She snorted.\n\"First off, that boy is my servant, not my boyfriend. Secondly, when you fight a Dullahan, you have to destroy his soul first, not attack his head. After all, their heads are replaceable.\"\n\"What?\"\nEsen sat back on her beach bed. She took a sip of her cocktail, \"What I'm trying to say is, you fucked up.\"\nBOOM\nSuddenly, the headless body of Marc picked up the bastard sword and swung it toward Qiang Baidu at lightning speed. The blade directly hit his stomach, but it failed to cut through his skin.\nQiang Baidu was sent flying 500 meters into the sky before he regained his balance. But when he looked back at Esen, he could no longer find Marc's headless body.\nMarc's head reappeared 100 meters away in front of Qiang Baidu. As for his body, it was already above the guy.\nThe blindfold cloth was gone. Qiang Baidu could finally see Marc's face.\nMarc had no physical eyes! In his eyesockets were two glowing red lightning balls, staring straight at Qiang Baidu's soul!\nA new physique manifested, using Marc's head as its core. A red body made of red electricity gained mass while Marc's physical body emitted black flame.\n\"!!!\"\nThe black aura of Marc's headless body revealed his true strength. Upon sensing his opponent's power, Qiang Baidu was terrified.\n\"RED TRIBULATION LIGHTNING?! YOU'RE NOT A MORTAL!\"\nMarc grumbled. His lightning physique teleported and grabbed Qiang Baidu's neck.\n\"Duh, obviously. Do you think a mortal can survive after hearing your shout up close? You didn't use your brain a lot, do you?\"\nZAAAAAP\nUsing his pure Qi, Marc unleashed a red electric current through Qiang Baidu's body and fried him. At the same time, Marc's headless body swung the bastard sword down, cleaving Qiang Baidu's body from head to groin.\nThe body of the mutant chieftain was cut in half while it was burnt to crisp.\nMarc released Qiang Baidu's cleaved neck. The body dissipated into black ash.\nDespite the destruction of Qiang Baidu's body, Marc's eyes moved around, searching for his opponent's soul and new physique.\nWHOOSH\nA crimson dome emerged, enveloping Leo's domain and Qiang Baidu's troops. Flame from the dome's ceiling barriers poured down and condensed a new mass.\nAs Marc had expected, Qiang Baidu wasn't dead yet. The flame mass condensed Qiang Baidu's new body. He reappeared in front of his troops with his full clothes intact. His skin was slightly charred, while smoke came out from his body. However, all wounds instantly healed in seconds.\nMarc clicked his tongue. He had fought immortals before, and killing them wasn't easy. To kill an immortal, he needed to destroy or disable his opponent's domain first.\nOn the ground, Esen had been observing the fight, and she was slightly disappointed in Marc's indecisiveness. She complained.\n\"Don't just use your brute strength against an immortal. Use everything necessary to crack or destroy your opponent's domain! If you can't, you lose!\"\nMarc nodded as he remembered the trick. He cursed in his mind.\n\"I'm getting rusty.\"\nHis red lightning physique and headless body activated their domain abilities in unison. A blood dome and an upside-down island emerged from nothingness.\nThe surface of the upside-down island was a cemetery. Tombs and graves were disorderly arranged while the black soil wailed as if it was haunted. At the center of the cemetery, a statue of a headless horseman was situated there, holding a long scythe and a bundle of heads.\nThe flying island hovered over the troops of Qiang Baidu. It also slowly spread black fog to conceal its existence. At the same time, the blood domain covered it.\nThe blood domain barrier and crimson flame domain overlapped. As both domains collided, their real bodies were affected.\nQiang Baidu flinched and looked above him. A scythe symbol hovered over his head as if he had been cursed by Marc's blood domain and the upside-down Cemetery Island.\nVice versa, Marc's headless body was caught in crimson flame. Fortunately, the black flame negated the burning effects, and the red lightning of Marc's soul devoured the weaker flame as fuel.\nWhenever immortals overlapped their domains, they could tell which side had an advantage. Qiang Baidu's face darkened as he figured out that his opponent was immune to crimson flame.\nChanging his strategy, Qiang Baidu chose another ability.\n\"It doesn't matter what your cultivation base is! As long as I have a soul domain that can counter your trump cards, I can kill you-UUGH!\"\nBANG!\nBefore Qiang Baidu could finish his sentences, Marc pulled out one of Leo's distributed rifles and shot Qiang Baidu with an enchanted sacred wood bullet. It pierced his throat directly, cutting off his voice.\nMarc clicked his tongue as his aim was off. He readjusted his aim.\nQiang Baidu had enough. He healed his throat and bellowed.\n\"ALL UNITS, CHARGE! KILL THEM ALL! QUASI-IMMORTAL, GET RID OF THOSE 9TH-STAGE MONSTERS! AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, DESTROY EVERYTHING!\"\nThe troops stopped observing. As they had witnessed Marc's strength, no one held back their skills.",

They have done it, munya. Who's going to help them, munya?\"\nOn the mystic realm portal platform, the three statues laughed at the invaders. They looked at each other.\nThe black-winged angel shrugged, \"Rock, paper, scissors?\"\nThe Cathulhu disagreed, \"That's not fair, munya. I can only do tentacles. Pick another method, munya.\"\nThe Fenrir also panted and stuck out his tongue, pretending ignorance, \"You want my paws, woof?\"\n\"…\"\nAs they didn't feel the necessity of participating in this fight, the trio pushed the responsibility to each other. However, as they had the same mind, they couldn't come to an agreement.\nThe angel facepalmed. He then glanced at his three concubines, including the new member. Qiang Qiang, who lost her soul and was converted into a stone golem, still sat on the angel's lap. Her apathetic gaze stared into the distance.\nMeowmeow patted the girl's head. Then, he injected a fragment of her soul back.\nQiang Qiang's body jolted as if she was electrocuted. A second later, she looked around and found her new master. Instead of panicking or making a fuss, she nodded at Meowmeow.\nShe lost all her previous memory. The only instinct of Qiang Qiang was to follow this angel's instructions.\nAfter converting Qiang Qiang into a complete slave, Meowmeow gave her the first order.\n\"New order for you. You will serve Lord Florida Man as your new master as he is also my master. For now, I want you to take the elevator to the first floor. When you arrive, you will pretend to be a fountain statue at the entrance of the shopping mall. If intruders manage to break in from the front, it will be your duty to stop them. Got it?\"\nQiang Qiang nodded. She got down from the angel's lap and shrank her physique. With determination, she entered the elevator and got down to the first floor.\n.\n.\nUpon Qiang Baidu's signal, the mutant army charged toward the nightmares and thunder unicorns. None of them was afraid of the monsters.\nTaxi transformed into a human with a unicorn horn. The silver horn glowed and fired a yellow thunderbolt at the incoming quasi-immortal mutant.\nThe lightning bolt hit the demonic cultivator, but he came out unharmed. The mutant roared and manifested his flame axe. He swung down, aiming at Taxi's head.\nCLINK\nTaxi parried the strike with his horn. While he was at it, he pulled out his rifle and pointed at the mutant's face.\n\"SMASH!\"\nUnlike the naïve Dullahan, Taxi had been through countless battles in the mystic realm. He knew when he should unleash an all-out attack to finish off a strong enemy.\nHe injected the sacred wood bullet into the chamber with yellow lightning energy. Then, he pulled the trigger.\nBOOM\nThe rifle and sacred wood bullet amplified the energy and unleashed an orange laser beam.\nGetting shot in the face, the quasi-immortal's head and upper shoulders melted. His soul was pulverized without a chance to recover.\nJust like that, Taxi claimed the first kill. He then exhaled a long fume of white smoke from his mouth.\n\"Smash!\" (Get them, boys!)\nLearning from their pack leader, the other thunder unicorns transformed into naked humans. As they had prepared freshly-made rifles from the gunsmith workshop, everybody armed themselves and aimed at the sky.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\n49 orange beams ascended to the sky and devoured unlucky mutants in their paths. The proud quasi-immortal mutants fell one after another. However, the majority of them dodged the attack with ease.\nAfter one volley, they instantly downed 6 quasi-immortal mutants and 600 soldiers.\nThe unicorns reloaded their guns and prepared to shoot again. But then, they discovered the problem with their rifles – The gun muzzles were bright red!\n\"SMASH!\" (Someone go fetch new boomsticks! We can't use these again!)\nThe unicorns were smart. They realized that the rifles got overheated after they forcefully injected their yellow lightning energy into the gun chambers. 20 of them kicked the ground and chose to fight in close combat while the rest stayed on the ground, shooting lightning bolts at their enemies instead.\nOne of Taxi's comrades rushed into the store. He ignored the panicking disciples and went to the gunsmith.\n\"Smash!\" (I'll borrow these!)\nThe guy grabbed as many guns as he could and rushed out to supply his friends.\n\"…\"\nThe two mannequins in the workshop only glanced at the naked unicorn man. After which, they shook their heads and continued crafting more rifles and bullets.\n.\nIn the sky, Ricardo and 49 Nightmares didn't bother using Leo's guns. They all transformed into muscular bronze men with black unicorn horns on their foreheads. Strangely, after they had transformed, they all wore a red bandanna and tight bikini underwear.\nSeeing the charging army, Ricardo turned around and made a pose. The others also did the same as if they choreographed the moves. Then, they sexily turned back and smiled at the invaders. Again, the entire team was in sync, busting a move in unison.\n\"…\"\nThe group of quasi-immortal mutants and soldiers had goosebumps. Because of the weird vibe and air of these bronze unicorn men, their movements slowed down by a beat.\nAt that moment, the mannequins on the shopping mall's rooftop struck. They loaded their guns with spirit stones and fired small laser beams at the soldiers behind the quasi-immortals.\nAll recycling center's mannequins stared at their enemies with glowing bloody lenses. Their joints crackled while they reloaded new spirit stone bullets, which were freshly minted from the recycling machine. Because their residual Qi was 100 times thicker than standard spirit stones, these new bullets were slightly better than the regular sacred wood bullets from the gunsmith.\n\"AAAAAHHHH!\"\nBecause the attack was not as flashy as the massive laser, it caught the backline soldiers off guard. Every shot always hit a person.\nA soul transformation mutant's physique was as sturdy as a quasi-immortal cultivator. Although they were shot, none of them died on the spot. Instead, they circulated their elemental essence into their wounds to regenerate their flesh.\nTheir usual techniques would have worked had Hua Jiashan or others used the same guns and bullets. However, the sharpshooters were mannequins of Leo, who were created from his system. Combined with the special spirit stones, the bullets were perfect catalysts for the system mannequins to borrow Leo's power.\nThe wounds on the soul transformation mutants turned black. Instead of mending or recovering, they got infected.\nThey thought they had the superior physique of a demon. They thought they had graduated from being a mortal. However, the contagious flesh-mutating virus from the bullets broke the bubbles and taught them the harsh reality of this universe.\nThe bullets of mannequins could mutate people the same way when they touched objects or living beings!\n\"NOOOOO!!\"\nTheir bodies uncontrollably swelled and bloated. Some of their guts imploded and gushed out from their orifices. Moreover, their nascent souls couldn't be ejected from their fresh bodies!\nThe mannequins leisurely fired more rounds. As they had a hivemind, none of them shot the same person twice.\nAfter launching two volleys, the enemy troops reached them. Two hundred soul transformation cultivators landed on the rooftop while a thousand got behind the shopping mall building. As for the quasi-immortals, they got entangled in close combat against the unicorn men.\nThe mannequins dispersed. They leaped in all directions while they shot more mutants in mid-air. One of them tackled a nearby mutant and put a bullet in the latter's head. Afterward, he showed the most disrespectful behavior by twerking close to the enemy's face during the mutation process.\nNo one had the luxury time to scold the ill-mannered mannequin. Everybody chased after the gun robots in anger.\nUnfortunately, the mannequins didn't know how to fly. As they could only jump and leap, most of them got caught. The mutants pummeled them and attempted to break their bodies into pieces.\nThe mannequins expressionlessly endured the assaults even though various Qi skills and palms crushed their limbs and torso in half. Their bodies reddened. Then, they exploded.\nBlack flame emerged from the self-detonating mannequins and devoured the soul transformation cultivators on top of them. Several hundred demonic cultivators died on the spot.\n\"SMASH!!\"\nThe destruction and the explosions distracted Taxi and Ricardo. Both horsemen bellowed in anger, thinking that they had just lost their comrades.\nBut the next moment, the hidden feature of the system domain was activated. A portion of iron pine logs in the junkyard automatically moved and fell into the acidic liquid of the recycling center's pool. Instead of the pool melting the log into spirit stones, the wood turned into worker mannequins that had died earlier.\nTheir red lens gleamed as all of them retained their memory. Their hivemind also learned from their mistakes and discovered new tactics that they could use.\nCRACK-CRACK\nThe newly respawned mannequins rushed back to where they had died and grabbed their guns. They resumed shooting at the invaders around the shopping mall, protecting Leo's headquarters.\nThe surrounding mutants noticed their emergence. At first, everybody thought they were hidden soldiers from Leo's building. As they also learned from their comrade's mistakes, the mutants threw dao avatar attacks from a long-range, preventing their suicide bomb attack tactic.\nSeveral mannequins exploded into black flame upon destruction. But again, they quickly consumed logs from the junkyard and came back to life.\nOne of the quasi-immoral mutants noticed the commotion. He also spotted how the acid pool produced new mannequins. Despite being in combat against a unicorn man, he ordered his subordinates.\n\"DESTROY THAT POOL AND THAT MACHINE! THEY ARE PRODUCING THE GOLEMS!\"\nTwo hundred soul transformation cultivators descended from the sky and hurled 5,000 fireballs at the structure.\nRUMBLE\nFlame erupted, and the building was caught on fire. However, the pool and the recycling machine were still intact.\nBANG\nSuddenly, a cat-eared mannequin walked out from the shopping mall, wearing the domain's black suit uniform. She also carried a dozen sets of black suits, and she rushed toward the recycling center. Unafraid of random attacks from above, she passed the suit to the newly respawned mannequins.\nBOOM\nOne of the fireballs hit her back. Fortunately, the suit neutralized the damage to her body. Still, the impact staggered her forward.\nAs soon as the clothing store mannequin stumbled, the male mannequins flinched. Their expression turned dark as if a hoodlum assaulted their girlfriend.\nCRACKLE\nDespite being angry, they put on the new uniform. As if the clothing store mannequin knew about their weaknesses, she also made them gloves and cloth masks.\nAfter putting everything on, they became ninjas in a business suit. Everybody returned to the battlefield.\nThe clothing store mannequin nodded in approval and fled to the shopping mall, avoiding the battle. However, several hundred eyes noticed her actions, and they followed after her.\nInstantly, the mutants found the back entrance of the shopping mall.\n\"FOLLOW THAT DAMN GOLEM! KILL EVERYBODY INSIDE!\"\nThe soul transformation mutants threw their attacks at the main building next. More explosions enveloped the shopping mall building. However, the glass windows and the walls were unaffected by their strikes.\nBOOM\nA black statue suddenly blasted out from the backdoor of the shopping mall. She then transformed back to her original size.\nQiang Qiang, the new gargoyle statue, made her debut as Leo's shopping mall guardian. She looked around and opened her four arms. Then, she clenched her fists.\nCRACK\nA domain ability of Qiang Qiang was unleashed. Five hundred soul transformation soldiers above the recycling centers and a dozen men behind the shopping mall were squeezed by something invisible. Their bodies were crushed like pancakes.\nHowever, Qiang Qiang's ability wasn't omnipotent. Despite killing so much, she couldn't use it repeatedly. After releasing her hands, Qiang Qiang's arms cracked. She glanced at her cracking stone arms for a moment and concentrated on healing her new physique.\nWhile healing, one of the invaders recognized her. He screamed.\n\"LADY QIANG QIANG?!\"\n.\n.\n\"Why are they so noisy outside?\"\nGao Yan opened his eyes. He had eaten Leo's Floridian Dantian Pill, and he hadn't fully digested the pill effects yet. However, his cultivation advanced to the soul formation realm, aka the 6th-stage. He was one stage below the soul transformation realm.\nAlthough Gao Yan was not ready to come out of the seclusion, he paused his cultivation schedule and stepped out of his house.\nAs soon as he came out, a quasi-immortal's headless corpse fell from the sky and landed in front of him, splashing blood on his face. Taxi also descended and stomped the dead body for good measure.\nTaxi then noticed Gao Yan. He smiled at the guy.\n\"Smash?\" (What's up, amigo? Did you just wake up?)\nGao Yan wryly smiled, \"What's happening here?\"\nTaxi pointed to the sky. Gao Yan looked up.\n\"Oh.\"\nThe nightmares were in combat against quasi-immortals in the sky while Taxi's unicorns battled another group on the ground. However, thousands of soul transformation mutants rained upon the main store's building.\nA hundred of them rushed toward Gao Yan. One of them summoned his titan dao avatar and was about to punch Gao Yan.\nThe teenager didn't bother looking at the titan avatar. He pulled out a pistol from his belt and pulled the trigger, aiming at the real body of the giant without looking.\nBANG\nLeo's pistol was more powerful than the mass-produced rifles. Even though Gao Yan only loaded sacred wood bullets in his magazine, it had more destructive power than the mannequin's version.\nThe soul transformation mutant died instantly, body and soul!\nBANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG\nAs if Gao Yan's hands were possessed, he rapidly pulled the trigger and adjusted his aim after every shot. Within one second, he emptied the magazine. 14 more mutants fell from the sky.\nGao Yan yawned, but his hands reloaded a new magazine in less than a second. He looked at Taxi while he fired 15 more shots at the sky.\n\"Do I need to fight? I have to go back and cultivate some more?\"\nTaxi shrugged.\n\"Smash?\" (Can you help? We're under manpower here.)\n\"I need more bullets. I have like… 5 more mags, maybe?\"\nCLICK\nAfter finishing that sentence, Gao Yan reloaded the second mag and emptied the chamber in the next second.\nIn a flash, Gao Yan already killed 45 invaders without even looking.\nTaxi smirked at Gao Yan.\n\"Smash!\" (I'll tell my boy to fetch you some ammo.)\n\"Thanks.\"\nTaxi kicked the ground and tackled another quasi-immortal nearby. He and his colleague proceeded to stomp the poor guy to death.\nGao Yan snickered and pulled out a lightsaber. He tossed it in front of him and controlled it with his Qi.\nWHOOM\nThe activated lightsaber floated in mid-air, acting as Gao Yan's flying sword. He reloaded another mag and continued firing.\n\"Hwuaah. I'm kinda sleepy. I want to go back to my dream world and train again.\"\nThe Floridian Dantian Pill was at work. Gao Yan already spent a hundred years in his dream training in various firearms. It was a matter of time before he became immortal John Wick.",

Seeing how underperformed the mannequins were, he frowned.\n\"Why are the mannequins so weak, munya? I thought they were stronger than trashy immortals, munya.\" Complained Mu-Nyang.\nMeowmeow also had the same thoughts. But after taking a better look, he realized something.\n\"Our lord is too far away from us. The mannequins exert their fullest potential. They are strongest when our master is around.\"\n\"But haven't mastered built us a pylon tower for us, munya?\"\nMu-Nyang referred to the crystal tower with the spirit stone heart. It had been supplying this domain with abundant yin-yang Qi. However, compared to Leo's presence, its energy supply was negligible.\nThe angel deeply sighed, \"It's still not enough. The energy consumption of \"Purgatory Flame\" is too great. Think of a battery. When many electrical appliances are active at once, the battery will be rapidly drained. Also…\"\nMeowmeow opened his eyes and stood up. Then, he walked toward the edge of the platform.\n\"Have you felt it?\"\n\"Feel what, munya?\"\nThe angel gazed toward the stars. His expression turned dark.\n\"The eyes that are watching us from above.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe Fenrir and Cathulhu statues widened their eyes. Then, they looked up. Then, they noticed the anomaly. Although the night sky was full of stars, the three detected faint killing intent from far away directed at them.\nThe Fenrir statue instantly recognized the stare. The pair of eyes came from someone from his race.\nThe Fenrir statue bore fangs. He lowered his stance and prepared to shuttle to space. However, the Cathulhu statue jumped and body-pressed the wolf as if a professional wrestler delivering a finishing move.\nThe wolf was stunned and dizzy. His eyes spun.\nThe Cathulhu comically flipped the wolf statue over and pinned him. Then, one of his tentacles counted the fall.\n\"ONE, TWO, THREE! DING-DING-DING! MUNYA!\"\nThe Fenrir statue came back to his senses. He glared at the cat and barked, \"What are you doing, woof?!\"\n\"Our master aren't here, munya. Until he's back, no big fight, munya.\"\n\"…\"\nThe angel nodded in approval, \"He's right, doggy. We're running on a reserve battery right now. Look at my girl. Even though she got an upgrade from me, she can't use her full strength.\nWhile they chatted, a barrage of fireballs, fire lances, flame wheels, and fire hurricanes descended upon Qinag Qiang. She endured the random attacks and came out with a slight crack in her chest.\nNoticing the damage to his subordinate, Meowmeow let out a long sigh.\n\"We're running low on energy. We have to assume that our master won't return any time soon. Let's help them and finish this quickly.\"\nThe angel vanished. He reappeared in the middle of Qiang Baidu's army.\n\"!!!\"\nThe appearance of the giant statue surprised the soul transformation mutants. They shouted and summoned their dao avatars.\nMeowmeow unsheathed a long katana, and a dark dome emerged, covering everybody within Leo's domain. He then swung it once and sheathed the katana.\nWHOOSH\nThe dome of darkness vanished, revealing the result of the attack.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Eh?\"\n2,000 soul transformation mutants and 30 quasi-immortal elites were cleaved in half. They widened their eyes as their bodies split vertically. Moreover, their souls got stuck inside their dying physiques.\nIn one attack, the angel statue cut down 25% of Qiang Baidu's troops!\nThe angel returned to the platform. He let out a long sigh and threw his butt on his throne. He then complained.\n\"I'm out of energy. You two are next.\"\n\"Okay, munya…\"\n\"…Woof.\"\nThe two beast statues seemed hesitant as they didn't want to run out of energy. Still, for the sake of protecting Leo's place, they took action. Both wolf and cat jumped out of the mystic portal platform.\n.\n.\nQiang Baidu glanced at the battlefield while he parried Marc's strikes. The battle did not go well for his side.\nThe horned men teamed up and isolated his quasi-immortal elites to a 3v1 or 2v1 combat. They also used long-ranged weapons, which always erased one or two elite bodyguards per shot.\nIt had been 10 minutes into the fight, but their number was reduced by half. As for the other party's casualty, only the wooden golems were destroyed. Still, every time they were destroyed, they self-exploded, killing a dozen soul-transformation mutants at once.\nAs for the property damage, it was hopeless. The shopping mall building remained intact while the recycling center only suffered from slight burn damage.\nAt this rate, his forces would be wiped out. The humiliation of losing to a tiny force with less than 200 combatants angered him.\n\"FLORIDA MAN!!\"\nMistaking Marc for Leo, Qiang Baidu roared and used his trump card. He pulled out a black pill from his spatial ring and ate it.\nAs soon as the pill entered his stomach, his skin turned black. His physique grew larger while all of his bodily hair fell.\nMarc backed away from Qiang Baidu as he sensed something amiss. From his point of view, Qiang Baidu gave an air of a demonic creature from another world.\nTwo black horns grew from Qiang Baidu's temples. His jaws extended forward like a savage beast. All his muscles bulged while his blood vessels expanded and lengthened. Two demonic wings emerged from his back. As for his legs, the bones and joints transformed, turning into massive goat legs.\nIt took Qiang Baidu only two seconds to transform from a four-armed mutant into a 10-meter-tall four-armed demon with a dog face.\nThe consciousness of Qiang Baidu faded, replaced with pure primal instinct. He howled and charged at Marc.\nMarc's main head left behind an afterimage and teleported two meters behind the demonic werewolf. His red lightning arm pierced through Qiang Baidu's back and unleashed the red tribulation lightning upon him.\nBOOM\nAn explosion occurred. However, it was Marc's arm that exploded. As for Qiang Baidu, he was unharmed.\nThe headless body carried Marc's bastard sword. He hacked down, aiming at Qiang Baidu's neck.\nCLANK\nInstead of lopping off the demon's neck, Marc's precious artifact was broken in half. Moreover, the body flinched\nMarc frowned as he suspected something. While clenching his lost arm, he fired a transparent thunderbolt at Qiang Baidu.\nBZZZ\nThe electricity hit the demon, but it was Marc who took the damage.\n\"I see. An attack reflection domain ability, this is troublesome.\"\nMarc regenerated his lost arm and put his head back to his physical body. Then, he flew toward the inverted flying island, heading to the Dullahan statue in the cemetery.\nThe statue reacted. It moved and jumped out of the cemetery, flying toward its master. Then, the two extended their index finger and gently touched each other's fingertips.\n\"FUSION!\"\nThe horseman statue merged with Marc. The flying island hummed and generated a gravity force, pulling everybody in the sky toward the cemetery. At the same time, Marc emerged as a black knight riding on an armored war horse.\nWhen the transformation finished, Marc didn't pursue Qiang Baidu. He threw away his precious bastard sword and pulled out a long scythe from the saddle's weapon holder. He rotated it over his head to warm up.\nRUMBLE\nThe gravity force of the inverted island had a mind of its own. It directly pulled Qiang Baidu toward the cemetery.\nMarc chased after the demonic werewolf. Even though he couldn't harm the demon, he could isolate the Earth Celestial demon and protect his weaker allies on the battlefield.\n.\nEsen still rested on a beach bed, observing the chaotic battlefield next to the white tree array.\nAlthough Esen seemed lazy, she worked harder than anybody. She had been maintaining a transparent dome, covering the farms and the white tree array.\nThis domain made everything inside invisible. Moreover, it generated an illusion of a burning farmland, tricking the invaders.\nIn addition to the farmland protection, she kept an eye on the unicorns and nightmares on the battlefield. Whenever they got critically injured by the mutants, she secretly dragged them inside the domain and transferred some yin essence to the beasts, healing them in the process. Then, she kicked them out.\nWhile monitoring the battlefield, she glanced at Marc to see how the boy fared against an earth immortal.\nShe was slightly disappointed. She thought that Marc would defeat Qiang Baidu easily, but the latter was abnormal.\n'Which overlord is backing that guy? A demon? A Fenrir? Or both?'\nSeveral names came to Esen's mind, such as Overlord Lucky, Overlord Hein, and Overlord Anuboque. Although she had never met them in the past, she was aware of their existence as her former mentor was one of the overlords as well.\nBecause of the complications and the involvement of galactic entities, Esen figured that Marc might not be Qiang Baidu's opponent this time. She stood up and stretched. Then, she rubbed her throat, sending voice transmission to another subordinate.\n\"Beatrice, how's it going?\"\nThe death knightress Beatrice instantly replied, 'I'm observing the Magpie City at the moment, Your Majesty.'\n\"What about the humans?\"\n'No danger.'\n\"Good. Come back and help your brother. He is fighting an incarnation of an overlord or an entity at the moment. He knows how to kill souls, but he doesn't know how to kill an apostle.\"\n'Understood, Your Majesty. Heading back now.'\nEsen let out a sigh of relief. She looked up, watching over Marc.\nBut as Esen looked up, someone accidentally stepped into her domain again. The next thing she heard was a buzzing hum of a lightsaber cutting through a person's limb.\n\"AAAAAHHHH!\"\nA soul transformation mutant collapsed on his butt after losing two of his arms to Gao Yan. The latter leisurely walked toward his opponent while commanding his flying lightsaber to deflect a fireball from above. He pointed his gun's muzzle at the mutant's head and pulled the trigger.\nBANG\nAnother mutant went down.\nGao Yan turned around and walked out of the invisible domain as if he didn't sense the changes. When he left, Taxi rushed to Gao Yan's side and supplied him with a barrel of unorganized 9mm bullets.\n\"Smash!\" (There you go, boy. Have fun smashing!)\nGao Yan nodded at Taxi, \"Many thanks, senior.\"\nAlthough Gao Yan got more ammo, he still needed to put them in empty magazines first. Without looking at the barrel of ammunition, Gao Yan flickered seven empty magazines over the barrel.\nUsing only his Qi, he commanded the ammo to fill the magazines. In 10 seconds, 105 bullets were ready to use. He took the mags and started blasting holes while he completely left the domain.\nEsen looked at Gao Yan and noticed Thora, who followed Gao Yan around as usual. She turned toward her and deeply bowed. Then, she awkwardly chased after her boyfriend.\nLooking at Gao Yan, Esen felt like she had seen him somewhere before, but she couldn't remember.\n\"Where have I seen that guy? I kinda remember someone with a similar fighting style, but I can't remember…\"\nEsen tilted her head and fell into deep thought for a long time.\n.\n.\nBeatrice returned to the domain an hour later. However, by the time she arrived, the fight was almost over.\nThe Cathulhu statue and Fenrir statue briefly joined the battlefield and killed 3,000 soul transformation cultivators instantly. Then, they left. As for the quasi-immortals, Taxi, Ricardo, Qiang Qiang, and 98 Pony Legion crushed them with Esen's support.\nThe remaining soul transformation mutants were either devoured by random bullets from Taxi's subordinates or mannequin musketeers. As for Gao Yan, he loitered in front of his house and shopping mall, picking off stray mutants in the area.\nThe remaining fight was located on the inverted island above Leo's domain. On the cemetery island, a demonic werewolf continued chasing after Marc in his knight appearance.\nBeatrice flew to the cemetery and landed behind the demonic wolf. She pulled out a 1.5-meter-long blade from her chest. The purple blade emitted a black aura of death and extreme yin essence, which no living being could use.\nIt was the aura of death itself.\nBeatrice slowly took off her blindfold. She calmly opened her eyelids, revealing her pitch-black eyeballs.\nAs soon as Beatrice revealed her eyes, the demon werewolf flinched as if he regained sanity. Qiang Baidu turned around to see the Grim Reaper.\nSHING\nA purple horizontal light flashed and vanished. Beatrice swung her blade the same way Meowmeow did, minus the domain of darkness. Then, the purple blade receded into her chest.\n\"???\"\nQiang Baidu didn't feel anything. But a second later, his body collapsed on the ground lifelessly. Transparent purple particles flew out from his physique as if his soul had disintegrated.\nHis attack reflection ability was ineffective against Beatrice's mysterious blade. Only Esen, Ivy, and Marc were aware of the true terror of this death knight.\nMarc, who was still in his knight armor, lowered his scythe. He didn't do anything fancy other than running around on his war horse, dodging Qinag Baidu's random attacks. He canceled his transformation and smiled at his sister.\n\"Sister Bea, you're back!\"\nBeatrice silently nodded. She revealed a faint smile for a moment before she resumed her usual pokerface. She put back her blindfold clothes and closed her eyes.\n\"You lack training.\"\nMarc slouched his shoulders, \"But I fought hard.\"\n\"You lack training.\"\n\"…\"\nMarc wanted to cry, but he had no tears. He deactivated his domain ability, and the inverted cemetery island vanished.\nSounds of combat ceased, and the night regained its tranquility. No cheer or celebration was heard from the winner's side even though they just defeated an overwhelming army of an immortal.\n.\n.\nMorning\nWHOOSH\nLeo finally returned to the bedroom of his battle bus. He deeply inhaled and treasured the stale air of the master bedroom. As he missed his domain and people, he stepped out of the bus to tell everybody that the daddy was home.\nAs soon as Leo got out of the parking lot building, he found a trace of carnage last night. He also found Esen and her two minions, dragging corpses of weird humanoid creatures toward the junkyard.\n\"Wut da hail happened here?\"",

No Baby Has Been Conceived.\nChapter 193 – Woman Called Cops on Florida Man For Allegedly Sexual-Harassed Her, Made Her Fall in Love with Him, Then Friendzoned Her. No Baby Has Been Conceived.\nLeo inspected the exterior of his buildings. Scars of burn and sword scratches remained visible on the shopping mall's walls, apartments, and the parking lot. Although they posed no threat to the structure's stability, they ruined the aesthetic and the beauty of these modern buildings.\nGazing at these buildings reminded Leo of when he just purchased a brand new car, but some douchbag door-dinged him, leaving behind small scratches on the mint car.\n\"Who did this?!\"\nLeo bellowed and stomped into the shopping mall to check the interior and his workers.\nUpon entering the main store's building, Leo found a stone fountain. His legs froze as he didn't remember building it here.\n\"Lord Florida Man!\"\n\"He's back!\"\n\"We're safe!\"\nLeo pursed his lips. He looked around and found some familiar faces among the crowd.\n\"Wu Buyi!\" Shouted Leo.\nWu Buyi sprinted with all his might. He slid with his knees, bent forward, and kowtowed at the same time. As if he had calculated his strength, the sliding stopped when he arrived in front of Leo. As a result, the alchemist elder invented the sliding kowtow for the first time.\n\"Your loyal servant is here, my lord!\"\n\"Explain the situation?\"\n\"Of course, my lord!\" Wu Buyi stood up and rubbed his hands. He then recounted the last night's incident.\n.\n.\nAt the junkyard, the war veterans, namely the mannequin troopers, sat and rested near the recycling pool. The cracks and damage of their bodies rapidly healed. As for the domain uniforms they wore, they still emitted white smoke as everybody went through a series of bombardments.\nThe gentle clothing store mannequin carried warm towels toward the group. She distributed the towels to the fighters.\nThe boys gazed at her and blushed. All mannequins kept staring at their goddess while she walked around and checked the conditions of her colleagues.\nMeanwhile, non-combatants came out and cleaned the battlefield. Warehouse and granary mannequins got busy transferring, sorting, and filtering useful goods from useless ones. Useless junk, such as regular grain pills, food, used clothes, and common weaponry were thrown into the pool. As for the rest, namely spirit stones, essence stones, rare plants, fruits, meat, books, and artifacts, the mannequins arranged them in the center of the junkyard, waiting for Leo's inspection.\nThat was not all. As there were so many enemies, corpses and blood were harvested and collected in one of the granaries. Esen took charge of this arrangement and relocated farmland crops and other food from the first granary to the second building. As for the first storeroom, she stored buckets of fresh blood and whole corpses. As for the militated and mutated ones, she collected them in spatial rings and put them in the first granary.\nMarc and Beatrice were busy running around and fetching dead bodies outside of Leo's domain. They also watched over the young workers, who came out to help with the clean-up.\nLeo came out of the shopping mall's backdoor and walked toward the junkyard. Wu Buyi trailed behind his master.\nWhen Leo found the piles of new goodies, his foul mood vanished. A bright smile returned to his face.\n\"So much trash to recycle! Excellent!\"\nWu Buyi and young workers from Life Sword Sect sweated profusely while they gazed at the mountains of precious artifacts, spirit stones, and essence stones. They silently cursed Leo in their mind that he treated these treasures as junk.\n\"M-My lord. Those are spirit stones, essence stones, and martial art books. We should at least arrange them properly.\"\nLeo smirked. He walked toward the mountain of spirit stones and spat on it several times, making sure that every marble was baptism by his almighty blessings.\nIn the blink of an eye, all trivial spirit stones evolved into essence stones with the highest quality.\nLeo laughed, \"Now, these balls are no longer trash. Mannequins, my boy! Stash these in one of the warehouses! Store them in some spatial rings or something! We'll use these to pay our slaves next month!\"\nWu Buyi and the human bystanders coughed blood. Although some of them had seen Leo's feat and abilities once, their hearts and minds couldn't comprehend or adapt to the new reality and logic in this place.\nTheir wages were a bunch of saliva-soaked spirit stones? That was the common question in their minds.\nLeo moved to the pile of essence stones next. Instead of spitting on them, he stored everything in his spatial rings. These resources would be useful for the soul stone crafting project in the future.\nAfterward, Leo shifted his attention to the artifacts.\nGiant axes, blade wheels, swords, and spears were common weapons that the Gorr Tribe used in the previous battle. Every piece of weapon was made from a special red ore, which Leo had never seen before.\nLooking at the crimson weapons, Leo scoffed.\n\"Trash!\"\n\"PFFFT!\"\nAgain, Wu Buyi and the young men coughed blood. Their kidneys clenched so hard that their bloody kidney stones gushed out from their pee hole.\nThe pain was unbearable. Every man closed their legs and covered their groins while they shed tears of agony.\nWhile Leo inspected the loot, Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Xu Nuan, and Dongfang Mei rushed out of the shopping mall to greet him. Everybody just recovered from the previous injuries, and they were happy to see their strongest backer again in one piece.\nBut then, Leo approached the mountain of skill books, martial art manuals, and scrolls containing various cultivation methods. He flipped through the content and uttered in a crispy voice.\n\"Trash!\"\n\"…\"\nA line of blood leaked out from the corners of everybody's mouths even though they had bright expressions on their faces. Their livers churned as if Hajime Ippo delivered them a full-blown liver punch to the guts.\nHua Jiashan silently approached Leo. Without saying anything, he stored all books and scrolls in his spatial ring. Then, he calmly brought them to the library building, which he recently built next to Wu Buyi's workshop.\nHan Hao learned from an example. With dull eyes, he gathered all the artifacts in his spatial ring. He then gazed at Leo.\n\"Lord Florida Man. I would like to request permission to build a weapon pavilion for our domain.\"\nLeo didn't bother looking at Han Hao, \"Suit yourself.\"\n\"I'll integrate the contribution system of the Life Sword Sect to the new pavilion.\"\nHan Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Xu Nuan, and Dongfang Mei's eyes gleamed. They bowed in unison, \"We will also help.\"\nLeo waved his hand and shooed them away. The group widely grinned and flew toward the northeast zone of Leo's domain to construct their new weapon pavilion.\nThe weapons and books were all taken away, leaving behind random pills and miscellaneous objects.\nLeo turned around and glanced at Wu Buyi. The latter looked back and forth between Leo and the mountain of pill containers, full of unidentified pills.\nIt was not hard to guess Wu Buyi's intention. Leo snorted.\n\"A man's trash is another man's treasure. I don't plan to experiment or study random junk I picked up from corpses. Do whatever you want with those, but I want you to report to me the recipes and the effects of those pills.\"\nWu Buyi was moved to tears. He kowtowed so hard his butt pointed to the sky.\n\"THANK YOU, MY LORD! PRAISE LORD FLORIDA MAN! PRAISE THE FLORIDA GOD!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi gathered everything and waltzed to his workshop in glee.\nLooking at the obnoxious butt-kisser, Leo shook his head. He turned his attention to the other important \"trash\" that he could use.\nThey were the corpses of mutants.\nWhile Leo admired the mountain of four-armed men, Esen sneaked behind Leo's back. She injected every ounce of her Qi into her fangs and leaped at Leo's nape.\nAs if Leo had an eye on his back, he turned around and grabbed Esen's face. His big palm pressed her nose.\n\"Unhand me, you ingrate!\" Esen flailed her arms, throwing a tantrum.\nLeo gave her a meaningful look and glanced at the dead body. Guessing that Esen might have worked hard to defend his domain, he released her and patted her head instead.\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"Hmph!\" Esen snorted, \"My subordinates and I worked hard. I want compensation!\"\n\"What do you need?\"\n\"I want your blood!\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nEsen was taken aback as she expected a different reaction. She only messed around with Leo for a little revenge for all the bullying. Because of the sudden gentleness and consideration, she blushed, thinking that Leo cared for her.\nBetraying her expectation, Leo bit the tip of his tongue and shoved it in her mouth. Then, he smirked.\n\"Lick it good, brat!\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen's face reddened to the ears from embarrassment and anger. She then bit his finger, but her teeth couldn't even put a dent in his skin or nail.\n\"YOU'RE BULLYING ME AGAIN!?\"\n\"No, I'm rewarding you. Also, your tongue is very soft.\"\n\"!!!\"\nRealizing that Leo teased her, Esen spat Leo's finger out. However, her face and ears were still as red as tomatoes.\n\"Y-Y-Y-You will pay for this humiliation!\"\nLeo smirked and teased her again, \"I'll pay you with my body anytime.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen flinched. Her mind wandered elsewhere as she took Leo's words seriously. Her mind wandered and imagined impossible scenarios.\nSeeing Esen's reaction, Leo laughed and disillusioned her.\n\"I mean, I'll pay you with my blood. What were you thinking?\"\n\"!!!??\"\nWhite smoke came out from Esen's crimson ears and face. She covered her eyes with her hands and sprinted away in embarrassment and shame.\nLooking at the flustered elf, Leo snickered. Teasing this spoiled girl reminded him of the good times he had with his close friends on Earth. Unfortunately, after coming to this world, he couldn't find anybody who he could consider as a friend. So far, only customers and subordinates were around him.\nA bold and rebellious girl came at the right time. She was strong enough to overcome his immortal cancer cells, and she treated him as her equal. Thus, he couldn't help but prank or tease her every time they were together.\nAfter Esen had left, Leo turned his attention to the main course. He rubbed his hands.\n\"So many yin fluid and pill ingredients. I'm rich!\"\nHe giggled like a hyena. Then, he proceeded to collect corpses to his spatial rings.\n.\nStuffing a thousand whole corpses into a storage ring was easy. However, the process of adding them all into spatial rings was tedious.\nAs spatial rings were programmed to recognize a dead body as a unique object, the ring owner had to manually add the corpse into a ring by using their Qi as storage rings automatically rejected living beings. Shoving dead bodies into a storage ring at once always resulted in rejection.\nLeo sat there, dragging one corpse after another into a ring. The first hundred bodies were easy as Leo was enthusiastic. However, after repeating the process 2,000 times, he was bored.\n'I should have delegated someone to do this. Why am I doing this?'\nHe stopped working and rechecked the remaining dead bodies in the junkyard.\nThe mutants with gunshot wounds were gone. The rest were corpses with missing body parts. A few were burnt to a crisp.\nAs Leo inspected the remaining corpses, something caught his eye. One of the dead bodies was a 10-meter-tall werewolf.\nLeo had a history with the Fenrir race. He checked the body up close.\nSuddenly, Leo received a system notification message.\nDING!\n<Detecting Earth Fate Crystal!>",

He Said During Interview, “This Casual Racist Will Attempt the Ranked Mode If Necessary!”\nChapter 194 – Florida Man Claimed Innocence After His Worshipers Declared a Racial War Against Elves Under His Name. He Said During Interview, \"This Casual Racist Will Attempt the Ranked Mode If Necessary!\"\nFate Crystal Tutorial\nFate Crystals are profound artifacts that created the universe. By collecting at least seven fate crystals of the same quality, the collector can gain new strength, depending on the crystal's quality.\nEarth Fate Crystals are useless to you. However, it will be nice to collect them for future usage. Maybe someone around you can find them useful?\nBe warned. You are not the only one who searches for these crystals. There will be competitors, and they are not your run-in-a-mill pushovers.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (2/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/1)\nSecondary Objectives:\n1 – Kill 7 Immortals (2/7)\n2 – Upgrade Humble General Store to Shopping Mall (1/1)\nPrimary Mission Rewards: Gnosis of Earth Fate, True Earth Fate Crystal, Ring of Entity Upgrade Feature\nSecondary Mission Rewards: 7 Lucky Draws, 777 Free Tickets\n.\nSo far, Leo obtained two fate crystals – One from Yan Xiang's secret treasury and one from Acku, the orc. He also killed a nameless immortal at Cauliflower City and Groruk in the Fate Arena.\nSuddenly, the system detected a fate crystal from this giant mutant corpse. Leo was delighted.\n\"Lucky me! I'll take it!\"\nLeo reached out to grab the giant mutant, planning to dissect it.\nSuddenly, Qiang Baidu's corpse snapped open his eyes. He stared at Leo.\nLeo looked back at the giant wolf-head four-armed giant. He frowned for a moment before he gently grabbed the latter's nape with his right hand. His left hand firmly grasped Qiang Baidu's shoulder.\n\"…Oh. You surprise me. This ain't Mortuary Assistant. We don't welcome ghosts here.\"\nWithout confirming Qiang Baidu's life and death, Leo yanked the head.\nSWUA\nWith a forceful pull, Leo ripped Qiang Baidu's head and shoulders apart.\n\"Dead bodies are best dead. No hidden survivor here.\"\nLeo flipped Qiang Baidu's head and grabbed his demon horn. He pulled it up to see the giant's dog head.\nTo Leo's surprise, the head seemed alive. The dog head muttered.\n\"I remember you. You were at Fate Stadium.\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows. He was sure that Qiang Baidu was dead. However, something was not right about this dead body.\nMoreover, only people who had been at the Fate Stadium should know him. This guy's testimony revealed that he was not Qiang Baidu.\n\"You mess with the wrong overlord, Florida Man. Your death is warranted!\" The head threatened Leo.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"You don't need to know. You and your people will live in misery forever, waiting for your doom.\"\nLeo hated people who pretended to be mysterious. He recounted the deeds he had done at the stadium and came up with a guess.\n\"You're the boss of those stupid mutts, I assume. I see that this guy has a puppy face.\"\nBeing insulted, the head of Qiang Baidu became savage. His brows wrinkled while he bored his fangs.\n\"YOU'RE COURTING DEATH, NU'EARTHE! I'VE CONFIRMED YOUR PLANET! A MILLION DIETIES WILL DESCEND UPON YOUR REALM AND DESTROY EVERYTHING! WE'LL FEAST UPON YOUR CHILDREN! YOUR WOMEN WILL BECOME SOW SLAVES, AND WE WILL ENSLAVE YOU FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY! YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE YOUR LOVED ONES BEING TREATED AS PUBLIC TOILET! YOU, NU'EARTHE, WILL-\"\nSMASH\nLeo heard enough. He squeezed his hand and crushed the giant head's skull. Qiang Baidu's brain imploded.\nAfter exploding the severed head, a shining grain emerged from Qiang Dongbai's brain. It floated freely for a few seconds before it vanished into Leo's alien ring.\nDING\n<You have obtained Earth Fate Crystal.>\n.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (3/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/1)\n.\nFour more to go, Leo almost needed to work a little harder.\nHowever, the system notification messages hadn't ended yet. New messages followed, warning Leo of new major conflicts.\n<Player \"Overlord Pochi\" of Fenrir Tribe has marked you as his sworn enemy.>\n<Player \"Overlord Milo\" of Fenrir Tribe has marked you as his sworn enemy.>\n<Player \"Overlord Max\" of Fenrir Tribe has marked you as his sworn enemy.>\n<The Fenrir Tribe has declared the Extinction War against you!>\n<Every 3 months, 100 representatives of your forces and 100 representatives from the Fenrir Tribe's forces will be sent to a battlefield in Fate Stadium.

Your system buildings will receive overall attribute debuffs when your sworn enemies or their forces enter your world. Vice versa, their system's buildings will be inflicted with debuffs if you or your subordinates invade their worlds.>\n<A new event quest has been generated.>\n.\nWar of Extinction – Overlord Pochi, Overlord Max, Overlord Milo VS Florida Man\nBackgrounds: Three Fenrir Overlords have declared war against you because of the recent conflicts. Even though they have lived longer than you and acquired \"System\" before you did, they still abuse their authority and attempt to remove you from the Player List.\nDifficulty Evaluation: You lack manpower, and your system hasn't been upgraded to show its full potential yet. Your domain is vulnerable to surprise attacks and rapid invasions. Your battle prowess is your only advantage. As for the rest, the Fenrir Tribe is superior to you in every way. The key to winning this war is you and how you can catch up to the Fenrir Tribe's technologies, manpower, territory, and army quality.\nVictory Condition: Kill Overlord Pochi, Overlord Max, and Overlord Milo.\nDefeat Condition: You died.\nSide Objectives: Complete any of these objectives to earn big rewards.\n1. Destroy or capture at least 3 planets of your sworn enemies. (0/10)\n2. Destroy or capture at least 10 mystic realms of your sworn enemies. (0/10)\n3. Destroy or capture one of your sworn enemy's home planet. (0/1)\n4. Win 10 Seasonal War Games (0/10)\n5. Win 3 Annual War Games (0/3)\n6. Win 1 10-Year War Game. (0/1)\n7. Kill a relative of your sworn enemies (0/1)\nRewards: One UR-Guaranteed Universal Draw\n.\nThe changes shocked Leo. His expression turned dark when he read the details about the war.\nThis complicated things. He already had a hard time dealing with the PVP feature. Adding this to the picture, Leo's life difficulty changed from super-easy mode to slightly easy mode.\n\"Eh, invading me? Ha! Sure! This casual racist will try the ranked mode if necessary! Oh, wait. Is the lifespan stealing feature still there?\"\nDING\n<Please note. The newbie protection period is over. Please gather lifespan by using the store features or do it your \"old\" way.>\n\"…\"\nThat was enough to confirm that Leo could no longer abuse his store domain system anymore. He let out a long sigh.\n\"Nothing I can do. Back to drugs, I guess. Well, I have plenty of materials. Also, how are my sub-quests?\"\nLeo rechecked the other quests that he needed to complete. He opened the quest menu.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phrase 1/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phrase.\nPhrase Completion Rewards: 100,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Building), and Increase Sub-Building's Max Level to 12\nPhrase One Tasks (8/10 Completed)\n- Evolve Humble General Store into a Shopping Mall. (Done)\n- Move any building into the main store's building. (Done)\n- Set up a new store in the main store's building. (Done)\n- Complete a mystic realm expedition once. (Done)\n- Upgrade any building to level 10. (Done)\n- Harvest at least 10,000 of any crops from Basic Farmlands. (Done)\n- Concoct at least 10,000 pills by using Alchemy Workshop.

(Done)\n*For each completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo only needed to wait one day to get the last quest done. He also gathered 9 lucky draws for buildings and 9 lucky draws for automatons. If he could get one more, he could do the 10+1 draw and get something new for his domain.\nAs there was nothing he could do, Leo looked around to inspect the property damage. He wondered if any building needed to be repaired.\nLeo toured his domain. After walking around the farms and apartments, he found nothing unusual, except a missing monster.\nHe could not find Cat anywhere. Usually, the glutton cat-wannabe would have clung toward him and tasted his skin whenever she had a chance.\n\"Where's that damn nom-nom plant?\"\n.\n.\nFrozen Fire City\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nCat chewed a dead mutant, who belonged to the base guard squad that Qiang Baidu had left behind. While eating, she followed Ivy, using her as a shield.\nIvy didn't mind it. She already slaughtered all remaining four-armed mutants in this city, and she was on her way to Esen's former mansion.\nUpon reaching the underground mansion, Ivy entered the building and searched for the remaining armor and weapons. She then found a hundred pieces of random armor parts, sitting and collecting dust in the treasury room.\nIvy smiled as she understood the true value of these dusty scraps. She collected them in her spatial rings and emptied the room.\n\"I guess Her Majesty didn't have enough time to get THAT.\"\nAfter the room was emptied, Ivy found a hidden door cover. She opened it and found stairs toward their secret room.\nIvy took this opportunity to take off her blindfold. She opened her eyelids and revealed her eye sockets, devoid of physical eyes. In the blank eye sockets, two purple fireballs were ignited.\nHer young and pretty face reverted into a human skull. The smooth flawless skin underneath her robes disappeared as if they were an illusion.\nUpon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Ivy in her skeleton form gazed at a black grassland cemetery. At the ceiling of this underground level, a small green stone illuminated the entire floor and provided yin and yang Qi to nourish the black immortal grasses.\nTombstones and wooden crosses riddled the beautiful grasses. None of them had a name on it, yet blossomed immortal grass flowers remained behind on every tombstone and cross.\n\"It has been a long time, my comrades.\" Uttered Ivy. She remembered the days when she and her fallen comrades were together as if it were yesterday.\nAlthough they had fallen, it didn't mean that Ivy couldn't bring them back. Esen and liches always respected the dead as they got a more peaceful rest than living as an undead. Thus, they chose not to resurrect them unless they needed to.\nBecause of the recent development and the invasion of immortals, Esen and Ivy realized that they lacked manpower. Thus, bringing the old comrades back was necessary.\n\"I'm sorry. I have to wake you up from your slumber. May your souls forgive me… KARMA BESEECH THEE, ARISE!\"\nRUMBLE\nThe cemetery's ground shook. The immortal grasses instantly withered while the immoral grass flowers turned into dust as they were sacrificed for this spell.\nA hundred skeleton arms emerged from the soil. The arms pushed the ground and lifted their main bodies out of the ground.\nSimilar to Ivy, purple fireballs floated in their eye sockets. Their jaws and their perfect white teeth clattered as if they were angry that their peaceful rest was interrupted.\nAll skeletons glared at Ivy, yet they didn't emit killing intent or express their anger. Instead, they waited for her explanation.\nIvy let out a long sigh. She waved her cane and uttered, \"This will be faster. I'll transfer my memory to you.\"\nA hundred purple strings came out from Ivy's forehead and connected with the skeletons' foreheads. Her memory flowed into them, showing the recent events that she had been through.\nThe skeletons witnessed the fight scenes between Ivy and quasi-immortal mutants. They also saw Esen's current appearance, who resembled the person who killed Esen and made her an undead.\nEverybody still remembered that Esen's mother killed her as Esen had disgraced the high elf council by protecting the other races. They still hated the elves that turned her into one of them.\nIvy then roused them.\n\"As you have witnessed, the new enemies must have a connection with a demonic realm. And as you all know, demonic realms belong to Fenrir Overlords. And do you remember who their real masters are?\"\nRUMBLE\nThe skeletons exploded their killing intent. They still remembered the humiliation they suffered when the elves threw them into this world and trapped them with the undead curse. Hearing about the underlings of the elves and their existence enraged them.\nOne of the skeletons opened its jaw. He produced a human language.\n\"Who shall we serve? Her Majesty Esen… or the new lord?\"\nIvy gave them a meaningful look. She made her stance clear.\n\"The Holy One - Lord Florida Man is Her Majesty Esen's savior. He will also free us from the elf's blasphemous curses as he has already proved himself! Do you know that the Holy One has lifted the undead curse from Her Majesty Esen?\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\n\"He can do the same to us! He is the savior of our people! Follow me, my comrades. We will swear allegiance to the Holy One and support Her Majesty Esen! They will free us from this curse! With his lead, our revenge draws near!\"\nRUMBLE\nThe skeletons emitted even more killing intent, shaking the entire underground level. Everybody roared as if angry beasts had been unleashed.\nTheir roar caused the ceiling stone to fall and land in front of Ivy. She picked it up.\n\"I almost forgot about this. What was it called again?\"\nOne of the skeletons laughed and reminded Ivy.\n\"That's earth fate crystal, Archlich Ivy. We commonly use that to suppress the elf's curses from spreading.\"\n\"Ah, I remember.\"\nIvy nodded and put the fate crystal in her spatial ring. She also informed the others, \"We probably don't need this anymore. Let's report our resurrection to Her Majesty and the Holy One. Then, we'll discuss what to do next.\"\nThe 100 skeletons roared. 30 of them released their black Qi, transforming into skull knights in black armor. 40 of them created lich robes and summoned their canes. As for the rest, they pulled out long black scythes from their chests and summoned black skull armor on their bodies. After donning themselves in armor, they generated a black hooded robe to cover their gear.\nThe newly emerged death knights, archliches, and grim reapers were ready for the new age and new master.",

The Immigrants Were Originally Broke When They Crossed Borders.\nChapter 195 – Florida Man Scammed Illegal Migrants by Accepting Them into His House, Offer Them Legal Jobs, And Robbed Them Afterward. The Immigrants Were Originally Broke When They Crossed Borders.\nMagpie City\nThe battle at Leo Domain was visible from this city. Tang Xuan and Tang Tian observed the battle all night. Even after the battle was concluded, they remained vigilant.\nIn the morning, one of the Tang Clan's members went out to scout the battlefield. He kept a respectable distance and spied on the unicorns and nightmares' movements.\nThe beasts reverted back to their beast appearances. They returned to their barn, recuperating after a rough battle. As for the aftermath, the cleanup team came out from Leo's store and handled the job.\nRealizing that the battle was over, the spy returned to Magpie City and reported his findings.\nWhen Tang Xuan heard that Leo's subordinates vanquished the massive army of quasi-immortals and soul-transformation mutants, he was overjoyed. He ordered his people to pack their things to visit Leo.\n.\nIn the afternoon, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian, along with his first caravan, arrived at the border of Leo's domain. As they showed Leo their utmost respect, they traveled on food and approached the domain openly.\nWhen the group crossed the border, patrolling disciples of the Life Sword Sect spotted them. They came to greet the visitors. Among the disciples, Yao Qiqi was one of them.\nYao Qiqi didn't get to do anything in the previous battle due to her size and her age. Nobody allowed this loli goddess to step onto the battlefield as she was too precious.\nIn the aftermath, Xu Nuan allowed her to tag along with the patrolling unit to give her something to do. She had been working as a moral support for the patrol unit since this morning.\nWhen Yao Qiqi spotted the guests, she ran toward them to greet them.\n\"Hello, senior! Welcome to Florida Domain! We have the best alligator steaks, rare potatoes, and pinnacle-graded elemental pills for sale!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan brightly smiled as he found the girl cute. As for Tang Tian and their subordinates, they were taken aback by her assertiveness and sales pitch. Their clan was famous for their alchemists and poison alchemy techniques. Thus, trying to sell a pill to them was the same as selling cans of cola to a Pepsi factory.\nBehind the two Tangs, Jin Yong, who had become Tang Tian's disciple, was interested in Yao Qiqi. He was the second person who discovered her true cultivation base after Tang Xuan.\n\"This place has grown a lot since my last visit! When I was working at the Life Sword Sect as a part-timer, there weren't many buildings around here. This girl, too, is quite strong. Senior Florida Man cultivated her well.\"\n\"W-What?!\"\nAs Jin Yong mentioned Yao Qiqi's strength, the others were surprised. They then stopped treating her as a child and scanned her dantian.\nGolden core cultivators and weaker servants failed to measure her strength. As for the others, they were flabbergasted. Tang Tian even dropped his jaw. This girl reminded him of his dead disciples.\nWhen Tang Tian was young, he had met so many promising individuals. However, most of them died young. This harsh world was unforgiving for talented youngsters as adults were prone to jealousy. Most of them died mysteriously, but Tang Tian was aware that the Ouyang, Situ, and Yan Clan murdered them before they could grow stronger.\nIn the end, cautious disciples of his, namely Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei, managed to survive while hiding behind the others. They weren't on the big clan's radars.\nSeeing Yao Qiqi, Tang Tian felt bad for her. He believed that Situ Nantian or Ouyang Zi would send their best assassins after her without fail. He had to do something to protect this girl from those nasty men.\n\"Little girl,\" Tang Tian crouched in front of her, \"Who is your master? Is he or she around?\"\n\"My master?\" Yao Qiqi brightly smiled and pointed at the shopping mall building. \"I have multiple masters! Mommy Xu Nuan is my mother and my first master. Grandma Dongfang Mei is my second master. Also, Grandpa Florida Man is my savior and my third master! My grandma said that I should respect him as my grandfather. Do you know that I like my grandpa the most? When I grow up, I'll marry my grandpa!\"\n\"…\"\nTang Tian had a wry smile on his face. He then glanced at his father as he had a bad feeling about this.\nTang Xuan and Jin Yong remained expressionless as they had met Leo before. He didn't believe that Leo was such a degenerate person who would be sexually attracted to a little girl. Instead, they believed that the girl was educated and nurtured well in a peaceful and loving environment.\nHowever, his followers had another idea.\n\"Patriarch! This Florida Man is too vulgar! How dare he seduce such an innocent little girl! We must protect her and take her away from that pedophile!\"\n\"Yes, patriarch! He is worse than the Murong Clan and their Joyous Yin-Yang Sect! At least, those dual cultivators don't touch children!\"\nYao Qiqi overheard it and pouted, \"You are rude, mister! Angel Florida Man is my life-saver! He saved my mother's life! He saved my grandmother! He saved my friends! He's my savior!\"\n\"…\"\nNobody dared to retort as the girl seemed angry. They looked at each other, gesturing with their eyes so that their comrades would do something.\nTang Xuan coughed and changed the subject.\n\"Little girl, could you guide us to see your grandfather? We're from the Tang Clan, and we would like to discuss our migration. We would like to seek shelter in his domain.\"\nYao Qiqi was excited, \"Are you moving here, too? This is great! We can have more slav-I mean friends!\"\nNobody noticed the brief change of expression on Yao Qiqi's face when her dao avatar almost possessed her. Everybody smiled, thinking that she bit her tongue.\n.\nThe group of 100 people arrived in front of Leo's shopping mall. They were not all of Tang Clan's members as they were the representatives of the group to evaluate the situation.\nBecause all the elders were busy, nobody was there to welcome them.\nYao Qiqi advised them, \"Grandfather Florida Man is busy at the moment. I'll go tell them that you're here. Also, if sister Esen shows up, you should talk to her instead. She's grandfather's best friend!\"\nNobody hated a cheerful little girl. Their hearts were cleansed, and they temporarily forgot about this cruel world.\nYao Qiqi then excused herself and returned to patrol duty and play with the other young disciples of Life Sword Sect. Tang Xuan and the men all stood in front of the shopping mall with no one accompanying them.\nThe group took this opportunity to look around. Their eyes were attracted to the parking lot and the flying island above them at first. It only took them a minute to notice another landmark.\nBeyond the parking lot structure, a crystal tower trekked through the sky. It was the second tallest structure in Leo's domain after the shopping mall elevator, which connected to the floating island.\nTang Xuan and Tang Tian widened their eyes in shock. They kicked the ground and flew toward the pylon tower as they sensed something nostalgic.\nWhen they arrived, they almost fell on their knees.\n\"Spirit Stone Heart?!\"\n\"I-I-It's massive!\"\nBoth had never seen anything like this. They had seen spirit stone hearts, but they were not even half the size of this pylon tower.\nAs cultivators, their legs automatically moved closer. They walked toward the foot of the tower. However, as they got closer, their legs got wobbly.\nThe pylon tower pushed them away with its residual forces. None of them could reach even the outer layer.\nThe outer layer featured a thousand white cushions for cultivators to sit on. A few of them were occupied as a few off-duty workers sat there, cultivating the yin-yang energy from the tower.\nLooking at the young workers, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian were envious. They reattempted to reach the outermost layer of the seats. But again, they were pushed back.\nWhile the two Tangs were helpless, one of the workers noticed them. He stood up and saluted them.\n\"Senior. This place is restricted to the Florida Domain's employees. If you're not an employee, you cannot cultivate here.\"\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan nodded in understanding while Tang Tian drooled. The latter couldn't wait to join Leo's side.\n\"Thank you for the information, young friend. Then, please excuse us.\" Tang Xuan saluted back.\n\"No problem. I hope you will join us, too.\"\nTang Xuan was impressed by the humbleness of the workers there. He believed that Leo nurtured them well.\nAs Tang Xuan and Tang Tian couldn't do anything there, they turned around to head back. However, before they could go back, they ran into Leo.\n.\nLeo had been walking around his domain as he was in the middle of repairing the roads. He also helped the workers pick up random corpses that they overlooked.\nWhile making his way back to his shopping mall, Leo found a large group of visitors waiting for him in front of the store. He also detected Tang Xuan and Tang Tian near his pylon tower.\nCurious about what they were here for, Leo went to see the two Tangs first.\nHe waved his hands to say hi.\n\"I thought you died during the chaos at Cauliflower City. Hell broke loose, eh?\"\nTang Xuan wryly smiled. He somewhat wanted to blame Leo for causing mayhem after the tournament. Still, everything was Yan Xiang's fault, so he kept quiet about the incident.\n\"Yes, it has been a while.\" Tang Xuan bowed. \"But I'm here with a different purpose this time. I hope that you can lend me ears.\"\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\"I would like to join your domain and worship you as our lord. I hope you can take us under your wings.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows. He didn't expect someone to surrender this soon.\n\"I think it's too early… wait.\"\nLeo almost declined the offer. Suddenly, he recalled that his domain required more men, especially soldiers. After all, invasions from other planets might become a common occurrence.\nFor the sake of the future war, Leo changed his mind.\n\"Are you here to serve me?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Yes, senior.\"\n\"I have to warn you though. You'll be working here from 9 to 5. You get two days off every week, and your pay will be essence stones, made by me. You may use your hard-earned essence stones to purchase grain pills from me if you need them. As for cultivation resources, I'll randomly distribute them to you if you show promising results in your cultivation. Is that okay?\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nThis employee welfare was new to them. In their world, servants were expected to work 25 hours a day until they died. No one was allowed to sleep or ask for a day off. Moreover, cultivation resources were mostly exclusive to the executives, not the employees or servants.\nTang Tian found these terms too good to be true. He knelt on both knees.\n\"Junior Tang Tian greets Lord Florida Man! I promise that I'll work my hardest!\"\nTang Xuan glanced at his son and wryly laughed. He didn't care for the cultivation resources, day offs, or wages. He was more interested in the pylon tower.\n\"Then, could you allow us to cultivate near that Spirit Stone Heart?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Everybody under me is free to do whatever you want during your day off. Of course, you can cultivate near that tower if you want.\"\n\"Then, our lives will be in your care, including our clansmen and the people from the Sixth Element Sect.\"\n\"Huh? I thought it was just you two.\"\nTang Xuan laughed, \"When I said \"WE\", I meant my entire clan and sect. Also, we have about 2,000 people. We only bring 100 people here for today. Tomorrow, we'll inform the others and have them migrate here.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Oh, do you have a place for us to take shelter? You don't have to prepare a house or anything. We will build our dwellings anywhere as long as you give us permission.\"\nLeo facepalmed. He had a headache as he didn't want these people to suddenly erect a slum in his domain. As this matter involved 2,000 people, Leo came up with a new idea.\n\"You know what? You can take shelter in that building first, but you're not allowed to build anything yet. Tomorrow, I'll do something about it.\"\nLeo pointed at the parking lot building. As there were many empty floors, these people could use them as temporary shelters for the time being.\nHe could have purchased more RV vans for these new guys. However, it was not the time since they had never proved their usefulness to Leo yet.\n\"No problem, senior!\" Tang Xuan widely smiled. He had no issue living in the strange building with no door or windows. After all, he didn't need to sleep or eat to live. He just wanted a roof to cover his head whenever he wanted to rest.\n\"…\"\nSince the guy seemed to be too happy about it, Leo came up with an idea to extort them.\n\"By the way, I forgot to tell you. If you want an RV house like the others, you will have to work here for at least ten years. You can hasten that process by being stronger than one of those horses outside and pay me 10,000 years of lifespan for the RV.\"\n\"…Eh?\"",

Tang Xuan, Tang Tian, and the people from the Tang Clan were added to Leo's employee list, enabling them to use Leo's facilities.\nAs Leo had plans for the domain, he forbade Tang Xuan from building anything inside his domain. However, their clan could do anything they wanted outside of his official territory.\nTang Xuan was pleased. He relayed his order and let his people construct their new shelters right away. As for the weak, elders, women, and children, he sent them to the parking lot building for the time being as they needed a place to rest.\nAs all members of the Tang Clan were cultivators, they had no issue living near the pylon tower. In fact, they loved the parking lot due to the open space and airflow. Even though they had no bed or room, they didn't care.\nThe food issue was also not an issue. Most cultivators sustained on grain pills. Only children relied on hard food as they still needed natural nutrition to grow.\nPeople from the Tang Clan's group rushed back to inform the others in the Magpie City. Then, in the late afternoon, more people moved into the domain as planned.\nLeo got busy welcoming and adding them to the employee list for the rest of the day.\n.\nThe next day\n\"What the hell is this, Tang Xuan?\" Leo stood next to Tang Xuan, gazing at the crowd of immigrants. Something was not right about them.\nMass of people kept coming to Leo's domain non-stop. Leo had been counting his new employees, but the number exceeded the promising quota.\nTang Xuan sweated profusely. He also didn't expect this development.\n\"I'm so sorry, sir. I didn't think this through. It seems that the commoners from the Magpie City and other cities have heard about you.\"\nNot only did the Tang Clan and Sixth Element Sect move in, the commoners from the Magpie City and refugees from various places flocked to Leo's place. Regardless of their cultivation background, they deemed Leo as the safest place on the continent.\n\"The commoners?\" Leo frowned. \"I need capable workers, not freeloaders.\"\nTang Xuan wryly smiled and explained. \"Commoners are roots of cultivators like us. Without them, we wouldn't have existed. At least, we should support them and let them grow as cultivators, don't you think?\"\n\"…From our agreements, I can only take you in, not them.\"\n\"Look. They bring their family and children along. Will you send them away, sir?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had more headaches to deal with. As commoners got mixed in the people, Leo couldn't take them all. Still, they brought in their children and families, making the situation complicated.\n\"Fine. But they can't stay within my center domain. Let them live elsewhere but here or they will accidentally mutate. My domain is too toxic for regular people.\" Leo gave up.\nNoticing Leo's generosity, Tang Xuan was moved. He hurried and assisted Leo.\n\"I'll tell my people to arrange a place for them, sir.\"\n.\nIn the end, the commoners gathered at the west of Leo's domain, taking spaces between the Magpie City and Leo's territory. The Tang Clan and the Sixth Element Sect took the east so that they would not be involved with the mixed-in newcomers.\nAs for the south, thunder caimans, a contaminated river, and the presence of a white tree array deterred the immigrants. No one dared to step foot in this territory.\nThe same applied to the extinguished magma field to the north. There were still lava badgers lingering in the area. Moreover, Leo's junkyard and recycling center operated close to the north field. It was too dangerous for the commoners to move there.\nThe segregation settled in peace after Leo explained the complications of his domain to the commoners.\nLeo stood in front of the crowd of commoners while the new guys from the Tang Clan stood on the sides, listening to Leo's new announcement.\n\"Please remember that my domain is very toxic to regular humans. The north, the south, the center, and the east are off-limit to you unless you're a cultivator. The north belongs to little monster beasts, and the land cannot be reclaimed at the moment. The center is where my domain is, and it's full of monsters and Qi. The east side is exclusive to the Tang Clan and the Sixth Element Sect for the time being since they have come here first. As for the south, don't go there. There's nothing to see but alligator monsters and a contaminated river… That's the general geographic and usable terrain here. Next… about my store…\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned an exception, glints appeared in the commoners' eyes. They silently listened to the regulations until the end.\nAfter Leo finished explaining the rules and their duties, he allowed them to ask questions.\n\"Anybody doesn't understand about what I said?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Yes, sir!\" One of the commoners shouted.\n\"Ask away!\"\n\"You mentioned that only cultivators can access the central district. How do we become a cultivator?\"\nLeo answered without thinking much. \"You just need to be able to cultivate. That's it.\"\n\"How can we cultivate, sir?\"\nLeo shrugged. \"Get a cultivation resource.\"\n\"From where, sir?\"\nHearing that question, Leo paused. His instinct cried that a major opportunity arose, and he needed to grasp it. Thus, he gave them hope.\n\"You may exchange your lifespan for some cultivation resources. Though, I can't sell you essence stones to you yet since it can kill you.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe commoners murmured and looked at each other in excitement. The front-most adult man raised his hand.\n\"How much does it cost, sir?!\"\n\"20 Years of lifespan per pill for one elemental grain pill.\"\n\"C-Can we check our lifespan, sir?!\"\n\"Sure.\"\nLeo opened their lifespan menu for the crowd of commoners without thinking. Again, he raised a commotion.\nThe commoners had never seen a system screen before. When blue screens showed up and told them their remaining time, they were speechless. Still, everybody caught on to what they needed to do.\n\"Sir! I would like to buy one of your pills!\"\n\"Me, too! I'll take two for my child and myself, sir!\"\n\"I want one for my grandfather!\"\n\"I-I-I want the cheapest one, sir! I only have 15 years to live! At least, I want my descendants to live a better life than mine!\"\nThe gathering crowd almost rioted. They pushed others and tried to get close to Leo. Fortunately, the Tang Clan's members managed the crowd and got them to form queues.\nAs so many people wanted his pills, Leo had no choice but to sell them. He allowed them to visit his shopping mall for the time being.\nIt was a mistake. 2,000 regular people flooded into his shopping mall and fought for his grain pills.\n.\n.\n<You have sold Pinnacle-Grade Fire Grain Pill for 20 Years of Lifespan.>\n<You have sold Pinnacle-Grade Poison Grain Pill for 20 Years of Lifespan.>\n<You have sold Immortal Grass for 10 Years of Lifespan.>\n<You have sold…>\nLater that day, Leo stood in front of his supermarket section, collecting YOL from his customers. They came here to acquire basic cultivation resources for their children, exchanging their lifespan for opportunities.\nLeo didn't stop them. He only warned people with low lifespans not to spend too much.\nA hundred people buying one pill each wasn't an issue. However, two thousand commoners flooding his shopping mall at once to get multiple pills was troubling. Leo called over some disciples from the Life Sword Sect to help him restock the supermarket as products flew off the shelves at a rapid rate.\nThe people from the Sixth Element Sect also mixed among the customer crowd. Jin Yong recommended the poison grain pills to his colleagues, and they rushed to the store to grab some as well.\nEverything happened so fast. Within one hour, Leo's grain pills were out of stock. He was forced to close the mall for the day until his grain pills were properly restocked.\nMost commoners got their desired pills for their family members. Alchemists of the Sixth Element Sect managed to snag poison grain pills to increase their poison element proficiency. However, a few didn't get anything, so they had to wait for the next opportunity.\nAfter closing the store, Leo counted his profits. He checked his lifespan.\n<Current Lifespan: 1,641,544 Years…>\nHis lifespan almost tripled!\n\"…Wow.\"\nLeo couldn't believe what he had just done. He just wanted to kill his time for the day to wait for the quest to finish, but he ended up working for so long that he forgot about time.\nThe phase one quest was completed yesterday. However, Leo didn't get a chance to collect the rewards.\nAfter the store was closed, Leo took this opportunity to grab the tickets and rewards.\nDING\n<You have completed the Entity Fate Crystal Quest (Phrase 1/13)!>\n<You have received 100,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Building)!>\n<Your Sub-Building Maximum Level has been increased to 12!>\nIn summary, Leo obtained 10 Lucky Draw (Building), 10 Lucky Draw (Automaton), one SR Lucky Draw (Building), some lifespan, and a new perk in total. He was ready to dib his hand into a gacha rabbit hole.\nLeo opened the gacha system menu. Without hesitation, he navigated to the lucky draw section. He then prayed to RNGesus for good luck.\n\"Give me something nice!!\"\nLeo pressed the [10+1] summon button!\nDING\nDING\nDING\nAn animation of 11 capsule balls came out from the gacha machine in the background. The ball popped, ejecting 11 building icons out.\nEight icons were white, indicating the common rarity.\nOne was green. An uncommon one.\nOne was blue, which was the guaranteed rare building.\nAnd the last one was gold! Leo got a super rare building!\n\"NOICE!\"\nSeeing the result, Leo checked the details of each building right away, starting with the common rarity ones.\n\"Alchemy workshop?\"\nTwo common draws were two alchemy workshops, which weren't that shabby. Leo could build them to make more pills, so he wouldn't lose anything.\nThe third was another gunsmith. It was alright as well.\nThe fourth and the fifth were a granary and a warehouse respectively. Leo didn't really need them, but it was nice to have.\nAs for the sixth common draw, it showed up as a blacksmith workshop. Leo could finally experiment with cold weaponry and materials.\n\"Eh, it's not like I need cold weapons. Well, I can leave it to Hua Jiashan, I guess.\"\nThe seventh was another clothing store. Leo shrugged it off as he could use another tailor to make more clothes.\nThe last common building was a strange one. However, it looked TOO normal – A fast-food chain restaurant. It could only be built inside the shopping mall's first floor due to its restrictions, and it automatically consumed food from the granary to make food.\nLeo didn't hate it, but he didn't like it either. As cultivators never needed food, this building might just be a decoration for his shopping mall.\nAfter the common ones, Leo started with the uncommon rarity. He hoped for a better building.\nHe wasn't disappointed. New building icons appeared, and their descriptions attracted Leo.\n.\nGreen House Farm (Uncommon)\nFarming Automaton (0/5)\nGreen House Size (0/5)\nCrop Quality (0/5)\nCrop Growth Speed (0/5)\nCan be placed on the rooftop of the shopping mall.

Scientists and Chemists Baffled Why He is Still Alive.\nChapter 197 – Florida Man Mistook Lithium as Iron. Mined a Ton. Threw Raw Ores to Furnace. And Caused an Explosion. Scientists and Chemists Baffled Why He is Still Alive.\n\"…\"\nLeo was not disappointed, but he wasn't impressed either. The new buildings seemed complicated.\nMoving on, Leo glanced at the icon of a guaranteed SR lucky draw. Since he couldn't exploit the 10+1 draw like the regular lucky draw, he used it on the spot.\nDING\nA new building icon appeared. This time, it looked different.\n.\nGenetic Modification Lab (Super Rare)\nSurgeon Automaton (0/20)\nSurgeon Skills (0/20)\nGenetic Storage (0/20)\nCapsule Module (0/20)\nSpace: 100 x 100.\nCannot be built inside Shopping Mall.

He also didn't forget to build other buildings that he had been neglecting.\n.\nFood Court\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 10\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – Three Humble General Store's Rooms or Shopping Mall's Rooms.\n.\nEssence Stone Quarry\nRequirement – Humble General Store Level 10\nPrice – 1,000 Years of Lifespan\nSpace – 200 x 200\n.\nLeo added the quarry southwest of his domain, west of the farm district.\nAs for the food court, Leo added it to his shopping mall, occupying three slots near the entrance. A fast-food chain restaurant was also put in the adjacent room. All buildings were upgraded to level 12.\n.\nFood Court Level 12\nAutomatons Cooks (2/5)\nAccommodation Size (2/5)\nFood Quality (5/5)\nFood Variety (3/5)\n.\nFast-Food Chain Restaurant Level 12\nAutomatons Cooks (2/5)\nCooking Speed (2/5)\nFood Quality (5/5)\nFood Variety (3/5)\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 12\nActive Cauldrons: (4/5)\nAutomatons Alchemist (1/5)\nProduction Quality (5/5)\nProduction Quantity (2/5)\n.\nClothing Store Level 12\nAutomaton Worker (1/5)\nAutomaton Weavers (3/5)\nWeaver Skills (5/5)\nStore Quality (3/5)\n.\nGunsmith Workshop Level 12\nAutomaton Gunsmith (1/1)\nAutomaton Hand Loader (1/1)\nFirearm Technology (5/6)\nProduct Quality (2/6)\nStructure Quality (3/6)\n.\nBlacksmith Workshop Level 12\nAutomaton Blacksmiths (2/5)\nFurnace (5/5)\nProduct Quality (5/5)\nProduction Speed (0/5)\n.\nFor alchemy, Leo prioritized the number of cauldrons as the past production rating was too slow. The gunsmith got new technology upgrades while the clothing stores obtained two new workers.\nThe blacksmith was a nice addition. Leo hadn't figured out its features yet, but he learned from the alchemy workshops. Thus, he put all points to furnaces so that he could produce more goodies.\nAfter Leo had constructed all the common buildings in his shopping mall, he built rare structures next.\nAn alchemy factory replaced one of the newest alchemy workshops. Leo checked its features.\n.\nAlchemy Factory Level 12\nAutomaton Alchemists (2/10)\nActive Machine (5/10)\nFactory Capacity (5/10)\nFactory Output Speed (0/10)\nCurrently Making: Elemental Grain Pills\n.\nLeo went to the 5th floor of his shopping mall and visited the factory.\nThe front office of the factory resembled the other workshops. However, it utilized machines instead of cauldrons to produce pills. A cargo elevator emerged at the back of the factory and connected to the warehouse.\nThe factory's automatons automatically fetched pill ingredients from the shopping mall's underground warehouse, using its exclusive elevator at the back.\nWhen Leo arrived at the factory, the structure and the automatons already started working even though Leo hadn't given it an order. Five sets of machines moved in sync, converting iron pine nuts into elemental grain pills.\nWithin ten minutes, a factory belt rolled a dozen elemental grain pills into a bucket. 20 round balls caused a loud noise in the enclosed space.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nThe first batch gave Leo 20 metal grain pills. As for the other machines, they produced other types of meds. Fire grain pills, water grain pills, and other elemental grain pills came out.\nLeo picked one of them to inspect its quality. Then, he deeply frowned.\nThe quality was mediocre.\n.\nMedium-Grade Metal Element Grain Pill\n- Satisfy your hunger for 120 hours.\n- Improve your blood circulation and internal organ efficiency by 15% for 120 hours.\n- Increase your lifespan by five years.\n- Increase Metal Qi by two years' worth of cultivation.\n.\nInstead of making top-tier pills, the factory rapidly chugged medium-graded ones and consumed a lot of ingredients in the warehouse.\nLeo hated it as he wanted the best pills. However, as things went on, a mass production line was necessary as he couldn't restock the supermarket fast enough. Cheaper products would do the trick since he didn't need to give every commoner the best items.\nAfter checking the factory, Leo upgraded another alchemy workshop into a new SR structure. Again, he upgraded it to level 12.\n.\nLand Vehicle Factory Level 12\nEngineer Automatons (2/20)\nTechnology (5/20)\nVehicle Quality (5/20)\nProduction Speed (0/20)\nCurrently Making: None\n.\nUnlike the pill factory, this one allowed Leo to choose which product to build. He opened its menu, and a screen appeared, showing a catalog of retro vehicles.\nJudging from their models, they were cars from the 70s era. Leo didn't need them at the moment, and he didn't want to waste his precious resources to make any. Still, he queued one for science.\nThe model he chose was a brown military jeep. As soon as Leo confirmed the production, the factory warned him about the necessary materials.\nDING\n<You lack materials and recipes.>\n\"…\"\nThe factory didn't bother to tell him which material Leo lacked. Instead, it just refused his order.\nLeo sighed as he couldn't do anything. He moved on to check the next structure that he couldn't build inside the shopping mall.\nThe next one was the quarry.\nWest of the farmlands, a rocky mountain elevated the ground.\nLeo then assigned points to the quarry.\n.\nEssence Stone Quarry Level 12\nAutomaton Miners (4/5)\nMining Speed (0/5)\nQuarry Tools (3/5)\nEssence Stone Quality (5/5)\n.\nFour mannequins holding pickaxes emerged. They ignored Leo and walked toward the stone mountain.\nLeo followed after them to see how they worked.\nThe miners stopped at the foot of the mountain. They touched the surface of a boulder and patted its dirt. After the mud and dirt had come off, the boulder revealed its true value.\nInstead of calling it a boulder, it was a massive black crystal hiding underneath mud and dirt.\nThe miners rushed toward the giant crystal and swung their pickaxes on it.\nCLINK\nCLINK\nThe miners instantly extracted several pieces of crystals. One of the miners collected and put them in a wheel cart. When the cart was full, the mannequin pushed the cart back to the patched area close to the quarry. He lifted the cart and poured everything to the ground. Then, he went back to get some more.\nLeo picked up the extracted crystals and inspected them.\n[High-Graded Essence Stone]\n[High-Graded Spirit Stone]\n[Medium-Graded Spirit Iron Ore]\n[High-Graded Rough Tin Ore]\nAlthough the crystals came from the same origin, each had a different property.\nThe spirit stones and essence stones were a no-brainer. Leo grabbed a spirit stone with his bare hand and instantly upgraded it into pinnacle-graded essence stones. As for the essence stones, their quality rose to the pinnacle grade upon touch.\nIron ores and tin ores were new to Leo. Like usual, he touched them and hoped to get an upgraded version of these minerals.\nLeo's instinct was correct. The brown ores blackened. However, Leo had no idea what they were.\nHe brought the newly mutated ores to the blacksmith workshop. He gave them to the automatons, and they threw them to the furnaces on the spot.\nBOOOOOM\nThe furnace exploded, breathing flame and almost cooked both blacksmith automatons.\nDING\n<You have discovered Immortal Iron Ore!>\n<You have discovered Immortal Tin Ore!>\n\"…Aren't they just the same? Tin and iron? Hello?\"\nLeo shrugged, unable to figure out their value. He left the ores in the blacksmith alone and went to check the other new structures.\nHe didn't notice the changes in the blacksmith's eyes. The two mannequins stood in front of the working furnaces, waiting for the ores to completely smelt and work on them.\n.\nLeo built a greenhouse on the shopping mall's rooftop. It didn't occupy a wide space, but it worked the same way as farms. He left the new farmers to work on the yin cabbages as the horses needed them.\nWith that, Leo finished building almost all the new structures. He still hadn't checked the new gene lab yet. However, Leo had a short-concentration issue. He moved on to the automaton gacha next.\nLeo gazed at the banner and the poster girls. They looked attractive and unique for mannequins. Curious of what they could do, Leo reached out and pressed on the [10+1 Summon] button.",

Unfortunately, ten came out as grey – They were obviously common automatons.\nHowever, the other one was in rainbow color!\nIt was neither a pity rare gacha nor a super rare gacha. Leo hit the jackpot!\nPLOP\nThe balls split in half and shot out 11 automatons. 10 wooden mannequins and a humanoid beast woman manifested in front of Leo.\nFive of the wooden mannequins had leather armor on. They carried short swords and bucklers as if they were fighters. Three farming robots held farming tools, and the remaining two hoisted short bows and quivers behind their backs.\nFive fighters, two archers, and three farmers were basic units, but Leo welcomed them nonetheless.\nAs for the last automaton, she looked terrific. Her flawless light olive skin resembled Western Europeans. The automaton's curly blond hair refined her noble look. Her frilly red dress revealed her shoulders and upper bosom.\nOn a side note, she had a huge bosom despite having a slender physique. Leo estimated that they were at least K-cup. Moreover, her height was towering 7'5!\nShe was a giant!\nThe mannequin looked like a noble lady in the Renaissance era. She would have looked perfect without the dull iris, cold expression, and two bull horns on her head.\nDING\nThe gacha system revealed the stats of the mannequins.\n.\nFighter Golem (Level 1)\nRarity: Common\nStrength: Muscle Tempering Realm\nSpecialty: Basic Swordsmanship\n.\nArcher Golem (Level 1)\nRarity: Common\nStrength: Muscle Tempering Realm\nSpecialty: Basic Archery\n.\nFarmer Golem (Level 1)\nRarity: Common\nStrength: Muscle Tempering Realm\nSpecialty: Agricultural Knowledge\n.\nSierra Tauron, the Tauro Constellation Baroness (Level 1)\nRarity: Ultra Rare\nStrength: Earth Immortal\nSpecialties: Domain of Minotaurs, Minotaur Bloodline, Animal Husbandry Knowledge, Dairy Production\nBiography: Tauron Sierra was once a princess of the Minotaur Clan. When Sierra Tauron was alive, she visited Overlord Xiaomao and studied under him for a decade. She returned home and used her newly acquired animal husbandry knowledge to improve her home planet, earning her the Baroness title.\nOn 764,319 O.E. (Overlord Era Calendar), the Divine Elven Zenith of Neo United Terraforming Solars (DEZNUTS) declared war against the Minotaurs. Overlord Lucky led the DEZNUTS Army of 200,000 deities, 5,000 sages, and 200 entities to eradicate all living beings of the Tauron Solar System. Tauron Sierra died during the invasion, and her soul returned to the River of Karma.\n.\nAfter reading her biography, Leo had goosebumps. He felt like he had touched something complicated.\nLeo walked closer to Sierra. He waved her hand in front of her face, but she didn't even blink.\n\"Hello, ma'am?\"\nWhile talking, Leo's gaze fixated on the cleavage in front of him. Although they only came in a pair, Leo loved them.\nSuddenly, Sierra's eyes moved. She gazed at Leo's face and noticed that his eye level was at the same height as her chest.\n\"You can't milk those.\"\n\"…\"\n\"…Yet.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo almost had a heart attack as he didn't expect this summoned automaton to speak. His eyes looked up and noticed her dull stare. Embarrassed, he stroked his beard and feigned ignorance.\n\"Ahem. Erm, ma'am. Do you still remember what happened to you in your previous life?\"\nSierra maintained her gaze. She didn't look like she had any emotion or memory left.\n\"I remember that I am a Minotaur, but I don't remember anything else. My purpose in this life is to fulfill your need, master.\"\n\"AHEM! AHEM!\"\nHer wordings sounded dangerous. Leo looked away from her bosom to suppress his neurons and hormones.\n\"Tell me what you can do.\" Leo changed the subject.\nSierra counted her fingers.\n\"I can manage ranches and livestock. I can tame wild animals. Also, I can produce a gallon of milk every month.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo choked on saliva. His moral integrity raised a red flag while his primal instinct cheered.\nAfter taking a deep breath, Leo asked her about her strength.\n\"About your level and strength, how do I upgrade your level?\"\n\"Please touch me and use your life force.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo made up his mind. He would assign her a conversation instructor later as her wording might give someone a wrong idea.\nFor the sake of his conscience, Leo grabbed her hand.\nSierra dully gazed at her hand. Feeling the touch, her body responded. She clenched her hand into a firm handshake.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo sensed the force in her grip. He smiled.\n\"Girl. You shouldn't provoke others. By the way, your hand is very rough. You must have been a hard worker in your previous life.\"\n\"I somewhat remember. My breasts hurt every time I extract my breast milk. I hate them.\"\n\"…\"\n\"If possible, master. May I ask you for a favor? When I'm lactating, could you please milk me with your hands? At least, they are softer than my hands.\"\n\"…\"\nSierra was the first to make Leo bend forward and awaken his dragon. He shook his head and got rid of naughty intrusive thoughts.\n\"I'll send you a better milker. Anyway, about combat, can you fight?\" Again, Leo changed the subject before the conversation steered to a wrong turn.\n\"If you mean fighting in a real battle, I cannot. But if you refer to bed battles, I'm confident in my skills.\"\n\"…Never mind.\"\nLeo closed his eyes. He gave up on her.\nFor some reason, Leo felt like she didn't belong in this peaceful and family-friendly domain. She might fit well in adult-rated stories.\nBecause the conversation kept steering toward THAT subject, Leo stopped asking Sierra. While holding her hand, Leo glanced at his system menu.\nThe upgrade fee was quite expensive. Upgrading Sierra to level 2 cost 10,000 YOL.\nSince Sierra was Leo's only ultra-rare worker, he invested in her and spent his lifespan.\nDING\nAs soon as Sierra's level became two, her status changed.\n.\nSierra Tauron, the Tauro Constellation Baroness (Level 2)\nRarity: Ultra Rare\nStrength: Sky Immortal\nSpecialties: Domain of Minotaurs, Minotaur Bloodline, Animal Husbandry Knowledge, Dairy Production\n.\nHer cultivation base improved by a major realm. Although Leo wasn't clear about the cultivation rank beyond the mortal stages, he was happy with the improvement. He upgraded Sierra again.\nDING\nDING\nDING\nFortunately, every upgrade only cost 10,000 YOL. After Leo had upgraded her to level 9, her level reached a soft cap.\n.\nSierra Tauron, the Tauro Constellation Baroness (Level 9) (Evolution Material Required)\nRarity: Ultra Rare\nStrength: True Immortal\nSpecialties: Domain of Minotaurs, Minotaur Bloodline, Animal Husbandry Knowledge, Dairy Production\n.\nBecause of this system, Leo learned more about immortal ranks. The immortal realm cultivation ranks were as follows;\n1st stage – Earth Celestial\n2nd stage – Sky Celestial\n3rd stage - Star Celestial\n4th stage - Heaven Celestial\n5th stage - Celestial Warrior\n6th stage - Celestial General\n7th stage - Celestial King\n8th stage - Celestial Emperor\n9th stage - True Immortal\nWhile thinking about the cultivation ranks, Leo wondered how strong Esen and Acku were. For certain, she should be a high ranker.\nLeo shook his head and collected his thoughts. He rechecked the upgrade requirement.\nAn inventory menu appeared, but there was only one item slot. Over the inventory box, an icon of a required material was shown.\nThe icon was a blue water droplet. Leo pressed it, and the system informed him of its description.\n<True Earth Fate Crystal's Holy Water>\n\"…I guess I have to complete fate crystal quests to get those.\"\nLeo deeply sighed. He let go of Sierra's hand. However, she didn't let her hand go.\nSierra stared into Leo's eyes. She uttered with a firm voice.\n\"My lactation period is a week away. Master, don't forget to pay me a visit and milk me.\"\nLeo widened his eyes and yanked his hand away from her. He got goosebumps.\n\"Get somebody else to milk those cow tettens! Leave my hands alone!\"\n\"If you prefer, you can drink it from the source.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo silently and inwardly facepalmed. He had a headache.",

On the Other News, Ohio Man Discovered on Death Star.\nChapter 199 – Florida Man Built Trillion-Dollar Labs to Modify Cabbage DNAs. On the Other News, Ohio Man Discovered on Death Star.\nLeo assigned Sierra as the new unicorn barn's manager. She would be in charge of handling those pervert thunder unicorns from now on. As for her milking business, Leo got someone else to do the task.\nAs it had been a while, Leo visited Gao Yan to check on his experiment. He wondered if the guy was still alive after he had eaten Floridian Dantian Pill.\nLeo came to Gao Yan's house and knocked on the front door.\nA few seconds later, Gao Yan dragged his feet and opened the door. When Gao Yan saw Leo's face, he squinted his brow in a bad mood.\nLeo was also surprised. Under Gao Yan's eyes, black bags were visible. The latter looked like someone with insomnia issues.\n\"How are you doing, boy?\"\nGao Yan deeply sighed, \"Not good, senior. Could you leave me alone for…like…a month or two? I need some more sleep so that I can digest your pill.\"\n\"…Alright. Take your time. Just checking.\"\nGao Yan nodded and closed the door in front of Leo's face.\nLeo didn't mind it. He understood that insomnia patients were usually moody, and Gao Yan might develop that trait. He didn't notice that Gao Yan's cultivation base was on the verge of reaching the soul transformation realm.\nSince Gao Yan was okay, Leo moved on to the next work. He opened the shop domain menu and glanced at a certain structure.\n.\nGenetic Modification Lab (Super Rare)\nSurgeon Automaton (0/20)\nSurgeon Skills (0/20)\nGenetic Storage (0/20)\nCapsule Module (0/20)\nSpace: 100 x 100.\nCannot be built inside Shopping Mall. Require Fate Crystal Bearer's blood to operate. Max Level: 50.\n.\nThis lab required a lot of space. Curious about its perks and effects, Leo built it in the northern district between the pylon tower and the junkyard.\nRUMBLE\nThe elevated land remained the same, but a trench emerged. The trench passages led to an underground bunker's steel doors.\nAs usual, whenever a new structure appeared, the local workers rushed in the check it. They gathered around the trench maze and observed it from above.\nLeo ignored the curious crowd and walked to the sealed doors. He thought of nuclear bunkers on Earth, which failed to outlast the nuclear fallout era. As he was familiar with how bunkers worked, he strolled toward the gate and leaned toward an eye scanner located on the console at the right side. While he was at it, he upgraded the structure to the current max level, aka level 12.\n.\nGenetic Modification Lab (Level 12)\nSurgeon Automaton (3/20)\nSurgeon Skills (5/20)\nGenetic Storage (2/20)\nCapsule Module (2/20)\nCurrent Usage: None\nGenetic Donor: None\n.\nThe bunker gates opened. Leo waltzed into the bunker's airtight room. Using the console on the side, he shut the doors behind him.\nBeyond the airtight room was a lone elevator. Leo entered it and found only two buttons – [G] and [B1].\nLeo pressed the B1 button and let the elevator take him to the mysterious land.\n.\nDING\nThe doors were opened. Leo looked ahead and walked out of the elevator.\n\"…Wow.\"\nAlthough the structure's name was a lab, Leo found a hospital lobby and ICU wards instead. In each room, an empty patient bed and a sci-fi-like bed capsule glittered in gold.\nBehind the lobby counter, three mannequins in a lab coat stood up and saluted Leo. Strangely, these guys wore eyeglasses even though their camera lens didn't need such things.\nOne of the mannequins wrote something on an A4 paper and handed it to Leo. The latter looked at it.\n[We need gene samples to work.]\nIt was a direct request. Leo also had no issue giving them some genes.\n\"Where do I put the genes and how do I donate mine?\"\nOne of the mannequins brought out a glass vial and pointed at it. Then, he wrote something.\n[Put your blood in the vial. We will handle the rest.]\n\"Oh, nice!\"\nLeo bit his fingertip and squeezed his transparent blood out. The three overexcited mannequins held their vial and stared at the dripping blood of Leo as if the liquid was a precious treasure.\nAfter filling half the vial, Leo licked his finger to heal it. He also asked them.\n\"What does this place do? Do you know how this works?\"\nOne of the mannequins wrote on the same paper.\n[You can bring any lifeform here to modify their genetics by using the donated samples as a catalyst. The test subjects might obtain a trait or two from the genes if they are lucky.]\nLeo almost celebrated as he wished to train some useless employees in his domain to be as strong as him. However, the luck factor sounded suspicious.\n\"If they are lucky?\"\n[If they are unlucky or the genes are incompatible with the test subject's DNA, there might be side effects.]\n\"Such as?\"\n[Memory loss, permanent paralysis, blindness, random disability, and death.]\n\"…\"\nIt was worse than Leo had imagined. He also flipped the mannequins as this structure might become useless for a long time.\n[The higher the surgeon skills, the lower the mortality rate. Please upgrade us when you can, master.]\n\"Yeah, good to know. Anyway, if I bring someone here, what is the chance that a side effect might occur?\"\n[At the current rate, 75%]\n\"…That's quite high, isn't it?\"\n[That's because your structure level is too low. Please unlock more max level caps so that we can be more useful to you.]\nLeo shook his head. He excused himself and was about to walk away.\nBut then, Leo turned around. His intrusive thoughts had another sick idea.\n\"You said that you can modify any lifeform, correct?\"\n[Yes, master.]\n\"Can you modify plants, vegetables, or fruits?\"\n[Yes, master.]\n\"!!!\"\nThis sounded terrific. Leo rubbed his hands, wondering if these surgeons could transform some of his crops or vegetables into something better.\nTesting things out, Leo ejected a yin cabbage from his storage ring and gave it to the three mannequins.\n\"Let's test it. Can you modify these veggie genes?\"\n[We can try. Please wait.]\nOne of the mannequins took the cabbage into a ward. He dropped it into a sleeping capsule and closed the hatch. Then, he fiddled with the console panel.\nDING\n<Modifying Yin Cabbage Genes…>\n<Time Remaining: 59 Seconds…>\nThe task was strangely quick. Leo crossed his arms and waited for the mannequin to complete the job.\nA minute later, the genetic transformation was completed. One of the mannequins opened the bed capsule's hatch and picked up a seed, which was the only remaining thing from the yin cabbage.\nThe seed glowed in rainbow color just like Leo's aura. He received the seed and inspected it.\n.\nLow-Grade Seed of Floridian Yin Cabbage\nCan only be planted in Basic Farmland or Greenhouse. It takes 12 hours to mature and requires a clean flow of Yin Qi as nutrition.\n.\nAnother item got its name after Leo's origin. He wryly smiled.\n\"I'll use this building as a research institution from now on, I think. By the way, can you automatically convert more veggies without me?\"\nThe three mannequins nodded and gave Leo a thumbs up.\nLeo was relieved. At least, he wouldn't need to visit this place often.\n.\n.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nSouth of the Floridian Domain, Ivy and Cat led the troops of undead elites home. While they traveled north, the newly recruited undead harvested the souls of dead cultivators in the area and awakened them as mindless skeleton soldiers.\nIvy looked back and frowned.\n\"Don't make too many. We only need extra laborers at the moment. The battle has long ended.\"\nOne of the death knights laughed. \"We all need servants. A few wouldn't hurt.\"\nIvy gave up on them. She turned around and concentrated on getting back before the daybreak.\nMeanwhile, Cat was bored. She parted from the group and went back to swimming without telling anybody.\nWhile diving underwater, Cat spotted new marine creatures in the river. One of them was a black lustrous anaconda.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\"\nNot caring about danger, Cat chased after the snake.\n.\n.\nSeveral galaxies away from Leo's planet, a lone artificial planet floated freely in the void. Under the radioactive shield of the planet was a civilization.\nThe population of this planet only consisted of Fenrir Werewolves. They walked around naked on the street, but they all had handheld gadgets, such as smartphones, portable soundcards, or storage boxes.\nAmong the skyscraper towns, one of them was decorated in neon lights as they embraced the cyber-punk style. Many werewolves wore sunglasses as the bright light on the street hurt their eyes.\nIn the neon-light city, one of the werewolves sat at a bar counter. He passed a photo of Leo to the bartender.\nThe werewolf was none other than Anuraku, who once challenged Leo and ran away from the fight. He returned to his home planet for a mission.\nThe bartender glanced at the photo and muttered. \"Who's that Nu'Earthe?\"\nAnuraku grinned.\n\"A mutual enemy of our race's overlords.\"\nThe bartender scoffed as he didn't care. \"What service do you need?\"\n\"Hahaha! Simple. This guy has at least one entity fate crystal, and his home planet hasn't been found yet. I want his home planet's coordination.\"\n\"That's a tall call. It will be costly.\"\n\"I don't care. Use your system power. I want his coordinate!\"\n\"Alright. If that's what you need.\"\nThe bartender collected the photo and counted his fingers. Then, he wrote something on a paper.\nAnuraku picked it up. As soon as he saw the price quote, he yelled at the bartender.\n\"A million years of lifespan?! Are you kidding me?! Do you think I'm a sage or something?!\"\nThe bartender shrugged. \"As I said, this job is a tall call. Tracking an entity fate crystal bearer is a challenging job. My price reflects the danger I have to face!\"\n\"TSK!\"\nAnuraku was annoyed. He stood up and stomped out of the bar. Before he left, he yelled at the bartender.\n\"You should be grateful that the overlords think highly of you! Had it been others, I would have killed you!\"\nThe bartender shrugged. \"Go home, kid. If you want to challenge me, at least get a heavenly fate crystal.\"\n\"…\"\nThe werewolf grumbled and slammed the door of the bar.\nAfter Anuraku had left, the bartender transformed from a werewolf into a bald muscular half-African Caucasian human. He tore the photo and rolled his eyes.\n\"Why should I spend my lifespan to track my fellow countryman?\"\nThe bartender snapped his fingers, and a t-shirt, leather jacket, and a pair of jeans manifested. He put them on and walked to the front door. Then, he put a sign \"Close\" on it.\nDING\nHowever, the door was barged open. A female werewolf kicked it open.\n\"NU'EARTHE OHIO MAN! THE OVERLORD IS LOOKING FOR YOU!\"\nThe \"Ohio Man\" turned around and gave the intruder a deep frown.\n\"We're closed.\"\n\"SHUT UP, NU'EARTHE! I SAID OVERLORD MILO IS LOOKING FOR YO-\"\nCLICK\nA 12-gauge shotgun appeared in Ohio Man's hand. He shoved the muzzle into the wolf's mouth.\n\"One more N-Word, I'll blast your head off.\"\n\"…\"\nSeeing that the wolf stopped barking, Ohio Man pulled his gun back. He then quoted the price.\n\"A hundred million years of lifespan for one day of service.\"\n\"YOU BAST-\"\nCLICK\nAgain, the shotgun's muzzle entered the wolf's mouth.\n\"Pay it or leave it. Choose.\"\n\"…\"",

Ohio Man Earned 100 Million by Selling Information to Cartel Lord While Florida Man Genetic-Engineered Cabbage DNA to Create Ultimate Pet Food and Earned Nothing!\nChapter 200 – Income Disparity! Ohio Man Earned 100 Million by Selling Information to Cartel Lord While Florida Man Genetic-Engineered Cabbage DNA to Create Ultimate Pet Food and Earned Nothing.\nOn the artificial star, a bright meadow was situated in the middle of a cyberpunk city. In the middle of the grass field was the castle of a realm master, aka an overlord.\nSitting on the throne was a 50-meter-tall black werewolf. While waiting for a certain visitor, he leaned on his armrest and closed his eyes.\nIn the throne room, 5,000 werewolves of various sizes stood in formation. Everybody was fully equipped with cyan plate armor from head to toe. Their red aura revealed their cultivation base of celestial kings and emperors. A few of them were true immortals.\nAs for their leader, the black werewolf, his strength transcended the immortals, deities, and sages. Just like Leo, he was also an entity fate crystal's owner.\nOverlord Milo ignored the anxious looks of his minions. He discovered the approaching human and a werewolf's aura. Noticing their arrival, Overlord Milo opened his eyes.\nThe brown muscular man was still in his human form. He waltzed to the throne room with Milo's messenger in tow. However, the poor messenger still had a gun pointing in his mouth.\nMilo smirked at the guest.\n\"Human Ohio Man. I see that you've accepted my invitation.\"\nOhio Man snorted. \"Pay up, or else. I want 100 million years of lifespan.\"\nThe messenger widened his eyes and refuted, \"You said 10 million earlier!\"\n\"You didn't pay upfront, but you asked me to pick up the pay here. Obviously, the price is different.\"\n\"YOU BASTARD NU'EARTHE-\"\nBANG\nOhio Man pulled the trigger. The head of the messenger exploded, including his soul.\nThe immortals in the throne room bore fangs and barked at Ohio Man. They pulled their weapons and were about to jump him.\nOverlord Milo snapped his fingers.\nRUMBLE\nThe werewolf immortals suddenly sensed a great pressure falling on them. They fell to their knees and sweated profusely.\nOverlord Milo warned them.\n\"As I always warned you – Ohio Man is an entity like me. He only needs to wiggle his fingers and you lots will die without knowing what hit you. Stand down!\"\nEverybody lowered their heads. Even if they disagreed with their overlord, nobody had enough strength to resist the pressure.\nOverlord Milo snapped his fingers again, and the pressure was lifted. He looked at the brown man next.\n\"Ohio Man. Is 100 million years of lifespan the final price of your allegiance?\"\n\"No. This price is for a piece of information.\"\n\"That's quite expensive for a piece of information.\"\n\"You asked me to betray my kin. That is a reasonable price.\"\n\"Fair enough.\"\nOverlord Milo deeply inhaled. Then, a large system screen appeared in front of him. He pressed a few buttons, ticking the names of all immortals in the throne room.\nThe overlord uttered and warned his men.\n\"Your troops retreated first when our army clashed with Overlord Nyan Meo's Army. As a punishment for deserting, I'll be taking half of your lifespan. Consider yourself lucky that you won't be trialed!\"\n5,000 werewolves gritted their teeth and looked at the flow of life force escaping from their bodies. A flow of white lukewarm air moved toward Overlord Milo.\nThe average lifespan of these soldiers was 30,000 years as their cultivation base was high. Thus, everybody lost about 15,000 YOL.\nThe life force of 5,000 werewolves accumulated into millions. Instantly, Overlord Milo secured over 75 million YOL to pay Ohio Man.\nThe brown man frowned as he found Milo's method disgusting. However, he didn't voice his dissatisfaction as it was none of his business.\nMeanwhile, Milo rechecked his YOL balance and found that he still lacked 20 million YOL to pay Ohio Man. He glanced at the men and smirked.\n\"Second punishment, how dare you lose to the Cathulhu?! The DEZNUTS senators clearly ordered us to produce results, but you couldn't even raze one of their planets! The price of this humiliation will be your death!\"\nThe werewolves in blue armor widened their eyes. They pleaded with their lord.\n\"CHIEF! PLEASE DON'T! WE FOUGHT WITH ALL OUR MIGHT! PLEASE FORGIVE US!\"\n\"WE DID EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER, CHIEF! WE HAD TO RETREAT TO SAVE OUR INJURED COMRADES!\"\n\"DON'T KILL US, CHIEF!\"\nMilo snorted, \"Silence! DIE!\"\n\"NOOOOOO!!\"\nAgain, Milo snapped his fingers. This time, all troops in the throne room collapsed and dissipated into dust. Their soul returned to the karma river while their life force gathered inside the overlord.\nOhio Man closed his eyes. This wasn't Overlord Milo's first time, and Ohio Man had seen it before. Still, it left a bad taste in his mouth.\nOverlord Milo sneered at the lone human.\n\"What? Do you pity them?\"\nOhio Man smacked his lips, \"No loyal soldiers deserve this. They fought for you. You just mistreated them. How are you going to explain to their families?\"\n\"Nothing. I'll just kill them all and take their lifespan.\"\n\"…\"\nOhio Man glared at the overlord. His killing intent exploded while his cold expression remained the same. However, he chose not to antagonize the werewolf entity.\nHe changed the subject.\n\"What do you want to know? Also, pay up, and I'll answer.\"\n\"Good.\"\nOverlord Milo smirked and waved his finger. A system screen appeared in front of the brown man, showing a drafted contract between an employer and a freelancer.\nThe freelancer silently bit his fingertip and signed the contract with his blood. The system screen then produced golden chains, which entered both Milo's and Ohio Man's bodies.\nMilo didn't scam him. He operated his system and transferred 100 million YOL to Ohio Man. Afterward, he asked the main question.\n\"Give me the coordinates of Florida Man's home planet.\"\n\"…\"\nThe brown man narrowed his eyes. Then, he closed them. After a minute of long pause, he opened his eyes and summoned his system screen. He typed a few words into his system and pressed the [Send] button.\nDING\n\"The coordinate of Florida Man's \"HOME PLANET\" is there. I complete the contract.\"\nMilo glanced at the coordinate. Seeing the number and texts, he grinned.\n\"I need to confirm the information first. The contract hasn't been completed yet.\"\n\"I don't think so.\"\nOhio Man smirked and flickered his finger at the golden chain in front of him. The transparent chain dispersed into nothingness, and their systems prompted them with a notification message.\n<The transaction has been completed.>\nMilo squinted his brow, but he didn't protest. After all, the golden chain contract was made by the system. It automatically verified the actions of both parties that no one cheated on the others. In addition, according to the contract, Ohio Man had to comply with Milo's request without fail, and he could not lie to him.\nSince the contract chains dispersed automatically, Milo believed that Ohio Man spoke the truth.\n\"I guess you didn't play tricks.\"\n\"As I said. I gave you the coordinates of Florida Man's \"HOME PLANET\" as you requested. I'll be taking my leave now.\"\n\"Alright. You may go. I'll ask for your service again… Mister Seer.\"\n\"…\"\nOhio Man turned around and left the castle. As he left, he snorted and mocked Milo.\n\"Dumbass. You think I'll harm my countryman? If he's from Florida, he's a family! Nobody messes with my family!\"\nHe returned to his bar, but he didn't resume his business.\nOhio Man rubbed his ears. A second later, they lengthened to the side, transforming into elven ears. His face changed, and his black long hair grew. While the transformation went on, he packed his belongings and opened his system menu. Then, he navigated to a quick travel tab. The brown man then chose a planet, which he nicknamed \"WIFE\" as his destination.\nDING\n<Quick Travel requires a million years of lifespan to use, and you can only go to a place where you already visited. Will you really spend ONE MILLION years of lifespan to use this feature?>\n\"Yes.\"\nDING\n<Affirmative. Teleporting to WIFE.>\nWHOOSH\nJust like that, Ohio Man teleported away from this realm after scamming the local overlord.\nWhen Ohio Man reopened his eyes, he found himself standing in a forest with gigantic tall trees.\nIn front of him was a humble cabin. A female elf carrying a tone-skinned infant in her arms sat in the garden, singing for her baby.\n\"Daddy's home, Ester?\"\nThe elf mom turned around. Upon seeing the brown handsome elf with long straight hair touching his back, she smiled at him.\n\"Welcome home, Simba.\"\nShe was Ohio Man's wife. The infant in her arms was also his son.\n.\nAfter Ohio Man had left, Overlord Milo made his way to a portal altar behind the throne room. He stood at the center of the altar and operated his system.\nDING\n<Please input the coordination value of your destination.>\nMilo copied and pasted the value that Ohio Man had told him.\nDING\n<A new planet has been discovered.>\nA new system screen showed the image of a frozen world. The atmosphere was full of white ash while the terrain was mostly ash snow.\nMilo laughed. He glanced at the cooldown time of his portal.\n.\nInterdimensional Portal (Level 50)\nNumber of Travelers (20/20)\nSize of Travelers (20/20)\nGate Duration (10/20)\nCooldown Time (0/20)\n.\nAs Milo never upgraded the cooldown time level, this facility could only be used once every year. Thus, he always kept this as an emergency.\nBut in this case, Leo had a bounty on his head. Moreover, the entity fate crystal in Leo's hands was too precious to ignore. Milo needed to get his hands on it before his colleagues or the elves started making their moves.\n\"Open it! Bring me to that planet!\"\nRUMBLE\nA dimensional gate appeared. Milo laughed and crossed the realms.\nAfter crossing to the other side, he looked around. Although the local temperature was almost at absolute zero, he had no issue enduring the freezing wind.\nGWAAAAAA\nWhile looking around, a lizard-like monster emerged from the ground and stood on two hind legs. The Godzilla breathed an ice laser beam toward him.\nMilo smirked at the monster.\n\"PATHETIC! A deity without a vessel?! You are nothing but food here!\"\nThe beam hit Milo's chest, but it didn't do anything. He punched the Godzilla in the face.\nBOOM\nThe monster's head exploded upon impact. Milo cackled and mocked the monster.\n\"This is what you get for messing with an entity! Even sages have to bow their heads to me!\"\nAfter killing the monster, Milo began searching for Leo and his domain.\n\"Now, where is Florida Man and his vessels?\"\nHe wasn't aware yet that he was on the wrong planet.\n.\n.\n\"ACHOOOO!! ACHOOO!!\"\nMeanwhile, Leo couldn't stop sneezing. He stood on a farm, watching the newly planted seed growing into a sprout.\nIt was the newly evolved seed that Leo got from the lab. He waited to see what kind of vegetable he would get from it.\nPLOP\nIt didn't take long for the Floridian Yin Cabbage to mature. Instead of growing up into either a black or green cabbage, it shone in rainbow color.\nLeo extracted it. But instead of bringing it to an alchemy workshop, he waved his hand and called over a newly summoned golem.\nThe farmer rushed to aid Leo. It looked at the rainbow cabbage and waited for Leo's instruction.\n.\nFarmer Golem (Level 8) (Evolution Material Required)\nRarity: Common\nStrength: Quasi-Immortal\nSpecialty: Agricultural Knowledge\n.\nLeo gave it to the golem and ordered him.\n\"Can you multiply this or improve the quality? I don't want to keep remaking the seeds.\"\nThe farmer nodded. It then turned toward the greenhouse on top of the shopping mall and jumped. Instantly, it arrived in front of the greenhouse.\nLeo followed the golem to see how it would do with the product. Then, he was stunned.\nThe golem cut the cabbage into pieces. Then, he planted them in the greenhouse. In 10 minutes, they matured. The golem harvested the cabbages and collected them in a basket.\nLeo counted the new batch of yin cabbages. It multiplied from one head into 30 heads in 10 minutes.\n\"I'll be damned.\"\nThe farmer didn't stop there. It cut five cabbages and replanted them. Then, the golem turned around and gave Leo a thumbs-up.\nIt seemed that Leo didn't have to worry about running out of food for a while. However, there was a pressing issue.\n\"ACHOOOO!!\"\nFor some reason, Leo couldn't stop sneezing.",

He no longer had a supply shortage issue.\nWhat pleased Leo the most was the gunsmith upgrade.\n.\nGunsmith Workshop Level 12\nGunsmith Automaton (1/1)\nHand Loader Automaton (1/1)\nFirearm Technology (5/6)\nProduct Quality (2/6)\nStructure Quality (3/6)\n.\nAs the tech level went up, the current distributed rifles became outdated. The mannequins stopped producing breech-loading rifles and began producing something more interesting.\nAt the workshop, Leo stood in front of the two mannequins. They also waited for Leo's instructions.\nIn front of Leo was the system screen, which showed the list of firearms that Leo could build.\n\"I guess we skip the WWII techs to the Cold War period. How nice!\"\nAK-47, M16, Barrett M82, and Steyr AUG were available to craft. However, unlike the previous rifles, Leo could no longer rely on sacred wood and holy lich superconductors. The system demanded Leo's lifespan and other materials to make.\nFrom here on, Leo also needed to supply the mannequins with his blood and a weird material called Immortalium. He also had to pay the mannequins one year of lifespan for every new rifle made.\n\"And where the hell do I get that ore or mineral?\"\nLeo scratched his head and stared at the two idle mannequins. They tilted their heads as they didn't know either.\nRealizing how useless they were, Leo gave up on them. He took the elevator to the mystic realm portal and visited his trusty advisors.\n.\nOn the flying island, the fisherman guardian \"Kitten\" never stopped throwing something out of the portal. Every minute, either trees or living monsters came out from the permanent portal. All materials vanished upon coming out while all living beings went down the slider and fell to the canyon river.\nWhen Leo got there, he realized that he never collected the tributes from Kitten. He walked toward the portal to check the other side.\nHowever, the three presenting guardians could read Leo's mind. They reminded Leo how he could collect the tributes.\nThe angel uttered first.\n\"Master, all gathered materials are automatically sent to your warehouses and granaries. You just need to head there and bring them out from the system's temporary storage.\"\n\"…Oh.\" Leo was surprised. \"I have an inventory system?\"\n\"Not that kind of inventory you're looking for, but it is indeed an inventory system. You can't store items in there though.\"\n\"Fair enough. Anyway, I need help. Do you know where I can get Immortalium ores or whatever that is?\"\nThe angel remained silent and glanced at the wolf. The Fenrir wagged his tail and smiled.\n\"You can find them on this planet, woof. But you have to go further north, woof!\"\n\"North?\"\n\"Somewhere beyond the Cauliflower City, woof! Fly 100 kilometers north. You won't miss it, woof.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo nodded. He also had another reason to go there.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phrase 2/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phrase.\nPhrase Completion Rewards: 200,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Automaton), Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 15, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 15\nPhrase Two Tasks (7/10 Completed)\n- Use the PVP feature once. (Done)\n- Defeat a player's shadow in weekly PVP Mode (Done)\n- Defeat a player in monthly PVP Mode (Done)\n- Spend 10 Building Lucky Draws. (Done)\n- Spend 10 Automaton Lucky Draws. (Done)\n- Upgrade 10 buildings to level 12. (Done)\n- Gather one million years of lifespan. (Done)\n- Secure a strategic mineral depot. (0/1)\n- Build a resource extractor on top of a mineral depot. (0/1)\n- Locate three hidden Earth Fate Crystals on your planet (1/3)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo had finished the first main quest, and the second set appeared. Fortunately, Leo had already completed most tasks. Only the complicated ones remained.\nThe bottleneck was the earth fate crystal and the mineral depot. As the mysterious Immortalium ore might be a strategic resource that the system mentioned, securing the depot was the same as killing two birds with one stone.\nLeo had no reason not to explore the main continent. He agreed to the suggestion.\n\"I guess it's time for another adventure. By the way, do you know where the hidden earth fate crystals are?\"\nThe angel pointed south while Mu-Nyang pointed east.\n\"One of your subordinates has it. She might give it to you if you ask her.\" Said Meowmeow.\nMu-Nyang looked east and hinted at Leo. \"The last one should be in the middle of the ocean, munya. You might have to get to the bottom of the ocean to get it, munya.\"\nLeo smacked his forehead with his palm. He couldn't imagine himself diving into the ocean abyss and searching for a random crystal.\n\"That's worse than searching for a needle in a haystack.\"\n\"Want me to go search for it in your stead, munya?\"\nUpon hearing Mu-Nyang's suggestion, Leo was overjoyed. He readily agreed.\n\"Then, please do. I'm already busy as I am.\"\n\"NYAHAHAHA! PLAY TIME, MUNYA!\"\n\"Oi!\"\nIt was too late for Leo to retract his words. The giant Cathulhu statue vanished and left behind a sonic boom shockwave.\nThe angel and wolf statue's expression dulled as they had expected the cat to run away sooner or later. As for Leo, he pursed his lips.\nHe didn't mind that Mu-Nyang ran away from his guardian duty. He envied the cat.\n\"Say, Meowmeow.\" Leo's expression was solemn.\n\"Yes, master?\" The angel sensed the seriousness of the situation. He prepared to take action.\n\"Can you teach me how to fly?\"\n\"…Huh?\"\n\"Don't HUH me! I know you can read my mind! I don't know how to fly, and I want to fly, too! I WANNA BECOME A PIGEON SO THAT I CAN DROP A SHIT BOMB ON MY ENEMY'S HEAD!\"\n\"…\"\nMeowmeow facepalmed as he didn't expect his master's childish behavior to act up often. Still, as Leo lacked the fundamentals and basic skills of a cultivator, the angel decided to help him.\n\"Flight skills can be difficult, but you should be able to do it naturally like how you breathe. First, you should treat the gravity force as a hindrance while the air is a mass of water. Then, you use your Qi to…\"\nThe lesson went on. Leo sat in front of the angel statue, listening to the lecture.\n.\n.\nA week went by.\nLeo's daily routine changed. In the early morning, he opened the shopping mall and welcomed new customers from the commoner town. As nobody could take the role of a cashier, Leo got stuck in the mall from 6 AM to 6PM, collecting lifespan and selling pills.\nAt 6PM, the shopping mall was closed. No worker, commoner, or people from the Tang Clan could linger in the mall as Leo kicked them out. Afterward, for two hours, Leo always toured his domain and examined his farms, warehouses, granaries, and workshops.\nAt 9 to 11 p.m., Leo went back to the flying island to attend Meowmeow's lecture. When the class was over, Leo went back to his battle bus to sleep. He always woke up at 5AM and entered the shopping mall through the backdoor to manage the underground warehouse.\nAt 6AM, Leo repeated the loop.\nWhen nobody caused trouble, days were slow and peaceful. Leo loved the feeling of spending boring days doing the same thing over and over. This tedious mundane lifestyle reminded him of the time when he was still a regular salaryman.\nUnfortunately, the peaceful period was short.\nWHOOSH\nLeo teleported back from an offline battle stage to his bedroom. He just fought another shadow of an immortal and killed the guy.\nHe glanced at the reward, which he got from the fight. He opened the gacha menu and navigated to the gnosis gacha banner.\nAt the moment, Leo had two gacha tickets as he had defeated two shadows so far. He wondered if he should draw them or stack them to draw 10+1.\nThe discount tempted Leo. In the end, he decided to save up the tickets for the additional draw and guaranteed rate.\n\"Alright. Time to work!\"\nLeo went out of the bus to go to work as usual. However, this day was different.\nIn front of Leo's motorhome bus, Ivy, Esen, Marc, and Beatrice gathered. Behind them was a company of undead creatures.\nLeo didn't fear ghosts. He stared at the crowd and frowned.\nHe didn't mind that Esen brought friends. However, he was dissatisfied as she never informed him.\n\"This ain't Halloween y'all. I have no candies for you. Also, Esen. Next time, introduce them to me first so that I can add their names to the employee list. I can't let them roam free without permission or the Fenrir statue will eat them. He likes bones.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen rolled her eyes as she couldn't understand what Leo was referring to. She rested her hands on her hips and leaned forward.\n\"Geezer, I need your help.\"\nLeo smirked. \"Is that the attitude of someone who needs help?\"\n\"Meh, I don't give a damn. We're out of tea. I want more tea for age reduction! I want my people to become alive again.\"\nLeo pursed his lips and glanced at Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice. Although the trio had drunk a lot of tea, their skin already turned purple. It didn't look like the tea worked on them.\nOn the other hand, Esen still remained a graceful flat-chested high elf. She also didn't smell like a corpse.\nAfter inspecting the crowd, Leo wondered why Esen was resurrected while the others stayed undead. He closed his eyes and recalled the difference between her and her minions.\n\"Esen.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nWhile recalling the old memory, Leo asked her. \"Do you remember how I resurrected you?\"\n\"…No clue.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo remembered that he almost mutated her, but he managed to save her life by shoving his blood down her throat.\n'Was that incident the reason?'\nThe corners of Leo's mouth curved up into a faint smile. He believed that he got the answer.\n\"Sure. But once I resurrect them, will they swear allegiance to me and be my employees for the rest of their lives?\"\nOne of the death knights at the back shouted. \"If you can remove the curse, we will do anything! Even if you want us to fight overlords, we'll do it for you!\"\nAfter the knight shouted, the others followed suit.\n\"That's for certain!\"\n\"We take pride in our loyalty! We, the Molg Tribe, keep our promises!\"\nLeo was satisfied with the answer. He turned his attention to Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice.\n\"Good. But that's not what I really want. I need something different. By the way, have you heard of an earth fate crystal? I need that for alchemy.\"",

Please accept our tribute.\"\n\"You're exaggerating. Anyway, thanks for the crystal. In exchange, I'll try to… resurrect y'all.\"\nLeo dryly laughed as he almost bit his tongue. It felt weird to say that he would resurrect these walking skeletons when he wasn't even a priest in RPG games.\n\"Now, go grab the tea in the granary. Drink 'em until you look like this damn tsundere elf.\" Leo ordered the crowd.\nEsen frowned. \"What's sun-de-le?\"\n\"A cute waifu material that deserves a lot of love.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen's face reddened, and her body stiffened. Smoke came out from her ears. She misheard \"Waifu\" as \"Wife\", and she thought that Leo saw her as his future wife.\nOn the other hand, Leo referred to Japanese anime characters. However, as it had been 50,000 years since he last watched an anime, he forgot the right terms to call the trope.\nWhile Esen was flustered, Ivy took this opportunity to ask Leo.\n\"When will you get married, Holy One?\"\n\"Dafuq?!\"\nIt was Leo's turn to be speechless. His body stiffened while his mind wondered why she had come to such a conclusion.\nStill, it reminded him of his future. He had been single for 50,000 years because he was the only \"Human\" on Earth. But at this moment, he lived in a civilization and mingled with the locals. It was about time for him to think about growing a family.\nLeo glanced at Sierra as her big assets came to his mind. He also thought of the sexy lamias with 6 boobas as they were his type.\n\"Probably when I can score a mother of my babies. Well, that's an odd question. Why do you ask?\"\nIvy faintly smiled and saluted. She secretly glanced at Esen, who was still flabbergasted and embarrassed.\n\"Nothing, sir. Just curious.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Leo changed the subject. \"When you get your fleshly body back, come find me. The resurrection process will be very risky because I need to touch y'all and feed you my blood. It will be very painful and dangerous. If you fail to endure the pain, you will probably die… again.\"\n\"We're not afraid of death, Holy One. We're already dead.\"\n\"…I know.\"\nLeo dryly laughed and facepalmed. He didn't know what to feel.\nIvy and Leo continued to chat for 10 minutes before the undead clan excused themselves. As for Esen, she didn't speak a word.\n.\nAfter Esen's group had left, Leo flickered the hand-sized crystal in the air and let it fall into his alien ring.\n\"This is the fourth!\"\nDING\n.\nFate Crystal Tutorial\nFate Crystals are profound artifacts that created the universe. By collecting at least seven fate crystals of the same quality, the collector can gain new strength, depending on the crystal's quality.\nEarth Fate Crystals are useless to you. However, it will be nice to collect them for future usage. Maybe someone around you can find them useful?\nBe warned. You are not the only one who searches for these crystals. There will be competitors, and they are not your run-in-a-mill pushovers.\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (4/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (0/1)\nSecondary Objectives:\n1 – Kill 7 Immortals (2/7)\n2 – Upgrade Humble General Store to Shopping Mall (1/1)\nPrimary Mission Rewards: Gnosis of Earth Fate, True Earth Fate Crystal, Ring of Entity Upgrade Feature\nSecondary Mission Rewards: 7 Lucky Draws, 777 Free Tickets\n.\nLeo only needed three more crystals to complete the primary objectives. As for the secondary one, he might have to rely on the monthly PVP mode and the Fate Arena.\n'Time to get going. I've prepared enough.'\nAfter spending a week practicing flight skills, Leo was confident that he could fly alone. However, as the trip might take days, Leo wasn't sure if he should head there without a toilet and a bed.\nSince it might be a long trip, Leo decided to take the battle bus with him. But first, he needed to inform his people that he would be absent for a while. He headed to the store to inform his employees.\n.\n.\nLeo stood in front of his bus, staring at Esen, Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice. They pestered Leo to tag along. Moreover, they wanted to bring the crowd of 100 elite death knights, archliches, and grim reapers along.\n\"You lots…\" Leo had a headache. \"I'm heading out for work. Why do you want to come with me?\"\nIvy grinned and made an excuse. \"We still need you to resurrect us. Since this trip might be long, it would have been a waste of time if we waited for you here. We should accompany you and complete the ritual along the way so that we won't waste the tea.\"\nLeo understood that Ivy didn't want to waste her time. However, he didn't understand why Esen wanted to tag along. Moreover, her clothes were weirdly cute.\nInstead of wearing the Florida Domain's uniform, she wore a silver evening dress from the clothing store, and she carried a small jewel handbag. Her hairstyle also changed into curly long hair, touching her shoulders. Her light makeup also covered the made her skin less shiny, which pleased the eyes.\nEsen looked like she was about to attend a ball.\n\"Esen.\" Leo dully stared at the elf. \"Are you going to a prom or something?\"\nThe elf in question dodged Leo's eye contact. Her face was still red to the ears. Still, she was capable of making a conversation.\n\"W-What's prom?\"\n\"A party where hormone-driven young men and women attend before they get drunk, secretly have sex in a toilet, and go home without alerting their parents that they are no longer virgins.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\nBecause of Leo's warped mindset, Esen misunderstood the prom as a vulgar party. She almost tore the clothes from the embarrassment. Fortunately, the clothes were so durable that Esen couldn't even put a dent in it.\nAfter teasing Esen enough, Leo invited the group to the bus.\n\"There aren't many rooms. Make sure you don't break anything.\"\nEverybody except Esen bowed to Leo. They got on the bus one after another.\nIvy and Esen were the last to enter the bus. The former dragged her master into the vehicle and whispered to her.\n'Your Majesty! Make sure to cling to him as much as possible. If you stay close to him, you will get stronger. If better, dual-cultivate with him to absorb his virgin yang. That way, you will attain godhood.'\n\"STOP TEMPTING ME! I'M NOT DUAL-CULTIVATING WITH THAT GEEZER!\"\n\"Have you seen his youthful appearance yet? If he drinks enough tea, he will become young. He might be handsome.\"\n\"I'M NOT DUAL-CULTIVATING!\"\nEsen screamed at her subordinate and kicked her inside the bus.\nMeanwhile, Leo overheard the conversation. He raised his eyebrows in confusion.\n\"What the hell are they trying to do? Matchmaking? Pfft. I ain't into flat boards. She's a good body pillow, though.\"\n.\nAfter getting on the bus, Leo drove it and took off. He flew the bus north.\nWhile driving, Leo upgraded the bus to level 12. The lobby area expanded, and more bedrooms appeared. All 100 knights, liches, and reapers could have a room of their own.\nLeo had no time to admire the bus's interior as he was the only one who could fly this battle bus. He focused on the task at hand.\nUnfortunately, the busy-body archlich girl didn't leave him alone. She whispered something to Esen's ears. A minute later, Esen walked toward Leo and sat on his lap.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nEsen's face and ears were so red that her head emitted strong heat and white smoke. On the other hand, Leo stared at Esen for a while before he glanced at Ivy.\nIvy maintained her pokerface. She advised Leo.\n\"Holy One. Please use her body as you see fit. She cultivates virgin yin, and her physique is compatible with you. If you dual-cultivate with her, your strength will improve leap and bound.\"\nLeo gave Ivy a meaningful look. \"I ain't banging the girl. What are you, a Hollywood pimp?\"\n\"I only hope for the best for you and Her Majesty.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He turned to Esen next.\nHowever, the high elf looked up and gazed at Leo's face. Her eyes were moist because of embarrassment.\nLeo lightly bonked her with the edge of his palm. Then, he adjusted her posture and made her face the front. Without letting her react, he grabbed her hands and placed them on the wheel.\nAfter correcting her posture, Leo slipped out of his seat and let Esen sit in the driver's seat.\n\"You keep driving north. I'm gonna go take a nap.\"\nEsen: \"…\"\nIvy: \"…\"\nLeo left and entered his bedroom. As for Ivy and Esen, they looked at each other.\n\"Is he gay?\" The corner of Esen's mouth twitched. She was offended.\n\"More like, he isn't easily tempted, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Is my charm not enough?\" Esen pouted.\n\"You're very beautiful. But I think the Holy One's taste is a bit special. I think we have to improve your femininity… starting from your chest.\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nThe bus flew over the Cauliflower City and headed further north. Wandering cultivators noticed the vehicle, but none bothered attacking it.\nAfter traveling 1,000 km further, Leo came out of his room to check the view.\nThe north of Yan Empire Continent was full of snowy mountains. A few of them were pencil-like mountains while the others were series of mountain ranges.\nAmong the white mountains, a pitch black stood out. It was ten times taller than Mount Everest, and its peak reached the space. Yet, all light couldn't reflect from the dark mountain's surface.\nLeo gazed at the mountain and recalled the statue's words. Indeed, he couldn't miss it.\n\"That's our destination.\"\nLeo pulled Esen out of his seat. He resumed driving the bus, bringing it closer to the mountain of darkness.\nEsen and Ivy stopped seducing Leo. They remembered this mountain well.\n\"What are you doing here, geezer? Isn't that Immortalium Mountain?\"\n\"You know the mountain?\" Leo was surprised.\n\"That damn mountain's territory was a forbidden area during my reign. The mineral there is so toxic that it degrades our souls. If we get too close, the link between our fleshly bodies and souls will be cut off, and we'll die.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo widely smiled as he found the mountain and Immortalium interesting. He wanted to learn more about it. Thus, he navigated his bus and landed the bus on a frozen lake 10 kilometers away from the Immortalium Mountain.\nHe put on the suit and got off the bus. As he prepared to fly alone toward the mountain, Esen tugged his clothes.\n\"What?\" Leo looked back. He started to get annoyed.\n\"S-Soul… Our souls.\"\n\"What soul?\"\n\"There's a way to prevent the soul links from being cut. When my men explored the mountain, we sent couples there together to mine the Immortalium ores.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"O-O-Only husband and wife can enter there! Unless you have a wife, you can't go there! Your soul will instantly return to the karma river if you go there!\"\nLeo clicked his tongue. He thought Esen tried to trick him into dual-cultivating with her.\n\"I don't have time for that. Let go.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen paused. She turned toward Ivy, asking for her help with her look.\nIvy nodded. But before she could speak, Leo already kicked the ground and flew toward the black mountain.\nEsen and Ivy dropped their jaws. It was too late to pull Leo back as he already crossed the boundary of no return.",

      "content": "Chapter 203 Naked Florida Man Climbed Mount Everest to Set a Guinness World Record for Longest Urine.\nChapter 203 – Naked Florida Man Climbed Mount Everest to Set a Guinness World Record for Longest Urine.\nFor the first time, Leo flew by himself outside of his domain. A week of training was enough for Leo to adapt to the flying technique.\nThe massive mountain emitted a dark aura. As Leo got closer, he started losing his vision. Lights vanished from his eyes, but his consciousness remained.\nLeo turned around and blinked twice. He instantly regained his sight. But when he turned back to look at the mountain, he was blinded again.\n\"How annoying.\"\nLeo's iris changed from green to red. His vision adjusted the natural light and tone. A few seconds later, he saw everything in yellowish and red infrared vision.\nThe mountain's surface was strangely hot despite being surrounded by snowy mountains. Strangely, the freezing environment here wasn't affected as if the heat was limited to the mountain's surface.\nLeo braced the danger and got closer enough to land on a cliff. But as soon as his feet touched the black metal floor, his vision blurred.\nThe surrounding environment changed. Leo found himself on Miami Beach when he was still a human.\nA crowd of pedestrians, tourists, and locals minded their businesses on the beach. They either wore swimsuits or light clothes while Leo was still in his suit.\n\"Huh? Oh, I'm hallucinating.\"\nLeo frowned. This wasn't his first time dealing with random hallucinations. After closing his eyes for a few seconds, he lightly scratched the tip of his tongue with his teeth to sharpen his senses. Then, he opened his eyes.\nThe view reverted back to the black mountain.\n\"Heh. Is that it?\"\nLeo shrugged and looked around, searching for a better place to explore. He looked up for a moment and jumped, climbing the altitude.\nInstantly, Leo was 1,000 kilometers above the seawater, but he hadn't found the peak of this mountain yet. As he looked up, he discovered that the mountaintop was beyond the atmosphere levels.\nSeeing the absolute unit of a mysterious mountain, Leo was taken aback. While flying higher, he scratched his head.\n\"How come nobody notice this thing? It's so big and tall… Oh, wait. It blends in space. But…\"\nAs no light reflected the surface of this mountain, nobody could see it in the dark. Still, Leo was puzzled why the locals never tried to exploit or extract this resource.\nHe soon learned the reason after he reached the stratosphere of this planet. The sky dimmed, and the stars became clearer. Also, Leo spotted a strange object orbiting the mountaintop.\nUpon getting closer, Leo could see what it was.\nIt was a statue of an elderly man in a cultivator robe, holding a thunderbolt in his left hand. Its right hand wielded a long black katana.\nAs Leo got closer, the statue moved. It looked back at Leo, and its eyes glowed. Their eyes met.\nThe statue adjusted its posture and faced Leo. It pointed the katana at his face and bellowed.\n\"This place belongs to the Kishin Clan! If you value your life, go back!\"\nAfter warning Leo, the latter's sight blurred again. The scenery around him changed once more.\nInstead of flying upward, Leo found himself sitting on a bed in a hotel room. He looked down and found his unit.\n\"Why am I naked?\"\nLeo frowned and stood up. He scratched his tongue with his teeth again, hoping to break the illusion. However, a shadowy figure appeared in front of Leo and thrust a long katana at his chest.\nTINK\nThe katana failed to penetrate his skin. Moreover, Leo caught the tip of the sword with his left hand.\nThe shadow silhouette revealed its identity. It was the statue from earlier.\n\"Figured as much.\"\nTeaching the statue a lesson, Leo lightly japed the statue's face with his right fist. The head exploded upon impact.\nAfter the statue's head was destroyed, the illusion was broken. However, Leo still found himself in a different place.\nHe still held the black katana of the statue earlier. Upon looking around, Leo found himself in a meadow. In front of him were a hundred naked women, a mountain of essence stones, a thousand chests of golden bars, and a floating crystal.\nLeo recognized the crystal. It looked like an earth fate crystal that he needed. But upon giving it a closer look, Leo scoffed in disgust.\n\"An illusion on top of another. Is this some kind of a trap? If I fall for it and take anything, will I get trapped here forever?\"\nLeo flipped the black katana and grabbed the handle. Then, he slashed the floating crystal in half.\nThe naked women vanished along with the crystals, except one. The remaining woman had the same appearance as Esen, but she had a full rack of assets.\nAll gold coins, essence stones, and other valuables disappeared, leaving them alone. The remaining woman coyly walked toward Leo and smiled at him.\n\"Florida Man. How do I look now?\"\nLeo sneered, \"Fake as EF. Get lost, damn illusion!\"\nNot a shred of hesitant, Leo swung the katana and beheaded the woman. She widened her eyes in shock for a moment while her head rolled on the ground. But a second later, she laughed.\n\"Hahahaha! You're the toughest one yet. All cultivators and Molgs in the past failed because of their greed and lust. But you, Florida Man. I like you.\"\n\"Who the duck are you?\"\nDespite asking, Leo walked toward the head and stomped it. The head exploded and turned to dust.\nThe headless body of fake Esen regrew her head. She changed her appearance into a naked lamia with six breasts that Leo had met at the Fate Stadium. She lay on the ground and wiggled her finger, tempting him.\n\"I'm your greatest desire, Florida Man. Why don't you give up cultivating and partake of me? You can stay with me forever, and I can shapeshift into any woman you like. If you desire a lamia, I can transform into one. If you desire a female Minotaur, I can do it too. Or… do you want to try the 2D girls that you dreamed of 50,000 years ago?\"\nJudging from the woman's words, she had some sort of mind-reading or memory-reading power. Leo narrowed his eyes as this woman was trickier than he had thought.\n\"Not interested. Go die.\"\nLeo stomped toward her and seized her neck. He let go of the katana and raised his fist, preparing to cleanse her soul with his holy punch.\nThe woman turned into smoke and slipped out of Leo's hand. She appeared behind him and embraced him from behind.\n\"How barbaric. Well, I like wild men. Stop playing hard to get and hug me.\"\n\"Nope!\"\nLeo swung a left back fist at the woman's face. It connected and shattered her into smoke.\nAfter the woman was gone, Leo broke the illusion. However, he was already free-floating in space, and he slowly drifted away from the planet.\n\"Ah, crap!\"\nTreating the void as water, Leo waved his arms and legs like a frog, swimming back to the mountaintop. Fortunately, his flight skills helped him back to the mountain. Had he never learned a flying technique, he would have drifted to the void.\nHe landed on the mountaintop and let out a deep sigh of relief. He wiped his sweat and checked on the surface of the mysterious Immortalium Mountain.\nLeo pinched a piece of black rock and pulled it out of the mountain. It was so sticky that Leo was forced to exert 10% of his strength to get a piece out. Even after it had come out, the piece of black mineral behaved like a magnet, pulling itself back to the ground.\nSensing the resisting force, Leo stored a piece of Immortalium rock in his storage ring. He walked around and explored the area.\nThe statue earlier was nowhere in sight. As for the black katana, it floated freely in the void and drifted away.\nLeo shrugged as he didn't care about a lousy black sword. But as he was about to abandon it, the sword flew toward Leo and pointed its tip toward him.\nTINK\nThe katana's tip hit the back of Leo's head.\n\"Oi. You. I already ignored you, but you dare to attack me first?\"\nLeo turned around and grabbed the katana's hilt. His left hand held the handle while his right hand grabbed the blade's body. Then, he kneed it.\nCLANK\nThe black katana was broken in half!\nAs soon as it was broken, a white aura came out from the broken blade. Smoke silhouettes of spirits rushed out and flew to the void.\nAlthough Leo had no idea what he had just done, he observed the ghosts. He noticed that there were a bunch of elves and monsters in the mix, but the majority of souls were humans.\nAlso, one of them glared at Leo. He also looked back and noticed that her soul was darker than the rest.\nDING\n<You have slain the Ghost Blade, Killer Queen.>\n\"Huh?\"\nThe system message surprised him. Still, it explained a lot. Leo figured out the situation.\n\"So, you must be Killer Queen, the Ghost Blade? I guess you must have been busy collecting souls of wandering cultivators while you're hiding here.\"\n\"BASTARD!\" Killer Queen's soul bellowed. \"MY KISHIN CLAN WILL NOT LET YOU LIVE! THEY WILL LEARN OF THIS PLANET'S COORDINATES THROUGH ME, AND THEY WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!\"\n\"Hey, you attacked me first!\"\n\"YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE MESSING WITH, NU'EARTHE! YOU SHOULD BE HONORED TO DIE BY MY HANDS AND BECOME ONE WITH ME!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He was tired of her stupidity and one-dimensional behavior.\n\"Lady. What has happened is the definition of EF around and find out. This is the consequences of your actions. Had you run into a weaker prey, you might have won. But since you chose to pick a fight with me, I retaliated. Well, let's stop talking and continue with our businesses. I'm an introvert. I'm allergic to conversations.\"\nLeo snapped his finger and summoned his dao avatar from his ring. The avatar appeared behind the sword ghost and grabbed her nape. Then, it tilted his head to the side.\nThe avatar discovered something inside the ghost. He smirked.\n'Master, may I consume her?'\n\"Consume, as consummate, or eat?\"\n'Both.'\nLeo rolled his eyes again. \"I guess spirits are still bangable, huh? Well, if she's your type, go ahead.\"\n'Just kidding. I don't have sexual organs. I can't procreate.'\n\"…\"\n'I'll be devouring her soul. Thanks for the food, master.'\n\"…You're welcome.\"\nThe dao avatar dragged the sword ghost's soul into Leo's alien ring and vanished. A second later, the ring spat something out.\nA white crystal ball with the size of a basketball rolled on the ground. As soon as Leo found it, he recognized it right away. After all, he had seen one at the pagoda of a mystic realm.\nThat was a gnosis crystal.\n\"…\"\nLeo widely smiled. At least, he got something worthwhile. However, at that moment, Leo sensed a crisis.\nHe needed to take a leak.\nWith unwavering focus, he assumed his position at the edge of a cliff. He zipped down and whipped his personal gun out. The graceful holy water gushed out from the chamber, but it didn't go down the mountain as the gravity was too light here. Sparkling yellowish liquid droplets floated freely in the atmosphere before they vanished into rainbow smoke.\nA minute of long relief sent a chill running down Leo's spine. He waved his gun and stroked it to remove the residual holy water in the chamber. Then, he collected his gun into his pants and zipped up.\nLeo didn't think much about the consequences of his actions as he just peed. However, this evaporated holy water would change the atmosphere of this world forever.\n.\n.\nFar away from Leo's star system, a lone elderly fisherman sat next to a seashore, fishing and waiting for a fish to take a bite. Behind him was a group of happy Cathulhu's children playing catch.\nOverlord Xiaomao, the fisherman, gazed at the horizon in a daze. But suddenly, his eyes shifted, and he turned around to look at the general direction of a certain star.\nHe uttered to himself.\n\"Did someone just break the karmic laws? Even if he's a fellow overlord, he can't just convert a mortal world into an immortal realm! He's just asking for trouble.\"\nOverlord Xiaomao shook his head. But as he sighed, a Cathulhu child hopped on his lap and meowed at him.\n\"Master, where fish, munya?\"\nThe other cats also begged for food, \"Where fish, munya?\"\nOverlord Xiaomao laughed, \"Hang on, kids. Give me a second.\"\nThe fisherman grabbed his fishing rod and lightly pulled it.\nZAAAAAA\nSuddenly, a massive tuna the size of an African continent jumped out of the sea, holding the bait in its mouth.\nIt was neither an ordinary fish nor an immortal fish. It was also not a deity or a sage.\nThe tuna was an entity of this sea that Overlord Xiaomao had been raising as livestock!\n\"FISH, MUNYA!\"\nThe kids celebrated, looking forward to a feast.\nThe overlord yanked the fishing rod. The next moment, the sea overlord's head and body were separated and deboned. All innards and blood returned to the sea while its juicy white meat, skin, and scales remained.\nThe old man collected 90% of the meat to his storage ring. Then, he waved his finger, extracting meat from the fish's head and distributing food to the kids.\nWhile feeding the kids, Overlord Xiaomao glanced at the faint star that he could barely see. The light hadn't traveled to his planet yet, but he already noticed the aura of holy water in the atmosphere. It reminded him of his blood and sweat.\n\"Who did that?\"",

The Doll Was Haunted, but Florida Man Happily Exorcised It on His Bed.\n\"Now, then.\"\nLeo grabbed the gnosis crystal. It instantly vanished into his body. No dao avatar appeared. Instead, the system confused him.\n<Congratulations. You have digested the Gnosis of Pocket Dimension!>\n<A new feature has been unlocked. You may explore the pocket dimension inside you.>\n\"Huh? Oh, okay?\"\nAlthough Leo was confused, he checked his system menu to see a new feature. However, he was left disappointed. No new feature showed up in his system menu.\n\"Where the hell is that new mode? System, is this an April's fool joke?!\"\nThe system didn't respond.\n\"Tsk.\"\nSince Leo got no answer from the system, he turned his attention to his alien ring. He rubbed it as if he wished to summon the Genie of the Lamp.\n\"Come out, my dude. I need help.\"\nWHOOSH\nBlack smoke came out from the alien ring and condensed into a dao avatar. The spirit furrowed his brow and stared at Leo as he was annoyed.\n\"My name is Leonardo. Please don't forget that, master.\"\n\"Obviously, I never forget that name. That WAS my name, you thief!\"\n\"Of course. After all, I'm your shadow in the past.\"\nThe spirit's appearance changed. He transformed into a brown-haired Caucasian man who seemed to be in his 20s. He had wide shoulders and a refined physique, including 6 abs. His defined jawlines and facial hair resembled Chad memes on the internet.\nLooking at his old appearance, Leo let out a long sigh. In the past, he thought he was perfect. But living in isolation for 50,000 years, Leo learned that appearance was a piece of useless illusion for people to admire. What mattered the most was his absolute strength, flexibility, and survival skills.\n\"I hate your look.\" Leo laughed at Leonardo.\nLeonardo rolled his eyes. \"Just get to the point. Oh, wait. Never mind. I know what you'll be asking me. The answer is your dantian.\"\n\"My dantian?\"\n\"A dantian is a core of every mortal in this universe. Every humanoid creature has three. Every mammal monster has three to four. The locations vary, depending on each species. As for us, our dantians are located in our brain, our heart, and our navel.\"\n\"Navel? Is it in my belly button? Somewhere around my bladder? Is it IN THE BLADDERS?\" Leo looked at his stomach and unbuttoned his shirt. He scratched his belly and peeled a layer of dead skin. While he was at it, he squeezed his navel to check if he had any stone inside. Fortunately, his skin was healthy as his cancer cells took care of foreign substances for him.\n\"Stop imagining stupid things, master. Of course not, the lower dantian IS NOT in the bladders. We don't keep our energy source in the pee stomach!\"\n\"Oh, what a relief.\" Leo laughed.\n\"Anyway,\" Leonardo coughed. \"It's usually hiding between our intestines. In our case, it's attached to the lower stomach like a tumor... It's a very healthy tumor to have, by the way. Don't try to cut open your stomach to see it.\"\n\"…I didn't say anything.\" Leo was disappointed that his spirit said it first. He was planning to slice his stomach open to check what it looked like.\nLeonardo's expression turned dark as he knew what Leo was thinking. He changed the subject.\n\"The dantian usually absorbs Qi that you digest in your stomach. Then, it channels the energy through your meridians to your heart and brain. Well, you have been doing it naturally since day one, so I don't need to explain further.\"\n\"…I still don't know how I do it, though.\"\n\"You can't explain when and how you learn to breathe, right?\"\n\"Right. Is it the same thing as how we automatically learn how to admire round and firm boobas?\"\n\"…That's not it, master.\"\nLeonardo had a headache as Leo was too childish. He couldn't blame him since his master got tazzed by countless red and black tribulation lightning bolts in the past. He might have become silly and childish because of that.\n.\n.\nIt took Leonardo 30 minutes to explain how the three dantians functioned as a whole because Leo kept interrupting him with stupid jokes. After the lecture finished, Leonardo returned to Leo's alien ring to rest.\nLeo was proud of his shadow of the past. He didn't have a shred of doubt as to why Leonardo was smarter than him.\nPutting the new knowledge to a test, Leo closed his eyes and sank his consciousness into his pocket dimension, aka the dantian dimension!\n.\n.\nWhen Leo opened his eyes, he discovered an endless grassland to the west while a raging rainbow sea was located to the east. On the north, a lone laboratory capsule tube full of black liquid stood there.\nTo the south, there was a wooden desk with a photo frame. It was a picture of a family of four, but their faces were blurry. A trace of black ink remained on their faces as if someone painted them to cover their eyes.\nThe two adults in the photo were his parents. A young boy in front of the father was Leo. As for the other guy, Leo forgot about him.\nHe couldn't even remember his face or his name, let alone his existence.\nLeo frowned at the photo. He still recognized the family, but he couldn't recall their faces.\nLooking at the photo ruined his mood. He was reminded of an unpleasant memory when he was a human. Thus, he walked toward the desk and grabbed the photo. Then, he put the face of the photo down to cover it.\n\"My day is ruined. Who the hell put it here?! Who's mocking me?!\"\nLeo looked around, but he found nobody. Only he and his naked butt were alone in this place.\nRealizing that he was naked, Leo realized that he was not in the real world. He pondered for a moment before he figured out why the picture was here.\n\"This place… is my world?\"\nAccording to Leonardo's lecture, this place contained a fragment of Leo's soul and memory. It also reflected the owner's life, character, past, and aspirations.\nUnfortunately, Leo only found the test tube that he got his second life and the working desk of his father.\nThe old memory distracted Leo enough. He stopped looking at the things and focused on what he could do here. He walked toward the sea.\nThe rainbow sea contained all of his elemental essences in the dantian. Leo stepped onto the white beach and slowly walked on the surface of the sea.\nThe raging sea's waves suddenly ceased. The water became as still as a silent lake.\nWith every step Leo walked past, a rainbow lotus flower emerged and bloomed. By the time Leo realized it, Leo walked a hundred steps and created a hundred rainbow lotus flowers in his elemental essence sea.\n\"Oh, dear. Sea pollution gets the best of me. Anyway, flowers won't hurt.\"\nLeo jumped off the sea and flew east, inspecting the endless sea's boundary.\nAfter 10 minutes of flying at the speed of sound, Leo still couldn't find the end of the sea or another continent. He stopped and landed on top of the seawater.\n\"What do I do here? What's the point of this place?\"\nWhile Leo pondered what to do next, he recalled that he got the mysterious new system feature from the gnosis. Thus, he tried to summon a system menu.\nDING\nStrangely, it worked. However, the system menu wasn't the same as the lifespan system he had.\nAn annoying rainbow system screen was so dazzling that Leo couldn't see the screen clearly. He was forced to narrow his eyes to read the texts.\n.\nPocket Dantian Menu\n- Combat Simulation\n- Dantian Universe Management\n- Lifeform Management\n- Time Ratio Settings\n- Energy Expenditure Settings\n.\n\"Hoh?\"\nThe new features interested Leo. As the system never provided Leo with a tutorial or explanation, he blindly pressed the combat simulation mode to test the water.\nDING\n<Please choose a fighter.>\nAnother menu appeared. This time, it showed a list of other people's statuses and portraits.\nThe status menu revealed all their details – Age, race, cultivation strength, skills, special abilities, favorite weaponry, and potential percentage.\nThe screen was also strange. Under the potential percentage panel, there was a slider. Leo could adjust the potential value of the status menu.\n\"What does this do?\"\nLeo scrolled through the list of people and found Esen among them. Curious, Leo checked her details.\n.\nName: Esen Sydin IV\nRace: High Elf\nAge: 10,007\nCultivation Base: Celestial Emperor\nSkills: Dao of Necromancy, Dark Magic, Soul Domain of Undead Army\nSpecials: Virgin Yin Blood, Divine Elf Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Nameless Breech-Loader Rifle\nPotential Percentage: 75%\n.\nSeeing the potential percentage of Esen, Leo laughed at her. He moved the slider bar to the rightmost, increasing her potential to 1,000% for a laugh.\nBut as soon as he did, her status changed.\n.\nName: Esen Sydin IV, the Overlord of Death Elf\nRace: Death Elf\nAge: 10,007\nCultivation Base: 12-Galaxy Entity\nSkills: Providence of Necromancy, Death Magic, Mandate of Destruction, Mandate of Death Legion\nSpecials: Virgin Yin Blood, Divine Elf Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Staff of Corrupted Divine Elf\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nLeo was speechless. He realized what the slider bar was for.\n\"Is this the difficulty adjustment setting? Wow, this stupid wench is… quite sexy.\"\nThe final form of Esen drastically changed. Instead of being a graceful elf, she became a dark elf. Moreover, her chest was round and bouncy, unlike the flat version.\nStrangely, Esen's hair became white, and her eyes were pitch black. The display portrait screen showed her rainbow aura, similar to Leo's.\nAlthough Leo was wary of her skills, his finger pressed the [Summon] button to call her to this world.\nDING\nA shadow of Esen manifested in front of Leo. She appeared with a set of black skull armor and a long gem staff. Despite wearing heavy armor, her gear showed a lot of legs and cleavage.\nThe shadow of Esen glared at Leo and raised her staff. Before Leo could utter a word, something entered Leo's chest.\n\"…\"\nHis heart clenched slightly. Leo felt like his heart stopped beating.\nHe shrugged and faced Esen's shadow. He understood what this mode was for.\n\"I see. So, this mode exists to train me. I can fight anybody I want in my consciousness? Is that why it is called a simulation? Neat… but pointless.\"\nLeo snorted and dashed toward Esen. The latter backed away and raised her staff again. This time, a million death knights with the aura of entities emerged from the sea.\nLeo ignored the emerging legion of death knights. He threw a punch at Esen's face.\nEsen vanished as she blinked to avoid the punch. However, Leo predicted her movements and reached out his hand to grab her neck.\nUnfortunately, Leo miscalculated the distance. He grabbed her chest instead.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nLeo widely grinned. He loved the feeling.\n\"Well, you're not real, so this doesn't count as molesting, right?\"\n\"…\"\nThe shadow's eyes emitted dark flame as if she were angry. She opened her mouth and screamed.\nLeo shuddered as his cancer cells trembled. A few cells exploded and died, but they self-resurrected instantly.\n\"Err…\"\nLeo was confused about how this fight worked. As he was just a consciousness, he still felt that his cancer cells were slightly damaged from this attack.\nSince Esen started threatening his life, Leo got serious. He stopped molesting the girl and threw a punch to her chest.\nBOOM\nBefore the death knights could join the battle, Esen's body exploded and shattered to pieces. Then, all death knights disappeared.\nThe system informed him of his victory, but a strange development followed.\nDING\n<You have defeated a shadow fighter of the highest difficulty!>\n<Defeat the same fighter 999 more times, and you can learn one of her skills.>\n\"…Huh?\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen and her subordinates still kept their distance from the mountain. They looked up and continued to track Leo's life signature.\nHe was still alive. Everybody was relieved.\nBut suddenly, Esen sensed a tingling feeling on her right chest. She felt like someone just touched it.\nHer face reddened, but she pretended that nothing had happened.\n'W-What happened to me? W-Who touched me?!'\nThere was a pricking feeling in her chest afterward, but it only jolted her. However, that previous touch was too memorable as it felt like Leo's rough hands.",

Ain't nobody got time for that!\"\nLeo scratched his head. Although gaining a free skill was tempting, he wasn't interested in the grind. After all, the previous fight was annoying as Esen's shadow was a lot faster than Situ Nantian. Had Leo fought her 2 months earlier, he would have been struggling to catch her.\nHe had enough with the simulation mode. He checked the other features next.\n.\nPocket Dantian Menu\n- Combat Simulation\n- Dantian Universe Management\n- Lifeform Management\n- Time Ratio Settings\n- Energy Expenditure Settings\n.\nThe next one in the queue was the Dantian Universe Management. Leo pressed on it and activated this mode. Then, changes occurred in his consciousness.\nHis body automatically floated out of the planet. His sight got stuck in the void, and he could only look forward. The grassland star, which he had been on earlier, became as tiny as a grain of sand.\nAside from the grassland star, there were other stars and colorful masses of gas and dust in the void. However, they seemed so far away from the starting world.\nDING\nAnother red system screen manifested and floated in front of Leo. It showed the status of this universe.\n.\nDantian Universe Status\nMax Star Capacity: 340,282,366,920,938,463,374,607,431,768,211,455\nInactive Stars: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615\nCurrent Active Star(s) In Use: 1\nAverage Star Mastery: Level 1/10\n.\n\"…\"\nLeo almost swore out loud. There were so many stars in this universe. However, the total number of stars that Leo could use was only one! Moreover, the stars had a level, and it was pathetically low.\nAt the bottom of the menu, several buttons hinted that Leo could do something about these unused stars.\n[Assign Element]\n[Assign Roles]\n[Create Galaxy]\nLeo spent a few minutes experimenting with these buttons. Fortunately, there was a hint of what they were for as a description appeared whenever Leo hovered his finger over a button.\nHe read the descriptions while he experimented on it. Surprisingly, everything was direct and simple.\n[Assign Element] was straightforward. Using this feature, Leo could assign a type of element essence for an inactive star, and it would become active.\nAfter a star got its elemental essence, the [Assign Role] button became available to use. It allowed Leo to choose the role of an active star, and there were four major choices – Habitat, Core Energy Source, Spiritual Source, and Material Source.\nThe habitat option gave permission to local lifeforms to evolve or grow. Leo could play god and create any living being on one of these stars with this option.\nThe core energy source option transformed an elemental star into a core of a black hole, a sun, or a core of a galaxy, which enabled the [Create Galaxy] mode.\nSpiritual Source's button linked an elemental star to a core energy source and developed a star system. When at least two stars joined and became a star system, they provided Leo with an unending flow of Qi and energy.\nAs for the Material Source, it was more magical than the rest. It allowed Leo to use whatever energy he had to materialize anything in the real world! However, it had a prerequisite that the local energy source or materials from the star systems and galaxies were enough to supply such a grand endeavor.\nFor example, to create a rock in the real world, Leo needed to sacrifice a thousand rocks in his universe. Then, a real rock would appear in the real world and carry the same characteristics as the 1,000 sacrificed rocks in Leo's dantian universe.\nThe exchange rate seemed cheap at a glance. However, the sacrificed materials couldn't be regenerated. Once a star was completely consumed, it disappeared forever. The only way for Leo to get them back was to cultivate energy from the real world into his dantian universe and let the Qi and essence create a new star.\nAnd lastly, [Create Galaxy] could only be used after Leo created at least 1,000 star systems using at least a billion stars. By using this mode, Leo could group useful stars together for future usage or add exoplanets to the same group. He could also separate planets with local habitats from the energy sources if he wished to play the SIM one day.\nIt took Leo an hour to get familiarized with the new toy. However, he didn't bother creating a galaxy as it was too tedious for his taste. Again, he didn't have enough time to manually assign an element to one billion stars and design their sizes.\n\"I wish I had more time. Meh, next.\"\nMoving on, Leo glanced at the \"Lifeform Management Settings\" menu. The status showed 0 as the current population as Leo had never allowed anything to live there.\nAvoiding the complications, Leo left this mode alone for the moment. He checked the other feature, which caught his eye.\n[Time Ratio Settings]\nLeo opened the menu and found a simple screen. It showed a few numbers, descriptions, and a slider bar.\n.\nTime Ratio Settings\nTime Flow Ratio (Dantian Universe: Reality) = 1:1\n*One unit = one day.\n.\nThe slider was in the middle. Leo tested the slider bar by moving it to the furthest right. Then, the menu changed.\n.\nTime Ratio Settings\nTime Flow Ratio (Dantian Universe: Reality) = 1,000:1\n*One unit = one day.\n.\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!\"\nLeo cackled as he found what he wanted to most. In the past, he lacked free time to play or study. But now, he had all the time in the world because of this feature.\nThis was the infamous DBZ's hyperbolic time chamber! Leo could spend a thousand days in here, but only one day would pass in reality!\n\"Oh, boy. I should have used this earlier!\"\nWith this system, Leo no longer had time issues.\nHe played enough. He skipped the [Energy Expenditure Settings] as he came back here to play with the universe SIM game and activate all his available stars in his universe.\nWith a thought, Leo's consciousness returned to reality. He opened his eyes in a good mood.\n\"Nice gnosis! Now, that's what a high fantasy cultivator's power should be… Oh, no. I almost forgot my tasks.\"\nLeo snapped back to his senses and looked at the black mountain. He still hadn't finished his quest yet, so he needed to find the right place to build something on top of it.",

Florida Man Converted Engineers into AI Instead.\n﻿\nChapter 206 – Forklift Certified Florida Man Successfully Implemented AI to His Ore Refinery. Engineers Protested As Machines Didn't Need AI. Florida Man Converted Engineers into AI Instead.\nThe mountain was peaceful without the influence of the ghost blade. Leo no longer hallucinated, and his view of the blackest mountain got better.\nAfter Leo toured the mountain for another hour, he came across a cave. A trail of black smoke came from the inside, which aroused Leo's interest. He waltzed into the cave to explore.\nUnlike the outward appearance of the mountain, the cave's interior was blindingly bright. Leo was forced to revert his pupil color to green as the light hurt him.\nWhen Leo's sight adjusted to the light, he found a manmade spiral staircase without a handrail. It headed down so deep that Leo couldn't see the bottom.\nThe stairs kept glowing and shining randomly. It produced extreme heat and emitted transparent flame sometimes. When Leo stepped on it, the flame enveloped his body and threatened to burn him alive.\nHowever, Leo didn't feel anything. On the contrary, it was as lukewarm as room-temperature water.\nAs Leo didn't feel like walking down, he jumped off and fell through the center hole of the spiral staircase. The deeper Leo descended, the lights of the stairs changed to a darker tone.\nLeo lost count of how many seconds he fell from the atmosphere. When he landed on the ground, he found a boiling pit of black lava.\nWhat interested Leo wasn't the black liquid. Instead, there was a red arrow system ping, pointing at the pit.\n\"Wut da hail?\"\nThe red triangle arrow let out a loud DING sound every five seconds. Whenever it chimed, the lava erupted like a fountain, splashing black liquid everywhere. Some of the droplets hit the walls of the cave and transformed into black crystals.\nLeo swiped away the liquid that got on his suit and his face. It was as sticky as tar, but it wasn't as smelly. Instead, it smelled like burnt sugar.\nDING\nAgain, the arrow wanted Leo's attention. He also had enough of the system, so he flew toward the system arrow. Then, he touched it.\nDING\n<Strategic Resource Detected!>\n<A new construction has been unlocked!>\n<Would you like to build a mineral refinery on top of this place?>\n<Warning, building a mineral refinery outside of your domain requires 1,000,000 years of lifespan.>\n\"…\"\nLeo's hands trembled while he glanced at his lifespan balance menu. He struggled for so long to collect his first million after the transmigration. However, the damn system wanted to rob everything from him.\n\"THIS IS A SCAM! WHY DON'T YOU JUST ROB ME, DAMN SYSTEM!?\"\nDING\n<Strategic resources are \"STRATEGIC\" for a reason. Secondly, this building is the only structure that can be built outside of your territory.>\n\"…\"\nFor once, the system argued with Leo. The latter didn't expect the system to respond, and he was speechless.\nDespite being angry, Leo pondered the pros and cons. In the end, he invested his lifespan in the system anyway.\n\"This better be worth it!\"\nLeo pressed the confirmation menu.\nRUMBLE\n.\n.\nEarthquake struck the black mountain. Esen, Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice looked at the ground and maintained their balance. They also gazed at the mountain, wondering what happened.\nThey still sensed the life signature of Leo inside the mountain. Thus, they chose to wait and see how Leo would fare inside the mountain.\nHowever, the earthquake changed everything. A series of steel walls and a metal refinery factory emerged from the ground. Countless machines came out from the factory structure without anybody controlling them.\nA thousand industrial drills flew toward the mountain and began extracting the ores. Loud screeches and screaming metals echoed in the area. Within 10 seconds, large chunks of black mineral were extracted from the mountain, and auto-piloting forklifts carried them into the large refinery building.\nEsen and her crew were stunned. They might have witnessed Leo's greatness and abilities in the past, but this one exceeded everything.\nIvy came to her senses first. She reminded Esen.\n\"Let's go in and see, Your Majesty. The Holy One must have done something to the mountain!\"\n\"…\"\nEsen nodded in agreement as there was no point waiting there anymore. She steeled her heart and led her team to inspect the new structure.\n.\nThe group entered the refinery building. Upon seeing the belts and the industrial machines, everybody dropped their jaws.\nSoulless machines automatically threw raw ores into a pool of transparent liquid. Then, the ores were hardened while the impurity was dissolved in the water.\nLooking at the pool reminded Esen and everybody of the recycling center. They wondered if they had the same functions.\nAfter the ores had been purified, a claw machine picked it up and put it down on an industrial belt. The belt carried the large hardened ore to a smelter next.\nThe flame of the smelter had the same air and aura as Leo. When the cleaned ore entered the burning machine, the black ore melted into black liquid. Then, the smelting machine squeezed, compressed, and cut it into ingots. After the ores had been condensed, the belt brought them toward another pool of transparent liquid.\nZAAAA\nThe burning hot ingots fell into the freezing cold water, making countless popping sounds and bubbles. Had the ingots been other types of metal, they would have deformed or exploded. However, the Immortalium didn't react to the conflicted extreme temperature.\nZAAAA\nA few seconds later, underwater claw machines picked up the ingots and transferred them to another industrial belt, which also carried the ingots toward another station.\nThe last station was oddly an empty warehouse. Inside the refinery warehouse was a black muscular humanoid mannequin, who collected the ingots and arranged them on the shelves as if they were treasures.\nEsen and everybody didn't interfere with the machines or the mannequin. However, when the mannequin didn't pay attention to them, Esen reached out and picked one of the 10kg ingots. She brought it closer to her eyes to see it up closer.\nThe ingot retained the nature of the mountain. No light reflected from the surface of this piece of ingot, but it was full of intense essence and life force.\nThe mannequin turned around and found that Esen had one of the ingots. It paused for a moment before it resumed its job.\nRealizing that the mannequin ignored them, everybody was relieved.\n\"This must be the Holy One's work!\" Ivy muttered.\n\"Yeah, this place has that geezer's perverting aura. He built this for sure.\" Esen approved.\n\"But this structure of this magnitude should have required a thorough planning, calculating, and consideration. He must have envisioned this place before we came here!\"\n\"…Doubt it.\"\nEsen pursed her lips and looked away from the machine. She turned her attention to Leo's life signature, which quickly faded.\nHis life force was so bright before. But at the moment, it was so faint that it resembled weak immortals.\n\"…He must have spent a lot of energy. Geezer, you idiot. You should have asked me for help.\"",

Climbers Protested as They No Longer Had a Place to Dump Their Trash.\nInside the mountain cave, Leo admired the newly created factory machinery, which automatically drilled and extracted the mountain's black rock. They worked from the top down so that the mountain wouldn't collapse on the machines.\nDING\nDING\nTwo sub-quests in Leo's quest menu were completed as a result. He couldn't be happier.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 2/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 200,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Automaton), Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 15, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 15\nPhase Two Tasks (9/10 Completed)\n- Use the PVP feature once.

(Done)\n- Locate three hidden Earth Fate Crystals on your planet (2/3)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo only needed to wait for a guardian statue to return with another earth fate crystal. Then, he would complete another set of quests and get to try his luck with the gacha again.\nAs his trip here was completed, Leo shifted his attention to his new goal – resource gathering. He eyed the black lava pit.\n\"I have a feeling that I should collect these. Don't mind if I do.\"\nLeo pulled out a handful of empty spatial rings and crouched at the edge of the pool. Then, he pointed a spatial ring toward the liquid.\nA stream of boiling liquid entered the dimensional storage ring. 10 minutes later, the ring's capacity was filled, but the lava pool was still full to the brim.\n\"…\"\nLeo was perplexed as the spatial ring's capacity in his hand was the best among the best. It could store 1,000 cubic kilometers of liquid!\nYet, the lava pool never decreased!\nLeo worked on the second ring. Again, the second ring was full, but the pool's level stayed unchanged.\n\"Hohoh. Are you challenging me? Fine. Challenge accepted!\"\nLeo put on 10 spatial rings at once and sucked the lava into his storage ring.\n10 minutes later, Leo stared at the mysterious lava pool. No matter how fast Leo's spatial rings sucked the content, it never decreased by a millimeter.\n\"Something wasn't right. There might be something mysterious at the bottom of the pit! Should I take a look?\"\nLeo was tempted to dive into the lava pool to see why the liquid remained the same. However, he remembered that Esen and others were still waiting for him.\nFor the sake of others, Leo postponed the project for now. He turned his attention to the white spiral stairs next.\n\"I'll take these. Thank you.\"\nLeo was interested in the stair's material. He touched it and stored the entire structure in one of his rings. Then, he kicked the ground and flew out of the vertical cave.\n.\n.\nLeo came down from the mountain and returned to his battle bus.\nWhen Esen and her subordinates saw him, they were overjoyed.\n\"You're back!\" Esen revealed her rare cheerful smile to Leo.\n\"Oh.\" Leo was surprised, \"You're quite a looker when you're smiling. You should smile more.\"\n\"!!!\" Esen's red flushed and averted her eyes in embarrassment.\n\"We're done here. Let's go home.\"\n\"Huh?\" Ivy and Esen were puzzled. \"What about your creation?! You just created those.\"\n\"Oh, that? That's just pure capitalistic industry. Nothing to worry about.\"\n\"Your speech is weird sometimes, geezer…I understand the word \"industry\", but what's Ca-pi-tan-lees?\"\n\"…A rich quick scheme, but you don't have to work.\"\n\"Sounds like a scam.\"\nLeo forgot about his location and time. He puffed his chest and explained.\n\"It isn't so. Fundamentally, it refers to a low-key way to exploit the working-class population by forcing them to spend their hard-earned money on overpriced housing and medical bills. We also trick them into pursuing a luxurious lifestyle, which consequences in overwhelming debts that they can't pay off in their lifetime. They will spend the rest of their lives slaving away to pay their debts, interests, and taxes which, in the end, return to our pockets so that we spread freedom...\"\n\"???\"\n\"COUGH! AHEM! I mean, this system brings prosperity and wealth to your subordinates so that they can enjoy their freedom! We spread freedom!\" Leo coughed and stopped himself from explaining the useless parts. He smacked his forehead because he got carried away.\n\"Oh!\"\nFortunately, Esen was still clueless. She didn't see anything wrong with the explanation.\nLeo turned around and gazed at the refinery factory. Then, he glanced at a system screen next to him. It showed the function of the refinery.\n.\nImmortalium Refinery\nThis refinery automatically extracts and refines immortalium ores into immortalium ingots. All completed products will be collected at the local warehouse until it is full.\nHint: If you connect your territory to the refinery, you can create a teleportation device to transport the ingots to your domain.\n.\nThere was nothing Leo could do at the moment. It would take ten thousand free expansion tickets to connect his domain to this place, which was a thousand kilometers north of Cauliflower City. At best, he would delegate some strong workers from his domain to transport ingots from this place to his place.\n\"We're done here. Let's go home.\"\nWith Leo's lead, the team returned to the bus. Everybody made their journey back home.\n.\nAs Leo was exhausted from this trip, he put the bus on auto-pilot mode. Then, he made his way to his bed to rest. As usual, he stripped everything and collapsed in his bed.\n10 minutes later, Esen sneaked into Leo's room. Ivy also accompanied her. They entered Leo's bedroom and found him snoring and drooling.\nIvy grinned, \"This is our chance, Your Majesty.\"\n\"U-Um.\"\nEsen's face was bright red. She took off her clothes and slipped into the bed. Without connecting a body part, she closed her eyes and cuddled with him to cultivate.\nVirgin yang Qi continuously flowed from Leo into Esen's body. His thick and overwhelming Qi and essence slowly stimulated her body from the inside, causing her to pant and moan. Her body twitched and shivered in ecstasy.\nBeing drunk in Leo's toxic energy, Esen wanted more. She pressed her naked chest against his and hugged him.\nMeanwhile, Ivy widely grinned and covered her mouth with her fingers. Everything went according to her plans.\n\"Keep going, Your Majesty. You're doing great!\"",

He Demands the Assailant to Redo the Activity While He Is Awake.\nRUMBLE\nAs if the bus understood Leo's intention, it arrived at the Florida Domain and safely landed on West Road.\nMeanwhile, Leo was still asleep. He didn't feel a thing even though someone made a mess on his bed.\nEsen quickly got off the bed, but her legs trembled. She lost count of how many times she went into a spasm and lost control of herself.\nIvy brought Esen a towel to clean herself. She guided her master to a bathroom and brought her clothes along. Before she left, she glanced at the mess on the blanket.\n\"…\"\nIvy waved her fingers. All stains and foul scent disappeared like smoke. After getting rid of the evidence, she followed her master to the bathroom.\nA few seconds later, Leo slightly opened his eyes and glanced at Ivy. He pursed his lips and looked under the blanket.\n\"I can't believe she used me to fap. Damn.\"\nLeo sat up and grumbled. Earlier, he pretended to fall asleep so that he could play with the dantian universe system. Although four hours had passed, Leo spent 4,000 hours in his pocket universe to defeat Esen's shadow 5,000 times in a row.\nA thousand victories earned him one of Esen's personal skills. But when Leo defeated her for the 5,000th time, he obtained something different.\nUsing the technique Leo had learned, he touched his chest. Then, he slowly pulled the staff that Esen's shadows used.\nFormerly, it was named the Staff of Corrupted Divine Elf. But after Leo possessed it, the name changed.\nWhile Leo was holding the staff, a red system screen appeared and identified the object.\n.\n[Holy Staff of Floridian Singularity]\nCan only be used by Floridians. Can be switched to firearm mode.\n.\nThe tip had the shape of a gun's muzzle while the shaft was made of glowing white material, which resembled the spiral stair's metal in the Immortalium Mountain.\nInstead of producing an ominous aura, it released soothing warm air and a scent of random flowers. The odor changed every minute.\nLeo already tested the staff, and he knew what it could do.\nAfter bringing the staff out, Leo stored it in his personal spatial ring. He also tossed the alien pen in there so that he wouldn't forget about it.\nWhile Esen and Ivy took a bath together, Leo ignored them and put on his clothes. Then, he stepped out of his room and drove the bus to park his car.\n.\n.\nLeo returned to the workshop floor. He headed to one of the workshops with a spare cauldron. Along the way, the workshop's mannequins and a few disciples who came to study alchemy made ways for him to pass through.\nWhen Leo arrived at the cauldron room, he ejected a droplet of black lava and held it in his palm.\nZZZZ\nThe lava slowly changed color from black to white. As usual, his radioactive flesh and blood converted this material into something else.\nAs soon as the mutation was finished, Leo tossed the white murky fluid into the cauldron and pressed the research button.\nDING\n<You have discovered the Breast Milk of Virgin Prophet.>\n\"…\"\nDeep down inside Leo's heart, he prayed that the prophet was a woman. Otherwise, nobody could explain to others what they were from when someone decided to drink it.\n.\nBreast Milk of Virgin Prophet\nThis liquid can be extracted from a virgin apostle of a virtuous deity. It is known to be one of the most nutritious drinks that cultivators can consume. Legends said that whoever consumed a cup of this milk every day would achieve immortality even though they never cultivated it.\nCan be used in cooking and alchemy.\n[Alchemy Recipe: Essence of Goddess]\n100cc of Breast Milk of Virgin Prophet\n100cc of Yin Fluid\nYin Essence\n.\nNothing was complicated for this white liquid. However, Leo wondered what the milk tasted.\nTesting the water, Leo poured black lava into the cauldron and spat into it. A few seconds later, the black liquid turned white.\nLeo opened his shopping menu and purchased a ladle. He scooped the milk and took a sip.\nIt was sweet. It tasted like fruit milk in the modern world. Also, it had an annoying side effect.\nLeo pursed his lips and looked at his groin. Upon looking down, his boner wiggled its rod to say hi to Leo.\n\"This ain't prophet milk! This is a damn Viagra milk! Dammit!\"\nHe wasn't ashamed of the untiming boner, but showing a boner in front of passing-by subordinates would be humiliating. Leo adjusted his pants and underwear to hide it.\nAfter correcting his boner, Leo brought out a sample of Immortalium raw ore. He flipped it around for a while, waiting for it to transform.\nAlthough materials rarely changed properties when Leo touched them, it was worth trying. Leo hoped that something inside might react to his radiation.\nHe wasn't disappointed. A minute later, the black ore turned white. He tossed it to the cauldron to research it.\nDING\n<You have discovered Crystalized Breast Milk of Virgin Prophet.>\nLeo facepalmed.\n\"I should have known.\"\n.\nCrystalized Breast Milk of Virgin Prophet\nIf the Breast Milk of Virgin Prophet is left alone for one year, it usually hardens and forms a crystal. This crystal is the result of such chemical reactions.\nAlthough the crystal cannot be used in cooking, it can be smelted and refined into Goddess Milkium Ingots. Many immortal blacksmiths and weapon refiners value it highly as the material can bestow the holy trait to the crafted weapon when it is used as a catalyst.\nCannot be used in alchemy or cooking.\nCan be smelted into ingots in blacksmith workshops or related facilities.\n.\nLooking at the result, Leo thought of the black ingots in the refinery. He wondered if he should go back there and convert everything to this nonsense mineral.\n\"Tsk. I just want some materials to make my AK47. Can I replace the Immortalium with Goddess Milkium?\"\nThere could only be one answer. As a self-proclaimed scientist, Leo pursued the truth for the sake of his curiosity and silly inspiration.\nHowever, going back and forth between Florida Domain and the refinery was time-consuming. Also, he didn't need to go there himself as many workers here lacked jobs.\nLeo left the workshop to find Taxi and Ricardo.\n.\n.\nFar away from Leo's planet, billions of light years away from Leo's galaxy was a cluster of 70 galaxies. Their swastika-shaped galaxies were identical, and every star orbited in sync. Thus, none of the galaxies were at risk of colliding with each other.\nDeep within one of the 70 swastika-shaped galaxies was a green planet, which was one of many homes of elves. Among the local population, dark elves and light elves coexisted in peace.\nIn a rural mountainous region, Simba, aka Ohio Man, stood in front of a black mountain. He wielded a shining pickaxe and smacked the wall of the black rock.\nBOOM\nSeveral chunks of Immortalium ores fell from the black mountain. Simba collected them in his storage ring and stopped working.\nWhen he turned around, he found many dark elves, who were busy mining the same ore. However, they weren't as efficient as him.\n\"You're strong, Simba! You're done already?\" One of Simba's colleagues praised him.\n\"I only need some Immortalium to make some pans and kitchen tools for my wife. I won't trouble you.\"\n\"Damn! If our blacksmiths had heard this, they would have fumed in rage! Why are you using Immortalium to make kitchen tools, dude? We need them to make weapons!\"\nOhio Man shrugged. \"Ester is terrible at controlling her Qi. She always destroyed our kitchen tools whenever she cooked. I need something sturdier.\"\n\"Hahahah! Well, tough luck, dude. Even though Her Highness Ester is disqualified from the throne, she is still a royalty. Obviously, her foundation and cultivation are profound and mysterious. Even though she's a sage, she can fight on par with an entity!\"\n\"You overpraised my wife, haha!\"\nSimba chatted with his friends for 30 minutes and excused himself. He brought the mineral home.\nWhen Simba returned home, he visited his child and his wife first. Then, he entered a workshop at the back of his house.\nOn his workshop desk, there was a framed photo of a family of four. The two adults were a Caucasian man and a woman in a lab coat, who were his foster parents.\nA young boy that the father hugged was a brown-haired kid with a pair of unique green eyes. This boy was the biological son of the two scientist parents, and they seemed to love him the most.\nAs for the other kid, he was a 4-year-old child. However, his skin was black. He was also the adopted child of the family.\nThat 4-year-old child was none other than Simba!\nSimba glanced at the photo of his old family, he smiled at his foster parents in the picture.\n\"I'll do my best again, dad, mom, brother. Watch over me from Heaven, okay?\"\nSimba took a deep breath and walked toward a black furnace, which was made from an otherworldly material. He put some red lumber inside and lit them on fire with his Qi.\nWhile watching the red lumber burn, Simba thought of the time he spent with his foster family. It lasted only two years, but every moment was memorable, especially when he played with his elder brother.\nSimba bitterly smiled. He wondered what kind of crazy bastard his brother would become had he survived the calamity on Earth.",

Officers Confused How He Infiltrated the Barrack.\nChapter 209 – Florida Man Pretending to Be Drill Sergeant Forced Recruits to Lick His Finger. Officers Confused How He Infiltrated the Barrack.\nIt didn't take long for Leo to assign new jobs to Taxi and Ricardo. The duo would be responsible for establishing a logistic route between his domain and the northern refinery, and they would be in charge of transporting the processed ingots to the warehouses.\nTaxi and Ricardo were excited as they didn't get to travel much. The duo quickly assembled a team of 20 horses and galloped to the sky, heading north to explore this world.\nAlthough some of the elites left the domain, there were still 80 9th-stage beasts lingering around and doing nothing. Leo left them alone for the moment.\n.\nThe next day, Leo reopened his store and operated as usual. Commoners from the newly emerged city visited the shopping mall to purchase grain pills again.\nAlthough elemental grain pills didn't give them much Qi, they were the only cultivation resources they could get their hands on without spending real money. They simply sacrificed their lifespan without thinking much.\nLeo happily exchanged the mass-produced version of grain pills for their lifespan. He sat in front of the supermarket and acted as a cashier while local workers got busy sorting and refilling the shelves.\nWhen the day was over, Leo closed the shopping mall. He made over 100,000 YOL of sales within a day, and he couldn't stop smiling.\nWhile Leo was about to close the front shutter doors, Esen brought her people over again. This time, some of them had already consumed enough tea of rejuvenation, and they gained their fleshly bodies.\nA hundred attractive men and women followed their master. Some of them had long ears like Esen, but most of them had white hair. Strangely, everybody wore a blindfold cloth to cover their eyes.\nEsen took the lead. She mustered her courage to ask Leo while her elf ears were still bright red.\n\"G-Geezer. I want you to fulfill our promises. Convert them…please.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo didn't remember the promise, but there was no reason to refuse. He extended his hand and waited for the first daredevil.\n\"Shake my hand, and you will undergo a transition. It will be a very painful and risky process, and I can't guarantee your survival. Take it at your own risk. However, I promise that I will do everything in my power to help you overcome it.\"\nThe hundred men and women gulped as they were afraid of the risks. However, one of them volunteered.\nMarc stepped forward and extended his right hand. Before Leo could react, Marc already shook his hand.\nThe boy innocently smiled at him.\n\"Please be gentle, senior.\"\nLeo snickered. He admired the courage of this boy. \"It's not up to me. It's up to my cancer cells. Well, steel your heart, clench your butt cheeks, and scratch your balls when you have a chance to do so. Everything is gonna happen REALLY fast-\"\nBefore Leo could finish his sentences, blisters and rashes rapidly expanded on Marc's right arm. Purple blood vessels spread from the right arm to his face and other limbs.\nLeo silently bit the tip of his left finger to extract his blood. He then grabbed Marc's jaws to open his mouth. Then, he tossed his blood inside and filled the boy's mouth with clean water, which he created.\nMarc coughed and choked on the water and the blood. His muscles and bones slowly deformed.\nLeo silently watched Marc going through a torturous process. He then glanced at Ivy, who was the brain of this crowd.\n\"Will this work? Do I need to do anything extra?\"\nIvy smiled and shook her head. \"That should be enough, Holy One. Your pure yang essence in your blood should be enough to remove the curse and purify his soul. The rest is up to his willpower.\"\n\"So, if he gives up, he dies?\"\n\"Precisely so.\"\nLeo nodded. Then, he turned his attention to the other people.\n\"While we're waiting for the result, who else wants to test their luck? I don't want to waste my time mutating you one at a time.\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, the crowd hesitated. Leo could see some of them break a sweat or shake in nervousness.\nOn the other hand, Beatrice remained expressionless. She walked toward Leo and grabbed his left hand without saying anything. Then, she sucked his index finger to absorb his blood.\n\"Oi…\" Leo was taken aback.\nBeatrice silently bowed toward Leo. She then took a few steps back to sit down.\nA few seconds later, her entire blood vessels blackened, and her skin reddened. Black blood gushed out from her eye sockets and ears. Yet, her expression never changed.\nA minute passed. Beatrice's skin slowly became lighter. Her blood vessels changed from black to pink. When her skin faded to light olive, all blood vessels inside her were no longer visible. Her ears also lengthened, becoming the same as Esen's ears.\nBeatrice stood up and stretched. She took off her blindfold cloth and opened her eyes.\nA pair of sparkling blue eyes reflected the LED light of the store. She gazed at Leo's colorful aura for a moment. When she came back to her senses, she bowed to Leo again.\n\"I'm healed. Thank you, Holy One.\"\nDespite speaking in a monotone, her voice was even prettier than Esen and Ivy's.\nAfter Beatrice conquered the cancer cells with ease, the crowd behind her uttered in astonishment.\n\"As expected of the legion general. She still has it.\"\nAnother woman with long white hair nodded in agreement. \"Indeed. General Beatrice was the strongest cadet of the Eleanora Academy. Not even high elves from the noble clans can defeat her in a duel or a magic competition.\"\n\"It's a pity that the traitorous matriarch and her daughter cursed her before she could enter the imperial house. She could have reached the entity realm had they never interfered with her career.\"\n\"You have to give her some respect. She sacrificed her career and future to stay with Her Majesty to the very end.\"\nLeo overheard their conversation. The more he listened, the more he admired Beatrice's loyalty toward Esen. She was worth nurturing.\nAs a reward for her courage and willpower, Leo fiddled with his spatial ring and flickered a Floridian Dantian pill out. He grabbed it and tossed it toward Beatrice.\nThe white-haired elf girl caught it and glanced at the pill. Upon seeing the aura of the pill, her expression slightly changed for the first time.\n\"Holy One?\" Beatrice looked at Leo.\n\"Don't ask. Just take it as a reward for your courage. The others are cowering and hesitating, but you take the shot and set an example for others. You deserve it.\"\nBeatrice closed her mouth and silently nodded. She then uttered.\n\"Thank you. This pill will be useful for my younger brother.\"\nLeo smacked his lips. \"I give that pill to you, not your brother. I have another one for him if he survives, alright?\"\nBeatrice's expression changed again. For the first time in years, she revealed a faint smile to a stranger.\n\"…Thank you, Holy One. I shall serve you and Her Majesty to the best of my abilities.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nLeo waved his hand as Beatrice's speech sounded cringe. He turned his attention to the boy, waiting for him to overcome the ordeal.\nHe wasn't disappointed.\nThe rashes and blisters subsided and vanished. Marc's hair color changed from white to black, and his height grew by a head. His shoulders widened as his bones got larger.\nThe innocent young boy turned into a tall and handsome teenage elf. His adolescent face was replaced by a defined jawline and a stoic-looking face. His formerly round eyes, on the other hand, remained the same.\nAfter the transition was completed, Marc collapsed on the ground, panting. Every pore of his skin excreted black sweat, which contained all the accumulated impurity inside him.\nRUMBLE\nMarc's cultivation base also soared. He displayed the aura of a true immortal!\nEsen raised her eyebrows. She was stunned that her bodyguard managed to surpass her in strength by just drinking Leo's blood.\n\"Hey! That's not fair! I worked so hard, but I'm still a celestial emperor! How come your strength jumps to the true immortal stage?!\"\nMarc dryly laughed. \"I-I don't know, Your Majesty. It… just happens.\"\nIvy coughed and pulled Esen from Marc. She explained.\n\"I think it relates to Marc's gender and his natural compatibility with the Holy One's virgin yang essence. Since they are both men, they are more compatible with yang energy. Thus, he gets the boon.\"\nEsen couldn't argue with that. However, she still had doubts.\n\"Then, why did he take so long to overcome that? Why did Beatrice get it done so fast?\"\nIvy wryly smiled and glanced at Leo. Since she was afraid to offend her master, she asked Leo with her expression.\nLeo noticed the hint. He coughed and mocked Esen.\n\"You were also in a similar state when you mutated, brat! I had to feed you pills and my blood, and your transition took as long as the boy's. You have no right to complain!\"\n\"…\"\nEsen was taken aback. She blushed and pouted.\nThe noisy bunch finally stopped making noises. Leo tossed another Floridian Dantian pill to Marc. Then, he forcefully grabbed Ivy's hand and yelled at the people.\n\"Form one single line and extend your dirty ass-sticking hands! Yours truly will grace you with my most abominable cancer cells and my DNA-frying radiation! After I'm done violating your defenseless juvenile skin, I shall let you feast upon my royal blood! If you vomit, I'll pry your goddamn breast-sucking mouths and spit in it!\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody was taken aback by Leo's odd speech. They didn't expect him to be this vulgar or sarcastic.\n\"…Geezer, what?\" Esen gave Leo a weird look.\nLeo coughed. \"Don't mind my military speech.\"\n\"…Okay?\"\n.\nOne after another, the converted undead knights, grim reapers, and archliches touched Leo. Their flesh and blood mutated as they had planned.\nStrangely, after everybody drank Leo's blood, the mutation process was less painful. Everybody soon overcame the ordeal by relying on their willpower alone.\nThe elf's curses were removed. The women got their former bodies back. As for the men and the boys, their cultivation skyrocketed. Although none of them managed to reach the celestial emperor or true immortal stage at once like Marc, they evolved into celestial kings.\nWith these immortals around, the domain's security was strengthened. He no longer needed to rely solely on the pony army anymore.",

The Queen Openly Disapproved Their Relationship.\nChapter 210 – Florida Man Allegedly Slept with the United Elfen Kingdom's Crown Princess and Accidentally Married Her. The Queen Openly Disapproved Their Relationship.\nAfter these skeletons regained their bodies, they reverted to their original appearance when they were alive. Surprisingly, 80 of them were elves while the rest looked like humans with white hair.\nLeo didn't question their ethnicity or race. He continued to distribute Floridian dantian pills to Esen and her subordinates that showed promising potential.\nStill, there were people without the pill.\nLeo gave them a promise.\n\"Those pills take too long to make, but we're currently in the middle of making a new batch. Don't be disheartened that your friends get it first. Everybody here will get one eventually.\"\nThe crowd smiled and knelt on one knee. Everybody bowed their heads toward Leo.\n\"Savior, we promise that we'll do everything in our power to fulfill your ambition and desire! We will die for you!\"\n\"Please allow us to worship you as our lord!\"\nLeo nodded in approval as these guys looked trustworthy. However, Ivy's next word instantly changed Leo's mind.\n\"Holy One. Please marry our empress.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo almost choked. He coughed and whizzed while he smacked his chest.\n\"Bitch! You almost gave me a heart attack! WTF?!\"\nUnfortunately, Ivy's suggestion ignited the passion of the crowd. Everybody gazed at Leo with sparkling eyes.\n\"It would be our honor if you accept Her Majesty as your dao companion! Please!\"\n\"Her majesty has all the qualifications to become the Matriarch of the Divine Elf, Lord! It's a pity that her mother and her sisters were envious of her talent and cursed her into an undead. Now that she has restored her body and removed the curse, she is the finest candidate for your dao companion!\"\n\"Holy One. Her Majesty was born with the Phoenix constitution! Combined with her virgin yin essence, she has the best body to conceive your descendants! Please honor us and bestow your bloodline on our clan!\"\nLeo was so flabbergasted that his wide eyes almost slipped out of the eye sockets. On the other hand, Esen screamed in embarrassment and anger.\n\"Y-Y-Y-YOU SHUT UP! H-H-HOW DARE YOU OVERSTEPPING YOUR BOUNDARIES!\"\nIvy giggled and massaged her shoulders from behind. \"Your majesty. A divine elf's princess with the finest and thickest bloodline has the obligation to conceive babies of a supreme being worthy of your status and integrate his bloodline with us. The Holy One Florida Man has all the qualifications. He possesses the unique aura of virgin yang and the supreme constitution. Once you two combine, your cultivation progress will improve by leaps and bounds! There's no other groom better than him-\"\nBONK\nEsen bonked Ivy with her hammer fist. She yelled at her people.\n\"I-I-I am not ready for marriage! I-I-It's not like I want to marry or anything, but it's n-n-not the time!\"\n\"Oi.\" Leo broke a sweat. Judging from her words, she neither denied nor accepted their proposal, which troubled him.\nEsen turned around and gazed at Leo with wet eyes. Her lips trembled. \"T-T-This isn't my idea! D-Don't misunderstand! T-T-They forced me into this!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo facepalmed and let out a long sigh. He turned toward the crowd and was about the chide them.\nBut then, he thought of an ancient era's culture when political marriage benefited both parties. Leo compared it to his situation and wondered if he should deny their request.\n'I don't want to accept it. But if I reject them, I might lose their support. These guys are special, too, considering their natural abilities, magic, and necromancy.'\nLeo had fought Esen so many times that he got curious about the divine elf race. As a result, he studied the shadows of other divine elves that he could find in the simulation mode.\nIvy, Marc, and Beatrice's potential and combat abilities were superior to Esen's at the moment. However, at their peak performance or final form, Esen outperformed everybody, especially when she used her death magic. Every time her shadow cast it on him, Leo's heart stopped beating for several seconds every time, almost defeating him.\nThinking of Esen's potential and the competence of her subordinates, Leo was unable to outright reject their suggestion.\n\"Hah…\"\nAgain, Leo deeply sighed. He glanced at Esen again.\nThe girl was on the verge of crying because of embarrassment. She seemed somewhat adorable for a cheeky elf woman.\n\"Hah…\"\nLeo made his decision. For the sake of the amicable relationship and the harmony of his domain's workers, he surrendered to the political marriage.\n\"Just in name for now, okay? I won't take more concubines or consorts. One official wife is enough.\"\n\"!!!\"\nSuddenly getting Leo's approval, the elf crowd cheered.\n\"Let's prepare for the ceremony right away!\"\n\"You've made the right choice, my lord! With this, we will have a legitimate reason to fight for the throne!\"\n\"Your majesty! We are happy for you! Please bear at least 1,000 strong children to show those evil princesses how it's done!\"\nEsen's face and ears reddened, and a fume of white smoke came out. She looked at Leo in disbelief.\n\"W-W-Why are you going along with them?!\"\nLeo paused for a moment as he didn't know what to answer her. But then, his intrusive thoughts came up with a solution and idea. He grinned and answered.\n\"You snuck into my bed and rubbed your chest against me so passionately earlier. I think you need to take responsibility for being a cute tsundere and be with me forever. How's that sound?\"\nPOOF\nA smoke explosion erupted inside Esen's head. Her eyes spun while her lips trembled in embarrassment.\n\"Y-You were awake?!\"\n\"I was up when you moaned and called my name.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen sat on the ground and covered her face. She didn't dare to look at Leo's face anymore.\nLeo laughed as he teased the girl enough. He glanced at the scheming elf.\n\"Ivy.\"\nIvy widely grinned, \"Yes, Holy One?\"\nLeo leaned toward her ear and whispered.\n\"This political marriage will be in name only. If you dare to offer me another woman, I'll expel you and your master from my domain.\"\nIvy giggled, \"I know my limits, Holy One. I promise this won't happen again.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"But seriously, please impregnate her if you can. We implore you.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He let out a long sigh and gave her a serious look.\n\"When this farce is over, you have a lot of explanation to do. No more conspiracy and secrecy this time. I want to know what you're cooking behind my back, and what are you trying to achieve.\"\n\"Of course, Holy One. We never lied to you. In fact, we already told you most of our stories.\"\nIvy mischievously laughed while Leo frowned at her. The latter snorted and turned around.\n\"Get going, you lots! Leave me… I mean, leave us alone!\"\nFor the sake of his mental health, Leo carried Esen by his shoulder and brought her to his battle bus like a caveman bringing his bride home.\nThe crowd cheered and whistled. Marc and Beatrice waved their hands at Esen to cheer her on. As for Ivy, she continued to show them a faint smile until they were gone from her vision. Then, her smile disappeared from her face.\nIvy's pupils and sclera turned black. She gazed at her comrades next.\n\"You should have heard the warning earlier. The Holy One expresses that he will only have one dao companion. If anybody crosses the line, I'll kill that bastard myself.\"\nThe former death knights and liches stopped laughing. They saluted.\n\"Don't worry. We will respect the Holy One's mandate.\"\nThe other also saluted. \"For the sake of our revenge, we will adhere to his orders.\"\nIvy was relieved. She turned toward Beatrice and Marc next.\n\"You two should also keep a respectable distance from them when they are alone. Let them have some privacy so that Her Majesty can show her woman's charm, alright?\"\nMarc repeatedly nodded while Beatrice lightly snorted.\n\"Fine.\" Beatrice sighed.\n\"Good.\"\nIvy had been working as a matchmaker to pair Esen with Leo. Although the process was forced and abrupt, the result went according to her plan, except for Leo's cooperation. She had never expected that Leo's heart was as solid as a stone.\n'For now, Her Majesty is completely under the Holy One's protection. Even if the other princesses or the matriarch finds her, none of them can kill or curse her again under his watch! I just hope that they won't realize that some of us have already broken the curses…'\nIvy secretly prayed that the divine elves at the swastika galaxies wouldn't detect their resurrection as they weren't ready to face their overwhelming army of overlords, entities, and sages.\n.\n.\nSimba had been minding his business, forging a new frying pan for his wife using the Immortalium ore. He raised a smith hammer and hit the flattened metal.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nThe noise echoed in the workshop. After hitting the flattened Immortalium metal for the 1,000th time, Simba threw the metal in a bucket of water to cool its temperature.\nRUMBLE\nThe Immortalium reacted to the water. Instantly, it evaporated the liquid.\nSimba ignored the natural attribute of the Immortalium. He wiped his sweat with the towel on his neck and took a sip of water.\nWhile Simba was resting, a system screen appeared before him. It was a message from another player. Coincidentally, the sender was his wife's mother, aka the matriarch of the divine elf.\n<Ohio Man. Come to the palace. We have a job for you.>\nSimba frowned as he hated the family of his wife. They were the ones who expelled her to the countryside, yet they had the galls to order him around.\nHe replied to the message.\n\"State your business. I'll charge you according to the responsibility and the difficulty of the tasks.\"\nThat was Simba's principle and a way to limit their influence in his life.\nIt didn't take long for the other party to reply. This time, the matriarch stated her business.\n<We have detected that a group of heathens have managed to overcome our curses. I want you to use your power to search for their current location and give us the coordinates.>\n\"That's all?\"\n<Yes. That will be all. We'll take the rest from here.>\n\"…100 million years of lifespan. Paying upfront.\"\n<No problem. I shall transfer the lifespan to you right away.>\n\"…\"\nDING\nSimba glanced at his lifespan status menu. His balance instantly went up by 100 million YOL.\nAfter getting the payment, Simba opened his system menu and started searching for the heathens.\n\"I need more information. Tell me their names or give me their pictures.\"\n<The name is Esen Sydin the fourth.>\n\"Sydin surname? The fourth?! Isn't she the previous crown princess… rather, your daughter?!\"\nSydin was the surname of the matriarch. Also, the fourth behind the surname indicated the generation, which only the official crowd princess could possess.\n<That heretic practiced death magic! That kind of dao is not allowed in our family! It doesn't matter if she was born with a Phoenix constitution or carried whatever bloodline! If she tamper with that blasphemous magic, she deserves to be suffering in hell forever!>\n\"…\"\nSimba didn't refute as he had heard the rumor before. The justification behind Esen's expulsion and eternal imprisonment wasn't the death magic or other heresy magic. Instead, it was purely political schemes of her family, who envied Esen's talent and potential. They felt threatened that Esen might steal the matriarch title from her mother, so everybody conspired against her.\nHis wife told him this. She, too, took part in the conspiracy. However, after Esen was out of the picture, the princesses fought against each other. In the end, Ester was expelled and was reduced to a commoner.\nSimba was disgusted with the royal family. Still, as he married one of their kin, he had no choice but to follow their rules and orders.\nAs Simba already got the name, he input it into his system. Then, the face of Esen appeared, including the coordinates of her planet and the country she lived in.\nThe planet's name was still marked as the Yan Dynasty. However, the country Esen lived in showed up in the system menu as \"Florida Domain\".\n\"…Shit.\"\nSimba regretted taking this job. He didn't expect to see this word.\n<Tell me the location!>\n\"…\"\nSimba bit his lower lips. Although unwilling, he revealed Leo's planet coordinates to the matriarch.\n'I'm so sorry.'",

Witnesses Said The Groom Brought the Urine Bag Home to Make New “Drink”.\nChapter 211 – Abrupt Chaos Ensued after Florida Man Received Bull's Urine as Wedding Gift. Witnesses Said The Groom Brought the Urine Bag Home to Make New \"Drink\".\nA day after the hectic meeting, Ivy announced the news of the upcoming grand wedding to everybody in the domain. She sent invitation letters to all employees, the Tang Clan, and the commoners in the west town.\nThe commoners, who just exchanged their lifespan with Leo's pills, were excited.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei also received the letters. The elderly couple laughed as they were happy for Leo. As for the other elders, such as Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Wu Buyi, and Xu Nuan, they were surprised that Esen was the bride.\nTang Xuan was stunned as well when he received an invitation letter from Ivy. When Tang Xuan got the letter, he couldn't help but admire Leo's vitality.\nIn this world, it was customary for guests to bring gifts for the bridge and the groom if they were invited. This tradition gave everybody a headache.\nAs Leo was their liege and he never lacked resources, no one could come up with a proper gift to give Leo and Esen on the upcoming wedding day.\nFortunately, Ivy informed everybody in advance. The wedding would be held after the next seasonal mystic realm expedition. They still had a month to prepare their gifts.\nThis event triggered an internal competition between the employees, the commoners, and the elders. They aimed to procure the best gifts that could impress Leo and get on his good side.\nThe Tang Clan was the same. As they were newcomers, Leo hadn't assigned them any task other than allowing them to build their residents. Tang Xuan and Tang Tian thought that Leo simply ignored them.\nThis wedding was their opportunity to show Leo their sincerity. Tang Xuan swore that he would get something useful from a mystic realm and impress Leo.\n.\n.\nThe news of the upcoming wedding circulated in the western town, which Leo nicknamed West Slum. The newly built town was full of one-story wooden buildings. Only a few structures near the main road were two or three stories tall.\nOne of the tallest buildings was the new home of a merchant company. The owner of this company was none other than Jiang Cheng, a merchant whom Leo had met at the Frozen Fire City and tipped him an essence stone. He sold the stone and used it as a capital to reinvest, and he earned millions of gold coins.\nJiang Cheng heard the news of Leo's upcoming wedding. He racked his brain to come up with a unique gift that could get Leo's attention.\n\"What should I gift him? He's a cultivator. He has an immense amount of essence stones. He doesn't lack wealth for sure. Ugh.\"\nJiang Cheng paced in his office, searching for inspiration. After an hour of brainstorming, he came up with an idea.\nThe merchant had gathered information about Leo before. In the past, Leo exchange his cultivation resources with the vegetables and fruits of the local people. He wondered if Leo still needed those.\nBecause of such information, the merchant finally got inspiration.\n\"Aren't vegetables and fruits food? Does he lack provision? How about I gift him a bunch of grains? No. For someone of his caliber, grains aren't enough. Cultivators rarely eat hard food, but they sometimes eat luxurious food with high-class ingredients. Wait… high-class ingredients? That's right. I can use those!\"\nFinally, Jiang Cheng had an idea. He called his subordinates over and ordered them.\n\"We're taking a trip to Tappaya City! We're going to import some spirit bulls from the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect!\"\n.\n.\nJiang Cheng wasn't the only one who came up with the idea. Han Hao and Han Meng, who had made contact with Leo before the others, remembered and understood why he needed food resources.\nHan Hao consulted with Han Meng.\n\"Son, do you remember when Lord Florida Man asked us to bring him vegetables and fruits?\"\nHan Meng remembered, \"Yes. Lord Florida Man can convert every type of plant into precious treasures. At that time, he collected so many cabbages and fruits from us. Now, they're sitting in the granary as golden sand bananas, yin cabbages, and other rare herbs that can't be found on the mainland.\"\n\"Correct. He is operating a store that sells precious treasures and herbs. Of course, he has to procure some merchandise from somewhere. And those merchandise in his store came from us!\"\n\"Aha! So, father. You're saying that he still needs those?\"\n\"Exactly! Right now, his store is wide, but he lacks merchandise to sell! We should bring him something unique that he has never gotten his hands on, such as… livestock!\"\nHan Meng widened his eyes as he got the idea.\n\"Yes! Cows, ducks, chickens, dogs, horses, pigs, snakes, sheep, and… what else?\"\nHan Hao's eyes gleamed. He proposed a bold move.\n\"The Yin-Yang Joyous Sect's spirit bulls!\"\n\"W-Wait, pops. T-Those perverted bulls?! Aren't those pheasants exclusive for those lunatics?\"\n\"They might be wild, but it is famous for its meat! Lord Florida Man is a hard-food lover. He will never reject such a fine source of meat! In fact, he might even turn those bulls into something greater!\"\n\"Good idea, pops! Let's go and contact that pervert sect!\"\nHan Hao and Han Meng formed a team of two. Without telling anybody, they traveled northeast, heading toward an isolated mountain range.\n.\n.\n500 km northeast of Cauliflower City was a mountain range. Behind the mountain range was an elusive sect, where male commoners would kill to join while women would do anything to enter.\nThe Joyous Yin-Yang Sect hid there. This sect focused on dual-cultivating methods, which required male and female cultivators to consummate to get stronger. Because of such methods, many men dreamt of joining this organization.\nWomen were no better. As this sect offered face alteration techniques and pills to remove excess weight, many commoner women whose look was below average sold their bodies to the sect to get their hands on the techniques and pills. As a result, they joined the sect as female disciples and took pleasure in cultivating with many men.\nAfter Leo slaughtered Yan Xiang and his sons, this sect became a safe haven for the Situ Clan and the Ouyang Clan. They migrated here and asked for the sect's protection.\nThe sect master was this place was Murong Qi. He was a friend of Situ Nantian. Although his foundation and his strength were far inferior to the Situ, he was the only one who could be considered the same generation as Situ Nantian.\nIn the sect master's courtyard, Situ Nantian and Murong Qi relaxed and enjoyed their afternoon tea. Although Murong Qi was at a similar age as his friend, he looked like a young man in his 20s. His muscular chest, refined shoulders, and toned body were at the same size as professional bodybuilders. His bronze skin was also popular among the female disciples, who shared beds with him.\nMurong Qi glanced at Situ Nantian's complexion. The latter just came out of seclusion, but he still looked pale.\n\"That injury must be so severe, brother Nantian. Was Florida Man that strong?\"\nSitu Nantian groaned. \"He's not just strong. He's a monster – A monster with heavenly artifacts!\"\n\"That sounds terrible. What did you do to ire that man?\"\n\"…He provoked me first! He dared to covet a precious treasure of a mystic realm I'm in!\"\nMurong Qi sighed. \"This is where you are wrong. I know you for over 500 years. Sometimes, you are the one who covets other people's assets and wealth. You must have tried to steal his treasure or something, right?\"\n\"…\"\nSitu Nantian was unable to answer. He clenched his teeth in anger.\nThe two fell silent as they had no topic to converse. Murong Qi sighed and planned to excuse himself to manage the sect.\nSuddenly, someone sent a voice transmission to Murong Qi and informed him of development from a faraway land.\n\"Hmm?\"\nMurong Qi raised his eyebrows and quietly listened to the report of his spies. After he heard everything, he smiled at Situ Nantian.\n\"Someone is getting married soon, brother Nantian.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Your enemy, Florida Man.\"\n\"He…That bastard dares to flaunt his wealth?!\"\n\"More like he is minding his own business and trying to live his life.\"\n\"No! That bastard has no right to enjoy life! He offended me and caused chaos in our empire! He needs to die!\"\n\"…Seriously, sometimes, I wonder who the sane one is. Your clansmen and Yan Xiang always treated us as perverts and psychos, but we never initiated bloodshed and conflicts. Sometimes, you need to stay away from society to understand society, you know?\"\n\"Murong Qi! Stop with your idiotic philosophies! I'm leaving!\"\n\"Have a great day, brother.\"\nMurong Qi didn't bother sending Situ Nantian off.\nWhen Situ Nantian left his manor, his expression turned solemn. He vibrated his throat and sent a voice transmission to his spies, who had infiltrated Magpie City and Leo's domain.\n\"Get more information about Florida Man's wedding and his background. Also, if possible, introduce us to him so that we can get the invitation. I want to pay him a visit… and maybe convince him to become our customer.\"\nThe Joyous Yin-Yang Sect was not just a cultivation school. It also operated as a grand brothel. Many rogue cultivators visited the sect and spent their fortune to bed their beautiful disciples or handsome men.\nIn addition, after the Amazonian Sanctuary was disbanded, many female cultivators flocked to the sect and joined them. At the moment, they had 10,000 female disciples and a thousand female elders.\nThey became the biggest sect after the fall of Yan Xiang. From Murong Qi's perspective, Leo's domain was the remaining rival on the mainland. Once Leo was out of the picture, he would rule the main continent and this planet.\n\"Friend or foe. How should I treat you, I wonder.\"\nMurong Qi snapped his fingers. Then, a three-meter-tall black bull flew from the ranch and rushed toward his master. When it arrived at the courtyard, Murong Qi smiled at his pet.\n\"I need your help again, Nancy.\"\nMurong Qi proceeded toward the bum of the bull. The animal also knew its queue as it peed at the sect master.\nThe perverted sect master collected the bull's pee in his spatial ring. He laughed and patted its butt.\n\"Thanks for the usual, Nancy. Your aphrodisiac urine is the best!\"\n\"Moo!\"\nMurong Qi snickered. He wondered what Leo would do if his bride was poisoned by the spirit bull's aphrodisiac urine during the wedding.\n\"The wedding gift is ready. Now, how should I tempt him or humiliate him? What to do? Decision, decision…\"",

Her eyes spun as she was still confused and embarrassed.\n\"Hah.\" Leo patted the elf's head and sighed. \"Relax. I'm not gonna eat you.\"\n\"W-W-We're going to get married?! A-Are you serious about me?!\" Esen flustered.\n\"Well, if you hate the idea, we can cancel it.\"\nLeo gave her a way out as he didn't want to force her to do something she didn't want.\nHowever, Esen didn't take the chance. She looked at Leo's face and shook her head.\nShe mustered her courage.\n\"I-I-I'm happy you have a feeling for me.\"\n\"…\"\n\"I-I'll behave from now on. I'll learn how to be a wife. A-A-And I'll smell like one!\"\nLeo frowned. \"Are you sure you understand what you're talking about? Are you drunk?\"\n\"No! I'm sober!\" Esen stood up and faced Leo. She closed her eyes and shouted. \"I'LL DEDICATE MY BODY AND MY SOUL TO YOU! B-B-BE GRATEFUL, GEEZER!\"\n\"…Hah.\"\nLeo massaged his forehead. He stood up and pulled out the staff that he got from Esen's shadow. Then, he passed it to her.\n\"Here.\"\n\"What's that?\"\n\"A new weapon for you for self-protection.\"\n\"F-For me?\"\n\"Consider it a gift from me. I'll do my best to get you a proper wedding ring later. Also, I need to measure your ring's size. Show me your hands.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo grabbed Esen's hands and measured her ring fingers. The elf girl blushed and let her future husband touch her hands.\nAfter getting a rough idea of what her ring size was, Leo opened his shopping system menu and purchased a diamond ring from the system. He picked a clear gold ring with a carat diamond.\nDING\nA pair of gold diamond rings appeared in Leo's hand. Each ring cost 1,000 YOL, which was considered cheap by Leo's standard. Thus, he immediately used his system perk to upgrade them to the max level.\nDING\nAfter the chime, the gold ring changed color into rainbow. The diamond retained the same color, but it shone like a glittering star.\nLeo didn't know what kind of upgrade the system gave these rings. He just wanted it to be durable enough not to withstand immortal Qi and his power.\nLeo glanced at Esen's face for a moment. His expression was solemn.\n'Well, a beggar can't choose. I should be glad that I can get a wife in this world.'\nLeo knelt in front of Esen. Then, he gently inserted the ring into her finger. He then gazed at her face and asked her properly.\n\"I know we are from a different race, and our age gap is big. We get ourselves into this mess because of our subordinate's stupid scheme. But since it has come to this, I promise that I'll treasure you. I'll make you the happiest woman in the universe… So…will you marry me, Esen?\"\n\"…\"\nEsen was in tears. Although she didn't expect Leo's proposal, his gesture and words moved her heart.\nWhile sobbing, she repeatedly nodded.\n\"Y-Yes. Yes…me, too. I-I don't know why we're getting married, b-b-but… I… I want to be with you forever!\"\nLeo bitterly smiled. He felt a bit guilty since they skipped many relationship steps. They never dated. They never confessed or expressed their love, but both of them got into this situation.\nBut since Esen didn't reject his proposal, Leo swore that he would properly love the elf lich. He embraced her and asked her to be sure.\n\"Do you prefer me as I am, or do you want me to be young again?\"\n\"Err…eh?\"\nEsen realized something. Leo made so much tea of rejuvenation, but he drank a lot of it. She wondered why his physical age didn't regress.\n\"Can you become young again?\"\n\"Do you want me to? Or do you like old men?\"\nBecause of the topic, Esen forgot about the previous embarrassment and shyness. She revealed her thoughts.\n\"I like you the way you are.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo widely smiled. Somehow, Esen was strangely cute today.\nUnable to suppress his evil intrusive thoughts, Leo hugged Esen.\n\"Let's rehearse the wedding night.\"\n\"Re…hearse? Rehearse what?\"\nLeo lewdly grinned. He pushed the divine elf down.\n.\nThe morning of the next day, Leo and Esen shared the same bed. The former slept while smiling, but the latter buried her face against a pillow. Although Esen wanted to scream and throw a tantrum, she was too exhausted to move.\n.\n.\nLeo woke up in the afternoon. He sat up, extended his arms to stretch, and yawned.\nHe graduated!\nNo more V card!\nHe felt light. His body was so energetic that he felt young again.\nLeo looked at the bed. Next to him, Esen was still there, sleeping peacefully. Although she was asleep, her aura twirled like a whirlpool, sucking every strand of Qi and essence into her body.\nHer cultivation base reached the true immortal stage, and she continued to grow stronger! Judging from this pace, she would break the limits of the immortal realm soon.\nLeo leaned over and kissed the forehead of the divine elf.\n\"Sweet dream, wifey.\"\nEsen grumbled in her sleep and mumbled.\n\"Geezer, you're a monster.\"\n\"Hahaha! Sorry. First time is a charm!\"\nLeo got out of bed and went to the bath to take a shower. He walked past the washbasin's mirror without paying attention.\n\"???\"\nLeo frowned for a moment and took two steps back. He then turned to look in the mirror.\nThe reflection in the mirror showed the face of a late middle-aged man. He still had long hair, but half of it was black. Secondly, his proud long braided beard seemed shorter than usual, and it was black as well.\n\"HUH?!\"\nLeo touched his face and looked at his skin.\nThe wrinkles and blemishes on his skin were gone. His muscle mass was more refined and toned. Also, his movement wasn't as sluggish as before.\nLeo looked like a man in his 50s!\n\"I'm young again?!\"",

He Revealed That Nutting Was the Secret.\nLeo nervously walked out of his room. When he came out, he found Ivy in front of the room as if she had been standing there all night.\nIvy's expression changed for a moment as Leo's appearance changed a lot. Fortunately, she recognized his aura.\n\"Good afternoon, Holy One. Congratulations on recovering your youth.\"\n\"…I see that you can recognize me. Did you expect this to happen?\"\n\"Not at all!\"\n\"…\"\nIvy grinned and glanced at the door. She still sensed Esen's presence in the room, but her aura and cultivation base grew so much.\n\"I see that you've accepted our empress, Holy One. Please take care of us from now on.\" Ivy deeply bowed.\n\"I know what you've been plotting. I don't mind it if you're doing it for your master, but do remember – Don't ever cross me.\"\n\"I'll keep that in mind, Holy One.\"\nLeo snorted and left Ivy alone. He walked along the hall. As he walked past the other elves on the bus, they stood up and bowed to pay respect to him.\nThe only ones remaining on the bus were the people without the Floridian dantian pill. As for those with the pills, they were in seclusion.\nLeo wondered why Ivy wasn't in seclusion like the others. He shrugged and left the scheming vixen alone.\n.\nAfter Leo had gone out to work, Ivy entered Leo's room and found Esen sleeping on his bed. She scanned the room and smiled.\n\"I'm proud of you, Your Majesty. You did it. You dual-cultivated with the Holy One.\"\nWithout waking Esen up, Ivy cleaned Leo's room and removed the scent from the previous night. She also removed the stains and residual liquid in the bed with her Qi. Then, she left the room.\n.\n.\nWhen Leo returned to the store, he caused a commotion. Everybody was surprised to see Leo in his younger appearance. Although he still looked old, it was a huge improvement.\nThe usual bootlicker, Wu Buyi, rushed to Leo's side. He praised his new look.\n\"You are so handsome, my lord! How did you do it? Did you drink a lot of tea? Or perhaps, are you cultivating an age regression technique?\"\n\"…None of those.\"\n\"Wow! Your knowledge is so profound and deep, my lord! I can't even express how impressed I am!\"\n\"…\"\nAlthough Leo disliked boot-kissers, Wu Buyi was an exception. He knew this guy was greedy, but he was loyal to him. He could trust the guy.\n\"I might need more alchemists in the future. I want you to pick up some of the commoners that just become a cultivator. Train them to be an alchemist like you. Can you do it?\"\nWu Buyi was delighted. \"Of course, my lord! I'll go scout those people right away! Oh, by the way, the Tang Clan has been pestering me to seek your audience. Maybe, you should call them over.\"\n\"The Tang Clan? Oh, those guys…\"\nLeo remembered Tang Xuan and his men. He wasn't fond of the newcomers, but he respected their decision to migrate here.\n\"I'll do something about them.\"\nWu Buyi and Leo chatted for 10 minutes before they went their own way.\n.\nAt night, Leo invited Tang Xuan and Tang Tian over to his store. However, as Tang Xuan was busy making pills, only Tang Tian showed up.\nTang Tian greeted Leo.\n\"Lord Florida Man. I see that you have looked younger. Congratulations on attaining a youthful physique.\"\nLeo leaned over. \"I heard you're looking for me. Is there anything you need?\"\nTang Tian was overjoyed when Leo asked him first. He confessed to Leo.\n\"Our clan runs an alchemy sect called the Sixth Element Sect. We mostly develop poison pills and medicines. When we came here, we heard that you are also a master of the same field. We hope that we can study under you.\"\n\"Oh, sure.\" Leo agreed to Tang Tian's request without hesitation. However, he had a condition.\n\"But I'm not free enough to teach you myself. You will have to learn it from observation. You see, the fifth floor of my shopping mall is designated for workshops and factories. You can send your people to observe my workers there and exchange your knowledge with them. Be warned, though. Don't cause trouble or I'll kick your clan out!\"\nTang Tian broke a sweat. He reminded himself to warn his subordinates not to offend the locals.\n\"Thank you, Lord Florida Man! Also, I have another request.\"\n\"Speak!\"\n\"You haven't assigned us a job yet. I hope that you didn't forget about us.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nLeo scratched his head. Indeed, he forgot about them.\n\"Alright. Since you want to work that badly, I want your clan to help me patrol that west slum. More people have shown up recently, and I need some trustworthy people to make sure no hoodlums show up. Also, some of them bought my pills. There might be a promising cultivator-to-be among them. Make sure to scout them and ask them to join your clan or my store. That will be great.\"\n\"Of course, Lord Florida Man! We'll do our best!\"\nTang Tian was delighted that Leo finally gave them a proper job. The security task was also their specialty as some of their clansmen worked as informants or assassins.\nThe Tang excused himself and returned to his clan with good news.\n.\nAfter assigning tasks to the Tang Clan, Leo let out a long sigh.\nManaging a huge store and many people took a toll on his mental health. He wished he had a system or someone to take care of the shopping mall for him.\n\"A manager would be nice. Also, I need cashiers who can collect the lifespan of my customers. If I had a cashier, I could have more time to train or do something else.\"\nWhile Leo was complaining, a certain guardian statue returned to the domain. Mu-Nyang landed on the mystic realm portal platform and sent his voice transmission to Leo.\n'Master, I'm home, munya. I've brought you the earth fate crystal, munya!'\nLeo widened his eyes.\n\"NICE JOB! MU-NYANG!\"\nLeo rode the elevator to the flying island. After exiting the elevator, he rushed to the Cathulhu statue.\nThe guardian statue presented Leo with a finger-sized crystal ball. It also carried several giant tunas with savage faces along.\nLeo glanced at the fish.\n\"Are those your snacks?\"\nMu-Nyang laughed. \"Those are for the souvenir, munya! I already had my fill.\"\n\"How nice of you! Thanks!\"\nLeo stored the monster fishes in his spatial ring. He also collected the earth fate crystal.\nThe last quest item entered Leo's alien ring. Then, the quest was completed.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 2/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 200,000 Years of Lifespan, One Guaranteed SR Lucky Draw (Automaton), Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 15, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 15\nPhase Two Tasks (10/10 Completed)\n- Use the PVP feature once.

Without praying or preparation, he pressed the [Roll 10+1] button right away.\n\"Come on! Give me something nice!\"\nDING\nDING\nDING\nFive grey balls, three green balls, two blue balls, and one rainbow ball came out!\n\"Five common, three uncommon, two rare, and one ultra-rare?!\"\nLeo rubbed his hands, looking forward to seeing the result.\nThe screen changed. All 11 balls were opened, and building icons came out.\nLeo ignored everything except the rainbow facility. He read its description and admired the model of the building.\n\"Wow!

Cops Summoned Exorcists the Next Day.\n\"Isn't this a business opportunity? I can let those maniacs play in this building for a fee. How much should I charge them? 100 YOL per day? 500? No. Those men have a limited lifespan. I need to make it slightly cheap and give an illusion that their time is worth the opportunity.\"\nLeo hummed while he built the Tesseract Time Chamber on the fourth floor of his store. He designated this floor as a training ground for cultivators. In the future, he would build more facilities that offered a similar service.\nHe also upgraded the shopping mall and other facilities to level 15. It took him a while to adjust their attribute points.\n.\nTesseract Time Chamber (Level 15)\nTime Dilation (5/30)\nTraining Facilities (2/30)\nChamber Capacity (5/30)\nChamber Size (3/30)\n.\nOne point in time dilation increased the time chamber's effects. According to the system's description, one day in reality was one hundred days inside. Every point allocated to this attribute increased the time inside the chamber by 100 days!\nTraining Facilities were the accommodations inside the chamber. The quality and quantity of facilities in the chamber grew according to the level.\nThe Chamber Capacity was the maximum number of visitors. At the moment, five visitors could stay in the chamber simultaneously.\nAs for the last one, the size of the chamber was straightforward; the higher the point, the bigger the space inside the chamber.\nAside from the chamber, Leo obtained two more alchemy factories, three greenhouses, two blacksmith workshops, two alchemy workshops, and one gunsmith workshop.\nLeo didn't think much. He built everything inside his shopping mall.\nAt level 15, Leo's shopping mall expanded underground. It created four new levels – B2, B3, B4, and B5. All floors could either be assigned as underground parking lots or warehouses for Leo's goodies.\nFor now, Leo made the new floors as his warehouses. As nobody in this world had a car, the parking lot was unnecessary.\n\"Next, robot gacha! Here I come!\"\nAfter Leo finished fixing the facilities, he rolled the personal gacha next.\nDING\nDING\nDING\nAs usual, 11 animated gacha balls showed on his screen. Unfortunately, there was no fancy gold ball this time. He got 7 grey balls and 4 blue balls.\n\"I came here looking for copper, and I found salt…\"\nLeo was disappointed in his luck. He shed a tear of regret.\n\"Aren't earth fate crystals supposed to boost my freaking luck?! How come my luck is so terrible?!\"\nAs if the system understood Leo's complaint, it sent him a message.\n<Please note. The chance of getting a rare gacha is 5%. Super rare is 1%, and ultra rare is one in a thousand.>\n\"…\"\nIn short, the gacha rate was more evil than Genshin Impact, Fate Grand Order, or Honkai: Star Rail combined. Even the cruelest game developers might have to kowtow to Leo's system for this sadistic gacha system. Leo consecutively rolling super rare and ultra-rare was already a miracle.\nIt was the system's way of telling Leo that the earth fate crystals worked as intended. As for his crap luck, he could only blame it on RNGesus.\nLeo gave up complaining. He looked at what he got.\n\"!!!\"\nAs soon as Leo saw their roles, he almost knelt and praised Jesus.\nThree of the gachas came out as cashier mannequins while the other one was a warehouse manager!\n\"HALLELUJAH!!\"\nThe manpower issues were solved. Leo didn't have to stay in his store all day anymore. However, there was still one remaining question; could the cashiers collect customers' lifespan in Leo's stead?\nLeo summoned the four rare mannequins right away.\nFour pink female mannequins appeared. Three of them came out wearing a maid outfit. As for the warehouse manager, she wore a modern suit.\nAs if they understood Leo's intent, the three cashiers opened their system screens and showed it to Leo.\n.\nName: Cashier A\nLifespan Balance: 0\nStatus: Idle\n.\nAfter reading their statuses, Leo understood what they could do. Leo was relieved.\n\"Alright. Two of you should go and manage the supermarket section. As for you, go to the Tesseract Time Chamber. I'll write y'all the job description and how much you should collect from your customers before next day's morning.\"\nThe three maids saluted and proceeded to their assigned stations.\nLeo turned his attention to the manager next.\n.\nName: Warehouse Manager A\nAssigned Warehouse: None\nStatus: Idle\nSpecialty: Extend the food expiry date in the assigned warehouse by 10 days.\n.\nHer status was different than the default workers in the regular warehouses. She didn't seem to be a laborer but a supervisor.\n\"What can you do?\"\nThe manager mannequin couldn't speak, but she opened her system menu and typed a message for Leo. She wrote her abilities.\n\"I can manage the shopping mall's underground warehouses. If you assign me one of the warehouses, I can manage the local workers for you. They will be able to access the shopping mall's warehouses with my permission.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Secondly, my specialty is related to food. I hope my work is related to food.\"\n\"You got it, girl. I trust you!\"\nLeo immediately assigned the mannequin as the manager of the B1 warehouse. He also gave her a job moving all consumables, fruits, vegetables, immortal grasses, and pill ingredients from all warehouses and granaries to the shopping mall.\nThe manager saluted and started working. She ran toward the mall's elevator and descended to the B1 floor.\nAfter the four girls had left, Leo summoned the rest of the gacha workers. As usual, some of them were farmers or fighters. Leo assigned their jobs according to their roles and sent them away.\nWhen everything was in order, Leo glanced at the remaining gacha ticket.\nThere was a guaranteed SR ticket sitting in his system inventory.\n\"HAHAHAHA! Show me the money! COME OUT, MY SR!\"\nLeo pressed the summon button and opened his arms. The system screen flashed him with a bright golden light. When the light subsided, the result was shown.\nA middle-aged man carrying a broad sword behind his back came out. He wore white robes like a cultivator, but his outer cloth had a familiar emblem of the Life Sword Sect.\nThe screen then showed the swordsman's status.\n.\nHua Taixu, the Sword Saint (Level 1)\nRarity: Super Rare\nStrength: Earth Immortal\nSpecialties: Domain of True Sword, Dimensional Cut, Librarian\nBiography: Hua Taixu was from the planet Yan Dynasty. He was a talented swordsman, who became the first immortal of the Yan Dynasty Planet. During his journey to pursue dao, Hua Taixu defeated all local lords and challenged the authority of the emperor. He suppressed and killed countless officials during his life. But after being undefeated for centuries, Hua Taixu realized his dao. He built the Life Sword Sect and spread his knowledge to the entire world, earning him the sword saint title.\nAfter Hua Taixu ascended and became an immortal, he realized that he was a frog in a well. Alien immortals from other races defeated him one after another. Because of the consecutive losses, Hua Taixu returned to his home planet to retire. He married a local girl and gave birth to two sons. After the sons grew up, Hua Taixu challenged the immortal realm again. He discovered the sanctuary of strong fighters, \"The Fate Stadium\", and lived there. 30 years later, Hua Taixu was trapped and was killed by Fenrir Werewolf Deity Anuraku. His soul returned to the river of karma.\n.\nLeo flinched. He didn't expect to see the sword saint that Hua Jiashan and others worshiped.\nAfter reading his biography, Leo doubted everybody knew that Hua Taixu was dead. He felt pity for them.\nStill, this copy of the sword saint might be for the better. Leo also wondered how those boomers would react when they saw Hua Taixu's face.\n\"Let's upgrade you first. I don't want anybody to see you as a weak immortal.\"\nLeo touched the expressionless doll of a swordsman and upgraded him to level 9, which was the highest possible level at the moment.\nHua Taixu's aura grew. His cultivation base jumped from the first immortal stage to the true immortal rank.\nThe doll gazed at Leo with dull eyes. His first conversation startled Leo.\n\"Where werewolves? Werewolves stupid. Me kill werewolves!\"\n\"…\"",

Government Official Claimed It Was a Flying Washing Machine of Ohio Man’s Mother-In-Law.\nChapter 215 – Florida Man Gazed the Stars and Discovered Alien UFO. Government Official Claimed It Was a Flying Washing Machine of Ohio Man's Mother-In-Law.\nRUMBLE\nA massive cubic spaceship orbited around a green planet. It was a hybrid ferry-battle cruiser spaceship of the divine elves, which was capable of sustaining 400,000 crewmates for 100 years without resupplying.\nWhile it cruised, a hundred beacons flashed, sending passengers from the ground to the ship's teleportation altars.\nA thousand deities and 10,000 immortal elves boarded the spaceship. They assembled troops and prepared to travel somewhere.\nWhile the immortal elves and their deities were in preparation, Simba sent his friends and neighbors off. He saluted by placing his right fist on his left chest and bowed.\nThe elves waved their hands and departed without chatting with Simba.\nThe Ohio man kept gazing at the beaming beacons and fell into deep thought. He couldn't get rid of the guilt in his heart.\n\"Are you worried about them?\"\nBehind Simba, his wife also watched everybody leaving. She misunderstood him, thinking that he was concerned about their safety.\n\"Yeah.\" Simba didn't lie. He might be guilty, but he cared about the neighbors and his friends. After all, if someone from Earth managed to survive and make it to another planet, his strength should be at the deity rank at the weakest.\nMoreover, Simba did some research. He secretly visited the Fate Stadium and checked the PVP ranking there.\nHe found someone with the title \"Florida Man\" among the rankers. Although the guy in question was a newbie, his detail was redacted due to his mysterious fate crystal.\n\"I don't think all of them will return in one piece. Their enemy is going to be very strong. I doubt sending deities there will be enough.\"\n\"Oh. Did you advise my mother?\" Ester was surprised.\n\"No. She didn't ask.\"\n\"…I see. Well, she's like that. My mother is too overconfident sometimes.\"\n\"Because of her overconfidence, you get to keep your head on your shoulders, Ester. Had she been a little ruthless or decisive, none of us would have been alive.\"\n\"I know. It's a blessing in disguise.\"\nSimba embraced his wife's shoulder and watched his friends leave this world. He deeply sighed.\n'I also hope that bitch won't get too crazy and force me to go to war. If she does, I'll take Ester and the others outta here.'\nRUMBLE\nThe spaceship collected everybody. It slowly steered toward the deep space. Instead of traveling through a hyperspace or a warp drive, it continued to cruise toward the outer rings of the star system.\nWHOOSH\nSuddenly, the entire spaceship vanished.\nSimba narrowed his eyes. He secretly opened his system menu and fiddled with it.\nA new system screen showed up. A solar system map of the Yan Dynasty Planet appeared. A second later, the vanished spaceship reappeared on the outer edge of the star system and cruised toward Leo's planet.\nSimba's eyes locked onto the live feed. He glanced at the planet and summoned another system window, which showed the status of Leo.\n.\nName: Leo [Redacted]\nTitle/Alias: Florida Man\nRace: [Redacted]\nAge: [Redacted]\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: [Redacted]\nLocation: Yan Dynasty Planet, Florida Domain\n.\nAs usual, most of his information was concealed due to his entity fate crystal. Simba smacked his lips and gazed at the portrait photo of Leo.\nThe system still published Leo's photo as an elderly man with long white hair and a white beard.\nSimba didn't recognize Leo. He glanced at the photo for a moment and thought to himself.\n'I hope your system can save you. If you survive this, let's meet at the Fate Stadium. I hope we can meet and talk.'\n.\n.\n\"Phoenix Drive, clear!\"\n\"Anti-domain guns, checked. Antimatter cannons, checked!\"\n\"All systems green, setting course to YDP-01.\"\nThe crews on the ship scanned for anomalies and the damage of the ship after the teleportation.\nThe engine they used was a state-of-the-art omnipresent drive, which allowed them to teleport the entire spaceship anywhere in the universe as long as they got the coordinates right.\nHowever, the cubic spaceship was not designed to fight on the frontline or war. Instead, it was a cargo ship, which was commonly used by merchants. They featured some dangerous guns and cannons, but they weren't enough to take down entities.\nHalf of the spaceship was designated to be a residential district. Every crewmate had a 40 square meter room for themselves. As for the rest, they were allocated to other facilities. Thus, not many parts of the ship were prepared for combat.\nThe captain of the spaceship, Ingof Jack was a 15-star elf deity. Inside his dantian, he condensed 15 elemental stars, and he alone had enough power to destroy any habitable planet.\nThe elf received the order from the matriarch to scout the Yang Dynasty Planet, aka YDP-01. He was to locate Esen's whereabouts and capture her. In case she resisted, Ingof had the authority to kill her.\nIngof watched the blue planet getting closer as his ship gradually entered the star system's orbit. He leaned on the captain's chair and turned his head to look at his aide.\nBehind him, another female dark elf stood still with her arms behind her back. She was also a deity, but she was slightly weaker than the captain.\n\"Have you contacted the mutts?\" Asked Ingof.\nThe dark elf answered without changing her expression or posture. \"The Fenrir will deploy their battleships here in two days.\"\n\"What takes them so long? Are they still using the warp drive?\"\n\"I'm afraid so. The matriarch always sold them outdated battleships. Their best battleships are the Hyena-Class.\"\n\"That ship class suits them well, don't you think? Hahahaha!\"\n\"They might be detestable and disgusting, but they are our subordinates, captain.\"\n\"Ah. Anyway, let's keep the distance and wait for the vanguards. We don't need to exert our forces before the hyenas show up.\"\n\"Aye-Aye sir!\"\nThe aide relayed the order, and the crew altered the flight course. The cubic spaceship adjusted the flight course and followed YDP-01's orbit path instead.\n.\n.\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Hmm, munya.\"\n\"Hmm, woof.\"\nThe black-winged angel, the Cathulhu, and the wolf statue looked at the stars. They grumbled in unison.\n\"Do you see what I see, cat?\"\n\"Do you see what I see, doge, munya?\"\n\"Do you see what I see, birb, woof?\"\nThe angel rolled his eyes. \"Stop calling me birb. I'm an angel.\"\n\"A birb is a birb, woof!\"\n\"At least, you're a BIRB, now a BIRD, munya.\"\n\"…\"\nMeowmeow had a headache dealing with the two beasts. He wished the fisherman statue were here.\nThe angel stopped playing around. He got to the point.\n\"Have y'all recharged?\"\nMu-Nyang laughed. \"Full to the brim, munya.\"\n\"Me, too, woof!\"\n\"Alright. Let them come a little closer. If they're in range, we go ham!\"\n\"Roger, munya!\"\n\"Okay, woof!\"\nThe three guardians licked their lips. They were ready for another big battle.\n.\n.\nDING\n<Warning! A player's forces are approaching!>\n<Warning! If another player forces enter your domain, all effects of your facilities will be penalized. All your automatons will lose 50% of their strength and energy.>\n<Warning! You do not have the authority to collect the lifespan of the invaders.>\nLeo suddenly received multiple system messages. He frowned and glared at the screen.\n\"Okay. My life has been full of conflict. Who the hell is looking for trouble this time?\"",

He made sure that the sword saint was at the max level and ordered him.\n\"Go and stand in front of the Tesseract Time Chamber. If someone talks to you and asks you about your identity, tell them that you're Sword Saint's twin brother. Also, if they are swordsman, you should offer to teach them swordsmanship and whatever skills that you know.\"\nHua Taixu slightly bowed. \"Yes! Where werewolves? Me kill werewolves.\"\n\"…Not now, but some idiots will invade our world soon. Sharpen your swords and wait for the mobilization.\"\n\"Understood. Enemy, werewolves?\"\n\"…Maybe.\"\n\"Good! Me, strong! Me kill werewolves!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had a feeling that Hua Taixu's memory might be jumbled, and this guy's speech was affected.\nHua Taixu snorted and vanished. He instantly teleported to the fourth floor of Leo's store and stood in front of the new facility.\nThe cashier mannequin was surprised. She shuddered and fell to her butt, but Hua Taixu helped her up. They stared at each other in silence.\nStrangely, the mannequin blushed. She pranced around Hua Taixu while the sword saint remained expressionless. He secretly chanted a personal sutra.\n'Me, strong. Domain, protect. Me kills werewolves.'\n.\n.\nAs the shopping mall had been upgraded, the interior was improved by a few levels. The luxurious vinyl tiles covered all floors and emitted a soothing scent. Mild Yin and Yang Qi circulated through the vents while the air conditioners kept the temperature warm.\nMembers of the Tang Clan and alchemists of the Life Sword Sect sensed the changes first. They rushed out of the workshops and admired the new changes.\nOne of the clansmen knelt and touched the wooden floor. He stroked it and drooled.\n\"T-This isn't just sacred wood. T-This is something else! What kind of wood is this?!\"\nAn alchemist from the Life Sword Sect also inspected the walls and the railings. As they were made from the same material, he couldn't help but admire the shiny brown wood.\n\"It's different from the steel. The surface is so smooth and beautiful. This craftsmanship is too superb!\"\nMore people made a commotion as they loved the gentle Qi from the air conditioners and vents. They no longer wanted to leave this place.\n\"I wish our lord wouldn't kick us out at night. I want to stay in seclusion here!\"\n\"Me, too.\"\n\"Me, three.\"\nEverybody lamented that they couldn't use the shopping mall as a cultivation center. Fortunately, the pylon tower provided a place to cultivate yin-yang Qi. Thus, they had a place to return to when they weren't studying alchemy.\nWhile everybody admired the new interior, a few people from the lower floor suddenly made a loud noise. One of the loudest men was none other than Tiger Swordsman, who patrolled the store to maintain order.\n\"SWORD SAINT! ARE YOU SWORD SAINT HUA TAIXU?!\"\nTiger Swordsman had seen Hua Taixu's portraits and paintings from various books. When he noticed the real deal, he was astonished.\nHua Taixu remained expressionless. He crossed his arms and stared at Tiger Swordsman.\n\"You!\"\n\"Y-Y-Yes, ancestor Hua?\"\n\"A swordsman, you?\"\n\"Y-Yes. My Daoist title is Tiger Swordsman. I was raised as an orphan slave from birth so I don't have a name.\"\n\"You, come. Me train you. You strong!\"\n\"???\"\nWithout waiting for Tiger Swordsman's answer, Hua Taixu grabbed him by the pants and dragged him into the time chamber.\nThe cashier mannequin followed after the two. She waved her hands around and showed a signboard that she had written a few minutes ago.\nThe signboard said [Entrance Fee – 10 Years of Lifespan per day per person.]\nHua Taixu glanced at the signboard and nodded. He pointed at Tiger Swordsman.\n\"He pays. We train. He strong!\"\nTiger Swordsman was taken aback by Hua Taixu's style of speech. He tried to resist, but he couldn't compete against the raw strength of a true immortal.\nIn the end, Tiger Swordsman was forced to become the first customer of the time chamber while Hua Taixu accompanied him as a personal mentor.\n.\nThe sighting of Hua Taixu quickly spread across the domain. Tang Xuan, Hua Jiashan, and people from the Life Sword Sect heard the rumor. They rushed to the fourth floor of the store to visit the time chamber.\nUnfortunately, the cashier mannequin stopped them. She raised another signboard to inform them of the facility's rules.\n[Only five visitors can enter the Tesseract Time Chamber at once.]\n[Entrance Fee – 10 Years of Lifespan per day per person.]\nThe mannequin then pointed at a whiteboard, which she had updated the current users in the time chamber.\n[Current visitors: 2]\nEverybody was stunned. The group contemplated what this facility was for and hesitated to ask the automaton.\nTang Xuan and Hua Jiashan were more decisive than the rest. They offered to pay their lifespan to enter to time chamber so that they could see the rumored sword saint.\n\"I'll pay the fee.\"\n\"I'm going in there, too.\"\nThe cashier collected the payment and opened a way for the duo to enter. She also updated the visitor number's status to 4.\nTang Xuan and Hua Jiashan entered the facility one after another. They silently greeted each other with their eyes, but they didn't chat. After all, they had other purposes here.\nThe existence of the sword saint was closely related to Hua Jiashan and Tang Xuan. Hua Jiashan was the sword saint's direct descendant while Tang Xuan was Hua Taixu's junior. Thus, they had a reason to visit the man.\nUpon entering the facility, they found themselves in an empty hall. Everything in the room was plain white and there was no sun, walls, plant, or any lifeform other than the people inside.\nNext to the entrance door, a series of modern gym equipment was there. Next to the gym were five small rooms, which featured bedrooms and restrooms. There was also a dummy area and an altar, which provided an endless flow of elemental Qi to the environment.\nHua Taixu looked back and found two new guys. He nodded at them.\n\"Come! I train you. You strong!\"\nHua Jiashan wryly smiled. He didn't remember that his ancestor was this young. Also, this person spoke in a colorful way, which he didn't recognize.\n\"Sir, are you a descendant of sword saint Hua Taixu?\" Asked Hua Jiashan.\nHua Taixu snorted. \"Me, sword saint! Me, your grandfather!\"\n\"!!!\"\nHua Jiashan couldn't believe it. He repeatedly shook his head.\n\"If I remember correctly, Grandfather is already over 2,000 years old. B-But you look quite young…\"\nTang Xuan inserted himself into the conversation. He cupped his fist and bowed 90 degrees.\n\"Junior Tang Xuan greets Ancestor Hua Taixu! It has been a while!\"\nHua Taixu paused for a moment. He stared at Tang Xuan and frowned.\n\"You. Not swordsman.\"\n\"Err, no. I'm an alchemist, not a swordsman.\"\n\"No sword skill, useless man. Me train you. You train sword!\"\n\"Eh?\"\nHua Taixu grinned and activated his sword domain. Then, a million swords emerged from the ground and transformed the white land into a sword graveyard.\n\"Grab sword! Me fight you! You get strong!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWithout waiting for Hua Jiashan or Tang Xuan to react, Hua Taixu grabbed one of the swords and lunged at them.\n\"WAIT! SENIOR!\"\n\"DAMMIT, GRANDFATHER!\"\nIt was too late for them to leave as the entrance door was locked from the outside. Tiger Swordsman, Hua Jiashan, and Tang Xuan would get stuck in this chamber for 500 days and get beaten up by the sword saint.",

They loaded the ingots into the local warehouse. Then, they changed shifts with the others.\nA new team was formed, and they traveled north to collect another batch of resources.\nAs soon as the ingots arrived, warehouse mannequins got to work. They coordinated with the new automaton manager and directly transported the ingots to the shopping mall's underground warehouse.\nAs Leo had prepared for this process, he left behind several barrels of his urine and a bucket of his saliva. The mannequins dipped every ingot in the barrels and dried them. The ingots soon changed color from black to white as they were upgraded.\nWhen more white ingots accumulated, the gunsmith workshop's mannequins stopped working and rode the elevator down. They collected the available resources and returned to their working stations. Then, they began crafting new weaponry.\nThe logistic chain was established. Without the need for Leo's guidance, the automatons worked non-stop.\nThe gunsmiths weren't the only place that got busy. The new facilities, namely the blacksmith workshops, began crafting cold weaponry.\nLeo watched the blacksmith mannequins hammering mysterious white metal. He waited for them to finish their first creation.\nIt took them only one hour to finish crafting a broadsword. The workers passed a white broadsword to Leo for inspection.\nLeo received the sword. At the same time, he received a notification message.\n[Your Blacksmith Workshop Level 15 has created Broadsword of Goddess Blood.]\n\"Heh. It changes from prophet's breast milk to crystalized milk. After it becomes an ingot, it changes its name to goddess milkium ingots. But when it becomes a sword, it turns into goddess blood sword.\"\nLeo laughed at the constant changes during the process. He wondered how many people would realize the origins of this sword.\nHe flipped it around and swung it. As Leo didn't exert his Qi or force, his swing looked amateurish and weak. However, the forces behind each swing cut through the air and left behind deep marks on the walls and the ground.\nFortunately, the shopping mall level 15 came with an auto-repair feature. The damaged floor and walls were gradually repaired.\n\"I wonder how strong this sword is… I wish I had someone to tell me.\"\nLeo thought of Hua Jiashan. However, the guy in question was still a mortal. Leo doubted that he had the qualification to evaluate the sword.\nAfter thinking of Hua Jiashan, the face of Hua Taixu came to Leo's mind.\n\"Oh, right. I have that sword saint. But that guy's speech is kinda…\"\nHua Taixu was not reliable due to his damaged conversation abilities. Leo thought of other people next.\nSierra didn't seem to be well-versed in swords. Taxi and Ricardo were monster beasts, so they didn't rely on external weapons. Tang Xuan was also a mortal, and his main expertise was alchemy.\nThe remaining options were Esen and her minions.\n.\nLeo returned to his battle bus to find Esen's subordinates. He wasn't disappointed.\nIn the lobby, Marc and Beatrice sat at a coffee table and enjoyed their snacks. They recently came out of their seclusion to take a break. Both elves managed to digest ten thousand years' worth of gun knowledge.\nLeo approached them and showed them the newly made sword.\n\"Can you guys evaluate its worth and its power? Is this good?\"\nLeo was embarrassed to utter the blasphemous words. The sentence \"Is it good?\" was known as a toxic way to flex a rare item in gacha-related games.\nMarc widely smiled and picked up the broadsword. He raised it and measured it from the hilt.\n\"Your Majesty, where did you get this? This is awesome!\"\nLeo was slightly taken aback by the new pronoun. \"I'm a king, now?\"\n\"Yes. You are going to marry our empress, so technically you will be our emperor!\"\n\"…I see.\"\nBeatrice slightly opened her eyes and revealed her abyssal gaze. She scanned the sword for a moment before she closed her eyes.\n\"That's a nice sword.\" Uttered Beatrice. \"It's good for dismantling god's souls.\"\n\"How did you know?\"\n\"It has the scent of goddess blood in it. It must have been made from milkium or something similar.\"\nLeo was impressed by Beatrice's knowledge. It seemed that she was wiser than her colleagues.\n\"What's special about Milkium? How do you know about it?\" Asked Leo.\n\"We used to live on another planet. I also was a part of a royal academy, and I had one of these swords before.\"\n\"Oh. Is it common in your hometown?\"\n\"No. It's reserved for the top student of the year. In my case, it got confiscated when Her Majesty and I were expelled and executed here.\"\n\"…My condolence.\"\n\"It happened long ago. I don't mind.\"\n\"About its power, can you describe it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nBeatrice described how the sword was made for young immortal elves to protect themselves. Every weapon made from Milkium was capable of killing gods and canceling their power. Because of its power, the divine elves confiscated the weapons and reserved them for their trustworthy soldiers and noble children.\nLeo and Marc attentively listened to Beatrice's lecture. When she finished, she sighed as if she was mentally exhausted.\n\"I talk too much today. Please excuse me. I'm not used to speaking more than 100 words a day.\"\n\"Understandable. I used to speak less than 100 words a day myself.\"\nLeo smiled at Beatrice and turned to Marc. \"I assume you both digest the pills properly, right?\"\nMarc repeatedly nodded. \"Yes, your majesty! My cultivation base is already at the true immortal stage. I'm a step away from attaining godhood, but I don't have a vessel yet. Once I have at least 100 vessels or worshipers, I can become a deity!\"\n\"…Good for you.\"\nLeo didn't understand anything Marc said. He wryly smiled and pointed at the sword.\n\"You're a swordsman, right? The sword is for you.\"\n\"EH?!\" Marc was shocked. Beatrice also raised her eyebrows.\n\"Beatrice, I want you to go to the shopping mall's fifth floor and collect every broadsword from the blacksmiths. Distribute them to your people first. From now on, you will be in charge of managing them, okay?\"\nBeatrice revealed a faint smile for a moment. She nodded. \"Understood, Your Majesty.\"\nMarc was also excited. \"Your majesty, are you making more of these?!\"\nLeo shrugged. \"I have plenty of milkium ingots. My golems are making them at the moment.\"\n\"H-How many can you make, your majesty?\"\n\"As many as I want.\"\n\"!!!\"\nMarc was speechless while Beatrice couldn't suppress her smile. Both were astonished by Leo's wealth.\n\"We'll visit the blacksmiths at once.\" Beatrice excused herself.\n\"Okay. Take care. Also, wait for the new guns. I'm planning to arm you with swords and guns. Don't forget to review your memory and gun knowledge. You'll need it.\"\nLeo laughed and walked along the hallway. He entered his room to check on his wife.\nMarc and Beatrice looked at each other. Their expressions were bright.\n\"His majesty is kind!\" Marc admired Leo.\n\"He is.\"\n.\n.\nBeatrice and Marc visited the blacksmiths as ordered. They collected every broadsword the automatons made and distributed them to their colleagues.\nHowever, there was a problem. As most of them weren't familiar with swords, they returned the weapons. Instead, they asked Beatrice if they could ask for a different weapon, such as staffs, canes, scythes, or spears.\nBeatrice acted as their liaison. She visited the blacksmiths and asked the automatons to make different weapons for them.\nAt first, the automatons rejected the order as Beatrice was not their master. Fortunately, the manager was there, and she convinced the blacksmith workers to accept the order.\nThe coordination went smoothly this time. The blacksmiths stopped making swords, but they created customized weapons for Esen's subordinates.",

While sleeping, her Qi circulated, and her body underwent a transformation.\nShe no longer looked like a 17-18-year-old teenager. Esen grew a few centimeters taller while her bosom and bottom developed.\nLeo observed and watched his wife's body grow. He wryly smiled.\n\"I guess I can't call you flat anymore.\"\nNo man hated seeing his wife getting more beautiful and sexier. Leo loved what he was seeing.\nStill, Leo was slightly disappointed. He had another business to consult Esen, and he needed her help. He needed more materials to concoct more Floridian dantian pills.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – True Death Poison Pill]\nOne True Death Mushroom\nOne Sweet Dream Mushroom\nOne Drop of Virgin Yin Blood\nOne Drop of Virgin Yang Blood\nWood and Earth Crystalized Essence\n.\nLeo needed Esen's blood so that he could make more of these pills. He planned to use them in the upcoming battle against the mysterious invaders.\nSince Esen was out, Leo left her alone. He returned to the new alchemy factory to assign a new task.\n.\nSo far, four alchemy workshops, two alchemy factories, one land vehicle factory, three gunsmith workshops, and three blacksmith workshops shared the fifth floor of the shopping mall.\nThere should have been seven alchemy workshops. However, three evolved into factories. Thus, only four remained.\nAs this floor featured more facilities, more cultivators and workers stayed on this floor. Some cooped in the alchemy workshops to study pill-making techniques. More than half gathered in front of the blacksmiths to repair or commission their new weapons while a few queued in front of the gunsmiths to get their reserved firearms.\nAlthough a couple of cultivators visited the land vehicle factory, they quickly lost interest as the local workers hadn't started manufacturing anything yet.\nLeo arrived at the floor and strode toward the idle factory. He entered the facility and checked its status.\n.\nAlchemy Factory Level 15\nAutomaton Alchemy (5/10)\nActive Machine (5/10)\nFactory Capacity (5/10)\nFactory Output Speed (0/10)\nCurrently Making: None\n.\nLeo glanced at the five factory workers. The mannequins all wore a white gown and a yellow helmet according to OSHA guidebooks.\nHe quietly cut his wrist and drew his blood to a bucket. The transparent liquid flowed into the container.\nAfter Leo filled the bucket to the brim, he rubbed his wound. The cut vanished, and Leo could feel that his bone marrow already replaced his lost blood.\nHe didn't stop there. Leo bit his arm and tore a chunk of his flesh off. Then, he tossed it into the bucket. The pain stung, but Leo only scratched it. Again, the wound instantly healed.\n\"Do we have enough caiman's cores?\"\nThe five workers nodded. One of them rushed out and entered the staff elevator at the back. A few minutes later, he came back with an armful of small balls.\nLeo narrowed his eyes and counted the caiman's cores.\n\"Only 12? Well, that's enough, I guess. Start making Floridian Dantian pills. Quality doesn't matter. Make as many as possible!\"\nDING\nThe factory's status changed. It queued the recipe while the workers brought the ingredients to the machines.\nAs soon as the workers started the pill-making machines, Leo's system informed him.\n<Remaining time: 24 hours…>\n\"HUH?!\"\nLeo was bewildered. It took the workshop a whole month to make a batch. However, the factory only needed one day! Moreover, Leo hadn't upgraded the output speed yet!\nHe was inspired.\n\"I see. So the workshop is for researching and developing the prototypes. The factories are for mass production! I get it!\"\nLeo rubbed his hands. He hoped that he could get more factories from gacha to upgrade his production facilities.\nSince Leo was around, he visited all workshops to collect completed pills. While he was at it, he started new projects, which he postponed for months.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 15\nActive Cauldrons: (5/5)\nAlchemy Automatons (3/5)\nProduction Quality (5/5)\nProduction Quantity (2/5)\n.\nFive cauldrons gave Leo room to initiate more projects. With four workshops at level 15, Leo had 20 cauldrons to work with.\nDING\n<Refining Soul Stones…>\n<Refining Werewolf Dantian Pills…>\n<Refining Longevity Pills…>\nThose were the recipes that Leo got from his early days. Leo also tried to queue for other projects.\n.\n[Alchemy Recipe – Pill of Youth]\nOne Hundred Blades of Immortal Grass\nOne Drop of Virgin Sage's Blood\nOne Drop of Unicorn's Tear\nOne Liter of Pinnacle-Grade Holy Water\nFive Elemental Essence\n.\nAs Leo had just lost his V card, he didn't know if his blood could replace the virgin sage's blood. Still, he tried it anyway. Leo called Taxi over and squeezed his tears. Then, he initiated the project.\nDING\n<Refining Pills of Youth…>\nStrangely, the workshop accepted Leo's blood as virgin sage's blood. He didn't know how and why it worked. Still, it gave him new inspiration.\nIf his blood could substitute virgin yang blood, would Esen's blood work, too?\nLeo needed to try. He returned to the battle bus.\n.\nUpon getting back to his bedroom, Leo found Esen sitting on the bed. She still looked drowsy and exhausted. However, her aura was different.\nA trace of holiness and soothing air came from her. Her skin was glossy and shiny like polished porcelain. Also, she smelled strangely delicious and appetizing.\nLeo drooled. He had the urge to jump her again, but he reeled his desire in check. He coughed.\n\"Good Morning, Esen.\"\n\"…!\"\nEsen finally remembered that they had done the deed. She grabbed a pillow and used it as a shield, hugging it.\nLeo laughed and sat next to her. He pulled her into a hug and teased her.\n\"Is there a point in getting embarrassed? We'll be seeing each other naked every day from now on. Hiding is pointless.\"\nEsen pouted. Her face was still bright red.\n\"…Monster.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"…My butt hurts.\"\n\"Sorry. Hahaha!\"\nAlthough Leo kept teasing her, Esen leaned her head against his chest. She then scratched his skin with her sharp nails and bit him. This time, she managed to leave a red mark on his skin.\n\"Wifey.\"\n\"…Hmm?\"\n\"Are we still considered virgins?\"\n\"HUH?!\" Esen pushed Leo away and stared at his face. \"Are you messing with me?\"\n\"No. I just used my blood as a substitute for virgin sage's blood, and it worked. I'm wondering if I can still use your blood as virgin yin blood.\"\nEsen gave Leo a weird look. \"Are you an idiot?\"\n\"For a human's standard, yes. But for MONKE's standard, absolutely not! A MONKE with 80 IQ is a genius of our kind!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, get dressed and come with me. Let's test something. We need to make more pills!\"\nLeo dragged Esen off the bed and threw her to the bathroom. He personally bathed her, dried her, dressed her, and combed her hair.\nEsen let Leo spoil her. She brightly smiled and enjoyed the feeling of being loved.\n.\nThe duo arrived at the alchemy workshop floor. As planned, Leo extracted his blood and Esen's blood. Then, he initiated a new project.\nDING\n<Refining True Death Poison Pills…>\n\"Ah, it works.\"\nLeo laughed while Esen looked at the cauldron in confusion. She pointed at it and questioned him.\n\"I saw you put sweet dream mushroom and death mushroom in there. What are you making?\n\"True death poison pills.\"\n\"What's that?\"\n\"I have no idea either. I just have the recipe, and I want to make it.\"\n\"HUH?!\"\n\"Anyway, I think I should teach you about other things.\"\nLeo guided his wife to a gunsmith workshop. He cut the queues and visited his workers.\nThe mannequins looked up and found Leo. They stood up and saluted him.\n\"Are the new toys ready?\" Asked Leo.\nThe mannequins nodded and handed Leo a prototype of their new line of products. As they were too new, they hadn't distributed to the other workers yet.\nLeo gazed at the black rile. He stroked its handle and muzzle as if they were the finest jewel.\nThe mannequins made a modern M-16.\nMoreover, the system gave Leo a piece of good news.\nDING\n<Would you like to upgrade the rifle?>\n<Price – 10 Years of Lifespan.>\nThe upgrade fee was 1,000 times cheaper than the guns from the shopping system!\nLeo immediately upgraded it to the max level. Unlike before, its max level reached 15.\nWHOOSH\nThe black rifle emitted black smoke and an ominous aura. A faint howl leaked out from the gun's muzzle while an eye spirit emerged from the weapon.\nThe floating smoke eye gazed at Leo and slowly blinked like a cat expressing its love to its slave. Then, it glanced at Esen.",

Then, he passed Esen the rifle.\n\"This will be your weapon from now on.\"\n\"Eh? This?\" Esen received the rifle and inspected it.\nIt was different from the breech-loading model. Esen couldn't find a way to insert an essence stone, spirit stone, or sacred wood bullets to load the gun.\nLooking at the amateurish hands of Esen, Leo laughed. He picked a loaded magazine and showed her the reloading method.\nThe magazines looked the same as their modern world counterpart. Only 5.56mm cartridges were compatible. However, Leo used the milkium, aka the goddess's blood, as a material.\nLeo didn't understand why white ingots managed to transform into black rifles. Although he wanted to learn more about the rifle's production process, he didn't have time to divulge his hobby.\n\"Be careful with it. This gun is different. One magazine carries 30 bullets, so you can shoot 30 bullets consecutively before you need to reload the gun. Also, because it's the pre-Vietnam War model, it doesn't have the 3-round burst-fire or semi-auto selector. If you pull the trigger and hold it, it will go brrr until you empty the magazine.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen tilted her head in confusion. She barely understood everything.\n\"So, if I hold the trigger, it will shoot all the bullets in the magazine?\"\n\"Yes. We call that full-auto mode. It's bad, though. The accuracy will be very poor if you just spray it.\"\n\"Hoh? Let me play with this! I'm gonna go shoot some alligators!\"\nEsen was interested. She giggled and hugged the rifle. Then, she ran out of the shopping mall and flew toward the south.\nLeo blankly stared at Esen. After she had left, he sighed.\n\"Oh, dear. Is she converting to one of my kin?\"\n.\nThat day, an incident occurred above the canyon river. Several black lightning beams flashed and ascended to the sky, followed by the thunderous noise of gunshots. One of the beams created a 10-kilometer-diameter crater before the contaminated river turned it into a lake.\nBecause of the commotion, Cat ran home crying. The monster plant climbed the pylon tower and sat on top of it. Then, she refused to come down.\n.\n.\nA day later…\nWHOOSH\nHua Taixu, Hua Jiashan, Tiger Swordsman, and Tang Xuan exited the Tesseract Time Chamber. Aside from the sword saint, the demeanor of the three cultivators changed.\nHua Jiashan carried the aura of a quasi-immortal. His gaze and movements were smooth and sharp. Every step he took, he left behind a scratch cut on the ground. He didn't carry a sword around anymore as he no longer needed one.\nTiger Swordsman was no different, except his cultivation base was one stage lower than Hua Jiashan. His muscular arms grew an inch thicker, and he also looked younger. The scars on his body disappeared, replaced with smooth jade skin.\nTang Xuan's style also changed. He exhaled green flame from his nostrils as if he had become a fire dragon. He strode while his arms crossed behind his back. By taking one step, he moved 10 meters forward. As for his cultivation base, he ascended and became an earth celestial immortal.\nThe sword saint gave his disciples a meaningful look and nodded in approval. 500 days of non-stop training inside the chamber was fruitful. He encouraged them to come back and train with him again.\n\"You little strong. Come back, you stronger!\"\nTiger Swordsman, Hua Jiashan, and Tang Xuan's expressions turned dark. They were still traumatized from the hellish training sessions.\nNone of them got a wink of sleep, and they survived by consuming the grain pills of the facility. For 500 days, they fought their best to survive from Hua Taixu's sword barrages until they dropped from exhaustion.\nFortunately, Hua Taixu stopped when they were half-dead. He fed them mysterious black nuts that he got from the facility's kitchen, and the trio's wounds and stamina were restored. Then, the Spartan training resumed.\nIn the end, they learned sword techniques and improved their cultivation base by being endlessly tortured.\n\"I'm not going in there again.\" Hua Jiashan complained.\n\"Same.\" Tiger Swordsman was on the verge of collapsing.\n\"I'd rather die than redoing everything again. That place was hell!\"\n\"Agreed!\"\nThe trio somehow got closer, and they talked without using honorifics. The group rode the elevator to the first floor and visited the fast-food chain restaurant to get something different to eat.\nThe shop had a fancy LED signboard – Florida Fried Chicken. It displayed photos of fried chicken, French fries, nuggets, and fried chicken wings.\nTang Xuan and others never tried the food before. They walked into the store's counter and sat at a table.\nA worker mannequin in a red uniform walked toward them and passed them thick papers. They were the menus of this place's food.\n.\nOne Nom-Nom Bucket (209 Spirit Stones) – 4 pcs of Fried Chickens, 1 Floridian Burger, 3 pcs Tender, 1 Medium French Fries.\nParty Nom-Nom Bucket (499 Spirit Stones) - 12pcs of Fried Chickens, 4 Floridian Burgers, 10pcs Spicy Wings, 2 Large French Fries, and One Refillable Drink.\nDiet Nom-Nom Set (99 Spirit Stones) – 1 Spicy Chicken Burger, 1 Medium French Fries, 1 Medium Tea of Rejuvenation\n.\nThe trio read the menus and drooled. The pleasant fried chickens from the kitchen smelled so nice, and the images on the menu looked appetizing.\nGROWL\nEverybody's stomach roared, demanding the food.\nTang Xuan pointed at the largest set. \"Get me the party bucket!\"\nHua Jiashan glanced at the father of his mentor, \"Can you eat all that alone?\"\n\"Ha! I can even eat a freaking horse!\"\n\"Alright. Make it two! I'll take the same set!\" Hua Jiashan showed two fingers to the waiter.\nTiger Swordsman scanned through the menu and flipped the pages. He then noticed other good stuff at the back. He placed the order.\n\"2 of numbers 7, 8, and 9 large, number 2 with extra cheese, five extra dipping sauces, and refillable tea.\"\nHua Jiashan and Tang Xuan stared at the big guy. They gave him a weird look.\n\"What?\" Tiger Swordsman scoffed.\n\"You gonna eat all that?\"\nTiger Swordsman laughed and smacked his stomach. \"Me bulking. Me eat lots!\"\n\"Stop talking like the sword saint. That gives me a headache…\"\nInstead of discouraging Tiger Swordsman, the guy laughed.\n\"Me nom-nom! Me stronger!\"\n\"…\"\nBoth elders covered their faces with their hands. They didn't want to hear another word from their friend.\nA few minutes later, their table was full of food. As if they had been starving for years, they devoured everything and almost ate the plastic plates of the restaurant.\nThree big-bellied old men paraded out of the shopping mall, satisfied. None of them realized what they had just eaten.\n.\n.\nAfter Hua Jiashan, Tiger Swordsman, and Tang Xuan exited the time chamber, more people flocked to this place to inquire Hua Taixu about what the facility could do.\nOne of the curious people was Jin Yong, aka the poison alchemist who once purchased poison grain pills from Leo.\nAt first, Jin Yong came here because of Tang Tian's assignment. The latter ordered him to fetch his father as he disappeared into the store for too long. But after witnessing the improvement of the three elders, he wondered if he could give it a try.\n\"Senior, is this place for cultivating? Can I cultivate in there?\" Jin Yong asked Hua Taixu.\nThe sword saint sized up Jin Yong. He snorted in disappointment.\n\"You weak. You train harder. Me train you. You stronger! COME!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nNot allowing Jin Yong to leave, Hua Taixu grabbed Jin Yong by the collar cloth and dragged him into the time chamber.\n\"Me train you! You stronger!\"\n\"EEEEEEEEEHHHHHH!!?\"\nTheir actions didn't escape the curious eyes of others. Three Life Sword Sect's disciples, who came here on their day-off, hoped to train under the famous sword saint. They voluntarily followed Jin Yong to the time chamber and paid their lifespan as a fee.\nThey would soon realize what Spartan Hell was.\n\"ME TRAIN YOU! YOU STRONKER!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 220 Florida Man Investigated after This Year’s Graduates of His University Had Lower IQ Than Monkeys.\nChapter 220 – Florida Man Investigated after This Year's Graduates of His University Had Lower IQ Than Monkeys.\n\"Hey, have you heard? If you enter the facility on the fourth floor and pay 10 years of lifespan, you can enter a secret mystic realm!\"\n\"I heard! I heard! Elder Tang Xuan, Hua Jiashan, and Tiger Swordsman went inside. All of them broke through their bottlenecks!\"\n\"But I heard another thing. Someone said the food in the FFC shop is the reason! They ate the fried chickens there and gained an immense amount of Qi!\"\n\"Is that true? They went into that super expensive tavern?!\"\nRumors circulated in Leo's domain after Hua Jiashan's group returned home. The employees saw them leave the shopping mall and speculated what happened inside based on testimonies and witnesses.\nThe next day, more people gathered in the mall. There were two groups of visitors.\nThe first group was the gourmet type. Everybody had a fair amount of wealth to pay for the food, so they came here to give it a try. As for the second group, they went to the fourth floor, hoping to try the new facility.\nAmong the first group of people, Gao Yan and Wu Buyi managed to reserve a table. The former just came out from seclusion after he had digested all information from the Floridian dantian pill. As for Wu Buyi, he tagged along with his disciple to monitor his condition.\nAt the moment, Gao Yan was a quasi-immortal. His cultivation progress baffled Wu Buyi so much that he was concerned about Gao Yan's foundation. Thus, he took the disciple here to relax and have a good meal. Coincidentally, it suddenly got popular.\nAs Wu Buyi was not the first timer here, he quickly ordered his favorite menu.\n\"Give me the party nom-nom bucket, three BBQ dipping sauces, and a set of spicy cockatrice wings.\"\nAfter making his order, Wu Buyi glanced at Gao Yan. Noticing that Gao Yan was still in a daze, he recommended a light course.\n\"How about the first set, the one nom-nom bucket? If you can't eat it all, you can take them home. It's cheaper, too.\"\nGao Yan nodded and closed his eyes. Silently, he dozed off.\n\"Oh boy.\" Wu Buyi dryly laughed. He knew why Gao Yan was in this condition.\nMost of the time, cultivators in seclusion spent their time meditating 24/7 and circulating their Qi. However, there were cases in which secluded cultivators got so absorbed in meditation that their bodies and minds switched to auto-pilot mode. Then, they stopped thinking or using their brain.\nAs a result, when the meditation session was over, their mind remained blank for a while just like patients who woke up after anesthesia's effect wore off. Many people recovered in a few hours, but weak-willed cultivators might need a few days to regain their senses.\nWu Buyi could only hope that Gao Yan would recover quickly.\nMurmur\nMeanwhile, the restaurant was crowded. Lines of curious visitors queued in front of the counter, waiting to order some food to take home. The mannequins behind the counter worked like a machine while some of the waiters ran around and took orders from customers at tables.\nThe fast-food chain was not the only place that got busy. The food court was also crowded. Although they didn't offer expensive fried chicken, they had more variety of food. Stalls and shops selling street food, drinks, steaks, noodles, and random snacks were new to the local people.\nWu Buyi gazed at the crowd of people in front of both places.\n\"You know, when I first came here, this place was only a small building surrounded by tall trees and forest. Look at this place now. The land has been reclaimed, and some places are not even recognizable.\"\nGao Yan nodded while he was still half-asleep.\nA few minutes later, the food arrived. The pleasant scent of fried chicken and hot crispy French fries woke Gao Yan from his slumber. He slowly opened his eyes and gazed at the yellowish food.\nBecause of the Floridian dantian pill's effects, Gao Yan learned a few jumbled memories. His mouth and throat uttered a word without thinking.\n\"…KFC?\"\n\"What's KFC?\" Wu Buyi glanced at Gao Yan while he dipped a couple sticks of French fries in a dipping sauce.\n\"…Fast food.\"\n\"Yeah. This tavern cooks very fast. It's fast food alright.\"\n\"…And it's junk food.\"\n\"Hey! Don't call good food junk! You're a junk! Your whole damn family is a junk! If you don't want to eat that, give it to me!\"\n\"…\"\nGao Yan frowned and swatted Wu Buyi's hand away from his plates of food. He slowly reached for a drumstick and bit it without pouring any sauce on it.\nThe taste buds on Gao Yan's tongue responded to the newly acquired memory from the pill. He remembered this taste.\nNOM-NOM!\nGao Yan started to eat faster. He skillfully poured ketchup and chili sauce on the chicken on his plate and feasted on the French fries. Then, he downed all the hamburgers in a few bites.\nWhen everything was gone, Gao Yan burped. He drank the last drop of tea in his cup and grumbled.\n\"I wish they served some soda. It lacks some good Pepsi and coke.\"\n\"Huh?\" Wu Buyi was confused. \"What's coke and pep-si?\"\n\"Sweet drinks. They usually have them in this type of fast-food chain.\"\n\"…Have you eaten something like this before?\" Wu Buyi raised his brows. He doubted that Gao Yan had traveled to other cities since he was too young.\n\"To be honest, no. I just got this strange memory.\"\n\"What memory?\"\n\"I don't know. I just have it. I think it's from Lord Florida Man's pill.\"\n\"Hoh?\" Wu Buyi's curiosity was piqued. \"What was the pill's name again? I'll ask the lord to sell some to me.\"\n\"Floridian Dantian Pill.\"\n.\nThe conversation between Gao Yan and Wu Buyi didn't escape the ears of bystanders. As most of the people here were former disciples of Life Sword Sect and Amazonian Sanctuary, they paid extra attention to the rising star and the alchemist elder.\nWhen they heard the keywords \"Floridian Dantian Pill\", they took notes. Everybody planned to ask Leo and the supermarket's cashiers if they had the pills for sale later.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tang Tian gathered in front of the time chamber on the fourth floor.\nAs Hua Jiashan, Tiger Swordsman, and Tang Xuan proved that the facility offered a place for them to train, the other elders rushed here to seize the opportunity. Moreover, they heard a thorough detailed version from their colleagues, and they knew what they would experience.\nDongfang Mei counted the heads and giggled. \"I guess we have to fight for a spot. There isn't enough room for all five of us to enter at once.\"\nXu Nuan humbly bowed, \"If you wish it, I can give up my spot for you, master.\"\n\"Hahahaha! You don't have to. We can ask one of the gentlemen to concede instead.\"\n\"…But I think I should come back tomorrow with Qiqi. I think it's better for me to be beside her when she gets to train in there.\"\n\"Hmm. That's also a good idea.\"\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Tang Tian overheard their conversation. They let out a sigh of relief as they didn't have to fight each other for an available spot.\nTang Tian walked toward his former disciple Dongfang Mei. He teased her.\n\"I heard you and Jiashan married. When did you hold the ceremony? How come you didn't invite me, your mentor and senior?\"\nDongfang Mei ejected a paper fan and slapped Tang Tian's butt, messing with him. The sound was loud and crisp, causing others to look at the group.\n\"OW! You stinky brat! I told you not to smack my butt whenever we greet! You haven't changed a bit!\" Tang Tian rubbed his butt and grumbled.\nDongfang Mei laughed. \"Stupid teacher. You should have joined us ages ago. Anyway, we haven't decided on our ceremony dates yet. I think it will be after Lord Florida Man's wedding.\"\n\"Oh, I see. Who is his wife again? Is it the woman with the long ears?\"\nTang Tian had seen Esen before. Her mysterious air and aura gave him an impression of a celestial being from heaven. In the past few days, he tried to greet her a few times, but her bodyguards intimidated him.\n\"If you refer to the girl with blond hair, yes. I heard she has a unique constitution. I don't know the details, but she is a celestial emperor.\"\n\"Celestial Emperor?\"\n\"An immortal rank. I think it's the 8th stage of the immortal realm.\"\n\"…Wow. No wonder Lord Florida Man chooses her.\"\nTang Tian was astonished. His father just took the first step to the immortal rank, but he was just a fledgling compared to Esen.\nAgain, the bystanders eavesdropped their conversation and took notes. The more they heard about Leo and Esen, the more interested they were.\nIn the afternoon, Jin Yong, Hua Taixu, and three unfortunate young men exited the time chamber. Except for Hua Taixu, the four young men seemed mentally and physically exhausted. However, their cultivation base improved by several ranks, especially Jin Yong.\nSimilar to Gao Yan and Hua Jiashan, Jin Yong's strength stepped into the quasi-immortal rank. As for the other three, they got stuck at the nascent soul stage.\nThe appearance of another quasi-immortal stunned the elders and the onlookers in front of the facility. Everybody gawked at Jin Yong, who had a similar aura to Tang Xuan in the past.\nTang Tian rushed to his disciple. He supported his core disciple.\n\"What happened in there, Jin Yong?! H-How come you're a quasi-immortal now?\"\nJin Yong wryly laughed and looked at Hua Taixu. He warned his mentor.\n\"Me train hard. Me get strong.\"\n\"…What?\"\nHua Taixu widely grinned and gazed at Tang Tian. He then pointed at the latter.\n\"You weak! Train here! Me train you. You strong!\"\n\"…?\"\nTang Tian was taken aback as he barely understood both of them. Still, as Tang Tian came prepared, he readily paid 10 years of lifespan and accepted the sword saint's invitation.\nHan Hao, Han Meng, and Dongfang Mei followed them into the time chamber while Hua Taixu laughed in a merry mood.\n\"Enthusiastic seeds! Me train you. You STRONKER!\"\nEverybody entered the time chamber, and the door was locked. It was too late for them to turn back.\nOne of the surviving disciples looked back and prayed for the elders. He silently uttered.\n\"There hell. You suffer. Me pray good luck.\"\nJin Yong looked at his colleagues, who managed to survive the Spartan training together. He stopped talking like Hua Taixu and corrected his grammar.\n\"…I guess we have to retain our speech. Otherwise, everybody will talk like him.\"\n\"…Me agree.

Many Universities Openly Sponsored the Research.\nChapter 221 – Florida Man Proclaimed He Studied Dark Magic to Start Zombie Apocalypse. Many Universities Openly Sponsored the Research.\nDespite being threatened by the looming invaders, Leo continued his life normally.\nHis schedule slightly changed. As the cashiers collected lifespan from his customers for him, Leo got more free time. Aside from harvesting mutated mushrooms and sweet dream mushrooms, he spent his daytime meditating and training in his dantian universe.\nLeo faced several colleagues in his system world – Beatrice, Marc, Ivy, Hua Taixu, and Sierra. The result and the rewards were satisfying.\nAt night, Leo and Esen spent their quality time together. However, they didn't always get intimated like newlywed couples.\nWhile everybody in the domain was distracted by the time chamber, Leo and Esen sat on the bed, facing each other. The husband decided the guide his wife to improve her abilities so that she could be as strong as the shadow he fought.\n\"Esen, about your necromancy and vampiric skills, how far have you mastered?\"\nEsen puffed her chest. \"Out of five levels of necromancy, I've mastered all five – The resurrection art, the curses, the dark magic, the life force manipulation, and the puppeteering!\"\n\"Aren't there supposed to be seven? What about healing and the enchantment spells?\"\nEsen scoffed. \"Are you dumb? There is no such thing as healing and attack spells in necromancy!\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nAfter he had defeated her a thousand times, the system granted him new memory, allowing Leo to use the spells as if he had been using them a million times in the past.\nHe knew that Esen was wrong.\nLeo tilted his head and pointed his finger to the ceiling. Then, his yang Qi produced white smoke, which coiled around his finger. It was a healing spell from one of the necromancy arts that Leo had learned from Esen's shadow.\nEsen's frown deepened. \"Isn't that a holy spell? Isn't that gonna harm the undead?\"\n\"You got it wrong. Here, take a look.\"\nLeo ejected the corpse of a four-armed mutant and used a resurrection art on him. The mutated corpse rose up and groaned like a zombie.\nWitnessing Leo using her clan's technique, she was bewildered.\n\"Geezer! How did you learn my people's techniques?! T-That's my kin's exclusive arts!\"\nLeo shrugged. He reminded Esen.\n\"Watch carefully.\"\nLeo gently clenched his fist.\nCRACK!\nSuddenly, the mutant zombie's legs were snapped and broken. He fell to the ground and struggled to get back up.\nLeo explained. \"That was a combination of puppeteering and assault magic, right?\"\nEsen gulped and nodded. However, she was still confused about how Leo mastered her people's techniques.\n\"Now, here is the healing part.\"\nLeo waved his finger and sent a trail of white smoke toward the zombie. The light shone upon the zombie's legs and repaired the bones. A few seconds later, the mutant zombie got back on his feet.\n\"EEEHHHH!?\" Esen couldn't believe her eyes. \"HOW?! I THOUGHT UNDEAD AND HOLY MAGIC AREN'T COMPATIBLE?!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and lectured her. \"It's not actually HEALING but REPAIRING in a sense. The holy magic you referred to is nothing but another application of yang Qi and life force. You sacrifice some of your life force to create a miracle, and voila, a holy magic is completed. But in this case, I directly injected my yang Qi into his bones and restored them to their former shape\"\n\"You can do that?!\"\n\"This is going to take long. Anyway, take notes. I'll only explain it once…\"\nJust like that, Leo spent the entire night lecturing how Esen should use her abilities and skills, which her shadow at 1,000% potential could use.\nEsen saw Leo in a new light. Her eyes sparkled while her pupils expanded.\n.\nOutside Leo's room, Ivy eavesdropped their conversation as usual. But when she heard that Leo was lecturing her master about their secret arts, she was flabbergasted.\n'How did he know all of this? Is he an elf in disguise? That can't be right. I'm sure he's one of the humans… wait. He's not even a human! His life signature is a…\"\nIvy bitterly laughed. Then, she let out a long sigh.\n'That's even better. Human bloodlines are too weak anyway. He has something even better!'\nNobody knew what Ivy had discovered. So far, only Esen and Ivy were aware of what Leo actually was.\n.\n.\nA group of emissaries from the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect traveled southwest with a flying ship. When they passed the ruined Cauliflower City, they stopped their ship.\nElders of the sect jumped down the ship and entered the city. They swept the remnant of rogue cultivators in the area and collected their spatial rings. Then, they continued making their way south.\nTheir sect master, Murong Qi, made a trip here himself. He brought along a thousand prettiest female disciples, with an age range between 12 and 20.\nThis was Murong Qi's prepared gifts. Although he was certain that Leo wouldn't like them, these girls would still be useful as spies. After all, Leo had subordinates, and most of them didn't have a wife. These girls could marry Leo's subordinates instead.\nAs long as these dual cultivators stayed in Leo's domain, Murong Qi could obtain endless information about Leo and his power. Then, he could adjust his plan according to the situation.\nThe group reached Leo's domain at night. However, Murong Qi stopped his ship before they collided with the flying island. He navigated his vessel to land at the east of the Tang Clan's manor.\nMurong Qi got down from the ship and led his people toward the domain. He also inspected the large manor in the area.\nThe manor was surrounded by three-meter-tall earth walls. An array of green smoke floated over the walls to intimidate thieves and rogue cultivators. In front of the main door, a large signboard written the name of the owner's family.\nMurong Qi read the family signboard and smirked.\n\"So, this is where the Tang Clan hiding. Well, I can't blame them. They are smarter than me. I should have come here first.\"\nInstead of visiting Leo at night, Murong Qi ordered his subordinate to knock on the Tang Clan Manor's door.\nThe gate guards behind the door opened the gate and peeked outside. He frowned at Murong Qi for a moment before he detected the guest's cultivation base.\nOne of the guards rushed into the manor to inform their lord. As for the others, they opened the gate and bowed to the guests.\n\"May I ask who you are and what your purpose here at night, senior?\"\nMurong Qi shamelessly stated his business.\n\"We have traveled 3,000 li to pay homage to Lord Florida Man. Unfortunately, we arrived at night, and we couldn't possibly seek an audience with him at this time. Since my clan is on friendly terms with the Tang Clan, I've swallowed my shame and come here to ask for a favor. May my subordinates and I stay here for the night and get some food?\"\nIn short, Murong Qi came here to extort some wealth from the Tang Clan.\nThis was his habit. As a quasi-immortal, he always crashed at somebody else's manor and took advantage of their hospitality. In this case, Murong Qi brought 2,000 subordinates along, and he didn't want to spend a single dime on their food or pills.\nThe gate guard glanced behind Murong Qi and found an army of beautiful young maidens and male cultivators. He gulped.\n\"P-P-Please wait for our lord, senior. I don't have enough authority to make the decision.\"\n\"It's okay. I can wait. But as you can see, there are many women and children here. Can they at least get some food and a place to rest?\"\n\"…\"\nThe guard wanted to invite them in, but he couldn't. He glanced at the group of young maidens again.\nThis time, the girls looked back at him and the other guards. Their eyes shone in pink color, and every gate guard's mind became blank.\n\"Can we enter, sir?\"\nThe guards smiled and nodded. \"Sure.\"\n\"Thank you!\"\nThe girls giggled and made their way into the Tang Clan Manor.\n.\nBy the time Tang Xuan came out from his residence to see the commotion, half of the maidens already entered his manor and seduced his male servants and clansmen. Some of the clansmen gave up their room to let these underage girls inside.\nTang Xuan was enraged as he knew who visited him. He stomped toward the front gate and found the person as predicted.\n\"Yeah. The only shameless person in the world to crash and freeload other people's houses is you. What are you planning this time?!\"\nTang Xuan glared at Murong Qi while the latter was astonished.\n\"Your cultivation base… you're an immortal now?\"\n\"Ha! Obviously, I'm no longer a mortal! Don't lump me together with Situ Nantian, Ouyang Zi, or Yan Xiang! We're not the same!\"\n\"… I see. So this rumored Florida Man must have taken care of you very well.\"\n\"That's none of your business. Get your people out of my sight, or else!\"\n\"Whoa, relax, brother. I've come in peace!\"\nMurong Qi realized he had made a mistake. He thought that Tang Xuan's cultivation base got stuck at the quasi-immortal stage, so their negotiation power slightly shifted to Murong Qi's favor due to his bigger sect and influence. However, Tang Xuan broke the bottleneck and got stronger, which turned the situation in his favor. Murong Qi no longer had the power to force the Tang Clan to do his bidding anymore.\nTang Xuan also realized it. He pushed on.\n\"Get your vixens out of my property, too. We don't have enough rooms for your prostitutes!\"\n\"…\"\nAfraid of Tang Xuan's new strength, Murong Qi recalled his people outside of the manor. After everybody left, Tang Xuan shut the gates and locked the door.\nWithout a place to stay for the night, Murong Qi turned his attention to Leo's domain. He hesitated for a moment and made a decision.\n\"Let's rest in our ship for the night. We'll seek an audience with Florida Man tomorrow.\"\nThe dual cultivators behind Murong Qi were disappointed. As they failed to seduce the locals and drain their life force, they had no choice but to wait for tomorrow.\nThey hadn't realized yet that they hadn't paid the local taxes yet.\nOn the pylon tower, a pair of red eyes stared at the newcomers. The tax collector sized up Murong Qi and drooled.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"",

They crossed the domain's boundary and found a long and wide highway road.\nEverybody traveled on the road and admired the scenery. As soon as they inhaled the fresh air in this domain, their mind went blank for a few seconds. Like an innocent teenager inhaling the highest grade of cocaine, their iris expanded to the fullest.\n\"Wow!\"\n\"Holy cow!\"\nEverybody got high just by inhaling yin and yang Qi in the air. They fell in love with this place.\nAs they walked further, they found two tall apartments, where Amazonian Sanctuary's disciples and the Life Sword Sect's disciples resided. They stopped to gaze at the structures.\n\"What are those buildings? Are they new pagodas?\"\n\"That's definitely not a pagoda or a tavern. Should we get closer to check it out?\"\nSeveral girls were attracted to the big buildings. They imagined living there, and they were excited.\nMurong Qi coughed and reminded them of their mission.\n\"Stop being distracted. We'll seek an audience with the rumored lord of this place. If we manage to convince him, you girls might be able to move here. Don't forget your purposes.\"\n\"Okay!\"\nThe young dual cultivators giggled. They glanced at the local farmers in the southern fields and the wandering disciples north of the road.\n\"Huh?\"\nSoon, a few of the maidens noticed something odd. They found a few rough wooden cabins north of the apartments. However, they were made from black lumber.\nWhite smoke never stopped coming out from the chimneys. Several young men and women wearing white coats wandered in the area while carrying boxes of alchemy ingredients.\n\"Oh? They have an alchemy section over there!\"\nIt was common knowledge that any sect with an alchemy section was usually rich in cultivation resources. Many girls were delighted to see an alchemy department in this domain, and their expectations went up a tier.\nWalking further, the group came across three patio houses surrounded by fences and small gardens. They feathered at least three floors, and the building's materials were the same as the apartment.\nThe girls inwardly squealed. They believed that these houses belonged to the local nobles or rich merchants.\nWhile the fangirls drooled over the properties, one of the house owners opened the door and came out of his house.\nHe was none other than Gao Yan. He wore a white shirt, black pants, a pair of leather shoes, and a necktie like modern salarymen. He also carried a black suit on his arm and prepared to wear it on the job.\nGao Yan locked the door behind him and stretched, warming up and getting ready for farm work.\nAfter becoming a quasi-immortal, Gao Yan got taller. His collar shirt and black slacks partly hid his toned and lean muscle mass. Moreover, his face looked more mature and handsome. With a height of 6'2, 190 pounds of mass, and modern formal clothes, his appearance was unique and attractive.\nOver a hundred young girls dropped their jaws and salivated. They had never seen any young man so delicious. Like starving hyenas, many female cultivators panted and woofed at him.\n\"Handsome! Do you have a girlfriend?\"\n\"Gege. Can I volunteer to be your chambermaid?\"\n\"Handsome brother. What's your name? Do you live here alone?\"\nGao Yan frowned and gazed at the crowd. Upon noticing their vulgar expressions and gestures, Gao Yan wryly smiled.\n\"I'm sorry. I'm late for work. Also, I already have a lover.\"\nThora emerged from Gao Yan's shadow. She stuck out her tongue and flipped them with a middle finger. Unfortunately, none of them saw her.\nThe girls were crestfallen. However, no one gave up on Gao Yan.\nThis world's culture and tradition were different from the modern world. A man having three wives and four concubines was common. Thus, polygamy was well accepted.\nAs long as Gao Yan only had one lover, they still had a chance.\nOn the other hand, Murong Qi sweated profusely. He stared at Gao Yan in shock as he couldn't believe his eyes.\nThat young man had the same cultivation base as him!\n\"Young man.\" Murong Qi called Gao Yan.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"How old are you?\"\n\"Probably 17 in a few months? Why?\"\n\"…\"\nMurong Qi's face was ashen because of astonishment and shock. He couldn't believe that a super genius young man had been hiding in this place.\n'Situ Nantian, Yan Xiang! Both of you are foolish! You competed for supremacy and stole cultivation resources from countless clans, but you never scouted talented youths. Now, they are working for your enemies. Well, this explains your downfall. If you stop nurturing younger generations, your territory stops developing. Suit you right!'\nMurong Qi glanced at the woman's spirit behind Gao Yan. He also sensed that Thora was a sentient dao avatar, and her cultivation base was stronger than him. This alarmed Murong Qi.\n\"Ahem.\" Murong Qi coughed to calm his nervousness. \"Who is your mentor? Could I meet him?\"\nGao Yan snickered. \"I have many mentors here, senior. Which one would you like to meet?\"\n\"…The person that awakened your talent and taught you a cultivation method.\"\n\"Oh. If you mean the person who helped me the most, that's Lord Florida Man. He should be in his residence. If you go further down the road, you will find the general store building and the parking lot. Wait in front of the parking lot and call someone in black robes. They will guide you to him.\"\n\"Thanks, Junior. Also, is your dao avatar your fiance?\"\n\"Yes. Why do you ask?\"\n\"Ahem!\" Murong Qi grinned. He opened his palms and pointed at the young female cultivators behind him. \"My name is Murong Qi. I'm the sect master of the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect, and I've come here to find grooms for my disciples. I'm wondering if you have a plan of taking in some concubines or servants.\"\nGao Yan frowned. Without hesitation, he refused. \"I'm sorry. I wish to focus on cultivation and my job here. I have no time for romance. Also, as I said before, I already have a lover. One is enough for me.\"\n\"…I see. I envy your master.\"\nMurong Qi was taken aback that Gao Yan was more stoic and upright than he had thought. He admired the man even more.\nGao Yan excused himself and flew toward the southern farms. He had been skipping work long enough, and he felt bad for not helping his friends tending the farmlands.\nAfter Gao Yan had left, Murong Qi inhaled through his teeth. Nothing went according to his plans at all.\n'This Florida Man is too profound and mysterious. I can't take him lightly anymore. I don't think these girls can please him. I need another approach.'\nMurong Qi gestured for his people to walk further. But as they were about to resume their journey, a massive plant monster descended and landed in front of the group.\nThe purple chomper plant with the upper body of a young maiden stood before them. The plant's mouth smiled and uttered her catchphrase.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"???\"\nMurong Qi widened his eyes and gawked at the monster. Then, he looked around to ask the local people for help.\nUnfortunately, the local workers were used to the sight of Cat extorting nom-nom taxes from newcomers. None of them bat an eye.\nMurong Qi deeply inhaled and calmed down. He asked Cat.\n\"What's nom-nom?\"\nCat tilted her head and body to the side. She hated explaining her language to outsiders.\nSince the newcomers failed to understand her, Cat's joyous mood changed. Her bloodlust erupted as she mistook them as invaders.\n\"No Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"W-What's nom-nom? I don't understand!\"\nCat raised her tentacles and was about to crush everybody behind Murong Qi to meat paste.\nBANG\nSuddenly, someone kicked the door of his house open. A grumpy elder stomped out of his house while wearing only a pair of shorts.\nWu Buyi had been in the middle of a massage session. His smartphone still moaned and showed a sexy video of a naked 3D anime character dancing. Moreover, the pitched tent in his pants told many stories.\n\"DAMN CAT! THE ALARM IS OFF! THEY ARE NOT FOOD!\" Wu Buyi yelled at Cat.\n\"…Meow.\"\nCat was sad. She sulked and lowered her branches. Then, she turned around to head back to the pylon tower.\n\"Munya!\"\nFortunately, someone from above had been watching over her. A long stone tentacle slowly lengthened and descended from the flying island, carrying a large corpse of thunder caiman for her.\nCat was overjoyed. She took the corpse in glee and hopped back to the canyon river, where she normally hunted and collected food.\nThe Cathulhu Statue retreated his tentacle while Cat flew away. Murong Qi's group survived for another day.\nWu Buyi cackled. He turned around and glanced at the group of young female cultivators. Then, he spat.\n\"Stinky 3D pigs disgusting!\"\nBANG\nWu Buyi closed the door behind him. Then, he continued his private massage business.\nMurong Qi and his people were speechless. They stood there for a minute to digest all the information.\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS PLACE?!\"\nNone of them noticed Yao Qiqi, who had been watching them from the rooftop of the shopping mall. She muttered to herself.\n\"Welcome to Florida, senior.\"",

They admired the largest building in this place and stared at the glass elevator, which rose to the bottom of the flying island above.\n\"Wow.\"\nEven Murong Qi was amazed. He had never seen any building connect to a flying island before.\nThe girls and the servants were also distracted. They didn't notice that the shopping mall was open, and several commoners already entered the building.\nWhile the newcomers continued staring at the tall structure, a delicious scent of fried chickens came out from the mall and kicked their noses. Everybody came back to their senses.\n\"What a pleasant smell!\" One of the girls gulped.\n\"B-B-But hard food is forbidden! It's full of impurities. If we eat them, we will need to go to a lavatory when we cultivate!\"\n\"Grrr… I want to eat commoner's food…\"\nMore than half of the people rubbed their flat bellies. As everybody here relied on fasting pills or grain pills to fill their stomach, they missed the taste of good food.\nMurong Qi salivated, but he snapped back to his senses first.\n\"K-Keep going. We're not there yet.\"\n\"Ow…\"\nEverybody gazed at the shopping mall's entrance, unwilling to leave. They wished they could enter that place and check the mysterious food.\nEverybody traveled further west. Next to the shopping mall was another concrete building. Unlike the other structures, this place featured zero walls.\nStrangely, in front of the building, four handsome men with long pointy ears stood there, acting as guards. A dozen pretty elves also stood at the edge of the second floor's building, watching the people below.\nMurong Qi looked up and found teams of elves and white-haired people on every floor. They were stationed there as if they were protecting something inside.\nSeveral residents of the parking lot flew out of the building from the top floor. Coincidentally, the night shift workers clocked off and returned home. They landed on top of the parking lot. Then, they entered the building and returned to their RV home.\nUsing his Qi, Murong Qi observed how the workers went through the inspection process of the death knights on the top floor. After witnessing everything, he believed his group had reached the destination.\nMurong Qi approached one of the guards.\n\"Excuse me, fellow Daoist. I am the sect master of Joyous Yin-Yang Sect, Murong Qi. I would like to seek an audience with your leader. Could I ask you to tell him that?\"\nThe guards stared at Murong Qi's face and scanned his cultivation base. One of them let out a long sigh in disdain.\nLooking at their expressions, Murong Qi was annoyed. He also scanned their cultivation base. But upon doing so, he was in a rude awakening.\n\"!!!\"\nMurong Qi finally realized that he wasn't polite enough as these guards were all immortals. He couldn't measure their realms and their actual strength.\n'A-All of them are immortals?! W-What kind of place is this?! I-If immortals are Florida Man's gate guards, then how strong is he?!'\nMurong Qi's face lost all color. He didn't want to be here anymore.\n\"Sir Murong Qi.\" One of the death knights called his name. \"Please wait here. I'll go and inform His Majesty of your arrival.\"\n\"T-T-Thank you, senior.\"\nOne of the guards disappeared into the parking lot.\n.\n.\nEsen and Leo remained in their room. Although it was early morning, both husband and wife yawned as they hadn't slept a wink.\nAs Leo was tired, he took off his clothes and tugged into the bed.\n\"Good night. I'm gonna sleep till noon.\"\n\"…I'm also sleepy. Move a bit. Let me in, too!\"\nEsen threw away her clothes and got into the bed. They cuddled and were fast asleep.\nWhen Leo and Esen started snoring, Ivy entered the room. She collected the used clothes and placed fresh clean clothes near their bed. She then adjusted the blanket and left the room quietly.\nStanding in front of Leo's room, Ivy closed her eyes and meditated. She had already eaten the Floridian dantian pill, but she hadn't digested all the information and the memory fragments from the pill yet.\nHer aura twirled around her. Every minute passed, Ivy's mind experienced a month's worth of firearm training. Her dantian also accumulated more Qi, and her strength rose.\nWhile Ivy guarding her masters, one of the death knights came knocking on the bus's door. The other knights and liches came out to see the commotion.\n\"Sir, a large group of humans are seeking an audience with the Holy One. Could you please relay the word?\"\nThe liches nodded. They entered the bus and reached out to Ivy.\nAlthough Ivy's mind was still inside the sea of her consciousness, she still heard the voices in the real world. When the liches came closer to her, she opened her eyes.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Lady Ivy, some humans have come to visit the Holy One.\"\n\"He's unavailable at the moment. Tell them to come back in the afternoon.\"\n\"Is he busy?\" One of the liches wondered what Leo was doing inside.\n\"He's resting. He and Her Majesty spent all night cultivating. They need rest.\"\nThe liches grinned as they mistook Ivy's words. They thought that the husband and wife got busy the entire night, and they got exhausted in the morning.\n\"Understood. I'll go tell those people.\"\nThe liches exited the bus to relay Ivy's words to the death knight. However, they were blunt with their words.\n\"The Holy One and Her Majesty were intimated all night! They are sleeping, and they aren't welcoming guests at the moment. Tell them to come back in the afternoon!\"\nThe death knight was taken aback at first, but he quickly understood the lich's intention.\n\"Understood. I'll go tell the humans now.\"\n.\n.\nThe previous death knight returned to the front of the parking lot. When he arrived, Murong Qi's group was still there.\nThe death knight coughed and informed them by using his words.\n\"His Majesty Florida Man had intense sex last night, and he is exhausted. He is resting at the moment. Come back in the afternoon.\"\n\"…\"\nBecause the death knight's voice was loud and clear, everybody in the parking lot could hear it. The elves and white-haired men raised their eyebrows while the disciples froze on the spot.\nThe death knight's colleagues in front of the parking lot turned around and gave their friend a weird look. Everybody doubted that Leo did that with Esen.\nOn the other hand, Murong Qi saw hope. He was excited.\n'Finally! I don't believe that anybody's mind is clear and pristine like a virtuous saint! Every person at least has one or two dark sides or weaknesses! You're no exception, I see!'\nMurong Qi believed that Leo was weak against women or he was a lustful beast. Therefore, his ploy might work.\n\"Senior, could you tell Lord Florida Man that I also wish to give him gifts to express my goodwill? You see. I have a thousand young maidens right here. They have trained and cultivated in dual-cultivation techniques. Since your lord's hobby coincides with ours, he might…\"\nAll elves and white-haired people clicked their tongues in unison. The guard waved his hand.\n\"As I said, come back in the afternoon!\"\n\"T-Then, can I leave my gifts here, first?\"\n\"Take them back with you!\"\n\"O-Okay.\"\nMurong Qi smacked his lips as nothing went his way. He blamed his bad luck.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, a weird rumor circulated because of the guard. Several disciples overheard it and misinterpreted the words.\n\"Lord Florida Man had sex?\"\n\"Lord Florida Man did someone?\"\nThe rumor quickly spread throughout the domain. Then, the news reached Taxi's ears.\n\"Smash?\" (Oh, he and that broad smashed?)\nRicardo nodded in approval.\n\"SMASH!\" (Doesn't matter. They SMASHED!)\nBecause of their conversation, Sierra, who was assigned to be their caretaker, also misinterpreted the rumor.\n\"So Lord Florida Man milked Lady Esen?\"\n\"SMASH?!\" (WHAT?!)\n\"SMASH??\" (How come I haven't heard of this?!)\nSierra continued exaggerating the rumor unintentionally. \"I asked the lord to milk me, but he doesn't want to touch me. Since he touches Lady Esen, he might be planning to milk her?\"\n\"SMASH!!\" (HOLY HORSE!)\n\"SMASH?!\" (WHAT LOGIC! THIS IS A SCOOP!)\nThe horses circulated weird rumors to the badgers and the tamer girls. Soon, the words were twisted along the way.\n\"Lord Florida Man milk Lady Esen?\"\n\"Senior Florida Man drinks Lady Esen's milk?!\"\n\"Lady Esen has milk?!\"\n\"Lady Esen has BOOBS?!\"\n.\n.\nOn the flying island, Meowmeow, Mu-Nyang, and the wolf dully stared at the crowd below. They had a headache.\n\"Master is gonna get angry, munya.\"\n\"He is gonna be pissed for sure, woof!\"\nMeowmeow deeply sighed in resignation. He felt bad for Leo.\n\"I pray for you, master.

      "content": "Chapter 224 Florida Man Introduced New Career Choice to Female Teenagers – Lithium Miner.\nChapter 224 – Florida Man Introduced New Career Choice to Female Teenagers – Lithium Miner.\nLeo and Esen left their bus after a good sleep. Esen made her way to the white tree array to check on the formation. As for Leo, he hyped himself and planned to do some new quests.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 3/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 300,000 Years of Lifespan, One Selectable SR Building, Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 17, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 17, and Enable TOP-UP Feature.\nPhase Three Tasks (5/10 Completed)\n- Recruit at least 2,000 workers. (Done)\n- Complete at least one true fate crystal (0/1)\n- Successfully defend against an invasion from another player (0/1)\n- Successfully invade a player's home planet (0/1)\n- Embed a true fate crystal to a pylon tower (0/1)\n- Upgrade 20 buildings to level 15 (Done)\n- Upgrade shopping mall to level 15 (Done)\n- Get a girlfriend and fail NNN! (Done)\n- Manufacture at least 1,000 weapons using strategic resources. (491/1,000)\n- Recruit at least 100 immortals as your soldiers (Done)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nThe missions were tougher in this phase. Many quests seemed impossible for Leo at the moment. For example, Leo had no means of accessing or invading another player's home planet. In addition, the Earth Fate Crystal tutorial was still ongoing, and the progress was barely halfway to completion.\nHowever, nothing was impossible for Leo. As he had recently upgraded the shopping mall from level 10 to 15, his system unlocked many new buildings.\nLeo opened his domain system menu and browsed the list of the new buildings. Then, he widely grinned.\n.\nAltar of War\nGate Size (0/25)\nTransferable Personal (0/25)\nDistance (0/25)\nCooldown Timer (0/25)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCannot be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nTavern of Heroes\nHospitality Worker Automaton (0/25)\nTavern Size (0/25)\nMax Visiting Friends (0/25)\nAccommodations (0/25)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCan be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nMilitary Boot Camp\nDrill Sergeant Automaton (0/25)\nCamp Capacity (0/25)\nFacilities (0/25)\nTraining Speed (0/25)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCan be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nLife Force Casino\nHospitality Worker Automaton (0/25)\nFacility Quality (0/25)\nSecurity (0/25)\nAccommodations (0/25)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCan be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nFate Crystal Radar\nOperator Automaton (0/50)\nDetection Range (0/50)\nPrice – 1,000 YOL\nCannot be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nThese five buildings were the highlight of the newest upgrades. Aside from these new buildings, the rest were alchemy workshops, warehouses, granaries, farms, a new apartment, and small houses that Leo already had.\nLeo rearranged the granaries in his domain. He pressed the [Move] button and grouped them behind the shopping mall so that the land behind Gao Yan and Wu Buyi's houses was empty. Then, he erected new houses and an apartment in the area and upgraded them to level 15.\nRUMBLE\nInstantly, buildings appeared out of thin air and firmly occupied the elevated hardened ground.\nLeo didn't stop there. He erected new warehouses and granaries to increase his storage rooms. Two new farms extended to the west and east of the southern agriculture district. Moreover, two alchemy workshops were added to the shopping mall's fifth floor.\nAfter Leo had completed the minor buildings, he moved on to the main course. He started with the facilities that could be added to the shopping mall first.\nLife Force Casino, Military Boot Camp, and Tavern of Heroes appeared on the fourth floor, occupying the rooms next to the time chamber.\nAs usual, these facilities looked small from the outside. But after Leo had upgraded them to level 15 and allocated some points, the interior expanded, which was capable of hosting a thousand visitors at once with ease.\n.\nTavern of Heroes Level 15\nHospitality Worker Automaton (3/25)\nTavern Size (5/25)\nMax Visiting Friends (2/25)\nAccommodations (5/25)\n.\nMilitary Boot Camp Level 15\nDrill Sergeant Automaton (3/25)\nCamp Capacity (10/25)\nFacilities (2/25)\nTraining Speed (0/25)\n.\nLife Force Casino Level 15\nHospitality Worker Automaton (3/25)\nFacility Quality (5/25)\nSecurity (5/25)\nAccommodations (2/25)\n.\nThe upgrade cost of these three facilities was painful. One level cost 10,000 years of lifespan. Thus, raising everything to the max level required 450,000 years of lifespan.\nLeo didn't fret as he had plenty to squander. He was no longer scrapped for a year of lifespan like in his early days as his side hustler business got more popular during these few days.\nMore migrating commoners continued to show up and moved to the west slum district. The town's size continued to expand, and the outskirts of the town already reached the outer gate of the Magpie City. As new people showed up, they got interested in Leo's shopping mall and became his customers by default.\nIn addition, the people from the Tang Clan were richer than the commoners. They always queued in front of the supermarket section and waited for the new batch of poison grain pills or poison liquid to enter the shelves. Then, they always purchased them all.\nWith these guys around, Leo didn't need to work as hard as in the past. He just needed to expand and maintain the order around here.\nUnfortunately, Leo didn't get to enjoy his SIM session for long. While he was playing with the system, one of the death knights approached Leo and informed him of the visitors.\n\"Your Majesty. A quasi-immortal has brought many young mortals here to see you. He said something about giving you a gift as a tribute.\"\n\"A new customer? Well, where are they? Guide me to them!\"\nLeo was enthusiastic as he never hated new rich customers. He wondered how many cultivators he could scam on this occasion.\n.\n.\nMurong Qi and his people still lingered in front of the store. Some of them eyed the floating crystal tower behind the parking lot, which was the source of the yin-yang Qi in this domain.\nEverybody secretly cultivated and absorbed Qi from the environment. Even though the death knights forced them to wait here for hours, none of them complained. After all, the dense Qi in this area was thicker and better than the mystic realms that they had been.\nWhile everybody cultivated in earnest, one of the death knights called them over.\n\"His Majesty Florida Man is here! Kneel and pay respect to the Holy One!\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nMurong Qi and his followers were taken aback that the elf identified his lord as a king or an emperor.\nHad it been normal circumstances, Murong Qi would have never bowed to others. However, the elf was an immortal. Murong Qi had no power to argue or protest.\nObediently, Murong Qi knelt on one knee and cupped his fist. He lowered his head the same way he paid respect to Yan Xiang.\nSeeing their sect leader kneel, his followers copied him. Everybody behind Murong Qi paid respect to Leo.\n\"Murong Qi and his followers greet Your Majesty! May you be healthy and live in prosperity for 10,000 years!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo wasn't used to being treated as an emperor. He coughed to hide his nervousness and embarrassment.\n\"Ahem! Are you moving here like Tang Xuan and others as well? Or are you here to visit my store? What's your name?\"\nMurong Qi looked up and gazed at Leo's face. He tried to measure Leo's cultivation base.\nUnfortunately, no matter how Murong Qi looked into it, Leo's aura was no different from a soul formation cultivator or other mortals. He doubted that was Leo's true strength.\n'I see. He must have hidden his true cultivation base. An able rich man never flaunts his wealth! A true expert never shows his strength. This must be the case.'\nMurong Qi introduced himself and got to the point.\n\"I'm the sect master of the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect, Your Majesty. The reason I'm here is that I wish to come and pay homage to the new lord. I've also brought you some gifts as a tribute.\"\nMurong Qi looked back and showed him his followers. A thousand pretty maidens behind him looked up and beamed Leo with a bright smile.\n\"These girls are the finest disciples of my sect! I would like to offer them to you, Your Majesty. They are good at housework, chores, and… bed work. I'm sure you will like them-\"\nBefore Murong Qi could finish his sentences, Leo rolled his eyes and interrupted him.\n\"Send those bitches back to the lithium mine they belong. We don't welcome underage prostitutes here. Only underage miners and farmers are allowed!\"\n\"…Eh?\"",

He thought that Leo was into women and pleasure. However, his words contradicted the rumor.\nLeo snorted and stared at the young girls.\nEverybody wore skimpy and revealing clothes, showing a lot of skin. They also put on thick perfume and makeup, which was not something that tamer girls in his domain would do.\nEven if Leo's mind and IQ were below average, he was wise enough to differentiate between innocent maidens and prostitutes. Thus, he didn't trust these newcomers.\n\"If you're here as customers, I welcome you. But if you're here to ask for a job, get some proper clothes first. Also, those underage girls smell like puke. Tell them to take a bath at least once a day.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Your servants also have a foul odor. I can smell their dried sperm from a mile away. When was the last time you people took a bath? A month ago?\"\nMurong Qi broke a sweat. He looked behind him and noticed the unique odor of his disciples.\nAs their sect was located in the northern region, the weather was usually cold and dry. Thus, the natives rarely took a bath to conserve water. Only stronger cultivators who cultivated water elements took a bath daily. As for the disciples and cultivators under the 3rd stage, it would be a miracle if they took a bath once a month.\nIn short, they smelled like a horse stable mixed with strong deodorant and perfume.\nMurong Qi bitterly laughed. He waved his hand and activated his dao avatar. A water domain appeared and enveloped his followers. A few seconds later, he removed the water dome and all the water droplets in their clothes.\nJust like that, Murong Qi partially cleaned his people. Still, the sensitive parts of their bodies were as dirty as before.\nLeo observed their interaction. He had a new inspiration.\n'I wish I had a public bathhouse like the one in Japanese anime. I guess I have to pray to the RNGesus god for gacha luck next time.'\nLeo waved his hand and parted them with a warning.\n\"Take them home for now. Come back when your followers become adults. But if you wish to purchase something from my store, you should at least take a proper bath first.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo moved on to the next job, leaving Murong Qi and his followers confused.\n.\n.\nAfter Leo had left, Murong Qi gritted his teeth. He was angry and humiliated that Leo didn't welcome him.\n'If you weren't an immortal, I would have killed you on the spot! How dare you humiliate me?!'\nIn a bad mood, Murong Qi ordered his followers to return to their ship. Everybody was disappointed that they had to go home.\nAlong the way to their ship, they passed the Tang Manor. Tang Xuan stood there in front of his home, watching Murong Qi leave.\nTang Xuan snickered and mocked him. \"I see that you've been kicked out. Sucks to be you, pervert.\"\n\"Tang Xuan! Has nobody taught you not to step on a fallen man?!\"\n\"For someone like you, I don't need to treat you with courtesy.\"\n\"…I'll remember this humiliation, Tang Xuan.\"\n\"Yeah. Keep thinking of me when you return.\"\n\"…\"\nMurong Qi's face reddened in anger. He swore that he would get back to Tang Xuan one day in the future.\nIn the end, the people of the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect returned empty-handed. Because of Murong Qi's temper, none of their followers got to visit Leo's store or purchase his elixir.\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nMeanwhile, ten light years away from Leo's planet, two artificial stars emerged from a white wormhole. Both stars gradually floated forward while the wormhole was closed.\nSeveral kilometers above the artificial stars was the cubic warship of the elves. They descended and extended docking corridors toward the stars to connect a pathway.\nCLICK\nThe square cube connected to the artificial stars. A few minutes later, passengers from the stars flew in the corridors toward the cubic ship.\n.\nAt the meeting room of the cubic ship, the ship's captain, Ingof Jack, gazed at the two commanders of the reinforcement. Although Jack had a lower cultivation base, the two werewolves bowed their heads and showed respect to the captain.\n\"Overlord Milo, reporting for duty.\"\n\"Overlord Max, reporting for duty.\"\nBoth werewolf commanders were the overlords of their artificial stars. Moreover, they served the divine elves as soldiers.\nOverlord Milo was a werewolf with messy black fur. As for Max, he had the face and skin of a grey pitbull, and he was more muscular than the former. Without hairy fur, he resembled a beastman instead of a Fenrir Werewolf.\nBoth overlords had the cultivation of the sage realm, which was a major realm higher than the deity realm. They also brought over a thousand deities and a million immortals.\nIngof Jack invited them to their seats.\nThe room featured a round table with a hologram screen at the center. Ingof Jack sat at the head of the table while the two overlords sat next to each other.\nJack operated the console in front of him, and the hologram image changed. It displayed the planet on which Leo resided.\n\"Gentlemen, I'll get to the point. As you've been briefed, our primary mission is to secure Princess Esen and kill her followers. Secondly, we need to investigate how Princess Esen removed the undead curse.\"\nThe hologram screen zoomed toward the planet. It highlighted the main continent.\nAs the hologram kept zooming in, it showed the Florida Domain. The flying island stood out as a mystic realm portal was active 24/7.\nJack continued.\n\"Unfortunately, the mission won't be easy. Our intel has discovered three guardians there. Our detector estimates that the guardian statues have the strength of a deity at the very least.\"\nMax scoffed. \"A deity isn't our opponent! We can just go there and stomp everybody!\"\nJack shook his head. He showed other images, which his satellites managed to capture. The hologram showed the figure of the black-winged angel statue.\n\"Although the guardian statues have the same strength as a deity, this statue resembles someone from the Kishin Clan.\"\n\"Kishin Clan? The Oni Clan?\"\nMax and Milo shuddered at the name of the Kishin Clan. They weren't fond of those samurais.\nJack raised a remote and pointed at the wall on the opposite side of the two werewolves. Then, the wall showed a photo of a black-winged angel with the same face as the statue.\n\"T-That man?!\" Max recognized him.\nJack gave them a piece of bad news.\n\"Gentleman. I don't know how that statue's face looks like Overlord Mao of the Devil Tribe, but you should be prepared for it. If possible, we will not directly assault that place. We are going to avoid the guardian statue so we won't accidentally provoke Overlord Mao of the Devil Tribe. Please don't forget that Overlord Mao and Overlord Kishin are sworn brothers. If one of them is provoked, the other will also move. Things will get complicated if they suddenly wage war against us.\"\n\"…\"\n\"I'll explain our strategy for the mission.\"\nJack continued to explain his plan. As for the two werewolves, they grumbled as they hated to see the black-winged angel's statue there.\nThey wished that the statue never existed.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Meowmeow, the black-winged angel statue gazed at the new stars. He raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips.\n\"Oh, boy. Two more stars appear. They're still out of range, though.\"\nMu-Nyang cackled. \"Why don't we invite our master to go there, munya? As long as he's around, we can use our full strength, munya!\"\n\"Not so fast. We probably won't need to move.\"\n\"Huh? Why, munya?\"\nMeowmeow's expression was solemn. He shifted his gaze toward another star, which strangely moved erratically. It traveled at the speed of a thousand light years per second, and it was heading toward their star system.\nLooking at the approaching anomaly, Meowmeow warned his colleagues.\n\"Call Kitten over. We might need his help. I think that guy found us.\"\n\"That guy, munya? Wait… THAT GUY?!\"\nMu-Nyang stopped smiling. He frowned and followed Meowmeow's gaze.\n\"I see, munya. It's that blasphemous crook that stole the prototype body, munya! That body was supposed to be our master's body, munya! We have to get it back!\"\n\"Yeah…\"\nMeowmeow narrowed his eyes. He rubbed his katana, waiting to get his revenge.\n\"That body should have been passed down to our master. Because of that bastard, our master struggled for 50,000 years in an incomplete vessel and was forced to endlessly evolve! He also lost his opportunity to ascend! I swear with my name. I'll drag your soul out and crush you!\"",

As for the other factory, it mass-produced 20 medium-grade elemental pills every ten minutes.\nThe quality of these pills was far inferior to the ones made by alchemy workshops. However, the production rate was second to none. Because of these factories, Leo had endless supplies of pills for his employees and customers.\nLeo wished he had more of them. He hoped the next gacha would bless him with more of these factories.\nAs Leo had promised Esen's subordinates, he reserved the Floridian dantian pills for the death knights, liches, and grim reapers. Until everybody got their pills, he would not put these items on the supermarket's shelves.\nHe stopped inspecting the facilities and checked on the land vehicle factory next.\nThis facility had been put on idle as Leo didn't have enough material or resources to supply this factory. After Immortalium ingots and goddess milkium ingots entered the shopping mall's inventory, the factory's workers transported all necessary materials into the facility and waited for Leo's instruction.\nLeo entered the factory. He opened the facility system and checked what he could build in there.\nDING\n.\nLand Vehicle Factory Level 15\nEngineer Automaton (2/20)\nTechnology (7/20)\nVehicle Quality (6/20)\nProduction Speed (0/20)\nCurrently Making: None\n.\nCurrent Buildable Vehicles\n- Motorcycles – Standard\n- Motorcycles – Scooter\n- Motorcycles – Sport Bike\n- Motorcycles – Motocross\n- ATV\n- 2-Door Pickup Truck\n.\nThe choices were limited as the building's technology was still level 7. However, the portraits of the vehicles seemed to be from the 90s, which didn't seem so bad.\nCurious about what the factory could do, Leo chose the vehicle that required the least materials – The scooter. As scooters were friendly to drive for beginners, Leo believed it might sell if he could upgrade it later on.\nThe factory only took one Immortalium ingot and the goddess milkium ingot. The factory's mannequins rushed down the elevator and fetched several large chunks of stones extracted from the quarry. Then, they hurled them on the factory's belt and operated the machines.\nRUMBLE\nSophisticated machines hummed. One of them injected strange Qi into the raw stones. Then, blocks of chrome-color ingots exited the machine and sat on the running belt. Each ingot was in a different size, and the belt machines sorted them.\nOne of the machines pushed the largest ingot to another belt, which brought the mineral to a pool of mercury-like liquid. The ingot fell into the pool and emitted a burning iron odor.\nA claw machine slowly lowered and grabbed the material in the pool. The claw was 9,999 times more precise than any toy claw machine in modern arcades. Thus, it had no issue pulling out the grey ingot.\nBut when it came out of the water, it was no longer an ingot anymore. Magically, the mysterious stone ingot turned into a frame of a scooter.\nThe claw machine brought it toward another pool of black water, where another machine had smelted and poured Immortalium and milkium liquid inside.\nThe black and white liquid moved as if it were sentient. The substances coated the bike's frame and seeped into the core of the mineral.\nWatching how the machine manufactured the bike's frame was mesmerizing for Leo. He spent 10 minutes staring at the machines in a daze before he came back to his senses.\nHe scratched his head and complained.\n'Damn. I see. This is why those factory videos on YouTube are so satisfying to watch.'\nLeo left the factory before he changed his mind. He only checked the timer to see when the bike would be finished.\n<Time Remaining: 49 Minutes, 33 Seconds.>\nIt was fast! This factory could potentially make 24 scooters every day! Although it was not comparable to modern factories, it was good enough for a factory with only two working mannequins.\nLeo strolled around the shopping mall to kill time. He waited for the bike to finish.\n.\nAn hour later, Leo returned to check on the first production of this factory. He found a humble grey scooter, which resembled the Honda Elite 250 in the 90s except for its chrome paint job.\nLeo was excited. He brought it out of the factory and tried starting its engine.\nUnfortunately, it had no fuel. The scooter's engine was silent.\n\"Aw. Do you still need gas? Too bad for you, I'mma upgrade you and make you use the MAGICAL QI instead of gas!\"\nLeo stroked the handles and tried to summon the system menu. As usual, the system menu showed up, displaying its name, level, and upgrade options.\nSimilar to the M16's case, the system allowed Leo to upgrade it to level 15, which was the maximum level of the shopping mall. In addition, the price of each upgrade was a measly 10 YOL!\n\"Hehehe. I see. If I make the items, the upgrade cost will be cheap! Then, this bike can be sold for some profits!\"\nLeo contemplated his business plan. As the bike cost him 140 YOL in total as he upgraded it to the max level, he needed to sell the price higher than regular pills. Moreover, the bike required special materials to make, so Leo had to add the material and production cost to the calculation.\n'To be honest, I can just sell them at a cost price. But I don't have to upgrade every bike to the max level, do I? I can just make it passable by changing them into a QI-EV bike. Then, I can set the price for cheaper… How about 300 YOL per basic unit? I can still charge my customers 50 YOL for each upgrade!'\nHe made his decision. He would test the bike and show everybody the new merchandise first. Then, he would experiment with lower-level bikes to see which was marketable.\n.\n.\nVROOOM\nA few minutes after Leo had brought out the bike, he drove it out of the shopping mall and laughed.\nThe vehicle entered the highway and sprinted toward the east, which led to the Tang Clan District. Workers and clan members on the road leaped out of the way in panic.\nLeo grumbled as the road became a walking street. He switched the vehicle's gear a notch. Then, it stunned everybody.\nThe scooter was flying!\n\"KAHAHAHAHA! A WHOLE NEW WOOOOOORRLD!\"\nLeo began singing Aladdin's song even though no woman was there to sing the female part. As no one was there to sing with him, he sang the female part himself. As a result, the song sounded weird. Combined with his tone-deaf voice, everything was horrible.\nWhile Leo flew with his bike, the people below looked up and watched him. But because of Leo's bad voice, everybody plugged their ears. Some of the commoners shed tears of pain and cringe because of the loud tone-deaf voice.\n\"DAMMIT! STOP SINGING!\"\n\"ARRRRGH! MY EARS!\"\n\"MAKE IT STOP!!\"\nAside from the people who hated Leo's singing voice, many cultivators speculated what Leo had done this time.\n\"What's that? A flying sword?\"\n\"That's definitely not a flying sword. It's more like a two-wheeled cart of a performer trope.\"\nMeanwhile, Tang Xuan noticed Leo's new toy and his obnoxious tone-deaf voice. He rubbed his temples while he tried to figure out what Leo was riding.\n\"Two wheels, strange frames, and that sophisticated engine… Is that a new personal flying ship? That looks very creative.\"\nWhile Tang Xuan admired the bike, young people from the Tang Clan drooled. Many teenagers who had never flown with their own power wondered if the new vehicle was a special flying ship or a flying artifact that they could use.\nSome of them gossiped.\n\"I heard the Cugatti Flying Sword was the top brand of flying swords. But that is different.\"\n\"It seems friendly to the users, too. Look at how Lord Florida Man sits on the small chair. If you can sit on a flying sword, wouldn't it make it easier to use?\"\n\"Indeed. Even people with balance issues might be able to use that!\"\n\"I wonder if it's for sale. I want one.\"\n\"Me, too.\"\n\"Me, three.\"\nMany cultivators prayed that Leo would put one of the artifacts on sale. They wished that the supermarket would put something different on sale on day.",

Government Officials Baffled How Armed Scooter Was More Destructive Than Million-Dollar Tanks.\nChapter 227 – Florida Man Equipped Scooter with Military-Graded Weaponry and Sold it to the Army. Government Officials Baffled How Armed Scooter Was More Destructive Than Million-Dollar Tanks.\nAfter testing the scooter, Leo returned to the shopping mall. He also put the vehicle for sale with a staggering price tag of 1,500 YOL.\nThe scooter was situated in the center of the shopping mall, next to the statue of Qiang Qiang, aka the four-armed mutant turned statue.\nA thousand commoners and cultivators gathered around the scooter and observed it from a distance. Nobody dared to touch it as they were afraid of Leo and the fountain statue, who glared at them.\n\"1,500 Years of lifespan? Wow! That's expensive! I don't even have a hundred!\" One of the commoners bitterly laughed.\nA cultivator, who was a former commoner a few days ago, also commented.\n\"A muscle-tempering realm cultivator has roughly 100 to 200 years to live. A 2nd stage cultivator like me can live past 200 years. I doubt weak cultivators can afford that.\"\n\"Yeah. Only a prominent figure like Chancellor Tang Xuan or the handsome genius Gao Yan can afford it. We can only look and dream.\"\n\"Fool! Ya'll just need to invest your lifespan into cultivation resources first! You pay 20 years of lifespan to buy a grain pill. Once you become a proper cultivator, you seek a mentor. After you secure a cultivation method, you can purchase essence stones for one year each. Then, you accumulate life force and grow stronger from there!\"\n\"…Sounds good. Doesn't work. No cultivator or sect around here exists anymore. The workers here don't accept disciples.\"\nThe spectators ran their mouths as usual. They speculated who would buy this artifact from Leo.\nSeveral minutes later, Leo brought another scooter out for a test drive again. The people in the mall only watched him from afar as they didn't want to hear his tone-deaf song again.\nAfter 10 minutes of test driving, Leo brought the bike back. He widely grinned and parked it near the first scooter. He then purchased a blank signboard from his system store and put it in front of the second bike.\nLeo wrote the price tag of the second vehicle, including its specs.\n.\nScooter Standard Edition (Level 2)\nPrice - 300 YOL\nMax Range – 300 Miles.\nTop Speed – 75 MPH\nIndestructible in Crashes\nRequire Spirit Stones to Refuel\nNo Weaponry\nLand Vehicle Only\n.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Only 300?\"\nThe spectators were surprised by the price reduction at first. Several cultivators got interested and approached the signboard to get a closer look.\nHowever, when they realized that the vehicle only operated on land, they were disappointed.\n\"A two-wheeled carriage?\"\n\"Isn't this a bit expensive?\"\nMany had a similar idea. But when their eyes noticed a certain line of description, they paused to think.\n\"Indestructible?!\"\n\"Wait, what?!\"\nLeo had been waiting for them to notice the advertised spec. He explained.\n\"I've tested this earlier. The vehicle can withstand a full-power attack of an immortal with ease. Actually, I doubt even gods can put a scratch on the engine or the body frame.\"\n\"!!!\"\nMany cultivators widened their eyes and turned their attention to the bike's body frame and its material. One of them braced for danger and touched the seat.\nIt was firm and sturdy. He then applied some force to the seat, testing its durability.\nBOOM\nSuddenly, the bike's body frame generated a shockwave and knocked the cultivator away. As for the bystanders, they only sensed some breezy wind.\nLeo grinned and wrote another line. While he was at it, he elaborated.\n\"This bike comes with a security system. If a stranger tries to harm it or steal it, it will generate a shockwave as a warning. If the thief tries to harm or steal the bike again, it will KILL the thief.\"\n\"WOW!!\"\nMany commoners, merchants, and weak cultivators were interested in this feature. As they were at the bottom of the food chain, they pursued security the most. Thus, a vehicle that was immune to thievery and damage seemed like an ideal investment.\nA group of commoner merchants whispered among each other. Then, one of them stepped forward and saluted Leo to ask him.\n\"Immortal Florida Man, sir. I have a question to ask. May we inquire you something?\"\nLeo nodded. \"Speak.\"\n\"About the payment, can multiple people contribute for the same item? For example, there are 30 of us, but no one has enough lifespan for it.\"\n\"Oh, you mean, your group wants to pool your lifespan to buy this scooter, right?\"\n\"Ah. You are very wise, sir. Yes, it is as you said. Each of us will contribute 10 years of lifespan. With that, we have 300 years of lifespan to purchase the vehicle.\"\n\"I see no problem with that. We have a deal!\"\n\"THANK YOU, SIR!\"\nAll 30 commoner merchants were overjoyed. They planned to use the vehicle to replace the horses for their carriage since it seemed stronger than regular horses.\nLeo collected their lifespan and gave them the keys. He also taught the group how to operate the bike. He went as far as teaching him how to drive it.\nSome of the observing commoners salivated. The trade earlier gave them inspiration.\nMany traveling vendors and merchants from other affiliates rushed back to the west slum to inform their colleagues. However, the local cultivators were unfazed.\n\"It's just a land carriage. What's the big deal?\" One of the local workers chatted with his friends.\n\"For us, it's no big deal. But for the merchants who often travel across the mainland, this vehicle can be extremely useful. Besides using it to replace horses, I think they plan to use this as an emergency shield against robbers.\"\n\"No. You have no clue. This artifact is totally different from horses. If they use this to travel, they won't even need to rest. They can just keep on going until the passengers are tired.\"\n\"Right. There's that… Such innovation!\"\nEverybody glanced at the first bike, wondering if they should pool their YOL to purchase it.\nMeanwhile, Leo had been listening to their little gossip and conversations. He walked toward the first bike and rewrote its specs and descriptions.\n.\nScooter Performance Edition (Level 15)\nPrice – 1,500 YOL\nMax Range – 69,420 Miles\nTop Speed – 1,200 MPH\nIndestructible in Crashes\nRequire Driver's Qi to Refuel\nArmed with Anti-Immortal Saw Blades and Protection Barrier.\nFlyable\n.\n\"HMM?!\"\nThe specs were drastically different than the standard version. This time, the local workers were interested in the investment.\n\"Lord Florida Man, what's the anti-immortal saw blades?\" One of them noticed the weaponry of the vehicle.\nLeo snickered and activated the bike. He rode on it and flipped a red switch on the left handle.\nFour robotic arms extended from the sides of the vehicle. At the tip of the arms, giant white saw blades intimidated the crowd with their sharp and nasty teeth.\nVRRRR\nThe saw blades rotated while the robot arms moved around, searching for a target to slice.\n\"AAAAHHH!!\"\nThe spectators panicked and pushed everybody in the back away, escaping from danger.\nLeo stopped the saw blade function and widely grinned. He explained.\n\"As you can see, it is armed with four saw blades. This world is wild, and danger is everywhere. These blades will help you during your travel.\"\n\"…Wow. W-What about the protection barrier-\"\nWHOOM\nLeo activated the barrier. He then invited the local workers to try their luck.\n\"This is another feature of this bike. When you feel you are in danger, you can activate the barrier by consuming the battery's energy. Also, I doubt any immortal can destroy this barrier. Anybody wants to test it out?\"\n\"…\"\nNo mortal or commoner dared to challenge the barrier. They looked at each other in reluctance.\nWhile everybody hesitated, a voice came from behind the crowd.\n\"Let me try!\"\nThe crowd parted ways for the challenger. Everybody looked at the person in front of the store.\nThe person was none other than Tang Xuan. He came here to see the commotion.\n\"Ah, welcome. Come. Have a try.\"\nTang Xuan nodded. As he had just ascended and became an earth celestial immortal, he wanted to test his full power on something. Leo's vehicle came at a great time.\nThe bystanders moved away from the barrier and Tang Xuan. As for the challenger, he rubbed his fist for a moment and threw a straight punch.\n\"HA!\"\nBANG\nThe punch hit the surface of the blue barrier. It caused a slight ripple, but the fist failed to pierce through the outer layer.\nThe spectators were speechless. They were aware that Tang Xuan had just recently advanced to the first stage of the immortal realm, but the guy couldn't even do anything to the barrier.\n\"…Wow.\"\n\"If I have that…\"\n\"This artifact…\"\nThe local workers stared at the bike with red eyes. Their hearts yearned for this vehicle as it represented safety and social status.\nLeo observed his potential customers. He then announced.\n\"The line of production is underway. Every hour, I'll bring in a new bike. There will be multiple editions of them as well. But if anybody wishes to place an advanced order or reserve your vehicle, you can come and talk to me or the other cashiers in front of the supermarket. Then, I'll quickly touch up the bikes and deliver them to you!\"\nEverybody gulped. Even Tang Xuan stared at the bike and salivated.\nWithout hesitation, Tang Xuan made his decision.\n\"I want that bike you're riding!\"",

Florida Man Brought Out Restored WWII M4 Sherman Tank From His Garage and Destroyed Their RVs.\nRUMBLE\nThe fleet of artificial stars and a cubic warship traveled in a single-file formation, moving toward Leo's planet. One of the fake stars deployed a hundred shuttle pods, which made their way to the planet's atmosphere.\nTheir mission was to infiltrate this world and secure a safe landing site for their carriers and their battleships.\n.\n.\nOverlord Milo concealed his cultivation base and used an artifact to shapeshift into a male human with pale skin. The other Fenrir werewolves were also in disguise.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nA hundred shuttle pods landed at the ruin of Cauliflower City. Another hundred claimed the Frozen Fire City while the rest landed on the surface of the sea.\nOverlord Milo came out of his shuttle. He looked around and found nothing but burnt houses and destroyed buildings.\n\"The Qi here is quite thin and dirty. As expected of a lair of Nu'Earthe trash!\"\nMilo collected the spacecraft into his spatial ring. His soldiers also hid their transportation and regrouped with their leader.\nThe overlord gave his men a new order.\n\"As I have briefed you on the mothership, Overlord Mao is on his way to this planet. We don't know what he's here for, but we will avoid a direct confrontation with him. If he comes here to fight, we'll let him do whatever he wants with the Nu'Earthes. But if he demands Princess Esen, we will kill her first and let him have her corpse.\"\nThe soldiers took a mental note. They understood why the overlord wanted Esen dead in the scenario.\n\"No hostage, right?\"\n\"Yeah. Princess Esen is a criminal. We will not allow Overlord Mao to use her as a bargaining chip. Kill her, and we will announce to the universe that he did it.\"\n\"Roger that.\"\nThe werewolves grinned. They believed that they had everything under control.\nUnfortunately, they were mistaken. A few seconds later, every werewolf on the mainland and in the sea heard the sound transmission of a certain someone.\n[Hohoh? Plotting against me? Sure. Go ahead. Kill whoever you want, but I'm gonna take down your motherships first and strand you on this planet. How about that?]\nOverlord Milo and his soldiers were stunned. Their legs froze in fright as they knew who the speaker was.\n\"OVERLORD MAO!!!\"\nOverlord Mao was infamous for his cruelty and ruthlessness. In the past 10,000 years, he personally destroyed seven galaxies and enslaved a trillion female humanoid creatures. Moreover, his status as a supreme entity intimidated his peers. Even Overlord Xiaomao and Overlord Lucky avoided confronting him.\nThis devilish overlord went into hiding after he married the sister of the Oni Clan's patriarch. Every overlord was relieved that the devil disappeared.\n[At first, I was planning to take a quick look. You know what? I've changed my mind. You will do exactly as I'm telling you to do. Refusing to do so, the Devil Tribe and the Kishin Clan will declare war with you and your snotty long-eared masters. I'm sure Overlord Xiaomao and his pet Cathulhus will gladly ally with me!]\nOverlord Milo panicked. \"Sir! Senior Mao! Please forgive our transgression! It was a misunderstanding! That was all a joke!\"\n[A joke? Ha! Had I never noticed, you would have proceeded with our stupid plans and framed me for the crime I didn't do? You puppies never change.]\n\"I-I-I'm so sorry, senior! It wasn't our intention! W-W-We're here for a mission. Once we finish what we planned to do here, we'll leave quietly!\"\n[Hah! Too late for that. Now, stop talking, and let me think.]\n\"…\"\n[Yeah, I know what I'm gonna do. Call all your troops, including the guys in the motherships. Tell everybody to raid this planet and destroy it. Leave no one alive!]\nThe werewolves sensed a chill running down their spines. They knew that Overlord Mao had quite a temper, but they never expected him to order them to initiate a genocide.\nStill, the order aligned with their missions and ideology. The werewolves had no issue complying.\n\"Understood. We'll inform the motherships about your order, senior.\"\n[Good! Show me what you can do.]\n.\n.\n\"I see.\"\nIngof Jack and Overlord Max received the sound transmission from Milo. They let out a long sigh as they understood the situation.\n\"Change of plans. We'll begin our full-scale assault. Deploy the Planetary Core Evaporator!\"\nThe crew got busy. Everybody sat at their station while the weapon operators authorized the usage of the planet-destroying cannon.\nThe warship charged up an energy in front of its ship. An array formation formed, stabilizing the condensed energy.\n.\nOn the flying island, Meowmeow, Mu-Nyang, and the wolf statue widened their eyes as they sensed a crisis.\n\"Activate the FUCK OFF laser!\"\n\"Aye, aye, munya!\"\n\"On it, woof!\"\nThe guardians raised their arms, tentacles, and paws. An energy formation was erected to match the cannon's condensing energy. However, the energy-gathering speed was faster than the warship.\nWithin a minute, the guardians finished drawing the local Qi and Leo's Qi to the defensive array. Then, they activated it.\nA massive rainbow lightning beam was unleashed. The target was none other than the cubic ship.\nAs if the cubic ship detected the counterattack from the planet. The warship unleashed the cannon before the energy was fully charged. A black lightning beam was fired to intercept the incoming beam.\nBoth beams collided!\nAs soon as both energies made contact, it caused a massive shockwave. However, the shockwave was directed toward the cubic warship. Moreover, the rainbow lightning beam devoured the black lightning beam and made its way toward the spaceship.\nA barrier of the cubic ship was instantly erected before the shockwave hit it. The shockwave bounced off and caused the black barrier to tremble.\nBOOOM\nHowever, the rainbow beam instantly shattered the barrier upon impact. It pierced through the cubic warship and left behind a 3km-diameter gaping hole.\nDebris, components, crewmates, and random objects were sucked out of the ship and floated freely in the void. Many werewolves tried to scream, but no word could come out of their mouth.\nWeak immortals struggled to swim the void back to the ship. However, deities and stronger immortals leisurely used their Qi and made their way toward the artificial stars nearby.\nAlthough the cubic ship was severely damaged, the hull and its components quickly mended as if it were a living being. Within a minute, the damage vanished.\nAt the same time, a hundred smaller battleships and ten thousand unmanned jets flushed out of the cubic mothership. The artificial stars also revealed their spaceports and launched their warships.\nOver 30,000 jets and 1,000 battleships of various sizes turned into a net, which covered the stars. They rushed toward the planet.\nMeowmeow frowned. He gestured to his three concubines.\n\"You three, help us intercept the small battleships. As for you, cat and dog, go and take out the death stars. I'll take care of their flagship… and Mao Miaomiao!\"\n\"Roger, munya!\"\n\"On it, woof!\"\nAll guardian statues vanished.\nWhile the mortals in the Florida Domain enjoyed their slow life, a war between entities broke out.",

Floridians Gathered to See the WWII’s Tanks in Combat.\nChapter 229 – Tank Fight Ensued as Tourists Whose RVs Were Destroyed by Florida Man's Tank Brought Panzer Tank for Revenge. Floridians Gathered to See the WWII's Tanks in Combat.\nRUMBLE\nThe sky rippled while the Qi in the air trembled. Leo, Esen, and the former undead flinched as they sensed the changes in the environment.\nLeo looked up and narrowed his eyes. As his sight was enhanced, he could see beyond the star system. He quickly found the three motherships and ten thousand jets and spaceships.\n\"God damn. Darth Vader would have been shocked if he saw this.\"\nLeo rubbed his fists and was about to fly toward the incoming jets and battleships.\n'Master, let us handle this. You should protect the people around you.'\nThe voice of Meowmeow echoed in Leo's mind. The latter paused and uttered in response.\n\"Can you take all of them alone?\"\n'No. But your domain's safety should be the priority. If your shopping mall is destroyed, your system will consider you as a loser, and the domain system will be erased.'\n\"What?!\"\n'The PVP and war features are active. Some of the players are also present, so your buildings are very vulnerable right now.'\nLeo remembered this. He lowered his arms and stopped the thought of going to space.\n\"How far can my shopping mall take on the attack of the outsiders? Is there HP that I have to be wary about?\"\n'The shopping mall is sturdy. At level 15, it can withstand three 5-star deity's attacks. Further than that, some parts may be damaged or destroyed. Also, if the building collapses, it's over.'\nLeo nodded. He looked back at the shopping mall, which was the heart of his domain.\n\"No choice, huh?\"\n.\nVRRRRRRRR\nA loud siren sounded everywhere in the Florida Domain. Leo's voice also mixed in with the ringing noise, warning the workers and the local population.\n\"We're under attack! I repeat, we are under attack! For the sake of safety, please take shelter in the shopping mall. For combatants and employees of Florida Domain, gather on the rooftop and bring out your arms! Prepare for battle!\"\nWhile talking to a microphone, Leo directed his employees to the staff elevator and fire exit, sending them to the deepest underground floor of his shopping mall. It would serve as a protective bunker for the non-combatants.\nGao Yan, Jin Yong, Tang Xuan, Hua Jiashan, and the elders gathered as Leo had requested. Even Han Hao, Han Meng, and the people who entered the time chamber yesterday also joined them.\nTaxi, Ricardo, and Sierra assembled on the flying island as they would act independently. As for Esen and her team, they gathered on the top floor of the parking lot, forming the second immortal unit.\nThe commoners from the west slum seemed confused as they couldn't see the battle in space. Still, they obediently followed Leo's instructions and entered the shopping mall.\nThis was their first time entering the mall's restricted area. They walked down the stairs and gathered at the B5 floor.\nThe underground parking lot area was dimly illuminated by the ceiling LED lights. The air was slightly warm as the air ventilation was the worst here. Fortunately, Leo activated a portal, which connected to an empty warehouse. After that, the air circulation improved, and people could breathe.\nSheltering over 10,000 people in a short period wasn't an easy task. Women, children, and elderly people mixed in the crowd, which slowed the progress.\nWhile Leo was busy managing the crowd, the sky brightened. Countless shooting stars descended from space, beelining toward Leo's domain.\nLeo pulled out his pistol and was about to shoot at the falling stars.\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nTaxi's team made their moves first. They transformed into humans and armed themselves with Leo's newest weapon – The M16. They unleashed bullet hell upon the descending fighter jets from space.\nBlack lasers and beams flashed. Most of them missed the targets. But when they hit, the target exploded.\nHowever, they failed to shoot down all spaceships and jets. Within 10 seconds, the jets broke the formations and circled around Leo's domain. They also retaliated with their charged Qi bullets.\nOne of the bullets came from Taxi. The pony in Johnny Sin's appearance smirked and activated a defensive domain.\nCLANK!\nThe bullet hit the domain barrier and shattered it instantly!\n\"SMASH?!\" (WHAT?! HOW?!)\nThe bullet grazed Taxi's shoulder. He also reverted to his thunder unicorn appearance as he suddenly couldn't use his Qi.\nLeo saw everything happening with his eyes. Upon noticing that Taxi got pushed back by just one of the alien jets, he took things seriously. He pulled out the Floridian Staff. Then, he ejected the purple bones of deceased Molg Tribesmen.\n\"Ancestors, protectors, and warriors of the past, your children and descendants are being bullied by immortals, deities, and unknown creatures from outer space. If you still love them, answer my call! COME!\"\nFor the first time in the real world, Leo activated the necromancy power that he had learned from Esen's shadow.\nA purple aura formed around the bones. Every piece of bone floated in the air and regenerated the lost parts. Out of the 10,000 bones that Leo had collected, 3,000 managed to form a skeleton body. As for the rest, they didn't change.\n3,000 skeleton soldiers answered Leo's call!\nLeo pursed his lips and glanced at the 7,000 purple bones. He believed that their souls might have already been reincarnated as he didn't sense any connection with them.\n'I guess I can only use them in alchemy. As for these guys…'\nLeo waved his hands and used another art of necromancy on them.\n'Blessing of darkness.'\nAll skeleton soldiers changed color from purple to black. They also grew one meter bigger and larger. Moreover, their aura exuded the air of true immortals!\n\"Go! Take down those annoying flies!\"\nThe skeletons clattered their jaws and leaped to the sky. Without a weapon, they threw punches and kicks at the fighter jets that they managed to catch.\nAll captured jets exploded in one hit. Instantly, 500 jets were crushed.\nHowever, the enemy wasn't planning to sit around and let Leo's minions kill them all. The unmanned jets also fired physical bullets and beams at the flying skeleton soldiers.\nBlack explosions erupted and shattered a thousand skeleton soldiers in the sky!\nLeo squinted his eyebrows and raised his staff. He recalled one of Esen's skills that could be applied in this situation.\n\"Mandate of Death Legion. You are not allowed to die the second time!\"\nRUMBLE\nAn invisible domain expanded with Leo at the center. The dome covered everything in Florida Domain.\nThe destroyed skeleton soldiers froze in mid-air. They reattached and regenerated their lost parts and self-resurrected. Upon coming back to life, they howled and manifested dark armor, swords, and shields. Rainbow flame eyes were ignited within their eye sockets.\nThe skeleton soldiers evolved into death knights!\nThe newly emerged death knights returned to battle. Each fighter activated the unique domain abilities that they once had.\nThousands of domain energy domes overlapped. The next moment, jets exploded one after another.\nThe surviving skeleton soldiers also evolved into death knights. They paused to check the situation for a moment. Then, they started chasing after a larger battleship in the sky.\nAbove the flying island, a flat spaceship with a thousand eyeballs underneath descended from the atmosphere. All eyes glared at Taxi, Ricardo, and Sierra.\nSuddenly, their eyes moved around and fixated on the approaching death knights. Each eye acted as a magic cannon, generating an elemental essence bullet.\nA thousand balls of energy bullets were ejected from the eyeballs and rushed toward the death knights.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe energy balls shattered the death knights and broke their bones to pieces.\nLeo hopped on the flying island to oversee the combat. Upon seeing how his creation was destroyed, he tried to resurrect them again.\nBANG\nA bullet from a jet directly hit Leo's forehead! His head tilted backward.\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nA hundred bullets rained upon Leo as the previous jet focused its gun on him. Many bullets hit his chest, legs, arms, and head.\nLeo clicked his tongue. He pointed his staff at the annoying fly and pressed on the trigger.\nTATATATATATATATATA\nThe staff of Floridian Singularity unleashed its power. A thousand rainbow bullets shot out from the tip and followed the spaceships in the sky like homing missiles and caught them.\nA thousand explosions of fireworks ensued. Two of which also hit the newly arrived battleship with a thousand eyes.\nAfter the explosion, the battleship looked like something had eaten its hull. The ship was engulfed in flame from the inside and slowly descended to the ground.\nLeo pursed his lips and glanced at the shot-down battleship. He sensed a thousand life signatures in there, and he doubted that they would die in a crash.\nHe came up with an idea.\n\"Taxi.\"\n\"Smash?\" Taxi popped a healing pill into his mouth. He then yawned as the side effect kicked in.\n\"… You take a break. Ricardo, lead your people to clean up the fallen battleship. Be wary of their weapons since they also use guns like us.\"\n\"Smash!\" Ricardo saluted. He then gestured for his people to follow him.\n\"Sierra!\" Leo wasn't done yet. \"You will be in charge of a field infirmary. Take this idiot to the shopping mall's B3 or B4 floor and let him rest there. When you're done, come up and secure injured fighters of our domain. Bring them to the same floor and repeat. Got it?\"\nSierra nodded, but her next question gave Leo a headache.\n\"Understood. By the way, do you need a break and drink my breast milk, master?\"\n\"…\"",

Everybody was so astonished that they had goosebumps.\nIvy smirked and rallied her colleagues.\n\"Are you going to cower here and let His Majesty do all the work?! What are we, freeloaders? Are your necromancy skills for show?\"\n\"WHAT?!\" The former undead warriors were offended. \"WHAT DID YOU SAY, IVY?!\"\n\"I'm saying we shouldn't be sitting here idly! Let's follow the lord and get rid of those invaders!\"\nExcept for Esen and Beatrice, everybody's expressions turned dark. As their passion was ignited, their killing intent soared.\nSeizing this momentum, Ivy asked permission from Esen.\n\"Your Majesty, let's go and help His Majesty!\"\nEsen lightly snorted. She waved her hand. \"Go. But leave Beatrice and Marc here.\"\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty!\" Ivy turned around and shouted, \"YOU HEARD HER, BOYS! MOVE OUT!\"\nThe 100-man unit took flight. Each carried an M16 with them, and they flew in an arrow formation, heading toward one of the descending battleships.\nThe battleship reacted to their approach. All cannons and guns pointed at them and unleashed bullet hell.\nAs energy bullets rained from the sky, the former undead warriors pointed their rifles at the incoming energy cannon balls and pulled the triggers.\nBlack lightning lasers flashed and pierced through the approaching energy balls, detonating them upon contact.\nThe elves didn't stop there. Even though they were astonished by the firepower, they kept firing at the battleship's deck and cannons. Some of the laser beams pierced through the hull, but a few hit the citadel. A chain reaction ensued as explosions erupted.\nThe team didn't celebrate after shooting down the entire gigantic spaceship. They frowned as they noticed several thousand crewmates flying out of the battleships while carrying guns, swords, spears, canes, and rocket launchers.\nA thousand colorful domain domes expanded and overlapped with the other domains. Then, the elven immortals revealed their power.\n\"SOUL DOMAIN, RESTRAINTS!\"\n\"SOUL DOMAIN, QI SEAL!\"\n\"SOUL DOMAIN, FEEBLE!\"\nA soul domain was an exclusive power of immortals. When activated, everybody in the domain besides the caster and their allies would be affected without fail. The only way to escape Soul Domain's range and abilities was to have a superior cultivation base or unique artifacts.\nDebuff magic caught Ivy and her team. Everybody suddenly felt sluggish as they couldn't use Qi. Moreover, they had a hard time breathing.\nStill, none of the debuff domain abilities disabled their ability to pull the gun's triggers. While falling, they aimed at the casters and fired.\nBANG\nBANG\nBANG\nEven without Qi, the default bullets still transformed into black laser beams. A hundred lasers flashed and hit a hundred targets in unison.\nThe shot crewmates didn't even realize what had hit them. Their bodies and their souls were disintegrated into dust because of the black tribulation thunderbolts.\nAfter the 100 elven crewmates vanished, a hundred domains lost their effects. Ivy's platoon recovered some of their strength.\nIvy commanded the team. \"Death knights! Switch weapons to death swords! You will target their domains and destroy them! As for others, avoid using a domain during chaos!\"\nTargeting the domes was one of many strategies to kill an immortal. If a soul domain was forcefully destroyed, the caster would naturally be hit with a backlash. They would lose half of their Qi in their dantian and have their inner organs crushed by the backlash pressure.\nIvy had a lot of experience in battlefields. In a chaotic fight where many people were involved, using any domain ability was the same as offering their heads to their enemies to shoot. Naturally, their domains would be the first to be targeted as it was easier to destroy.\nHowever, the crewmates lacked battle experience. They used their domains too soon.\nCLANK\nSHING\nThe death knights dispersed and brought out their black swords. They slashed at the empty air in front of them. However, each slash shattered the air in front of them. Like shattered glasses, several layers of the domain collapsed. Only the outer layers of wider energy domes remained.\nOver 500 elves that had abandoned the battleship vomited blood in unison. They fell from the sky like mosquitoes being sprayed with pesticides.\nUnfortunately, Ivy's opponents weren't just the crewmates from a battleship. Two more battleships followed the destroyed one and sprayed bullets at them.\n16 of the energy balls directly hit Ivy and several death knights. The cannonballs exploded!\nThe direct hit sent all victims flying and falling like a ragdoll.\n\"ARCHLICH IVY!!\"\nThe platoon panicked. They turned around and found the assailants from above.\nPEW PEW PEW\nFollowing the battleships were the drones and unmanned jets. They also unleashed their anti-domain machine guns at them.\nPU\nPU\nInstantly, half of the platoon got hit in the chest! They fell from the sky!\n\"NOOO!!\"\nOne of the grim reapers roared and activated his domain. He summoned a black scythe and swung it toward one of the battleships.\nSWUA\nThe reaper could sense feedback from his domain as several hundred souls inside the battleship were cut in half and destroyed.\nCLANK\nUnfortunately, using a domain during the confusion had a consequence. One of the drones shot his domain and destroyed it in one hit.\nThe grim reaper coughed blood and lost his ability to maintain flight. He slowly fell to the ground.\nBut as the grim reaper and the survivors were in despair, Ivy bellowed.\n\"IDIOTS! DON'T USE YOUR DOMAIN! BELIEVE IN HIS MAJESTY!\"\nIvy and the people who got shot down earlier flew back up. One of them rushed to support the injured grim reaper.\nWhite smoke still came out from their black suits and clothes. However, none of them was seriously injured. They only got a few burns on their skins or faces.\nThe uniform protected them from the bullets and the energy cannonballs earlier!\nThe grim reaper came back to his senses. He lowered his head in shame and embarrassment.\n\"I-I'm sorry, commander.\"\n\"It doesn't matter!\" Ivy snorted. \"Believe in His Majesty's blessings and protection! He blesses us with these godly artifacts. We mustn't let him down!\"\n\"OOOOOH!!\"\nEverybody regained morale. They restored their formation and started kiting small drones and jets, acting as decoys and targets.\n.\n.\nLeo glanced at Ivy's platoon in the sky. He let out a sigh of relief that the invader's weaponry was ineffective against his domain's uniforms.\nBut this didn't change the flow of the battle. He looked up and counted the number of battleships.\nThey were endless!\n\"This is going to take forever.\"\nLeo grumbled. He wished that he still had the newbie protection power during his early days.\n\"System, can I collect compensation from the invaders now?\"\nDING\n<No. However, you may collect the compensation after you successfully capture or kill the PLAYER behind this siege.>\n<Please note. When an invader is killed within your store domain, their lifespan will be collected and accumulated in a system pool. You can only claim it if the responsible PLAYER is captured or killed during the invasion. However, the system will automatically erase the accumulated lifespan pool if nobody manages to capture or kill the opposition PLAYER.>\nIn short, Leo had to find the one leading this mess and grab him to his domain.\nLeo swept his gaze over the large battleships and the motherships, searching for the one in charge.\nAs Leo kept looking, the corner of his eyes noticed a long angel, floating in the void behind the motherships and looking down at him and his people.\nStrangely, that person had the same face as Meowmeow, the statue. Moreover, Leo's heart was tinged with discomfort.\n\"That guy… Why do I hate him so much?\"\n.\n.\nThe black-winged angel in space was Overlord Mao Miaomiao. He indeed had the same face as the guardian statue Meowmeow.\nHis eyes met with Leo's. He sneered at the latter.\n\"I've come here to find an imposter, but I found the original! HAHAHAHA! That pitiful brat manages to survive, I see. Well, I owe you my gratitude. Your parents created a very nice vessel! Too bad it's too good for you. Hahahaha!\"\nMao Miaomiao burst into laughter while he circulated his Qi. His aura expanded as he revealed his true cultivation base.\nImmortal…\nDeity…\nSage…\nEntity…\nIt reached the realm of Karmic Sovereign!\n\"Admire this power, brat! This is your parents' hard work! You must savor it and memorize it well since you won't get to see it again!\"\nMao Miaomiao raised his hand and created a 666,666 km-long sword. He grabbed the hilt and was about to cut the entire planet in half.\n\"NOT SO FAST, MAO MIAOMIAO!!\"\nMeowmeow suddenly appeared in front of the angel and punched him in the face. The sword shattered while the angel was knocked back 20,000 kilometers.\nMao Miaomiao smirked and wiped his mouth. He spat out transparent blood and sneered at the statue.\n\"Oh, you. I remember you. That stupid crow pet of that brat becomes his shadow. What a loyal pet!\"\n\"Bastard! Return Leo's body!\"\nMao Miaomiao snickered. \"Come and take it if you can!\"\nMeowmeow bellowed and transformed into a black phoenix. He breathed rainbow flame toward the angel.\nThe angel sneered and swatted it away. He then clenched his fist and gathered Qi in his hand.\nA rainbow aura gathered in Overlord Mao's fist. He then threw a punch toward Meowmeow.\nBOOM\nA rainbow beam blasted out of Mao Miaomiao's fist and hit Meowmeow's chest. The black phoenix shattered!\n\"AHAHAHAHAHA! IS THAT ALL YOU CAN DO, LITTLE CROW?!\"\nBlack flame rekindled and emerged on top of Overlord Mao. The flame formed the phoenix's mouth. Then, Meowmeow swallowed the overlord whole.\nMao Miaomiao's expression changed. His body turned blue as he transferred his entire body and soul into another dimension. Then, he teleported 1,000 kilometers away.\nMeowmeow turned around and gave chase. The overlord clicked his tongue and complained.\n\"Playing catch? Fine! How long can you keep chasing me while you're getting further and further away from your master, I wonder?\"\n\"…\"\nThe game of tag in space started while Leo and his comrades fended off the invaders.",

However, not everything was well-protected when the invaders outnumbered the defenders.\nBattleships and unmanned drones quickly bypassed the defenders and bombarded the shopping mall and other buildings. Their bullets and lasers hit Gao Yan's house and the granaries.\nFaint barriers appeared, protecting all buildings within the domain. However, the layers of barriers slowly cracked as the anti-domain guns wore down the basic defensive barriers of Leo's buildings.\nLeo observed the situation and deeply pondered. He closed his eyes and sank his consciousness to his dantian universe, checking a few system skills that he obtained from the shadows.\n'Oh, I have this.'\nOne second in reality was 1,000 seconds (16 minutes) in Leo's pocket universe. He found what he needed.\nLeo pulled out the pen that he had bought from Nine-Fingered-Red of the Fate Stadium. He injected his Qi into it.\nFFFFKRRRSHZZZ\nThe pen transformed into a spear covered in rainbow plasma energy. From an onlooker's perspective, Leo was holding a light spear with a bare hand.\nVRAU VRAU\nLeo waved the spear around. The broom of the dwarf fit Leo's left hand while his right hand held the boom stick of Florida Singularity.\nHe looked up and swept his eyes over the countless burning drones, jets, and battleships. The rain of fire painted the sky in orange.\n\"...Domain.\"\nSHING\nLeo swung his plasma spear like a sword once. However, none of the airships, jets, or drones in the sky were harmed. Instead, hostile elves and werewolves in the premise of 100 kilometers collapsed.\nWhite smoke came out from the victim of Leo's mysterious domain. They slipped through the gaps of the ships and gathered toward Leo.\nLeo's chest was the eye of a whirlpool, sucking everything into his body.\nDING\n<You have absorbed 30,511 souls!>\n<You have converted 30,511 souls into life force.>\n<You have gained 6,431,916 years of lifespan.>\nDING\n<You have completed the Fate Crystal Tutorial's secondary objectives!>\n<You have obtained 7 lucky draw tickets (Building) and 777 free territory expansion tickets.>\nLeo snorted and retracted the light spear's energy. He put the pen back in his pocket and shifted his attention to the unmanned drones and jets.\n\"What kind of power should I use against those robots? EMP? Is there anybody that can use EMP or something similar?\"\nLeo closed his eyes and searched for the right skills. While he was at it, he scanned through the new names in his system menu. Several names of the overlords showed up.\n'Milo, Max, Jack…Jack Ingof? Jacking off? Pfft. Who named this mofo? Oh, well… Huh?'\nLeo sorted the list by the strength of the shadows, so the system menu would show the strongest person first. But after the list was sorted, Leo found a familiar name.\nDr. Mao, the Devil\n'Mao? Doctor Mao? Where have I heard this name before?'\nWhile looking at the name and the portrait of Overlord Mao Miaomiao, his heart raced, and he coughed. His face reddened, and his blood pressure rose.\nHe didn't know why, but he was angry.\n'…Do I know this guy?'\n.\n.\nOhio Man's planet\nSimba received a new transfer order from Ester's mother again. She ordered him to assist Overlord Lucky to lay siege against a colony of Cathulhu. Moreover, the main forces of the elves were also there as they were about to confront Overlord Xiaomao and his cats.\n\"Here we go again.\"\nSimba shook his head and deeply sighed. He hated the elves and their warmongering nature.\n\"Again, dear?\"\n\"Yes. Again. They never stop even though Overlord Xiaomao alone can take on a million entities by himself. He's as strong as a karmic sovereign. Why haven't they learned?!\"\nEster bit her lower lip. She circulated her Qi into the entity fate crystal in her chest. Then, a vision appeared in her mind.\nFlashes of events revealed the possible future. Branches of potential outcomes were right before her eyes.\nAfter calculating the future, Ester revealed what she had seen.\n\"One of my sisters broke through. Ellen has become a karmic sovereign like Overlord Mao and Overlord Kishin. Mother might have thought that Ellen could take on Overlord Xiaomao with Sister Ellen's help.\"\n\"Ellen? The 7th sister of yours?\"\nThe matriarch of the divine elves gave birth to many promising daughters. Esen was the eldest while Ester was the 2nd. However, because of the infighting and competitiveness of the royal court, none of them was on friendly terms.\n\"Yes. She's a cultivation maniac. She often stole other sisters' cultivation resources, but nobody could do anything to her because of her tyrannical strength and unique dao. She can erase anybody with negative karma. Also, she already killed three of our sisters… I think the queen is keeping her as a backup.\"\n\"…\"\nSimba had been with the Elf royalties for a long time. He knew that the \"mother\" hated her daughters the most.\nHe had proof, but he couldn't say it. He also knew why the \"mother\" kept her daughters around, and it was extremely repulsive.\n\"I gotta go. Take care while I'm not around, Ester.\"\n\"Yeah. Come back safely, Simba.\"\nThe husband and wife kissed. Then, Simba touched his face with his palm and transformed into one of the Fenrir werewolves. He teleported away.\nAfter Simba had gone, Ester bitterly smiled. She turned around and gazed at her house.\n\"Time to clean, I guess. He'll be fine.\"\n…\nEster quickly cleaned the house and let her kid play in the yard. She hummed and admired the sparkling clean house. Then, she shifted her gaze toward the garage, where Simba usually tinkered with some artifacts there.\n\"Ah, that place is getting stinky. I should surprise him.\"\nIn the past, Simba always told Ester not to enter his workshop as it was dangerous. Ester heeded his warning and respected Simba's privacy.\nHowever, Simba was not a clean person. He often forgot to clean his workshop. Thus, Ester always nagged him to do it himself.\nAs Simba neglected his workshop's hygiene for too long, Ester planned to remove some dust.\nEntering the workshop, Ester found a workshop desk, a furnace, a pill cauldron, an anvil, and strange machines. Aside from the craftsman's tools, she didn't see anything special but dirt and black dust.\nEster's face darkened.\n\"Simba, you lazy skunk! I told him to clean this place, but he never did. Oh, boy.\"\nEster waved her finger, creating a strong wind. The air circulation blew all the dust into the sky.\nAfter removing the dust, Ester brought a wet towel. While tidying the furniture there, Ester stumbled upon a framed photo of Simba and his family.\nEster giggled and admired her husband when he was young. She picked the photo to clean it.\nBut as Ester picked up the photo, a key slipped out from the back of the frame.\n\"Huh?\" Ester picked up the bronze key. \"What's this for?\"\nCurious, she looked for a place to use the key. She didn't need to look for long as the workshop desk's drawer had a keyhole of a similar size.\nEster used the key and opened the drawer. When she pulled it open, she found a stack of document papers in a folder.\nThe language of the papers was strange to her. She couldn't read it. However, among the documents, an old photo of an Asian man was clipped to a paper.\n\"???\"\nEster frowned as she had seen the face of this man somewhere before. Her curiosity was piqued.\n\"I shouldn't use this, but… please forgive me, Simba.\"\nEster opened her status window and browsed a lifespan shop system. She scrolled through the list to find the auto-translate function for Simba's native language.\nEarthling Linguistic Knowledge – One Million Years of Lifespan\nEster grinned and purchased it. Then, a flood of knowledge entered her mind. When she looked at the papers again, she could finally read them.\n\"That's better!\"\nEster reread the document with the photo of an Asian man.\n\"…Professor Mao Miaomiao, CEO and the owner of Immortal Cloning Incorporate…\"\nEster flipped the documents and read everything. The more she read, the more she was horrified.\nThese were the records of human experiments, which were done by the professor and his assistants. They adopted countless orphans and homeless children to their labs and experimented on them.\nShe finally recognized the professor\nHe had the same name as the infamous karmic sovereign overlord Mao Miaomiao!\nShe couldn't stop anymore. Ester kept reading.\nAmong the documents, she found photos of many scientists with a tribal tattoo on the back of their hands. Their unique green eyes were also identical to the eyes of divine elves.\n\"Wait, these people in the documents aren't even humans! I remember those tattoos! They're divine elves!\"\nIn shock, Ester flipped the pages and checked the documents with the photos again. She also glanced at the family photo of Simba.\nThe white boy in the picture might look like a human. However, his green iris and his sharp eyes couldn't fool her anymore.\nThis boy had a divine elf's blood in his veins! Moreover, the parents all had elven tattoos on the back of their hands.\nThey were elves!\nBut something didn't make sense. Ester rescanned the documents again to recheck what she might have missed. And indeed, she missed one notable fact of these strange documents.\nOne of the papers had the details of a certain test subject whose face was the same as the boy in Simba's photo. There was also a terrifying note at the corner of the paper.\n.\nTest Subject's Name: Leonardo Ariel\nCall Sign: LEO\nDNA Compatibility: OL-XM, OL-LK, OL-AP, OL-AS, and OL-ME\nDominant DNA: OL-ME, OL-AP\nCultivation Ceiling Potential: Entity or Karmic Sovereign\nProfessor's Note: MOTHER, transfer my soul into this body. Kill the rest of the scientists and test subjects.\n.\nThat wasn't the end of the document. Behind the personal information of this boy, there was Simba's handwriting.\n'Rest in peace, brother. Thank you for saving my life. I'll avenge you one day.'",

Even though their ship was hit by the guardian's laser and lost 20% of its personnel, the sacred machine cells of the ship restored all components and repaired the ship to its former glory.\n\"Howl-14 is down!\"\n\"We lost contact on Hyena 13!\"\n\"Foxtrot unit is wiped out!\"\n\"Howl 3 has sent an SOS! Their engine is down!\"\nAt the bridge of the cubic warship, Ingof Jack sat on his seat, listening to the reports from the operators. A thousand monitors in this room showed the camera feeds of their spaceships. However, one-third of the screens only showed statics as the ships had been shot down.\nOne after another, battleships stopped replying to their status call.\nJack's expression turned dark. He had predicted this outcome, but he had no choice. After all, Overlord Mao Miaomiao's status was superior to the divine elf matriarch Eleanor.\n\"Tell all units to stop charging at that place head-on. Descend and surround that place. Then, use your superior range to bombard them! As for the ships in the orbit, tell them to navigate to the axis pole. Destroy the planet's magnetic field!\"\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\nThe order was relayed to the other warships. A few minutes later, the remaining spaceships stopped charging blindly at Leo's domain. Instead, they entered the atmosphere while avoiding the domain's airspace.\nThe death toll still rose, but it wasn't as fast as before. Jack counted the remaining warships and was relieved to see the number stopped rising.\nBut suddenly, a loud explosion erupted and shook the entire cube warship. They also received another report from the other artificial star.\n\"SIR! COLONY MILO HAS BEEN DESTROYED!!\"\n\"What?!\"\nJack stood up from his seat and turned his attention to the side monitor, which showed the status of their ally mothership.\nOne of the artificial planets exploded!\n\"WHAT HIT THEM?!\" Jack was stunned. He thought that Leo didn't have enough personnel to counterattack or raid their motherships.\nThe monitor slowly zoomed toward the destroyed ship. The crews at the bridge turned their attention to the screen and were horrified by the scene.\nTen thousand grey 100-kilometer-long octopus tentacles pierced through the star from the inside and crushed the hull as if they were soft jelly.\nA cat-face octopus emerged from the destroyed mothership. Its head was half the size of the artificial planet while its long tentacles were about a kilometer thick.\nThe cat-octopus opened its wide mouth and chewed the components and werewolves in glee. Its tentacles also dragged everything it caught into its mouth.\nNOM-NOM MUNYA!\nJack recognized the creature well. This monster was from a race that the Fenrir Werewolves deemed as their nemesis.\n\"CATHULHU! WHY IS A CATHULHU HERE?!\"\nThe nightmare didn't stop there. One of the operators trembled in fear as he just received a piece of terrifying news.\nThe news came from Overlord Max's artificial star.\n\"SIR! O-OVERLORD MAX's LIFE SIGNATURE… HAS CEASED!\"\n.\n.\nA few minutes earlier\nWhile Overlord Milo infiltrated Leo's planet, Overlord Max remained in his mothership to command his troops. His forces detached from the others as they orbited around the planet to target the other side of the world.\nBesides the Yan Dynasty's main continent, there were other minor continents in this world. Small islands surrounded a 15 million square-kilometer continent. In addition, the land was full of small towns and villages of cultivators.\nMilo eyed on this continent. He sent his order to his minions.\n\"Send drone battalions down. Kill every nu'earthe there and set up a foothold!\"\nThe artificial star quickly deployed a million drones, which dove into the atmosphere.\nOverlord Milo relaxed on his captain's seat at the bridge and enjoyed the monitor screens of his ship. The cameras of the drones showed the footage of their hi-tech jets destroying the defenseless mortals.\nHis aide brought him a plate of raw steak, which Milo tossed the meat into his mouth. He then licked the plate to savor the taste.\n\"MORE!\"\nThe aide, who had the face of a Chihuahua, received the empty plate and proceeded to the gate of the bridge.\nUpon reaching the gate, the aide found a transparent energy wall, which separated the bridge from the corridor. However, on the other side of the corridor, the guards were on the floor and were soaked in their blood.\nOn the other side of the transparent energy curtain, a grey Fenrir werewolf stood there with his arms crossed. He stared down at the Chihuahua aide.\nThe aide widened his eyes in shock. The face of this man was well-known among all Fenrirs.\n\"O-Overlord Lucky!\"\nThe wolf grinned. He ordered the little werewolf.\n\"Open the curtain for me, woof!\"\n\"Y-Yes, Your Excellency!\"\nThe Chihuahua opened the bridge's protective curtain for the werewolf lord.\nWHOOSH\nThe energy curtain disappeared. The warlord strolled toward the bridge and patted the Chihuahua's head.\n\"Good job, woof.\"\nThe aide trembled in fear. He gazed at the corpses in front of the bridge and mustered the courage to ask him.\n\"W-What happened to the guards, Your Excellency?\"\nThe conversation caught the attention of busy operators in the room. Some of them turned around to look at the Chihuahua.\nAs the curtain was open, the scent of blood entered the bridge. Every werewolf detected the scent and was alarmed.\nThe giant warlord swept his gaze over everybody. Vice versa, Overlord Max turned toward the infamous person. Their eyes met.\n\"Overlord Lucky? Wait, BLOOD SCENT?! DAMMIT! WHO LET AN IMPOSTER HERE?! KARMIC RIVER LAW! COME OUT, BLOODHOUNDS! EAT HIS SOUL!\"\nOverlord Max bellowed and activated his domain ability. A dozen blood wolves manifested from nothingness and bit Overlord Lucky's neck, arms, and legs. Their fangs sunk into Overlord Lucky's flesh, but they didn't cause any external wounds. Instead, they caught his soul.\nStrong mortals relied on dao domains. Immortals could use soul domains while deities upgraded their power into providence domains.\nOn the other hand, sages borrowed power from the river of karma and called their power \"Karmic Law\".\nBut the imposter, who was Leo's wolf statue, exceeded those realms.\nThe imposter ignored the threat and sneered at Overlord Max. He sentenced Max's demise with a revelation.\n\"A measly karmic law? My master doesn't need to lower his status to deal with a sage like you, woof! I can handle this… SOVEREIGN JUDGMENT!\"\nThe imposter revealed himself as one of Leo's guardian statues. He reverted to his statue appearance and unveiled countless transparent strings in the bridge.\nThese transparent strings were the karmic bonds between souls and the river of karma. Everybody had one string connected to the invisible river of karma of this universe.\nOverlord Max's string was the largest among the crewmates. The thread treaded beyond the mothership into the void where nobody could see.\nMax widened his eyes in disbelief. He bellowed in desperation and commanded his hounds.\n\"TEAR HIS SOUL NOW! KILL THAT IMPOSTER! HE'S NOT OVERLORD LUCKY!!\"\nThe hounds exerted more force. However, their spiritual teeth and fangs failed to tear the imposter's soul apart. They got stuck with something.\nThe wolf statue who had Overlord Lucky's face snickered. He calmly extended his hand and grabbed the string of Overlord Max. He cut it with his finger and attached it to his chest.\n\"Our cultivation base gap is too large, woof! You can't expect to harm my master's soul with this much strength, do you, woof?\"\nOverlord Max screamed in desperation. Although he didn't understand or measure how strong this imposter was, he cursed at the statue.\n\"I SWEAR BY THE NAME OF HIS EXCELLENCY LUCKY! YOU IMPOSTER WILL FACE HIS WRATH!!\"\n\"That doesn't change your fate, woof. Goodbye.\"\nThe transparent string flashed and sucked Overlord Max's soul into the statue's chest. The soul let out a desperate cry before he vanished into the statue's body forever.\nCRUNCH!\nThe sound of a shattering glass echoed in the werewolf statue's mind. He licked his lips and burped.\n\"Delicious, woof! Anyway, y'all need to die, too.\"\nThe wolf howled and sang the silent requiem.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nThe confused and shocked crewmates stared at the statue in a daze. Their eyes, dantians, and internal organs melted into goo while their flesh and bones remained intact. Everybody collapsed in their pools of blood.\nThe bridge was not the only place where the crewmates were killed. The other subordinate warships of Overlord Max also suffered from the statue's domain power, aka the sovereign law.\nCountless werewolves in all ships fell without realizing what had hit them. The drones stopped functioning while warships descended and crashed on the ground.\n\"Hehe. Done, woof! I should go help the others.\"",

Because of them, Leo received new rewards for free.\nHowever, the battle was far from over. Drones and unmanned jets still rushed down toward his domain like angry Karens swarming an innocent store manager.\nA hail of beams and lasers hit Leo's store, pylon tower, and apartments. Two of three external defensive barriers shattered, leaving them only a thin layer of energy shields.\nLeo was annoyed. He had every ability to kill every lifeform, but he couldn't find the right skill to eliminate the machines.\nNot giving up, Leo searched his pocket universe system to find the right person with related skills. He sorted the shadow's roster by strength.\nThen, a certain angel appeared on the list.\n.\nName: Dr. Mao Miaomiao, the Devil\nRace: Chimera Homunculus\nAge: 50,072\nCultivation Base: Seven Karmic Sea Sovereign\nSkills: Karmic Dao of Lust, Karmic Dao of Space and Time, Karmic Dao of Swordsman, Karmic Dao of Chaos, Fate Plundering Dao, Blessing of Divine Elf's Matriarch.\nSpecials: Abyssal Phoenix Bloodline, Divine Elf Bloodline, Karma Oceania Bloodline,\nFavorite Weaponry: Katana of Karmic Severance\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nLeo deeply frowned as this man's name and photo annoyed him. He didn't know why, but his guts hated the black-winged angel.\n'This guy looks exactly like Meowmeow. Their names also coincide… is that really a coincidence? I need to ask that pervert angel later. Tsk. I have no time for that. I need any skill that can be used in this situation!'\nLeo glanced at one of the skills that Mao Miaomiao had – Karmic Dao of Space and Time.\nHe was interested in it. However, it might not be the answer in this situation. Also, the cultivation base of this man was alarming.\nIt took Leo several minutes to defeat Esen's shadow, who was a 12-galaxy deity. Moreover, this guy's cultivation base sounded stronger than hers. It might take a long time to defeat this shadow.\nDespite the hesitation, Leo tried it anyway. After all, the pocket dantian belonged to him, and he couldn't be killed in real life if he lost.\n'Show me what you can do, doctor. Who the hell are you?!'\nLeo summoned Mao Miaomiao's shadow to fight.\nDING\nThe shadow manifested in Leo's universe. The silhouette silently spread his black wings and transformed into a 500-kilometer-tall black phoenix. It flapped its wings and floated freely in the void. The beast glared at Leo, who was still standing on a planet.\nBefore Leo could initiate the fight, an explosion erupted inside Leo's stomach. Black flame gushed out from his eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, and other orifices.\n\"…\"\nIt was warm enough for Leo to sense a mild danger. He groaned in frustration and shoved his hand into his chest. Then, he pulled out a ball of black flame from his flesh.\nThis was the source of the explosion earlier. Leo didn't know how the phoenix stuffed this fireball inside him.\n\"Nice trick. But can you do this?\"\nLeo used one of the skills he copied from Beatrice. He shoved his hand into his chest again and grabbed one of his ribcages. He broke it and pulled it out.\nThe ribcage transformed into a transparent broadsword. It illuminated the dark universe in the pocket dantian.\nThe shadow phoenix flinched when he saw the transparent sword. It also summoned a flame katana.\nThe weapon floated around the phoenix for a moment to scan the battlefield. Then, it turned toward Leo and rose up.\nRUMBLE\nThe black katana extended and expanded. Then, it swung down, aiming at Leo's grassland planet.\nLeo imposed an IAI stance, which he had learned from Beatrice. He sheathed the sword and sliced the incoming giant blade.\nCLANK\nThe small broadsword and the black flame blade contacted. The smaller one cleaved through the massive metal and sliced it into two!\nThe cut didn't stop there. Cutting through the void at 300 times the speed of light was a crescent wind blade, which expanded according to the distance it traveled.\nSWUA\nThe energy blade cut one of the phoenix's wings. It reverted to a humanoid form. However, one of his arms was missing.\nThe shadow glanced at his missing arm and rubbed it. The lost arm regenerated, and he moved it around.\n\"Yeah, I figured.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAlthough no sound could travel in space, Leo's voice echoed in the pocket universe. The shadow turned around and found Leo floating in space.\nLeo had teleported behind the shadow earlier, using Grim Reaper's phasing techniques. By the time Mao Miaomiao's shadow realized it, Leo was already in his attack range.\nThe transparent sword swung down.\nThe shadow opened his mouth and bellowed in a hoarse voice.\n\"TIME!\"\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nLeo suddenly felt sluggish. His movement drastically slowed and came to a pause. However, he could still move his eyeballs to look around.\nOn the other hand, the shadow sneered and adjusted his posture. He resummoned his katana and hacked Leo's neck.\nCLANK\nThe katana hit Leo's nape, but it only managed to cut 5 millimeters into his flesh.\n\"!!!\"\nThe shadow exerted more force. Unfortunately for him, he failed to dig it further.\n\"This is a new record. Congratulations! Nobody managed to give me such a deep wound. I'm stoked!\"\nLeo mustered his willpower and strength. He clenched his fist and broke free from the mysterious restraints. Then, he did what Jotaro usually did in anime.\n\"ORAORAORAORAORAORA!!\"\nA thousand fists barraged the shadow's face, chest, stomach, legs, arms, and groin simultaneously as if Leo could shoot his fists like a shotgun.\nThe clone widened his eyes in disbelief. His body slowly crumbled and disintegrated as he was pummeled so hard that his flesh and bones broke down into atoms.\nLeo didn't have enough as the mysterious anger swelled in his heart. He reached out and pointed his palm toward the dust. Then, he activated one of Esen's magic.\nDeath Magic!\nThe spell was designed to attack a soul directly. The magic revolved around converting yin Qi into a black gas, which was hazardous to living beings and souls. As long as the black gas touched the target, the victim's soul would always perish if it was unprotected.\nBlack miasma erupted and surrounded Leo and the dust. It seeped into every atom of the shadow's dust, but the miasma ignored Leo.\nA loud screech followed, but no one could hear it. In one of the participles of dust, the artificial soul of the shadow emerged and tried to escape.\nLeo brightly smiled and swung his transparent sword. Again, he relied on Beatrice's death knight sword domain, which was capable of attacking anybody within the invisible dome.\nThe soul was beheaded while the miasma consumed it.\nDING\n<You have defeated Dr. Mao Miaomiao's shadow!>\n<If you defeat Dr. Mao Miaomiao 999 more times at this difficulty, you can learn one of his skills!>\nLeo brightly grinned and nodded in approval. It was easier than he had thought.\n\"I'm glad he's stupid. He's not the type to dodge any attack, I see.\"\nThere were many types of shadows in Leo's pocket dantian universes. Leo fought many death knights, Marc, and grim reapers in his free time to learn their skills, and they were the most annoying opponents.\nEvery time Leo fought Beatrice or her comrades, they dodged his attacks as if their lives depended on it. As a result, it took a long time to defeat one of them at a time.\nOn the other hand, Ivy and liches were stationary most of the time. They relied on teleportation magic and blinking techniques, but they couldn't dodge even basic attacks when they were caught.\nOther cultivators also fell into the two prior categories. Situ Nantian, Hua Jiashan, and Han Hao had high agility and dexterity while Tang Xuan, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman always tried to defend or block his attacks, which was futile.\nGao Yan, Yao Qiqi, and Jin Yong, on the other hand, were the balance type. They usually made a correct judgment when to dodge or defend. But in the end, none of them managed to cleanly dodge Leo's attacks when he put his mind to it.\nLeo had enough for now. He opened his eyes in reality.\nOnly a second passed in the real world. Leo didn't miss anything dangerous.\nAlthough Leo didn't manage to get a skill from Mao Miaomiao, he gained insight from the previous fight. He shoved his hand into his flesh and dug a ribcage out.\nSWUA\nThe ribcage transformed into a transparent sword like what happened in the simulation mode.\nThen, Leo activated Beatrice and Marc's domain powers at the same time. Two layers of dome expanded and covered the sky.\nBeatrice's personal domain allowed Leo to cut anything inside the dome. As for Marc's domain, it multiplied the attacks he delivered. The Jojo fist barrage earlier in the simulation was also one of Marc's abilities.\n\"What if I combine the one-hit slash technique and the multiplier skill together?\"\nLeo smirked and tested it out. He swung the transparent sword down.\nSWUA\nSWUA\nSWUA\nAs it was Leo's first time using the skills, only 46 drones and 16 unmanned jets were cut in half. However, ten thousand slashes only cut empty air.\nLeo pouted as he felt bad. He retried one more time.\nSWUA\nSWUA\nSWUA\nIt was worse than before. A total of 30 machines were broken while the rest missed the mark.\n\"Eh… Annoying. STAY STILL AND LET ME CUT YOU!!\"\nLeo swung his sword like a baseball bat. Every time he swung, battleships, jets, and drones fell from the sky.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen pursed her lips as she watched her husband work. She was proud of him.\n\"Isn't that Beatrice's soul domain? The multi-hit domain is the same as Marc's too! Hehe, damn, geezer. You're secretly practicing my subordinates' daos, I see.\"\nEsen didn't want to lose to him. She pointed her fingers at the countless militated corpses on the ground and shouted.\n\"DON'T EVER THINK DEATH IS THE END! ARISE, MY SLAVES!\"\nThe fleshes of corpses mended and combined into new beings. 10,000 zombies and skeletons slowly stood on their feet and howled.",

Both sides kept flying further and further away from Leo's planet.\nMao Miaomiao's historical laughter was silenced by the void while the angel statue bellowed in anger. No matter what Meowmeow did, he couldn't touch the devil.\n\"What's wrong? What happened to your confidence earlier?\" The angel mocked the imposter.\nAlthough Meowmeow couldn't hear the angel's voice, he could read his lips and his expressions. His anger soared.\n\"TIME LAW!\"\nThe statue bellowed and stopped time around him. However, the black-winged angel cackled and used the same ability.\n\"That's my power, you copycat. TIME AND SPACE LAW!\"\nAll gas and particles in the void within the radius of 100 light years of distance remained in the same place. However, the two angels continued playing the game of tag.\nMeowmeow's swords, beams, punches, and kicks kept missing. Meanwhile, Mao Miaomiao calmly counterattacked by hitting the statue with his palms.\nThe statue cracked and was on the verge of crumbling. Meowmeow looked at his body and bit his lower lip.\nAs Meowmeow realized he was not the opponent of the karmic sovereign, he vanished, withdrawing from the battle.\n\"Hey! Hey! You can't just leave. Come back here!\"\nMao Miaomiao pursued. In five seconds, he caught the statue and punched the latter's chest.\nThe chest of Meowmeow cracked and dented. He was knocked back 100 kilometers away.\nNot allowing Meowmeow to leave, the angel teleported and reappeared behind the statue. He threw a punch at the back of Meowmeow's head.\nThe statue detected danger. He bellowed and dispersed into smoke. Instantly, he teleported closer to Leo's planet.\nMao Miaomiao stopped pursuing the fleeing guardian. His smiley face turned solemn.\n\"I've played enough. Time to get serious.\"\nMao Miaomiao created a large sword, which was three times longer than the sun. He then swung down, aiming at the planet of Leo.\nThe sword descended and broke through the atmosphere.\n.\n.\nOn the flying island, Gao Yan and Jin Yong stood side by side. They had come out to assist the seniors, but their presence seemed unnecessary.\nIvy's platoon did well by kiting jets and battleships away from the domain. They tanked countless energy shots from battleships and unmanned jets, but they managed to take down as many drones and jets.\nWhile both promising quasi-immortals observed the fight of immortals and deities, an immortal on their side got on the island via elevator.\nBoth men turned around and found a swordsman, who had traumatized many people with his caveman's speech and brutality.\n\"WHERE WOLVES?! ME KILL WOLVES!\"\nJin Yong's eyes were dull as he gave up talking to his mentor. As for Gao Yan, it was his first time meeting the sword saint's clone.\n\"Is this the new guy you were talking about?\" Asked Gao Yan.\n\"Yes. Be careful, though. If he detects your talent, he'll drag you to that godforsaken place.\"\n\"Godforsaken place?\"\n\"A torture chamber. If you get stuck in there, you'll be forced to train nonstop until you drop.\"\n\"Isn't that interesting?\"\n\"…No. Don't do it, junior. Trust your senior!\"\nGao Yan was curious why Jin Yong hated the time chamber so much. He planned to visit it after this mess.\nRUMBLE\nWhile the two soon-to-be immortals chatted, the sky turned dark. A large energy blade rapidly got closer to their planet, and its humming noise alarmed them.\nGao Yan, Jin Yong, and Hua Taixu looked up. They clearly saw a large blade approaching, and it got bigger every second.\n\"Uh-oh.\" Gao Yan realized what it was. \"Isn't that an energy blade? It's massive!\"\nJin Yong broke a sweat. \"There is no time to admire that! That stupid thing is about to crush our world!\"\nHua Taixu's expression also turned dark.\n\"Enemy strong! Me helpless!\"\nGao Yan didn't want to give up. He raised his pistol and injected every ounce of Qi into his bullets. He switched the firing mode to automatic and unleashed hell upon the oncoming blade.\nRepeated lasers hit the approaching blade, but the beams were deflected upon contact!\nGao Yan was taken aback. This gun was the strongest artifact that he had, but it was not effective against the blade.\nJin Yong took this opportunity to try. He used one of the mass-produced M16 and sprayed enhanced bullets at the alien's sword.\nTING\nTING\nIt was ineffective as expected.\nWhile both men tried to protect their world from the sword, the others also worked hard to repel that absolute unit to hit the planet.\nIvy, Marc, Beatrice, Taxi, Ricardo, and Esen turned their attention toward the sword and threw their strongest attack at the sword. As futile as it was, no one managed to put a dent in the energy sword.\nThe sword quickly broke through the atmosphere to hit the planet.\n3,000 feet above the flying island.\n2,000 feet\n1,000 feet\nIt only took a second for the blade to descend from the exosphere to reach this far.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nGao Yan and Jin Yong rushed toward the energy sword and swung their weapons at it.\nBOOM\nThe energy sword generated a shockwave and knocked both men away. It descended further.\n100 feet!\nIt was too late for Gao Yan and others to stop the blade. It was 10 feet above the platform.\nBOOM!!\nIt hit!\nA portion of the flying island was cut through, but half of it remained intact as the tip of the blade got stuck by something.\nGao Yan, Hua Taixu, and Jin Yong turned around to see what the colossus blade had hit and why it was stopped. Then, they found the cause of such a phenomenon.\nSomething came out of the permanent portal of Orlando Mystic Realm. A thousand straight fishing lines came out from the portal and wrapped around a section of the blade, preventing it from cutting through the flying island in half.\nThe one responsible for the fishing lines slowly walked out of the portal.\nHe was a statue of an elderly fisherman, and his name was Kitten.\nThe fisherman looked up and found the karmic sovereign's blade. He snorted.\n\"A runaway homunculus dares to provoke my master? You don't know who you're dealing with!\"\nThe fishing lines tightened and crushed the energy blade. The weapon of Mao Miaomiao shattered instantly.\n.\n.\nMao Miaomiao raised his eyebrows and gazed at his destroyed energy blade. He was surprised that someone managed to block his attack.\n\"Hey, hey. Isn't that planet supposed to be a mortal world? How come there are so many entities? Oh, wait. I know! That brat is around. Right, I'm supposed to get rid of that brat and take whatever bloodline he uses with his new body.\"\nThe devil shrugged and ignored Meowmeow. He swept his gaze over the planet to find Leo.\nIt wasn't hard to find him as Leo stood at the top of his shopping mall with his eyes closed. He seemed to be meditating.\n\"Ah, found you. I should get this over with quickly. Also, that chick is FINE!\"\nMao Miaomiao found Esen, who minded her business on top of the parking lot. Around her, an army of skeletons and zombies listened to her instructions. Suddenly, they flew toward the remnant drones and jets.\nZombies jumped and caught many jets. Then, they self-detonated, bringing down some machines with them.\nWhen the zombies exploded and left with militated corpses, Esen waved her fingers and repaired them. The flesh and blood of destroyed zombies combined as one, and a new zombie was resurrected.\nMao Miaomiao admired Esen's ability. He also drooled as he had never tasted a fine divine elf with a flat chest before. He thought to himself.\n'I bet Mother Eleanor won't mind if I smash one of her people. Well, she isn't planning to use her body as a new vessel anyway. It's that warmonger that she will be using.'\nHe laughed to himself as he was the one who discovered a technique to transfer one's soul and consciousness to a new body without causing a side effect. At the moment, the matriarch of the divine elf was about to employ the technique on one of her successors to prolong her lifespan and youthful appearance.\nThe doctor couldn't help but laugh at his MOTHER. He was proud of his technological breakthrough achievements. Because of his elation, his wood was rock solid.\n\"Ah, I can't wait to taste some elves! I've changed my mind. I'll take her-\"\nPOEK!\nSomething hard suddenly hit Mao Miaomiao's nape. He turned around to see the assailant.\nThere was a thick tentacle behind Mao Miaomiao. He looked up and found the culprit.\n\"What are you looking at, munya!\"\nOn top of Mu-Nyang, Lucky was also there, sitting and sneering at the chimera doctor.\n\"You've done goof, woof!\"\nMao Miaomiao raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to the side. \"I fucked up? How so?\"\nMu-Nyang and Lucky stopped smiling. Their killing intent burst.\n\"Master has given us a new order. You're gonna die here, munya!\"\nThe Cathulhu and Werewolf Overlord's clone charged at the angel while the latter cackled.\n\"Y'all are stupid or what?! Do you think entities like you can be my opponent? You need at least 10 karmic sovereigns to beat me!\"\nMao Miaomiao summoned two black katanas out of nowhere and swung them toward Mu-Nyang. The cat-face octopus statue was cut into four pieces, and the cat collapsed.\nMeanwhile, the wolf imposter barked at Mao Miaomiao and activated his killing move. Strange energy infiltrated the karmic sovereign's body, causing his eyes and internal organs to melt!\nAlthough Mao Miaomiao lost both eyeballs and some internal organs, he ignored the threat. Instead, he clapped his hands and revealed his trump card.\n\"Play time's over. I'll show you something special… RETURN TO ZERO!\"\nSuddenly, a karmic law's domain emerged and covered everything in the galaxy. All movements were frozen in time. Unlike before, nobody could sense or feel the power of time and space law, except Leo.\nRUMBLE\nPeople began to move backward, and so did the spaceships and soldiers of Leo's domain. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, the time kept flowing backward!\nA minute later, the anomaly stopped. Then, the time resumed normally.\nThe destroyed energy blade reappeared while Mao Miaomiao's Qi remained in good shape. Also, the sword was about to descend and hit the world.\nMao Miaomiao sneered and changed his approach. Instead of letting the sword move by itself, he grabbed the hilt and changed its trajectory, aiming at Leo, who had been keeping his eyes closed.\n\"NO MORE NICE GUY! DIE, BRAT!! I ALWAYS HATE KIDS LIKE YOU!\"\nThe blade accelerated. It dodged the flying sword and Kitten's finishing lines, making its way toward Leo.\nSensing the incoming blade, Leo's eyes snapped open He then threw a punch at the sword.\nCLANK\nThe energy sword instantly shattered!\nMao Miaomiao gazed at his shattered sword in a daze. He was confused.\n\"Wait. What?!\"\nThe punch unleashed a shockwave, which traveled through space and hit Mao Miaomiao's face.",

A crack also appeared on his face as the shockwave slightly disintegrated his cells.\nThe doctor looked back at the assailant, who was still chilling on the planet.\n'That damn brat!'\nEnraged and humiliated, Mao Miaomiao charged toward the planet while he created a hundred star-destroying swords. He waved his hands and ordered the colossus swords to cut the planet!\n.\nThe sight of multiple gigantic swords bigger than the moons and the sun astonished the crowd. They emerged from a distance, but they rapidly got closer and swung toward their planet.\n\"NOT GOOD!\"\nGao Yan and Jin Yong panicked. They flew to space and unleashed everything.\nThey slashed, hacked, and shot the swords with their firearms.\nTINK\nTINK\nTheir bullets and swords weren't enough to deflect or stop the momentum of the swords. They got bounced back because of the repelling forces.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nThe swords went past them and came down toward the world.\nMeanwhile, Leo pursed his lips and deeply sighed. He muttered to himself.\n\"I guess I made it on time. What was the keyword? Oh, right… ZA WARUDO!\"\nLeo suddenly bellowed and unleashed a domain. A grey dome expanded, enveloping the entire world and the entire star system!\nThe grey dome reached Mao Miaomiao and also pulled him inside.\nMeowmeow, Lucky, Mu-Nyang, Gao Yan, Hua Taixu, Jin Yong, Esen, Beatrice, Taxi, Ricardo, and others didn't sense anything as the time flow in the domain was frozen.\nOn the other hand, Mao Miaomiao could still sense his surroundings, but he couldn't move. His entire body got stuck by an unknown force, and he could only move his eyeballs.\nWhile everybody was frozen in the time and space domain, Leo calmly jumped toward the energy swords. He lightly punched one of them, and they shattered into smoke.\nLeo took his time. He awkwardly swam the void toward the other colossus sword and punched it. Then, he moved to the next.\n.\nMao Miaomiao witnessed everything. He stared at Leo and counted in his mind.\n'12, 13, 14, 15 seconds… how long can you maintain it? I doubt you can even last a minute!'\nLeo couldn't hear Mao Miaomiao's internal thoughts. He swam the void and destroyed the third sword. Using the momentum, he floated toward the next energy blade.\nOne minute passed. Leo managed to destroy the fourth one.\n\"…\"\nMao Miaomiao inwardly sneered in his mind. When he was in his prime condition, ten minutes was the longest time that he could sustain this domain. As for the time rewind ability, Mao Miaomiao could only regress one minute to the past as it consumed too much of his life force.\nThree minutes passed.\nFive minutes passed.\nTen minutes passed, but Leo still took his time to break another sword. So far, he managed to crack 15.\nMao Miaomiao was patient. He gathered his strength, waiting for the domain to disperse. However, what he had been waiting for never happened.\n11 minutes passed. Everything was still frozen in time!\n'11 minutes?! What is this?! How come that brat managed to break my record?! If I remember correctly, I discarded his soul and sent it to the Karma River. Did Jocelyn and Aslan recover his soul and put it in a new vessel?! No. That's impossible. Jocelyn and Aslan were merely deities. They don't have enough authority and power to interfere with the rivers of karma.'\nMao Miaomiao was confused. He thought of Leo and Simba's parents, who were his colleagues 50,000 years ago. Those couples were in charge of nurturing the test subjects and brainwashing them, making them think that they were their real parents.\nIn reality, Simba and Leo were never their children. They were the creations, which mankind from Earth and the divine elves had created.\nAbyssal Phoenixes, divine elves, Cathulhus, Fenrir Werewolves, and other creatures from different races in the universe had been abducted and had their blood extracted. They also managed to get their hands on the rare DNA of top overlords of this universe.\nMao Miaomiao observed Leo and calculated in his mind.\n'The power of time and space comes from the Kishin's Oni… I'm sure either Jocelyn or Aslan must have implanted the OL-ME DNA into another chimera and had that brat reincarnate into it. But that alone can't enable him to endure the backlash this long. He must have the OL-AP and OL-AS DNA with him. The infinite revival ability and supreme vitality come from the abyssal phoenix. The power of regeneration and quick healing come from the Cathulhu. But I also have those DNAs. Why can't I last more than 10 minutes!? Something isn't right!'\nWhile Mao Miaomiao calculated, Leo destroyed the 50th sword and wiped his sweat. The guy leisurely dove back into the planet's atmosphere to take a breather. Then, he flew back toward the other swords and continued his work.\n\"…\"\nMao Miaomiao was speechless by Leo's calmness. He wondered if this guy was stupid. Had he been in Leo's shoes, he would have come after the caster and ended it.\nlightsΝοvel 'Luckily, that brat is stupid. He could have killed me and removed all swords altogether. Why is he taking a roundabout way to negate my attacks?'\nHe smirked and gradually accumulated his Qi in his veins. He managed to move his fingers a bit.\nIt wouldn't take long before Mao Miaomiao could break free from the time domain's restraints.\nPOOF\nPOOF\nWhile Mao Miaomiao fantasized about breaking free of Leo's domain, the rest of his swords suddenly shattered at once.\n'Huh?'\nMao Miaomiao shifted his attention to Leo. However, the guy was still at the same place holding his unique staff.\nLeo turned around. He looked at Mao Miaomiao and their eyes met.\n.\nLeo mumbled to himself as he was tired of destroying swords one by one. He got creative and used the death magic on the energy blades.\nBlack smoke from Leo's hands moved through the void and touched several swords at once. They instantly evaporated the colossus blades.\nLeo let out a sigh of relief.\n\"I should have done this earlier.\"\nLeo proceeded to remove all threats. When the swords were gone, he turned around and stared at the culprit of all the messes. He hadn't forgotten the guy.\n\"Now, you. Doctor Mao Miaomiao, I don't know you, but I hate you. I don't know why, though.\"\nLeo circulated his Qi into his feet and propelled himself forward. Instantly, he arrived in front of the black-winged angel.\n\"!!!\"\nMao Miaomiao sensed danger. He burst out his strength and broke from Leo's domain.\n\"YOU CAN NEVER DEFEAT ME, LEONARDO!! I HAVE THE SUPERIOR PHYSIQUE AND CULTIVATION BASE!!\"\nLeo couldn't hear Mao Miaomiao's scream in space, but his muscle memory remembered what he needed to do to defeat the doctor. After all, Leo had already defeated him a thousand times during the long process of meditation earlier.\nHe reached out and grasped Mao Miaomiao's neck with his left hand. His right hand returned the staff of singularity to his storage ring and clenched into a fist.\nBOOM\nLeo's right fist directly hit Mao Miaomiao's face. The latter's head directly exploded and splattered tissues everywhere.\nLeo didn't stop there. He spread miasma of death to capture every piece of Mao Miaomiao's flesh to find his true soul.\nLeo had done this a thousand times already. It wasn't hard to find the guy's soul.\n\"IMPOSSIBLE!!\"\n\"There you are.\"\nThe soul of Doctor Mao Miaomiao emerged from one of his brain tissues. The black miasma tied his soul's arms and legs while it seeped into his transparent body.\nMao Miaomiao's soul screamed in pain and slowly dissipated. However, the guy utilized his life-saving skills again.\n\"RETURN TO ZERO!\"\nAs soon as Mao Miaomiao uttered the word, Leo deeply frowned. The shadows in the simulation mode only used this technique for the sake of combat, not fleeing. However, Mao Miaomiao attempted to use it to save his skin and flee with all his might.\nTime was rewinded, and Mao Miaomiao's soul and body slowly restored themselves. As for Leo, he was rooted in the same place because of the time law.\nLeo forcefully shattered the restraint effects. He then threw a punch at Mao Miaomiao's face to kill him again.\n\"NO WAY IN HELL I'LL LOSE TO YOU!\"\nMao Miaomiao pulled out his secret weapon from his storage ring. But instead of swinging it toward Leo, he turned around and targeted an invisible string that only he could see.\nThe sword was known as the Katana of Karmic Severance. It was his precious artifact that he got from Divine Elf Matriarch Eleanor.\n\"KARMA SEVERENCE! DIE!!\"\nMao Miaomiao cut a transparent karmic string, which connected him and Essen!\nSWUA\nAs soon as it was cut, Leo flinched and his punch was halted. He only felt a slight discomfort, but his body trembled as if he had lost something important.\nUsing this opportunity, Mao Miaomiao bellowed and used his teleportation technique. He vanished and reappeared 200 lightyears away from Leo.\nMao Miaomiao turned around and burst into laughter.\n\"Ha…Hahaha. HAHAHAHAHAA!! BRAT! THAT WAS GOOD! YOU WERE GOOD! You must have worked hard for such power! Too bad for you, you're still naïve and inexperienced! You can't possibly beat me, the consort of Divine Elf Matriarch! I HAVE HER PROTECTION!\"\nHe believed that he had escaped from Leo's grasp. He also learned that Leo might have already surpassed him in time and space law's mastery. Still, Mao Miaomiao believed that he had a superior cultivation base and physique as Leo flinched from the previous attack.\nSevering karma was one of many killing moves of a karmic sovereign. As he could see and govern karma, he could decide the fates of mortals, immortals, deities, and even sages. Mao Miaomiao could even dictate anybody's luck and create low-grade fate crystals!\nAs Leo failed to react to Mao Miaomiao's karmic severing cut earlier, Mao Miaomiao was confident that Leo's true strength might be in the entity realm at best.\n\"Next time, I'll come prepared, brat! I won't be playing around anymore. I'll search for your karma strings and severe it! I'll find your karma of existence and destroy it! Then, you will disappear from this universe forever! HAHAHAHAHA-PU!\"\nWhile Mao Miaomiao was in a good mood, a fishing hook appeared out of nowhere and entered his mouth. The fishing hook pierced through Mao Miaomiao's upper gum while the fishing line was pulled.\n\"AAAAAAHHHHH!! WHO DARE?!\"\nMao Miaomiao turned around. Then, he found a statue of an elderly fisherman, holding a fishing rod. Floating behind him were Mu-Nyang, Lucky, and Meowmeow.\nThe guardian statue \"Kitten\" returned from the Orlando Mystic Realm to help.\nMao Miaomiao widened his eyes and gawked at the fisherman. He recognized the old man's face.\n\"OVERLORD XIAOMAO?!\"\nThe guardian statue lightly snorted.\n\"What? You stole the original's blood and made it yours. Don't you think that Leonardo can't do the same?\"\n\"Y-YOU ARE HIS CLONE?! IMPOSSIBLE! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A SOUL!!\"\n\"I might not have his soul, but I know how to infuse my soul into somebody else's body. You were the one who taught me, Doctor Mao.\"\n\"…You… ASLAN?!\"\nThe statue of the elderly fisherman transformed into a middle-aged human scientist in a lab coat. His face shapeshifted into the male parent in Simba's photo.\n\"Surprised motherfucker. YOU AIN'T GETTING AWAY!\"\n\"YOU CAN'T KILL ME! I HAVE A SUPERIOR PHYSIQUE AND CULTIVATION BASE-\"\nPU\nPU\nPU\nMu-Nyang pierced through Mao Miaomiao's chest using his tentacle. Meowmeow beheaded the doctor with his katana. As for Lucky, he glared at Mao Miaomiao and burnt his internal organs with his flame domain.\nAslan, aka Kitten, pulled his fishing rod and dragged out Mao Miaomiao's soul from his body. His fishing hook and line bound the doctor's soul and dragged him along.\nAfter the soul was captured, Mu-Nyang opened his mouth and ate the remaining flesh and blood of Mao Miaomiao, stopping him from coming back to life.\nMao Miaomiao struggled to break free. He tried to use his favorite skill again.\n\"RETURN TO ZERO!\"\nBut this time, it couldn't be activated.\nAslan scoffed at Mao Miaomiao.\n\"Who do you think I am? I'm using the clone of Overlord Xiaomao as a vessel. What cultivation base do you think he has, idiot?\"\n\"NO! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! OVERLORD XIAOMAO IS JUST AN ENTITY! HE CAN'T BE THIS STRONG!\"\n\"Silence, bitch!\"\nAslan slapped Mao Miaomiao's soul face. A portion of the spirit disappeared.\nMeowmeow glared at the doctor's soul. He turned to Aslan and made a request.\n\"Let's kill him. He deserves a thousand deaths for what he did to us.\"\nAslan smirked. \"Relax, boy. I know you hold a grudge, but we still need the guy.\"\n\"Why?\" Meowmeow wasn't happy with Aslan's decision.\nAslan snickered and shifted his gaze toward Mu-Nyang. The latter pouted and spat several crystal balls out.\n\"I have a total of 17 earth fate crystals and 4 sky fate crystals, munya.\"\nAslan tilted his head, gesturing that Mu-Nyang still had more.\nMu-Nyang pouted and spat another one. However, this one forced Mu-Nyang to puke a moon-sized crystal out of his large head.\n\"And one entity fate crystal, munya.\"\nAslan snickered and collected everything.\n\"Good job. Now, take this bastard's crystal as well.\"\n\"Okay, munya!\"\nMu-Nyang widely grinned. He opened his massive mouth, revealing a million sharp fangs under him. His tentacles wrapped around Mao Miaomiao and pulled him into his mouth. At the same time, Aslan removed the hook and the fishing lines for Mu-Nyang to eat the soul.\n\"NOOOOOOO!!\"\nMu-Nyang's fangs and teeth turned into a grinder. He crushed the doctor's soul to pieces and digested him.\nAslan nodded in approval.\n\"Mu-Nyang. Don't destroy everything. Let that bastard's soul reincarnate as one of your dantian universe's population and torture him until he's traumatized. Trap him in there and let him suffer an ill fate for at least a decillion years! Make him suffer! Oh, don't forget to extract his fate crystals in his soul. Leonardo will need those.\"\n\"Okie, munya!\" Mu-Nyang laughed. He loved playing with his victim's souls.\nInside Mu-Nyang's universe housed 100,000 souls of Fenrir werewolves. He planned to degrade these guys into something nastier and stupider than their previous race – The gnolls.\n\"Let's go home and help our master.\"\nThe business was over. The four guardian statues reverted to their casual appearance and flew back home.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, a disaster struck at home.\nEsen, who had been commanding her undead troops and standing on the parking lot's top floor, collapsed. She then stopped breathing, and her heart ceased functioning.\nA transparent karma string, which had linked her with Leo, fell next to her body.",

Their leader silently observed the battle from afar. On the other hand, the troops panicked as they lost contact with their operators.\n\"Your Excellency! We can't communicate with our mothership anymore!\"\n\"My lord. Our colony might have been destroyed. What should we do?\"\nOverlord Milo was silent. He narrowed his eyes and kept his eyes on Leo, but he didn't know that he was the Florida Man he had been looking for.\n\"Avoid that place. We'll go kidnap and kill other Nu'Earthe of this planet!\"\n\"But the colony…\"\n\"Screw the colony. I can drag you useless idiots home whenever I want to! Follow me and shut up!\"\n\"Y-Yes, my lord.\"\nThe vanguard team departed from the city and flew northeast.\nWhile flying, Overlord Milo thought of a certain Ohio man, who gave him the wrong coordinate of Florida Man. He grumbled and inwardly cursed him.\n'What a waste of time! I could have spent my precious time searching for Florida Man! Because of that stupid elf, I lost my colony star, and my team is stranded here. Well, I'm gonna pretend that we're busy fighting on this planet and retreat after I get my war trophies. The elves can't blame me if I bring home a bunch of Nu'Earthes.'\nThe group ignored the scenery and made their way toward a mountain range, where a certain dual-cultivation sect was located.\n30 minutes later, Overlord Milo found the hidden sect and a large city. He laughed and ordered his men.\n\"Capture everybody! We need war trophies to show those idiot elves that we WORKED. When we return, we will get our remuneration and reimbursement for our destroyed colony!\"\nThe werewolves stopped thinking about their destroyed base. They eyed the panicking mortals and sneered.\nThe group of immortals and deities launched their attacks, while the mortals did their best to resist and retaliate. Situ Nantian, Murong Qi, and the people of Ouyang Clan united to fight back.\nAlthough the city of Tappaya City and the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect housed many experts, they all failed to resist. Within 10 minutes, they were either captured or killed.\nSitu Clan, Ouyang Clan, Murong Qi, and half of the cultivators from the city were taken away. As for the city and the sect, they were left in ruins.\nOverlord Milo didn't waste time. He gathered his subordinates and summoned a magic shopping system. He purchased a mass-teleportation scroll by spending 100,000 years of lifespan. Then, he brought his people away from this planet.\n.\n.\nAfter losing contact with Overlord Milo and Overlord Max, Captain Ingof Jack made a decisive decision. He relayed his order with a heavy heart.\n\"… Retreat. Recall the battleships and detonate all unmanned drones.\"\nThe crewmates were silent. They lowered their heads in regret that they shouldn't have followed the order of Overlord Mao, who abandoned them during a critical time. Everybody gnashed their teeth in frustration.\nThe cube mothership gently traveled forward, retrieving the surviving battleships. Several drones also flew back from the planet. As for the jets and the drones in the atmosphere, they rearranged their formation and charged toward Leo's domain.\nThe jets performed a kamikaze attack on Leo's buildings!\nIngof Jack didn't bother waiting for the result of the suicide attack. He counted the number of surviving battleships and operated the navigation console in front of him. He pressed a few buttons and put his palm on the flat glass to confirm his identity.\nDING\nThe cube mothership slowly faded to nothingness as it teleported back to the Swastika Galaxy.\n.\n.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nJets and drones crashed into Leo's farms, pylon tower, apartments, houses, warehouses, granaries, and the recycling center. The west slum was annihilated while the Tang Clan's manor was leveled because of the suicide jets.\nThe pony team ignored every building, but they surrounded Leo's shopping mall. They used everything necessary to shoot down oncoming jets, which targeted their main base.\nLightning bolts, lasers, and various Qi techniques shot down jets and drones nearby. Taxi and Ricardo got sweaty as they worked the hardest.\nWhile the two horse monsters fought, they gained an insight. Both Ricardo and Taxi transformed and ascended. Their lower bodies retained the horse part, but their neck and head were replaced by a humanoid upper torso, arms, and human heads.\nA nightmare centaur and a unicorn centaur emerged for the first time!\nBoth Taxi and Ricardo took the first step into the immortal realm. They were no longer regular monsters but mythical monsters.\nThe black and white centaurs panted as their Qi was almost depleted after they had shot down ten thousand drones and jets. They were on the verge of collapsing from exhaustion.\nAs they were about to give up, the onslaught was over. The last suicide bombers were shot down by Gao Yan and Jin Yong.\nAll horses fell to the ground as they were dying to take a long rest. Some of them neighed and begged for water.\n\"…Smash.\" (Anybody, I need water.)\n\"Smash.\" (I wish I had an apple.)\n\"…S-Smash?\" (Am I dreaming? Why am I seeing a sexy zebra twerking her butt at me? Hey, come here. Let me smash that!)\nEverybody was out of commission. Had their enemies pressed the attack, they would have lied there and waited for their demise as their minds already gave up fighting.\nWhile the ponies got their precious rest, a commotion took place on top of the parking lot. Ivy, who had let her troops combat the intruders, returned to her master's side and discovered something shocking.\nEsen collapsed. Her heart also stopped beating!\n\"YOUR MAJESTY!! WHY?! WHAT HAPPENED?! MEDIC!!\"\nIvy injected her Qi into Esen's chest, but the latter's dantian didn't react to her energy. Instead, Ivy's Qi leaked out of Esen's pores and orifices.\nlightsΝοvel Beatrice rushed in. She fed Esen the \"Hope and Dream\" pill, which she had kept for emergencies. This was Leo's strongest healing medicine.\nAfter feeding Esen the pill, the latter's complexion looked better. Her heart woke up and resumed its duty. Her lungs reacted and began pumping air.\nHowever, Esen didn't wake up.\nBeatrice and Ivy frowned. They looked at each other.\n\"Let's ask His Majesty for help,\" Ivy suggested.\nBeatrice nodded. She looked up to find Leo in the void.\nCoincidentally, Leo also rushed back to his domain as he had a hunch. He flew toward the parking lot building and found the group.\nLeo flinched when he found Esen sleeping on the hard floor. He instinctively touched his chest as he couldn't feel their connection.\nSomething was cut. Leo was sure that Mao Miaomiao did something to him and Esen before he escaped.\n'That bastard! What did he do?!'\nLeo sat next to Esen's body. He pried open her mouth to tease her.\n\"Wake up, princess. If you don't wake up, I'll finger your throat and play with your uvula.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen didn't react. Only her subordinates stared at Leo's face, questioning his joke and timing with their expressions.\nAs Leo didn't get any answer, he stopped playing. He carried Esen in his arms and brought her to his bus. After reaching his room, Leo rested her on his bed.\nIvy and others followed Leo into his room. They looked at him.\n\"What happened to her, Your Majesty? Do you know anything?\" Asked Ivy.\nLeo couldn't answer. He had a feeling that he knew the answer. But at the same time, he was clueless. Thus, he pondered out loud.\n\"Sleeping beauty curse? Do I need to kiss you to wake you up?\"\nLeo put his theory into action. He leaned over and kissed Esen in front of her subordinates, hoping to end this farce as soon as possible.\nWhen their lips touched, Leo recalled the hot night they had. He remembered that Esen tried to bite his lips, but her fangs couldn't do anything to his flesh.\nThinking of the pleasant past hurt Leo's feelings in this situation. He wished Esen would wake up soon.\nLeo parted his lips with hers. He gazed at her peaceful sleeping face.\n\"Hey, brat. Stop playing. Wake up.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen remained asleep.\n\"Dammit. WAKE UP!\"\n\"…\"\n\"I SAID. WAKE! UP!\"\nLeo screamed at Esen's face, but she was still out.\nThe crowd silently waited for Leo to show them another miracle. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.\nOne of the liches whispered to his friends.\n\"Hey, should we try to resurrect her as an undead? Then, we let His Majesty cure her again.\"\nLeo overheard that. He widened his eyes as he was enlightened. Thus, he brought out the staff of singularity to enhance his necromancy power.\nBut as Leo was about to use the power of necromancy on Esen, Ivy, and Beatrice grabbed his arms. Although they didn't have enough strength to stop him, they reminded Leo.\n\"Your Majesty! Her Majesty is still alive! You can't turn her into an undead while she's alive! If you do, she will be in a lot of pain!\" Ivy warned Leo.\n\"She is alive. Necromancy is unnecessary!\" Beatrice also didn't like what Leo was about to do.\nLeo listened to the women and snorted. He glanced at them.\n\"Then, any better idea? Why is she in comatose?\"\n\"…That's.\"\nIvy and Beatrice couldn't explain either. They lowered their heads.\nEverybody also avoided eye contact with Leo. None of the undead legions understood why Esen was in this condition.\n\"Calm down, master. I can explain.\"\n\"!!!\"\nWhile everybody was in confusion, one of Leo's guardian statues entered the bus. He was none other than Kitten, aka Aslan.\nThe fisherman statue shrank his body to match Leo's size. He walked into the room.\nThe crowd of elves and Molg tribesmen parted ways for the fisherman statue to enter. Aslan stood at the foot of the bed and lowered his head to greet Leo.\n\"Kitten?\" Leo was surprised. \"Oh, right. I forgot about you. Did you come back from the mystic realm to help us fight? You're quite considerate.\"\nAslan snickered. \"Let's save the pleasantry for another occasion. Let's look at the patient first.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows. For some reason, this fisherman didn't act or talk like a fisherman. Instead, he sounded like a mature doctor from a hospital.\nAslan approached Esen and used his fingers to open her eyelids. Light came out of Aslan's fingertips as if they were flashlights.\nThe fisherman checked the response of Esen's iris, but she didn't react. He closed her eyes and deeply sighed.\n\"Master, have you ever heard about the term Karma Severance?\"\n\"Karma Severance?\"\n\"It's going to be a long story. Also, please excuse us.\"\nAslan glanced at Ivy, Beatrice, and their companions. He gestured that he wanted to be with Leo alone.\nIvy pouted, \"Can some of us stay?\"\nAslan shook his head. \"Your cultivation base is too low. Learning about advanced terms and techniques of the higher realms will disrupt your growth and dao heart. I don't want to traumatize you.\"\n\"…\"\nBeatrice firmly nodded in understanding and turned around. She waved her hands, asking her colleagues to leave.\nIvy was unwilling to leave. But as there was nothing she could do, she grudgingly left the room and left Aslan and Leo alone.\nThe door was closed. Aslan waved his finger to create a sound-protected domain to isolate their voices.\n\"So,\" Leo crossed his arms. \"What do you know that I don't know?\"\n\"Alright. I'll explain.\"",

He repeated what he had learned so far.\n\"So, there's a glitch in the karma river because that asshole cut her karma string. Do I understand it correctly?\"\nAslan shook his head. \"You can't compare the karma river to a computer. It's Mother Nature's finest creation and a threshold to separate entities from non-entities, and karma sovereigns from entities. Entities like me and other guardians are comparable to client users while karmic sovereigns are super users.\"\n\"What about the developers?\"\nAslan gave Leo a meaningful look. He concealed his mischievous thought with a smile. \"I have no clue about that, but I'm positive that he's harmless to you, master.\"\n\"Are you sure? How do you know that the person's a \"HE\"?\"\n\"It's a figurative of speech. Would you like me to address his pronoun as they/them or she/her?\"\n\"Never mind.\" Leo rolled his eyes, \"Talk about the trustworthiness of that guy. Are you sure about it?\"\n\"Of course, master. I'm very sure.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo had a feeling that Aslan hid something from him. He planned to fight the latter's shadow in the simulation mode at least 10,000 times to get his knowledge and skills later.\n\"Any, back to the previous topic. The Karma River is the gathering place of souls. Every time a soul is destroyed, a new soul will be born to become its replacement. When people die, their souls are dragged into the river so that they can be recycled… Ahem… reincarnated again. As for Esen, her soul is still inside her body because she hasn't died yet. It's just a little tricky. Her karma has been cut by a karmic sovereign, whose authorization surpasses the River of Karma. We can't use the Karma River's system to cure her.\"\nSo far, Aslan taught Leo about the karma river and its usage.\nIn this universe, there were seven karma rivers. Each of them was located at the center of a galaxy cluster. Every karma river housed 9.2 quintillion soul embryos of mortals, immortals, gods, and sages, which waited for their queue to be reincarnated into the universe.\nHowever, at the bottom of the rivers, there were other nasty things that only sages, entities, and karmic sovereigns were aware that they existed.\nKarma eggs of every mortal, immortal, god, and sage were hidden there. Many people called it Akashic Records. Some named them books of gods even though they were crystal-like eggs.\nThose eggs were the shells that the soul embryos left behind as the owners had already been reincarnated. However, the connection between the souls and the eggs persisted in the form of karma strings.\nThese karma strings were the things that sages, entities, and karmic sovereigns could toy or tamper with, depending on their cultivation base. For example, Sages could only temporarily cut the strings to kill the targeted souls. Entities could erase them permanently while they were immune to a similar trick. As for karmic sovereigns, they could tamper the souls to their liking, including putting a curse on any soul or blessing them with misery and misfortune.\nAslan reminded Leo.\n\"You see, master. When you revived her and purified her undead curse, you accidentally switched the link between her soul embryo's shell and her soul. You tied her existence with yours. Therefore, when that moron cut her karma string, she lost her connection to you. As a result, she lost her source of life force.\"\nLeo looked at Esen's face and let out a sigh of relief. \"Forget about the mumbo jumbo things. Teach me like I'm 10 years old. What do I have to do to fix her?\"\n\"To fix a patient with a severed karma curse, we need a karmic sovereign's help. Actually, you can also…\"\n\"Ahem.\" Aslan hid his grin and came up with an idea. \"How about we seek help from a karmic sovereign?\"\nLeo gave Aslan a meaningful look. He shook his head. \"I know that you know I can help her. Teach me how to do it. Again, teach me and use the vocabulary of a 10-year-old. No big words or stupid jargon.\"\n\"Alright, master.\" Aslan couldn't help but laugh. \"Have you created a karmic river in your dantian universe, master?\"\n\"What is that? How do I create one?\"\n\"Okay. This is gonna take a while. It's okay. This daddy will do his best.\"\n\"…Daddy? What the hell are you talking about?\"\n\"Never mind, master. Forget what I said. Hehehe.\"\nThe lecture continued for the entire day.\n.\n.\nThe next day morning, Aslan left the bus. As soon as he came out, Ivy, Beatrice, and their colleagues surrounded the living statue.\n\"How is our empress, guardian?\" Ivy clenched her hands together.\nAslan smirked. \"You don't have to worry about her. Your emperor has it under his control from the very beginning.\"\n\"R-Really? Can His Majesty really cure her?!\"\n\"You underestimate your emperor, my dear. You don't even realize how capable he actually is. Oh, well. I spoke too much. Just give him time, and everything will be revealed.\"\n\"…\"\nAslan excused himself and returned to the flying island.\nAs soon as Aslan left, Ivy rushed into the bus.\nDONG\nHowever, something prevented her from getting in. There was a transparent barrier, blocking everybody from reentering the motorhome.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you.\" The sound transmission of Aslan entered their ears. \"For the sake of your emperor's mental health, I've blocked the access to the vehicle. Until he completes what he is trying to do, none of you can enter the bus.\"\n\"HEY!!\"\nIvy screamed in frustration. The others were also annoyed as the bus was their living quarter.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo sat on a chair next to the bed. He closed his eyes to meditate and sink his consciousness into the dantian universe inside his body.\nThe universe was roughly shaped as Leo hadn't properly arranged his galaxies and star systems yet. Most of them still orbited around the rainbow sun, aka the core of Leo's universe.\nLeo floated in the void, gazing at the rainbow sun. He frowned for a moment as he noticed how the sun collected strange liquid and turned it into a sea of orbital rings.\nAs Leo had no idea what they were, he ignored it. Instead of inspecting his universe, he opened the simulation mode and browsed for an opponent. Leo filtered the search menu to find two individuals – Kitten and Mao Miaomiao.\nLeo hadn't done with the shadow of Mao Miaomiao yet. He needed to learn more about the karma severing skill that the mysterious doctor had. As for Kitten, aka Aslan, Leo suspected that the statue didn't tell him everything. He planned to extract memory and information from his shadow.\nDING\nThe details of Aslan appeared in the simulation system menu.\n.\nName: Dr. Aslan \"Kitten\" Ariel\nRace: Elemental Spirit\nAge: 50,120\nCultivation Base: 5-Law Entity\nSkills: Law of Genes, Law of Souls, Law of Creation, Law of Karma Fishing, Law of Soul Destruction, Dao of Guardian, Dao of Ocean King, Dao of Soul Scientist\nSpecials: Shadow of Transcended Singularity, Curse of Karmic Sins, Overlord Xiaomao's Bloodline, Blessings of Overlord Xiaomao\nFavorite Weaponry: Fishing Rod of Karma Oceania's King\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nThe guy had quite a potential in his final form. Unfortunately, his cultivation ceiling was stuck at the entity realm, which was a stage lower than the karmic sovereign realm.\nLeo didn't mind it. At least, Kitten seemed more reliable than the other guardian statues.\n\"How many skills do he have? One, two, three… eight? So 8,000 wins for all skills and an additional 2,000 for his weapon. Oh, well. Time to grind.\"\nLeo cracked his fist and began the simulation mode. He summoned Aslan's shadow to fight first as he seemed easier than Mao Miaomiao's shadow.\nAs soon as the shadow appeared, Leo wasted no time. He stopped time and punched the shadow in the guts, destroying the doctor's body in one punch.\nHowever, an artificial soul of Aslan's shadow escaped. It resisted the domain of time and pointed its finger at Leo's face. Then, a fishing line came out from its fingertip and pierced through Leo's head!\n\"!!!\"\nLeo was shocked. This was the first time that someone managed to stab him. However, he didn't feel that his physique was harmed or injured.\nThe fishing line didn't harm Leo's physical body in the simulation. Instead, he caught Leo's simulated soul. Aslan's artificial soul shouted and pulled Leo's soul out of his body.\n\"CRAP!\"\nFor the first time, Leo's soul was ejected from his body in the simulation mode.\nAslan's shadow didn't stop there. He reanimated his fleshly body to protect his soul. Then, he created a frog out of nothingness and pulled Leo's soul into a frog!\nAs Leo was unfamiliar with his new soul form, he failed to react on time. Aslan's shadow stuffed Leo's soul into the frog!\nWhen Leo came back to his senses again, he found the gigantic body of Aslan's shadow. He tried to lift his hand to fight back, but strength left him.\n'What the hell?!'\nThe next thing he knew was an incoming fist. Aslan's shadow's fist came down and crushed the animated frog while Leo's soul was still trapped inside.\nBOOM\nLeo's vision turned black for a moment. A few seconds later, he woke up from a trance and found himself hovering in the void.\nDING\n<You have lost in the simulation mode. Please try harder.>\n\"…\"\nHe lost!\nLeo lost to a clone of his guardian!\nLeo lost to an entity that was supposed to be weaker than Mao Miaomiao!\n\"…Crap. Isn't he quite strong?! What the hell? Isn't he supposed to be weaker than the other guy!?\"\nHe hadn't realized yet that Aslan was also a clone of Overlord Xiaomao. There were many abilities that Aslan's shadow could borrow from the karmic sovereign, which an entity like him shouldn't have. Moreover, the blessings of Overlord Xiaomao and \"Shadow of Transcended Singularity\" enhanced his abilities, raising his strength enough for him to be capable of killing Leo.\nInstead of feeling down, Leo was excited. He loved this harmless fight so that he could experience death as many times as he wanted. He could also spy on his future opponents and learn which type of abilities worked on him.\n\"I want that weapon. That thing is dangerous enough to negate my raw power. Also, what is that dao or law? I want to try using those!\"\nLeo summoned Aslan to fight him again.\n10 hours in the real world was 10,000 hours, aka 417 days in the simulation mode. Leo fought only Aslan as he tried to get familiarized with the soul-related abilities.\nHis fight record was horrible as Leo kept losing to the law of soul destruction of Aslan. But after battling him 50,000 bouts, Leo managed to get his first 1,000 wins.",

He picked the Laws of Souls as it might give him clues about soul attacks and fundamental knowledge.\nDING\n<You have chosen to learn the Laws of Souls.>\n<Unlocking the memory…>\nA flood of memories flashed into Leo's mind. Countless texts appeared in front of Leo's eyes at entered his brain like a stream of water vanishing into a sinkhole.\nSeveral hours in Leo's dantian universe passed. He slowly came back to his senses after digesting so much knowledge. He felt like he had read and memorized over a billion pages of scriptures.\n\"Was it that SIMPLE?!\"\nLeo was taken aback by the sudden enlightenment. He understood why he was so weak against Aslan's attacks that he wanted to smack his head into a wall in shame and frustration.\n\"I guess I never used the power of soul… or the basic power of sages at all! Man, this is why I shouldn't skip tutorials in games. I feel like I've jumped into a challenger-ranked game while my skill is only comparable to silver. What a mess.\"\nFrom what Leo had learned, the power of Laws was an ability or an authority to enforce one or more of the universe's absolute laws upon their enemies. For example, an entity who comprehended the Laws of Sword could command any sword in the universe to cut down their enemies.\nHowever, there was an interesting exception. When two or more entities comprehended the same laws and they fought, the entities would be restricted and banned from borrowing power from the universe. If they really needed to fight, they could only rely on their Qi and life force to fuel the power of laws. This exception existed to prevent multiple entities with the same laws from getting stuck in an endless battle while borrowing and depleting the primal Qi of the universe.\nAgain, this rule only applied to entities with the same power of laws. It didn't apply to karmic sovereigns, who could bend the laws of the universe at will.\n\"The laws of souls dictate that all souls must be connected to a vessel, aka a fleshly body, to exist in the universe outside of the karma river. Anybody who violates these laws is subjected to divine punishment. That's the general idea, but those motherducking minor sections are a headache. Dammit. I'm trying to cultivate here, but this whole thing is a fucking haven for lawyers!\"\nLeo recited the knowledge he just obtained to make sure that he correctly memorized them.\n\"Section 1, souls exist for the universe and the rivers of karma. Their existence solely belongs to the universe.\"\n\"Section 2, souls can only exist if one of the Karma Rivers contains one of their soul embryos or the soul's shells.\"\n\"Section 3, souls may reincarnate into a mortal. They cannot be reincarnated into immortals, deities, sages, entities, or superior entities.\"\n\"Section 4, souls who reincarnated must return to the karma river of their birth when they died…\"\nLeo's expression turned dark when he said the laws using his own words and understanding. He kept reciting until he reached a certain section.\n\"Section 5, every mortal, immortal, deity, and sage in this universe must stay connected to their karma the river of karma by maintaining their karma threads.\"\nThis section was related to the karma strings that Mao Miaomiao had tampered with. Leo believed that he hit the jackpot, but the following sections made him confused.\n\"Section 5.1, if any mortal, immortal, deity, or sage's karma thread is disconnected to the river of karma by accident, intentional, or by the third party's act, their soul will be considered as THE STRAY.\"\n\"Section 5.2, THE STRAY is subjected to reconnect to one of the karma rivers within one year after they lost connection with their origin karma river.\n\"Section 5.3, THE STRAY who fails to reconnect their soul to any karma river within one year will be permanently deleted by the universe… what?\"\n\"Section 5.4, THE STRAY who returns to the karma river will automatically abandon their previous vessel and wait for their new reincarnation process… HEY!\"\nLeo stopped reciting the laws as he was concerned about Esen. Aslan taught him that Esen's karma thread was connected to him, but Leo was not the river of karma. He was confused about how this worked.\nBut as Leo fell into a deep thought and recited the rest of the laws in his mind, he found a loophole in the laws. It never stated WHOSE karma river that a soul had to be connected with.\n'She connected to me. But when she lost her connection, she fell unconscious. So… I need to reconnect her to me, is that right?'\nLeo gained a new hope. He was glad that he spent over a year in this universe fighting Aslan's shadow clones.\nHowever, the knowledge of basic laws was not enough for Leo. He needed more, and he needed to learn how to utilize karma threads and karma laws better.\nThe answer to Leo's question was not Aslan's other skills. Instead, it had to do with the lower cultivation realms that Leo had skipped.\n\"To learn how to use karma threads, I need to learn the basics first. I know about dao domains, soul domains, and providence domains. But I haven't learned a sage's ability or domain yet.\"\nLeo let out a long sigh while he searched for other people to fight in the simulation mode so that he could rob their skills. He filtered the search menu and showed only sages, whose cultivation base was one stage above the deity realm.\nA new list appeared on the simulation system screen. The name of Overlord Max was on top of the list.\n.\nName: Max, the Overlord of Bulldogs\nRace: Fenrir Werewolf\nAge: 100,238\nCultivation Base: 4-Karmic Thread Sage\nSkills: Authority of True Bite, Authority of Territory Marking, Authority of Scent, Authority of Intimidating Bark\nSpecials: Fenrir Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Soul Piercing Fangs\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nThe next tier of domains was the dao authority. However, in this case, Max had a bunch of useless authority as he practiced useless daos when he was a mortal.\nLeo laughed at the skill list. Although he didn't need those authorities, he needed something to learn as a reference. Thus, he tried fighting Overlord Max's shadow a thousand times.\n.\n.\nTwo days after Leo had gone into seclusion, he opened his eyes and returned to the real world. In total, he spent over 2,000 days or over 5 years in his dantian universe to train.\nHis gaze, his expressions, and his aura seemed softer than before. The domineering rainbow aura around Leo receded to his flesh as if he had learned how to conceal or suppress them.\nLeo sat next to Esen, who was still unconscious. His eyes swept over the room and searched for a certain thread.\nHe didn't need to look far. The karma string that Leo had been looking for was still connected to Esen, but the other end was floating in the air.\nLeo deeply sighed as this issue was too simple. He wished that he had known about this earlier.\n\"Man, I worked hard for this? Welp, talking about wasting my time.\"\nLeo reached toward the invisible thread and grabbed it. Then, he pulled the loose line toward himself and searched for the severed part. When he found the end of the line, Leo injected his Qi into it.\nRUMBLE\nThe karma thread reacted. It got longer and moved toward Leo.\nThe end of the thread entered Leo's chest even though he didn't order it to do so. Still, Leo didn't resist as he knew what and where the thread went to.\nInside Leo's dantian universe, the thread emerged and wiggled toward the stream of liquid, which orbited around the center of Leo's universe. It found one of the red karma crystals in the depth of the river and attached its end to the balls.\nNo system message warned him or informed him about the development. However, Leo could feel that his life force slowly flowed toward Esen.\nAfter reconnecting the source of the lifestream with Esen's soul, Leo lay on his bed and complained.\n\"Yeah, it explains everything. I now know why some died and some survived after they touched me. I accidentally stole their karmic threads and karma embryos.\"\nAfter the complaints, Leo turned his head and looked at the sleeping face of Esen. He snickered.\n\"You troublemaker. Now I know why your lifespan status always shows as NULL. Your lifespan is my lifespan, damn leecher. You resurrected your friends, and their karma threads link to me, too. Now, I'm their sugar daddy. You're lucky that the clock doesn't accelerate and deplete my lifespan.\"\nBecause of the past frustration, Leo came up with a silly idea. He flipped over and got on top of Esen's sleeping body.\n\"In ancient times, there was a unique way that a master could transfer their mana to their servants, who were the souls of heroes. I think we're in a similar situation. I'm your master, and your status is similar to a servant. Therefore, I'm gonna replenish your mana, okay?\"\nLeo giggled and cuddled with Esen in glee.\n.\n.\nOn the third day's morning, Esen slowly opened her eyes and woke up from her long slumber.\n\"Umm…\"\nEsen stretched her arms and legs. They were so numb that she couldn't feel them for a while.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nEsen remembered the feeling. She looked left and right. Then, she found Leo, who was sleeping soundly next to her in the same bed.\n\"!!!\"\nEsen screeched as she realized what Leo had done. She slapped and punched him several times, but he didn't budge.\nThe lich empress panted and stopped hitting Leo. She dragged her feet to the bathroom to clean herself.\nThe elf walked past the face-washing basin's mirror. A second later, she took several steps back to look at her reflection.\n\"EH?!\"\nSomething was no longer the same size as before. She looked down and widened her eyes.\n\"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CHEST?! AND WHY THE HELL IS THERE A BITE MARK ON MY… DAMMIT, GEEZER!!\"\n.\n.\nWhile Esen threw a tantrum in the bathroom, Leo's consciousness was still in his dantian universe, battling Aslan's shadow clone for the 779,999th time.\n\"HAHAHAHA! GIDGUD, BITCH!\"\nLeo burst into laughter after he caught Aslan's karma thread. He yanked it and pulled Aslan's soul toward him.\nBut the soul was tricky. He used the trick that always killed Leo.\nSoul Detonation!\nThe soul swelled and burst out the true power of an entity, whose dantian's energy volume was comparable to a karmic sovereign.\nThe blast created a supernova, instantly engulfing and devouring Leo's body and soul.\nDING\n<YOU DIED!>\n<You have been defeated. GG!>\n<Please note. GG's true abbreviation is GIT GUD, not GOOD GAME!>\nLeo's body and artificial soul were reconstructed in the simulation mode. He reopened his eyes and stared at the mocking system message.\n\"DAMMIT!\" Leo was annoyed. \"I'M SUPPOSED TO BE STRONGER ALONE! HOW THE HELL ARE THE SHADOW'S STRENGTH INCREASE!?\"\nDING\n<The simulation mode's highest difficulty reflects the ultimate form of the present fighter.>\n<Fighter Aslan Kitten Ariel's original soul is an elemental spirit, whose strength and abilities are related to your strength in real life. As you get stronger, he also gets stronger. When he gets stronger in the real world, his shadow in the simulation mode also gets stronger.>\n<Again, please GIT GUD.>\n\"…\"\nLeo wished that the system was a man or a person that he could punch in the face.",

FBI Declared That He Rizzed His Last Gyatt.\nLeo drowsily woke up after he had lost to Aslan's shadow. He dragged his feet to the bathroom to get the morning shower. Upon stepping his foot into the bathroom, Leo found Esen, gawking at her improved physique.\n\"Mamma Mia…\"\nLeo nodded in approval as the busty physique of Esen aligned with his taste. He naughtily slapped her butt and entered the shower room.\n\"Ow!\"\nEsen bent her back and pouted. She glared at Leo in embarrassment.\n\"Hey, geezer! What did you do to me?!\"\nLeo shrugged and started showering. He gasped when the cold shower hit his face and shook his head, splashing water everywhere in the bathroom. Then, he answered Esen.\n\"Nothing much. I just injected some \"LIFE FORCE\" into you. Try to open the system and check your lifespan. You'll be surprised. Oh, by the way, I have given you the authority to freely browse your lifespan or view other people's lifespan status. Try thinking about your remaining lifespan, and the menu will show up.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen had a thousand curses to scream at Leo because of the last night's activity. She wasn't angry about what Leo had done. However, she was dissatisfied that he didn't wake her up to enjoy their romantic time together.\nAlthough Esen was annoyed, she tried opening the lifespan system menu to see her lifespan status. A blue screen appeared and floated in front of her.\n.\nName: Esen Sydin IV\nAge: 10,007\nRemaining Lifespan: 69,420 Years, 11 Months, 29 Days, and 22 Hours\n.\n\"Huh?\"\nEsen vaguely remembered that she saw this status screen. It used to show her remaining lifespan as null before, but the current status screen finally revealed her remaining time and life force.\n\"What did you do to me exactly, geezer!?\" Esen turned toward Leo, who leisurely washed his long hair while he untied his braided beard.\n\"I meant exactly what I said. I gave you some life force, so you won't suddenly drop and stop breathing like the last time. If someone cuts your karma string again, you will have some backup energy to stay alive until I rescue you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Esen had no idea what Leo was talking about.\n\"It's a long story. Let me explain to you about the power of sages and entities while we're here. Oh, do you want to take a bath together? Want me to rub your back?\"\n\"…\"\nAs soon as Leo mentioned taking a bath together, Esen came back to her senses. She remembered that they were naked and were alone in a bathroom.\nWhite smoke came out from Esen's ears. As usual, her entire face was as red as ripened tomatoes. However, as she had already lost her innocence, she instinctively looked down and checked Leo's figure.\nThe abs, the lean muscles, and the wide shoulders of Leo made Esen drool. She forgot about shame.\nLeo glanced at Esen and noticed her line of sight. He smirked.\n\"Or perhaps are you interested in the morning life force injection?\"\n\"…Injection? WAIT A MINUTE!\"\n\"HAHAHA! GET OVER HERE! STICK OUT YOUR GYATT FOR THE RIZZLER!!\"\n\"WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!\"\nIt was too late for Esen to escape. Leo pulled her into the shower room and trapped her there. He pulled her into a kiss.\nEsen resisted at first. But after a minute of licking and touching, she hugged him and freed her desire.\nThe husband and wife ended up taking a morning bath together and got intimated.\n.\n.\nTwo hours later, the couple got out of the bath and put on some clothes. Leo sat on his bed while Esen sat on his lap hugging him and leaning on his chest.\nLeo explained what he knew about the sage's abilities and the entity's laws. He also warned her of the threats of karma severance and the importance of karma strings.\nEsen was enlightened. She forgot about the shame and embarrassment from before as she was more interested in Leo's true cultivation base.\n\"Since you know everything, what is your actual cultivation base, geezer?\"\n\"Can't you at least call me \"Darling\" or \"Dear\" like a happy wife for once, honey?\" Leo pursed his lips.\n\"W-W-Who's your honey?! W-Why should I call you those?!\"\n\"Meh, you're still embarrassed even after all we have done so far?\"\n\"…\" Esen lowered her head and blushed. She thought of their sexy time in the bath, and she remembered how she threw herself on him.\n\"Anyway,\" Leo gently combed Esen's silky blond hair while speaking. \"I'm definitely neither a sage nor an entity. I'm probably a karmic sovereign or something higher… I guess.\"\n\"You guess? You don't know about your cultivation base or what?\"\n\"…Something like that. I don't have a clue.\"\n\"And how the hell have you gotten this strong?!\"\n\"… I just ate everything I found. Oh, I ate so many Godzillas and contaminated snow. That's probably why.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo thought of the dark time when he was still on Earth. He struggled to save up YOL so that he could transmigrate or teleport to a better planet.\nHe didn't regret what he did. He was thankful that he managed to save up to 2 billion YOL to get here. Because of such an achievement, Leo met many people and scored himself a wife.\n\"Anyway, the crisis is over. I'll be teaching you how to grow your strength from now on, okay?\" Leo changed the subject. He measured Esen's current cultivation base again.\nShe had become a deity. However, there were only 200 stars inside her dantian universe, which she wasn't aware of yet.\n\"You said that you had no idea about cultivation. How will you teach me?\"\n\"I know a lot more than you do, wifey. Actually, I have a thousand techniques that I can impart to you directly whenever I want to.\"\n\"Liar.\"\n\"Don't believe me? Fine. I'll show you something really good. You'll have to reward me by cooking this daddy some sandwiches later, okay?\"\nLeo pressed his finger on Esen's forehead. Then, he used a technique that he learned from Aslan and Mao Miaomiao.\nThe power of laws allowed entities to borrow the power of the universe. However, the power of Karmic Dao gave the authority to a karmic sovereign to bend the laws at his will. As such, their powers usually broke common sense.\nThe memory transfer technique of Leo was also a common technique that many nascent soul cultivators could use. However, Leo employed the power of time by creating a small time domain big enough to cover their room. He slowed the time flow by 1000x so that Esen could take the time to digest all the information.\nLeo transferred the skills and techniques that he had learned from Esen's shadow. He also planned to defeat Esen's shadow 10,000 more times so that he could get the shadow's weapon as a reward. That staff would be useful for her in the future.\nEsen fell into a trance when a strange vision entered her mind. Her body tensed and stiffened while Leo calmly stroked her back to calm her.\nOne minute in reality was one thousand minutes inside Leo's domain. However, it was not enough for Esen to digest everything at once as she didn't have the miracle power of a system.\nLeo wished that he could get her a system power for self-protection.\n'What do I have to do to get her a system's power or a similar alien ring? Should I start hunting for entity fate crystals? Or should I give her one of the crystals that I have? Hmm…'\n.\nIn the end, it took Esen two hours in the real world, aka 2,000 hours in the time domain, to understand everything. She regained her senses and panted in exhaustion.\nLeo supported her and put her down on the bed. He then canceled the power of time.\n\"Good job. How is it? Can I get your approval?\"\nEsen glared at Leo with the corner of her eyes. She complained. \"You're a monster.\"\n\"Yeah, I'm not a human anymore. I know.\"\n\"Not that. You literally are a monster.\"\n\"Well, you're right.\" Leo gently patted Esen's forehead and stood up. \"I'm gonna go to work now. Take your time resting and comprehending the new techniques while this daddy is out, okay? If you want some more injection at night, you can call Ivy over and…\"\n\"GET OUT!\" Esen threw a pillow at Leo's face.\nLeo laughed and left the room.\n.\n.\nLeo exited the bus and found Esen's subordinates waiting for him. Everybody surrounded Leo.\nIvy's eyes were moist. \"How is Her Majesty?! Is she safe?!\"\nLeo smiled at the group of former undead. He was proud of her that she had so many caring subordinates.\n\"She has woken up.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEverybody widened their eyes. Ivy collapsed and sat on her butt as if her legs lost all strength. In reality, she was so relieved that she cried in joy.\nThe elves and the molg people celebrated and cheered. Their voices were so loud that everybody in the domain could hear them.\n\"Go see her, Ivy.\"\nLeo patted Ivy's head and left the parking lot building. The latter brightly smiled and dashed onto the bus along with Marc and Beatrice.\nUpon stepping out of the parking lot, another party stood there, waiting for him. They were none other than the four guardian statues, who had come to make their reports.\nMeowmeow still had some cracks on his chest, yet he was the first to kneel\n\"We have failed you. Please punish us.\" Spoken Meowmeow.\n\"Fail? What kind of failure? Failure to become a doctor before you were 10 or you failed to become 30 years old when you were 12?\"\n\"Pfft.\"\nAslan held back his laughter while the other statues gave Leo a weird look.\nMeowmeow pretended not to hear Leo's joke and proceeded with his report.\n\"We have failed to defend your buildings and many facilities. All crops on the farm have been razed to the ground. The white tree has been hit by an anti-domain gun, and its trunk has been half-broken. The sweet dream mushroom spores leak from the array, and it is infecting the ruined farm. We've managed to contain it to a certain degree, though. Also… the shopping mall's front glasses are shattered. The machine in the recycling center has been destroyed. Both apartments have collapsed. As for the pylon tower, you can see it for yourself.\"\nLeo turned to look at the pylon tower, which was the main source of yin-yang Qi.\nIt also collapsed on the ground. Only debris remained.\nMeowmeow hadn't finished yet.\n\"I also have a confession. I tried my best to defeat the invader's ringleader Mao Miaomiao, but I failed to defeat him. Because of my incompetency, the Florida Domain has been critically damaged. Please punish me.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. Sometimes, he wondered who was smarter, Leo or Meowmeow.\n\"You dumbass. Have you forgotten what my system can do?\"\nLeo opened his domain system. The grid map revealed the state of each building and how damaged they were.\nAlthough everything seemed to be in ruins, the system had a friendly button that Leo could abuse.\n[Repair All]\nThe price of this button was a whopping 100,000 YOL. However, considering how important each building was, the repair fee was worth it.\nDING\nLeo pressed the button. Instantly, everything within Florida Domain was restored to its former glory. Big and small craters were buried. Burnt areas were cleaned while buildings were fully repaired and rebuilt. Broken machines became brand new while the destroyed crops were restored. As for the pylon tower, there was no need to check as the massive crystal began producing yin and yang Qi once again.\nThat was not all. Meowmeow's chest was also repaired.\nMeowmeow widened his eyes for a moment before he slapped his face in embarrassment and shame.\n\"I forgot about this. Please kill me. I don't want to live anymore.\"\nLeo scoffed. \"What? Just because you made a clown out of yourself, you want to die now? Yeah, you're a terrible clown alright. I've been a clown for months, but I never want to die. Grow some backbones, dumbass.\"\n\"PFFT!\"\nMu-Nyang, Lucky, and Aslan held their stomach while they covered their mouth, holding back their laughter. As for Meowmeow, he blankly stared at Leo's face in a daze.\n\"…Master. You're very cruel.\" Meowmeow wanted to cry but he had no tears.\n\"You dug yourself a hole. Nobody forced you.\"\n\"DAMMIT!\"\nDue to the accumulated emotional damage, Meowmeow flew back to the flying island and reverted to a giant guardian statue. As for his colleagues, they hysterically burst into laughter.\nMinutes later, the group laughed enough. Lucky took this opportunity to report his good deeds.\n\"Master, woof! I've collected lifespan from the invaders for you, woof!\"\nDING\n<Your guardian statue \"Lucky\" has transferred his life force to you.>\n<You have gained 2,159,156 years of lifespan.>\nLeo nodded in approval. He petted the good boy while Lucky wagged his tail.\n\"Good job! You've done, well.\"\n\"I'm a good boy, woof!\"\n\"That's right. You're such a good boy!\"\nAlthough the wolf statue's body was made of mysterious hard metal, Leo petted it and rubbed its face as if the metal skin was soft and fluffy. Lucky also panted and smiled as he loved the petting.\nThe petting session didn't last long as an evil cat stepped up to steal the scene.\n\"Master, munya. I have something better, munya! Check this out!\"\nMu-Nyang poured crystals on the ground. Each ball glistened in various colors and emitted a radiance of profound aura.\nThey were earth fate crystals and sky fate crystals!",

Everything floated and disappeared into the mysterious artifact.\nDING\n<You have collected 17 earth fate crystals.>\n<You have collected 4 sky fate crystals.>\n<You have collected 1 entity fate crystal.>\nDING\n<You can assemble seven earth fate crystals and combine them into one true earth fate crystal. Will you combine the earth fate crystals?>\nFinally, the old tutorial quest could be completed. Leo was also curious about what this true fate crystal could do.\n\"Combine them.\"\n<Combining…>\nLeo's fingers radiated in brown light. The alien ring spat out a Ping-Pong-sized brown crystal ball, which landed in Leo's hand.\nAt first, Leo didn't think highly of it as it looked similar to essence stones. But then, it started producing tiny invisible tentacles around itself.\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he could sense them wiggling on his palm but he couldn't see them. He felt like he was carrying a restless tarantula spider in his hand.\n\"This kinda tickles. What is this for?\"\nMu-Nyang pointed at the pylon tower. \"You can either insert them into one of the tower's sockets or implant it into somebody's soul, munya.\"\nLeo nodded as he finally remembered the feature, but he was curious about the implanting part.\n\"What will happen if I implant this into someone's soul?\"\n\"That person will have a series of lucky streaks for a few years before the true earth fate crystal is ejected from his body, munya.\"\n\"…And, will that ejected crystal be separated into seven pieces and they need to be assembled again?\"\n\"That's right, munya!\"\n\"Isn't that practically dragon balls?!\"\n\"Dragon balls can't be combined, munya. These crystals can't summon a dragon or a genie monster with green chickenpox issues. Also, fate crystals don't grant just one or three wishes, munya. The combined crystals can grant wishes for years until their luck energy is depleted. Don't compare our holy artifacts with those knock-offs, munya!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo wiped his sweat. Dragon Ball fans would have rioted if they heard Mu-Nyang's remarks.\n\"So.\" Leo coughed and changed the subject. \"If I implant it in my soul, can it grant my wishes?\"\n\"Depends on the wishes, munya. If it's something mundane, such as growing a bigger PP, that can be done as many times as you want, munya. But if you have an impossible wish. For example, you wish to obtain an infinite lifespan to abuse the system shop. Then, you will probably get a lump sum of lifespan, and the true fate crystal will run out of energy, munya. In short, you will get your wish from \"WISH APP\" instead of what you truly desire, munya.\"\n\"…That's reasonable.\"\nLeo heard enough. He smiled and guided his guardian statues to the pylon tower, which had been fully repaired.\nThe tower never stopped supplying yin and yang Qi to the environment in the domain. Hot and cold air entwined as the Qi mixed together. Leo walked closer to the tower and welcomed the warm air.\nAt the foundation of the tower, there were round socket holes as Mu-Nyang had mentioned. Each came at a different size.\nThe tower of Leo was already level 15, and it came with 15 socket holes. However, the labels disappointed him.\nTrue Earth Fate Crystal\nTrue Sky Fate Crystal\nTrue Heavenly Fate Crystal\nThose were the available sockets. As for the superior fate crystals, they were incompatible with the current tower.\nLeo shrugged and inserted the true earth fate crystal in his hand into one of the available sockets.\nDING\nThe pylon tower's crystal changed color to brown. The foundation lifted itself off the ground while the entire structure underwent a transformation.\nAn empty fountain pool became a new addition to the tower. The embedded socket transformed into the face of a cat with an open mouth, which spilled brown water to fill the fountain pool.\nDING\nThe status of the pylon tower also changed.\n.\nYin-Yang Pylon Tower Level 15\nYin and Yang Essence Production Level (10/10)\nFire Essence Production Level (1/10)\nWater Essence Production Level (1/10)\nWood Essence Production Level (1/10)\nEarth Essence Production Level (1/10)\nMetal Essence Production Level (1/10)\nLightning Essence Production Level (0/10)\nWind Essence Production Level (0/10)\nHoly Essence Production Level (0/10)\nDarkness Essence Production Level (0/10)\nCurrent Socket: True Earth Fate Crystal (1)\nCurrent Production: Holy Water of True Earth Fate Crystal\n.\nLeo raised his eyebrows as he remembered the item's name. He recalled that the perverted Minotaur Sierra and the brain-rot Hua Taixu needed this holy water to evolve.\n\"Perfect timing! Can I use this in alchemy, too?\"\n\"You can try, munya.\"\n\"Neat!\"\nThe new holy water was not the only thing that Leo obtained. He also completed the tutorial quest, which was rotting in his system quest menu.\n.\nFate Crystal Tutorial\nPrimary Objectives:\n1 - Collect 7 Earth Fate Crystals (7/7)\n2 – Assemble 7 Earth Fate Crystals (1/1)\nSecondary Objectives:\n1 – Kill 7 Immortals (7/7)\n2 – Upgrade Humble General Store to Shopping Mall (1/1)\nPrimary Mission Rewards: Gnosis of Earth Fate, True Earth Fate Crystal, Ring of Entity Upgrade Feature\nSecondary Mission Rewards: 7 Lucky Draws, 777 Free Tickets\n.\nLeo pressed the submit button and confirmed the completion of his quests.\nDING\n<You have completed the Fate Crystal tutorial!>\n<You have obtained the gnosis of earth fate and a true earth fate crystal.>\n<You have unlocked a new feature – Inventory System!>\nAs Leo already obtained the 7 gacha tickets and 777 expansion tickets, he only got the primary mission rewards. Thus, he received ANOTHER earth fate crystal, a gnosis of earth fate, and a new feature.\nHe was slightly disappointed with the new feature. He already had a bunch of storage rings, so he didn't need a cliché game-like inventory system.\n\"Lame, boring, and uninspirational.\" Complained Leo.\n\"An owner of an imploded submarine said the same, munya.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo turned around and glared at the snarky cathulhu. The latter giggled and fled to the flying island like a naughty cat.\nAfter Mu-Nyang had left, Leo turned his attention to the pylon tower. He flickered the new earth fate crystal in his hand. He hesitated if he should add it to the tower or implant it into somebody's soul for an experiment.\n\"Kitten.\"\n\"Yes, master?\" Aslan stepped forward. He could guess what Leo wanted to ask, but he pretended not to know.\n\"How many years of lifespan will I get if I inject this into my soul?\"\n\"A million years at best.\"\n\"Then, when it is ejected from my body, can I assemble it again and put it back?\"\n\"Depleted fate crystals require a long time to recharge their luck energy, master. We'll have to leave them alone for a billion years before they can be used again.\"\n\"Meh. What a long cooldown.\"\n\"We can't help it. It's the nature of y-… I mean, this universe.\"\nAs Leo already stacked several million years of lifespan in his pocket, he didn't need to waste a rare resource in exchange for some numbers. Instead, he measured which action he should take to get the best benefit from the true earth fate crystal in his hand.\n\"Socket another or give it to wifey… Oh, hey. Kitten. If I can assemble seven earth fate crystals into a true earth fate crystal, can I do the same with sky fate crystals or others?\"\n\"Of course, master. You can even combine seven entity fate crystals into a true entity fate crystal if you have enough.\"\nLeo rubbed his alien ring to recheck the number of entity fate crystals he had collected so far.\nThe first one belonged to him when he first woke up on the alien ship. Leo got the second entity Fate Crystal from the mystic realm. And recently, he received the third one from Mu-Nyang.\nLeo needed four more.\n\"Eh, I might as well put it in the socket… or should I research it for alchemy? Can I create these with the system buildings?\"\nAslan smirked and nodded in approval. \"You're getting smarter, master. I'm proud of you.\"\n\"Does that mean I was always stupid in your eyes?!\"\n\"Of course, not. You were very smart in your own way. If we compare your IQ to the local people, you're still smarter than them by miles. It's just that… you picked up things slower than an average entity's standard.\n\"…\"\nLeo had the urge to smack the guy. However, he remembered how strong Aslan was in the simulation mode, so he left the guy alone.\n\"If you're so smart, tell me what will happen if I put another true earth fate crystal in the tower.\"\n\"It will just accelerate the production process. I suggest you should sacrifice that thing to the alchemy workshop to get a recipe or something worthwhile. I bet you will be very happy to see that, too.\"\nLeo gave Aslan a meaningful look. Somehow, this guy showed up and replaced Meowmeow as an advisor. But unlike the black-winged angel, this old fisherman seemed suspicious.\nHe put the true earth fate crystal away. Then, he turned his attention to the gnosis next.\nThe gnosis came out in the form of a pink heart-shaped crystal. Leo didn't bother inspecting it and put it back in his storage ring.\n\"Are you planning to research on that, master?\" Aslan asked to make sure.\n\"Yeah, so?\"\n\"Gnosis is different from fate crystals. You can't make it with alchemy. I suggest you should use it.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He could always get new skills and daos by defeating random cultivators and aliens that he had met. Thus, he didn't need to use an artifact to gain power.\n\"No need. I can get new daos whenever I want to. I'll just put this to research.\"\nAslan narrowed his eyes. He blinked and appeared in front of Leo to stop him.\n\"Master, I'm sorry. This time, I have to convince you to change your mind. You'll regret it if you research that thing.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"The dao of fate crystals is unique. Nobody in the universe, including the strongest karmic sovereigns, has managed to comprehend it. If you learn the dao, you will be one step ahead of other players.\"\n\"Is that so? Then, why can't I research and mass-produce it?\"\n\"As I said before. It's a unique dao. You can't produce it or mimic it no matter what. Please trust me on this.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo paused and brought the gnosis out. He flipped it around while he stared into Aslan's eyes.\n\"What else do you know? Rather, what else are you hiding from me? Why am I getting a feeling that you aren't exactly my shadow but another bastard who possesses one of my subordinates?\"\nAslan bitterly laughed and jokingly revealed the truth.\n\"I am your father.\"\n\"Yeah, right. If you're my father, I'm Luke Skywalker! Get outta here!\"\nAslan shook his head. He tried, but Leo didn't believe him.\nFortunately, Leo heeded Aslan's advice. Instead of wasting the gnosis in the alchemy workshop, he shoved the gnosis into his forehead.\nThe crystal sunk into his forehead and merged with his soul inside his brain. Then, a new knowledge entered his mind.\nDING\n<Calculating karma…>\nThe new knowledge was nothing special. It told a story of how a deity condensed his dantian and formed a universe inside him. Then, he sacrificed some of his life force to condense an artifact for his dantian universe.\nThe artifacts were called fate crystals. They represented the deity, and they contained some of his power.\nTime passed. Lifeforms grew and occupied the planets that the deity had created. The artifacts also accelerated the progress and automatically adjusted the balance of nature.\nCountless years passed. The small lifeforms either evolved to survive or died out. Some of them gained intelligence and became sentient while many creatures relied on their instinct to survive.\nIntelligent lifeforms soon dominated the habitable planets. Several of them discovered the artifacts, which the deity had left behind. The mortals quickly mistook them as tools and wielded them as weapons.\nSome insane lifeforms with mental issues made up stories and established religions around the fate crystals. Afterward, disasters struck as wars broke out because of the conflicted religions.\nThe deity who created the fate crystals noticed the commotion and descended to pacify the mortals. However, everybody mistook him for the devil and rebelled against him.\nThe deity was enraged. He confiscated the fate crystals and massacred the useless mortals, who plagued his dantian universe. Then, he stopped relying on them to increase his power.\nLeo slowly opened his eyes and deeply frowned. He looked up to the sky in a bad mood.\n\"Are you telling me that we're freaking living in someone's dantian universe or something?!\"\nAslan flinched, but he kept his mouth shut. He wryly smiled and gazed at Leo.\n\"You don't have to worry about that. Even if we are, we won't be harmed.\"\n\"How do you know about that?\"\n\"Because the owner of this universe…\"\nAslan hesitated if he should reveal the truth. Again, he changed his mind and concealed the most important information from Leo for the sake of his future.\n\"Nobody owns this universe. We aren't living in a matrix. This is our reality.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"100%.\"\n\"Hmm…\"\nLeo didn't fully believe in Aslan. Still, judging from Aslan's soft expression, he decided to trust him just this once.\n\"Fine. Also, how the hell did you know what I learned from the gnosis?\"\n\"I'm your shadow. Whatever you learned, I learn it, too.\"\n\"…Fair enough.\"\nLeo turned around and proceeded to the shopping mall. He planned to research on the new holy water and the fate crystals next.\nAslan let out a long sigh. Then, he gazed toward the sky, thinking of his wife, the other deceased foster children, and the one who ordered him to start the past inhumane experiment – Matriarch Eleanor of the Divine Elf, aka Esen's mother.\n'Eleanor. Your soul transmigration experiment was successful indeed. Rather, it was TOO SUCCESSFUL. We've awakened a monster, and your sandcastle empire will be swept away by the tsunami soon.'",

Drug Cartels Called Cops and Complained That the AI Stole Their Jobs.\nChapter 241 – Florida Man Programmed New AI to Automatically Make New Drugs in His Meth Lab. Drug Cartels Called Cops and Complained That the AI Stole Their Jobs.\nEntering the shopping mall, Leo proceeded to the workshop floor. Along the way, he ran into several groups of the west slum's population, Tang Clan's members, and his employees.\nThe people still took shelter in the underground floors as the outside situation was not cleared yet. But when they saw Leo, they cheered as if they had seen their Jesus.\n\"LORD FLORIDA MAN IS HERE!\"\n\"ARE WE SAFE YET?!\"\nLeo shrugged and assured them. \"It's over. Pack your bags and return to your homes. Oh, there's no need to hurry. I don't want any human hazard here.\"\nEverybody cheered and celebrated. Some of them rushed to the elevator and descended to the shelter floor to relay the news.\nLeo ignored them. He flew to the fifth floor and entered one of the workshops.\nThe alchemy workshops and alchemy factories had been pumping pills non-stop even though their domain was attacked a few days ago.\nWhen the working mannequins found Leo entering their workshop, they lowered their head to greet him.\nLeo proceeded to one of the cauldrons, which was about to finish making a batch of pills. When he entered the room, he found Tang Xuan and some of his clan's members there, studying the concoction process from the local mannequin.\nTang Xuan noticed Leo's arrival. He stood up and cupped his fist to salute.\n\"Lord Florida Man.\"\nLeo nodded at Tang Xuan. \"At ease. I'm here to research something.\"\nTang Xuan silently nodded and sat down in his seat. He silently observed Leo and the local mannequin.\nFor the past few days, Tang Xuan had been studying and learning by sitting here after the chaos outside was settled. He finally understood why Hua Jiashan and Wu Buyi surrendered to Leo.\nThe products of this workshop and other factories were too good.\nNormally, an alchemist sect could at best produce a hundred average cultivation pills every month. They also needed to spend a lot of materials, spirit stones, and other resources to support the alchemists. This didn't include the long arduous years of training that alchemists had to go through before they were allowed to make cultivation pills.\nOn the other hand, Leo's factories and workshops defied the local's common sense. They singlehandedly produced a thousand pills within a few days, and they didn't even need senior alchemists to oversee the process. Moreover, the pills Leo's mannequins made were rare pills, which were unavailable in the market. Only master alchemists like Tang Xuan or Tang Tian could spend decades to make some.\nDING\nThe cauldron spat out completed pills. Leo glanced at his notification message to see the result.\n<Your alchemy workshop level 15 has completed 22 Superior-Grade and 28 Pinnacle-Grade Fenrir Dantian Pills.>\nLeo once made these before. However, at that time, the quality was low. This batch of completed pills was bigger and shone brighter.\n.\nPinnacle-Grade Fenrir Dantian Pills\nIncrease poison resistance by 100% for 480 hours.\nCure inflammation and internal wounds.\nIncrease poison and metal essence by 2,000 years' worth of cultivation.\nIncrease lifespan by 2,000 years.\nFill one's stomach for 480 hours.\n.\nLeo scoffed at it as the pills could disable the consumer's sense of hunger. As Leo was not a pill eater, he disliked the pills even though one of them could bless him with 2,000 years of lifespan.\n10 days of not eating anything was not worth it. Leo could potentially gain over 10,000 years of lifespan by eating werewolf steaks or caiman's meat within a week. Thus, he'd rather sell these pills to his employees or future customers.\nLeo glanced at Tang Xuan and teased him.\n\"Want one? I'll sell it to you for 2,000 years of lifespan. Production price.\"\nTang Xuan gulped. As he had just become an immortal, his life force increased. He was certain that he had enough lifespan to get it.\n\"What's the effects, senior?\"\n\"You get 2,000 years of lifespan back. You'll also get 2,000 years' worth of poison and metal essence.\"\n\"E-Essence?!\"\n\"Yes, essence.\"\n\"I'll buy it! I'll take one!\"\n\"Good.\"\nLeo flickered one of the pinnacle-grade pills to Tang Xuan and took 2,000 years of lifespan from the old man. The latter ignored the loss of his lifespan and caught the pill in glee.\nTang Xuan excused himself as he planned to consume it. His clansmen followed after him.\nWhen the crowd had left, Leo told the mannequin to either put the pills in the supermarket or store them in the underground warehouse. He then ejected a spare true earth fate crystal from his storage ring and tossed it into the free cauldron.\nWithout hesitation, Leo pressed the research button. The fate crystal instantly vanished.\nThe sacrifice of the fate crystal was not in vain. A new screen appeared and informed Leo of its true value.\n.\nTrue Earth Fate Crystal\nThis crystal is the perfect form of an earth fate crystal. It contains the profound power of luck that no cultivator or expert can cultivate. Just by possessing a true earth fate crystal, one may experience a series of good fortune. Whatever they wish for, they will get it.\nAlthough true earth fate crystals are also a key to unlocking a person's potential, strength, and fate, they cannot command other people's fate or destiny. It is only useful for granting one's wishes and dreams.\nTrue earth fate crystals can also be used in various ways. For example, when it is linked to a spirit stone heart or a similar mineral vein, it can consume the local's Qi to produce holy water. True immortals may find them useful for their ascension. They can also be consumed to increase one's lifespan. However, the best usage is alchemy as it can be used as a catalyst to enchant a supreme artifact. The enchanted weapon will obtain the god-slaying effect, which can negate or destroy any providence domain with a touch.\nIn addition, ancient alchemists used to replicate earth fate crystals for their usage. The method has been lost for a billion years. However, you, who bear a greater destiny, have all the information you need. What a cheat, right?\n[Alchemy Recipe – Providence Enchantment]\nOne immortal-grade weapon of your choice\nOne true earth fate crystal\n[Alchemy Recipe – Earth Fate Crystal]\nA dantian crystal of a deity\nOne drop of Florida Man's blood\n1,000 years of Florida Man's lifespan\n.\n\"Oh, boy.\"\nA certain recipe was quite specific. Leo wondered if the system was toying with him.\n\"Where am I gonna find those dantians of deities? It's not like gods are cabbages that grow on farms… Ah, shit. I'm stupid.\"\nLeo remembered that he hadn't examined the war trophies after the battle yet. He thought of the dead bodies that he hadn't collected. At the same time, he was concerned if a certain plant had eaten all of them.\n'Come to think of it, I didn't see Cat anywhere during the fight. Did she escape or hide somewhere? I hope she's okay. But meh, just keep hiding. I need those dantian crystals. How many gods did I kill, I wonder?'\n.\n.\n\"ACHOOO!!\"\nMeanwhile, the man-eating plant in question was in the middle of the contaminated canyon river. She was in seclusion as she was about to break through to the immortal realm.\nRUMBLE\nEven though Cat was underwater, orange tribulation clouds followed her underwater. It merged with the water and turned into a mass of orange slime.\nThe orange slime gathered heavenly lightning inside. When it was ready, it unleashed hell upon Cat, who was in the middle of meditating.\n\"NYAAAA!!\"\nThe orange electricity flashed and dispersed in the water. Several water creatures got zapped and died. However, thunder caimans and some monster tunas resisted the electric current and ignored the anomaly.\nCat received a mild shock. She only looked up and snorted.\n\"Meow!\" (Lame. Daddy's lightning is stronger!)\nCat thought of Leo, whose punches emitted black lightning bolts. She also thought of the taste of his sweat, saliva, pee, and poop.\nShe drooled. It had been a while since she last ate Leo's fluid.\n\"…Meow.\" (I miss daddy.)\nGROWL\nCat's stomach roared. Her human head looked down. Then, she rubbed her tummy.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow…\" (I'm also hungry…)\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe orange slime never stopped unleashing orange lightning bolts and trying to kill Cat. However, only less than 1% of the power reached her.\nCat absorbed the lightning energy and converted it to her Qi. She also swallowed some of the contaminated water to get stronger.\nIt wouldn't take long for Cat to advance. She patiently closed her eyes and resumed meditating.\nAt the end of the day, Cat broke through as she wished. She shredded the heinous large body of a monster and gained a humanoid appearance. Her ears grew longer while her skin turned brown. Her face was as pretty as every average elf on Simba's planet.\nCat grew up and became as tall as a 10-year-old human girl. However, her legs still looked like tree roots. As for the previously large mouth of a chomper plant, it turned into an empty shell.\nWhen Cat came back to her senses, she turned toward her discarded carcass. Then, she began eating it to fill her new belly.\nUnfortunately, after Cat ate her former body, she was still hungry. She turned toward the caimans and tunas in the river.\nPLOP\nWhile Cat was about to hunt some crocodiles, a dead body, which got stuck in a tree, fell into the river. It was a lifeless body of an elf, who had fallen from a destroyed battleship.\nCat brightly smiled and tore the body apart in glee. She had no idea that she looked like one of them.\nAs soon as Cat touched the body of the elf, her skin transformed into a thousand tree roots, piercing into the dead body's skin. She drained the body's liquid until it turned into a mummy. When it got thin enough, she opened her wide mouth and started eating the corpse from the head down.\nCat's cultivation base rapidly grew the more she ate. She also got addicted to the unique taste of an elf.\nCLICK\nCat's teeth found something hard and solid while she was chewing the elf's meat and bones. She spat it out and found a round crystal ball, which was only the size of her finger.\nShe gave it a closer look. Then, she noticed that there were small stars inside the crystal.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (This looks like stars. But can I eat this?)\nCat put it back into her mouth and tried to chew it. Unfortunately, her teeth failed to break the crystal.\nAs Cat couldn't eat it, she spat it out and pouted. She then hurled it toward the nearest thunder caiman and killed it in one hit.",

(Done)\n- Complete at least one true fate crystal (Done)\n- Successfully defend against an invasion from another player (Done)\n- Successfully invade a player's home planet (0/1)\n- Embed a true fate crystal to a pylon tower (Done)\n- Upgrade 20 buildings to level 15 (Done)\n- Upgrade shopping mall to level 15 (Done)\n- Get a girlfriend and fail NNN!

(Done)\n- Recruit at least 100 immortals as your soldiers (Done)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nLeo stared at the quest system screen and frowned. He found a bottleneck in this phase.\nThe invasion part was impossible to complete. Leo possessed no tool or the means to invade other players' cities or planets.\n'How the hell can I invade another player's planet or city? Should I ask Meowmeow or Kitten for advice again? Eh, forget it. I'll reinforce the infrastructure of my domain first. It's still a mess.'\nLeo closed the quest menu and exited the shopping mall. He explored the west slum area.\nAs Leo had completed the Fate Crystal tutorial quest, he received 777 territory expansion tickets from the system. Each ticket could be used to expand his territory.\nIn the past, only the territory to the south could be unlocked. But at the moment, the system map changed and allowed Leo to claim any area adjacent to his domain.\nLeo counted the number of areas that he could unlock. The west area consisted of one hundred 10,000-square-meter blocks, and each required a hundred tickets or a million years of lifespan to unlock.\nThe north and south were a lot cheaper. Every unlockable territory was only 100 square meters, and it only required one ticket to use.\nAs for the east, where the Tang Clan's manor was located, the territory was a lot larger as it was a single block of 1,000 x 1,000 grid. That one-square-kilometer had a whopping price tag of five million years of lifespan or 500 expansion tickets.\nLeo counted his fingers and raised his eyebrows. Although the east territory seemed to be more expensive at a glance, the cost-effectiveness was superior to the others. Moreover, by purchasing that area, Leo could double the size of his territory.\n'Yeah. The East is cheaper. I'll double my domain's size. As for the leftovers, I'll use them to make a railway system or something… Oh, right! I have that faraway black mountain to the north. I should focus on extending my territory there so that I can establish a long-term logistic route! I'm such a genius!'\nLeo snickered. He spent 500 tickets to purchase the whole one-square kilometer to the east. Then, he unlocked a territory to the north to extend his road.\nAfter the new areas became a part of Leo's domain, yin and yang Qi in the air extended toward the new territory. A thin layer of fog crept toward the new land.\nAs if Leo had toughed everything in the area, the local plants, grasses, trees, fruits, and seedlings slightly mutated. Regular grasses turned into blue spirit herbs while trees and fruits gathered Qi and changed their characteristics.\nMeanwhile, in the north, the claimed land was still warm as it was once the territory of lava badgers. The field was calm as the magma slowly lost its temperature.\nThe northern lava field also got hit by random beams and energy missiles from the invaders. Craters and black smoke could be seen from where Leo was standing.\nThe local lava badgers were also affected. They hid underground and fled when they saw Leo.\nLeo pitied the little critters. He examined the field and found many corpses of innocent creatures.\nHe also witnessed a sad scene. A group of injured badgers surrounded one of their fallen comrades. One of them shook the body and tried to wake the dead guy up.\n'What a tragedy. Is there anything I can do here?'\nLeo walked in the air and approached the pitiful group.\nThe lava badgers noticed Leo's arrival, but they didn't flee. Instead, they hissed at him, trying to protect the corpse of their comrade.\nLeo found their behavior admirable and praiseworthy. Their courage moved Leo's heart.\n\"You guys are a lot better than humans. Very well. I'll reward your courage just this once.\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes and concentrated on his vision and sixth sense. Then, he found a ball of soul, which belonged to the deceased badger. He still hovered around his friends.\n\"You there. Do you want a second chance in life?\" Asked Leo.\nThe soul paused as if it understood Leo. Then, the ball floated toward him.\nLeo opened his palm and allowed the transparent soul to land on it. He lightly rubbed the ball.\n\"I assume you are willing to take that second chance. Alright, this incident is partly my fault since I failed to protect you. I'll offer you a new place to live.\"\nHe let out a long sigh as he thought of the knowledge, which he had obtained from Mao Miaomiao's shadow and Aslan's shadow.\nWhen a cultivator reached a deity realm, he could condense and create a universe inside their dantian to store energy. Once the deity completely condensed a dantian universe and created a habitable planet, they could create new lifeforms to populate their universe. Importing souls from the real universe was one of many ways to quicken the process.\nLeo pulled the little soul into his dantian. The little guy vanished into his body and appeared in another universe. The ball of soul automatically flew toward the river of karma and gained a new home.\nLeo didn't stop there. He stood up and swept his gaze over the field.\n\"You poor souls. If you wish to live in a place without conflict in the next life, come to me. I'll bring you to a better place.\"\nAs soon as Leo finished speaking, over 10,000 souls of fallen lava badgers floated toward Leo. He took them in without hesitation.\nAfter accepting the souls of badgers into his dantian, Leo turned his attention to the survivors next.\n\"You guys next. Do you want to serve me as my vessel? I'll provide you a better universe and a planet to live in.\"\nThe living badgers couldn't understand what Leo meant. Moreover, they couldn't see the souls of their comrades. Thus, they continued hissing.\n\"I see. Very well, I'll respect your choice. But I can't leave without compensating y'all.\"\nLeo thought of something and went back to his shopping mall. 30 minutes later, Leo returned with a hundred baskets of yin cabbages. He threw the cabbages toward the surviving badgers and declared.\n\"My domain has a bunch of food. If you lack food, come find the locals. They will feed you.\"\nThe badgers silently stared at the yin cabbages and Leo. Several of them understood Leo's gesture and took the cabbages home. As for the others, when they noticed how their friends accepted the vegetables, they also rushed toward the baskets and picked some cabbages.\nIn a few seconds, all 100 baskets were emptied. The badgers stopped being depressed and returned home happy.\nNo one but Leo knew the secret of those cabbages. They were not ordinary yin cabbages that his farms grew. Instead, they came from greenhouses, which Leo had built on top of the shopping mall.\nThose were Floridian Yin Cabbages. As for the effects of those cabbages, Leo left it to fate. He could only hope that the badgers would become an asset to his domain in the future.\nAfter dealing with the local creatures, Leo resumed his project. He built a concrete road on top of the claimed land. Then, he unlocked a new block with his tickets and kept proceeding north.\nThe claimed land was a foot higher than the wasteland. The system automatically elevated the ground and cooled the molten magma. Then, a smooth and seamless concrete road magically appeared and paved on top of the prepared land.\n277 tickets were not a lot as Leo could only build a 2.7-kilometer-long road. It was still nowhere near the Black Mountain or Cauliflower City.\nLeo was tempted to use his abundant lifespan to buy new territory to expand the road. However, he hated the idea as he could use them to buy something else worthwhile, such as RVs or motorhomes.\n'Come to think of it, it has been almost a month since I last visited the Fate Stadium. I should check the cooldown timer.'\n.\n.\nA minute in reality was 1,000 minutes in Leo's dantian universe. The new souls inside him entered Leo's personal karma river and went through a reincarnation process.\nOne of the habitable planets in the universe was a rainforest planet. However, no creature resided there except fish, lizards, and sea creatures.\nThe new souls reincarnated as newborn alligators, but they retained their previous life's memory. As they remembered the life of a badger, they adapted to the world faster than regular alligators.\nAn hour in reality passed by while Leo was busy in the real world. But these reincarnated badgers experienced 1,000 hours and went through a phase of their life.\nBecause of the local environment and abundant Qi, these young alligators became stronger than their peers. Some of them even attempted to walk on two feet to live on land.\nLeo hadn't realized it yet. His action sowed good karma, and these reincarnated badgers would become a huge asset for Leo in the future.\n.\n.\nIngof Jack knelt inside a tent, bowing his head toward a divine elf woman, who sat at a table full of document papers. He sweated profusely as he feared for his life.\nThe woman was the 7th princess and a younger sister of Esen. She was Ellen, who held the current title as the crown princess. In addition, her strength was on par with Overlord Mao Miaomiao and Overlord Kishin.\nEllen was a divine elf like Esen. She wore two sets of earrings, and she tied her hair into a braided bun. Her crimson eyeliners highlighted her sharp determined eyes of a fighter and a strong leader. She also wore a crimson military uniform similar to what the 18th-century French soldiers wore.\nBehind towers of document papers, Ellen looked at her system screen and flipped through the log files. She glanced at Ingof Jack and scoffed.\n\"So, you're saying the campaign was not your fault?\"\nIngof Jack smacked his forehead to the ground. \"Everything happened because Overlord Mao Miaomiao forced our hands. We initially plotted to utilize the guerilla warfare tactic, but Overlord Mao Miaomiao threatened to kill us if we didn't launch a full-scale assault.\"\n\"You could have pretended to attack, though.\"\n\"B-B-But he was watching our every move.\"\n\"So, if he asked you to die, will you kill yourself?\"\n\"T-That's…\"\nEllen picked up a pen on the table and wiggled it.\n\"…\"\nIngof Jack stopped moving. His body slowly relaxed as if he fell into a deep sleep while kowtowing. In reality, his soul was ejected from his body and returned to the river of karma.\nAfter cutting Jack's karma string and sending him to the afterlife, Ellen clicked her tongue.\n'I don't have much time. Mother will sooner or later try to steal my body and my bone roots. I have to either kill her or flee from here, but I don't know how strong she actually is. Should I go and drag Esen back home or should I force Ester to become my scapegoat? This is a tough choice.'\nEllen had her worries. She thought of her hateful mother who lusted over her physique and talent. She also thought of Eleanor's consorts, especially Overlord Mao.\n'From the log file, Overlord Mao's life signature disappears during the chaos. Well, that makes things easier for me if he really died. I can just secretly form an alliance with Overlord Xiaomao and kill mother. Then, I'll be freed! For now, I should go back to Fate Stadium.'\nEllen made her decision. She stood up and opened her system screen menu. Then, she navigated to the Real-Time PVP menu and chose to fight in the Fate Stadium.\nWHOOSH\nEllen disappeared from her tent.\nShe decided to escape from Eleanor's grasp and sought shelter in the Fate Arena.",

      "content": "Chapter 243 Florida Man Who Recently Promoted as Drill Sergeant Added Alligator Wrestling to Regular Training Regime for New Recruits.\nChapter 243 – Florida Man Who Recently Promoted as Drill Sergeant Added Alligator Wrestling to Regular Training Regime for New Recruits.\nLeo returned to his domain in the afternoon. He then surveyed and inspected his territory, checking if any building needed help.\nAside from the various iron pine logs in the junkyard that got burnt down, most of the buildings were fully repaired. The ones that Leo couldn't help were the academy of Wu Buyi and the new library of Hua Jiashan that they had built to support their disciples.\nThe buildings, furniture, and treasures in there were gone.\nLeo approached the burnt library of Hua Jiashan. He swept his gaze over the ruin and sighed.\n\"I should probably write new cultivation manuals and sell these guys.\"\nAs Leo had defeated clones of top experts, he acquired their skills, daos, and knowledge through the system's assistance. Among them, Leo learned several cultivation techniques, which were superior to what Hua Jiashan and others were using.\nIf Leo wanted to, he could write books and publish them for his employees to learn. However, writing a book was an arduous and boring task. Leo was too lazy to sit still 12 hours a day for the entire month to write something from his memory.\n\"I wish I had a system library in my shopping mall… Wait. Do I have one? I don't remember.\"\nLeo rechecked the current workshops and facilities in his shopping mall.\n…\nRooftop\nGreenhouses\n5th Floor\nAlchemy Factories\nLand Vehicle Factory\nAlchemy Workshops\nGunsmith Workshops\nBlacksmith Workshops\n4th Floor\nTesseract Time Chamber\nMilitary Boot Camp\nLife Force Casino\nTavern of Heroes\n3rd Floor\nNothing\n2nd Floor\nNothing\n1st Floor\nClothing Stores\nFast-Food Chain Restaurant\nFood Court\nSupermarket\n…\nBefore the battle, Leo had added Tavern of Heroes, Military Boot Camp, and Life Force Casino to his shopping mall. All of them were upgraded to level 15.\nThe life force casino was as the name implied. It provided an entertainment service and allowed guests to gamble their lifespan in their games. Similar to modern casinos, the available games were blackjacks, roulettes, craps, baccarat, and poker.\nHowever, the casino was a bit special. The facility sealed the Qi of their guests, disallowing them to use their power when they gambled.\nSo far, Leo hadn't checked if it was well-received among the locals yet. They just went through an ordeal, so he believed that nobody was in the mood for gambling.\nThe next facility was the boot camp. When Leo upgraded it, the system screen informed him that it could enhance the abilities and solidify the foundation of the participants.\nHe also had an inspiration.\n'Can I use that facility to impart my knowledge to the visitors? Is there a way for me to make that place a sect or a training ground for those rookies?'\nLeo was curious about what it could do. He went back to the shopping mall to inspect the boot camp.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, news spread that the battle was over. Thus, people stopped worrying about danger and resumed their daily life.\nThe shopping mall was busy and crowded. Even though the second and third floors were empty, many cultivators and commoners chose the place as their gathering spots to hang out with their friends and colleagues.\nCommoners from the west slum either continued residing on the B5 floor or returned home. Those who remained chose to do so because they no longer had a home to return to. As for the rest, they returned to restore or rebuild their buildings.\nSome commoners chose to bet their future on the pills in the supermarket. They purchased the cheapest grain pills and ate them, hoping to become a cultivator.\n99% of the risk takers succeeded while the remaining 1% required more time to digest the pill.\nIn short, the number of cultivators increased, and they refused to leave the shopping mall.\nFortunately, some former disciples of the Life Sword Sect and Tang clan's members were smarter. They spent their free time cultivating at the foot of the pylon tower instead of wasting their time here. Thus, the domain's population wasn't congested in one building.\nLeo returned to the shopping mall and discovered that the elevators were never empty. He flew into an open area and landed on the fourth floor's balcony.\nOn the fourth floor, a crowd of off-shift workers and visitors crowded in front of the facilities. Several cultivators queued in front of the casino, waiting for their turn to enter and enjoy the games.\nAs for the boot camp and the time chamber, several swordsmen and Tang clan members lingered there. They also secretly queued and waited for the people inside to come out.\nOn the other hand, the tavern was partially available. Only a handful of cultivators visited this facility to get some tea or wine to rest.\nThe business was booming. Leo couldn't help but smile at his employees and guests.\n'It's good to have a popular business. I don't have to grasses like a cow anymore. Now, I can just relax and slap Esen's booty at home while my employees make money for me. What a paradise.'\nLeo hummed and strolled into the boot camp facility.\n.\nMilitary Boot Camp Level 15\nDrill Sergeant Automaton (3/25)\nCamp Capacity (10/25)\nFacilities (2/25)\nTraining Speed (0/25)\n.\nInside the facility was a new world. In front of Leo was a military compound, roads, and a training ground.\nLeo gazed at the training ground. He discovered a hundred male employees of his store, who wore nothing but military pants. They sat in a square formation, meditating.\nThree mannequins wearing green uniforms walked around with a wooden stick in their hands. They glared and monitored the trainees without hiding their killing intent.\nThe trainees sweated profusely, but they did their best to control their aura and leaking Qi.\nPA!\nOne of the trainees lost concentration because of Leo's presence. He opened his eyes to look, but one of the mannequins bonked him with a wooden stick.\nNo word came out from the mannequin's non-existent mouth. However, Leo picked up the sound transmission of the drill sergeant.\n\"Ya think a sexy bitch shows up here to sniff your sorry ass 3-inch dick?! While you're here, Jody already cucked you and eloped with your girlfriend! You have nobody here but you, me, and the lord. The only girlfriend you can trust is your damn dirty cum-sticking right hand! Now, close your ugly eyes and get rid of your horny thought! Until you realize your damn perverted dao, none of your virgin asses are getting out of here!\"\nLeo broke a sweat. He pretended not to hear their private insult.\nStill, it reminded Leo that the mannequins were capable of teaching the visitors. He thought of something and called one of the drill sergeants over.\nOne of the mannequins noticed Leo's gesture. He rushed toward his master and saluted.\nLeo instinctively saluted back. Then, he got to the point.\n\"What kind of cultivation technique are you teaching them?\"\nThe mannequin reported using his sound transmission.\n\"We use the default cultivation method – The Floridian's Mind Method, sir!\"\n\"What the hell is that?!\"\n\"We disable their Qi and dantian. Our daily routine is 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 pull-ups, a 10-kilometer run, and alligator wrestling, sir!\"\nLeo sweated profusely. He wondered if the mannequins copied Saitama's techniques and added a cherry on top to exaggerate the routine.\n\"What about the meditation? What are they doing?\" Leo pointed at the crowd.\n\"Recovering, sir!\"\n\"Recovering?\"\n\"We diluted a hope-and-dream pill in a water tank and forced them to drink it to recover their stamina, sir. After a five-minute rest, there will be a sparring session. We will let them fight each other without using Qi until one of them remains standing, sir!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo rubbed his forehead and waved his hand. \"Do whatever you want.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\"Also… about the length of the training. How long will it last for a batch of soldiers to complete the training course?\"\n\"As long as it takes, sir!\"\n\"…Wut?\"\n\"Until they meet our standard, the training will never stop, sir!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo closed his eyes and silently prayed for the 10 guinea pigs. He wished them luck.\nGetting side-tracked enough, Leo got to the point. He asked the mannequin.\n\"Can we implement another cultivation method to train them? I have some ideas.\"\n\"Of course, sir!\"\nDING\nAs soon as Leo mentioned the cultivation method, the system prompted him with a screen, revealing the options menu.\nIn the menu, labels and selectable options informed Leo of which training regime was being used. He could also adjust the intensity of the training by moving the slider bars. The default settings set everything to 100 or 10 kilometers, but Leo could make it 100 times harder.\nLeo was not evil enough to torture these people with a Spartan training course. He left the slider bar options alone and moved on to the cultivation method options.\nThe options showed up as \"None\". However, Leo could change it.\nWhen Leo selected the option, the menu revealed choices of what Leo could choose. Conveniently, all martial techniques and cultivation methods that Leo had learned were already there.\nLeo was delighted. He scrolled through the list to find the best cultivation method of his choice.\nThe method came from Aslan, whom Leo always struggled to defeat.\nThe method was called \"Ocean King Breathing\". From the clone's memory, it originated from Overlord Xiaomao, and it enabled him to awaken the dao of Ocean King.\nThe cultivation method focused on the water, earth, holy, darkness, yin, and yang elements. Thus, it was well-balanced and friendly for untalented cultivators. By mastering this combination of elements, the practitioner's physique would be balanced and flexible. It also enabled them to reach the sage realm without encountering a bottleneck.\nDING\nThe method was assigned as the new default cultivation technique of this place.\nAs soon as Leo pressed the APPLY button, the mannequins flinched as they received the new order. They turned to the trainees and informed them of a piece of good news through their sound transmission.\n\"Rejoice, soldiers! The Lord has granted permission for you to access a rare cultivation method! We will teach you the method after you rest enough!\"\nAll ten cultivators opened their eyes wide as they didn't expect to this regime. When they looked around, they found Leo, who waved his hand at them.\n\"Good luck, boys. Have fun.\" Leo snickered and left the boot camp.\nThe ten men stood up and saluted like a modern soldier. However, the mannequins yelled at them again and bonked everybody.\n.\n.\n\"Well, that's convenient.\"\nLeo walked out of the boot camp and glanced at the signboard, which the cashier of the time chamber had made.\n[10 Years of Lifespan per Person]\nLeo pursed his lips. He discovered that the boot camp's service was a lot longer than the time chamber, which only took a day to complete. He took a mental note that he might need to upgrade the training time level next time.\nLeo stopped paying attention to the boot camp and gazed at the tavern. He still remembered what this place offered.\nIt allowed Leo to invite his friends, aka PLAYER friends, to visit his domain!\nLeo thought of Acku, the orc. It was the time to contact the orc and ask for his quest advice.\n.\nTavern of Heroes Level 15\nHospitality Worker Automaton (3/25)\nTavern Size (5/25)\nMax Visiting Friends (2/25)\nAccommodations (5/25)",

Cops in Space Marine Costumes Arrested Him for Heresy.\nChapter 244 – Florida Man in Templar Knight Costume Attended Warhammer 40,000 Event. Cops in Space Marine Costumes Arrested Him for Heresy.\nThe tavern's receptionist noticed Leo. They bowed at him in unison.\nLeo approached the mannequins behind the counter. He opened the facility menu and fiddled with it.\nA new screen appeared, revealing the friend list menu. Unfortunately, the number of Leo's friends was zero.\n'Is this the friend list system the orc talked about?'\nLeo still vaguely remembered the conversation he had with Acku. The latter taught Leo that there was a friend system, which allowed them to locate and travel across the universe to each other's home planet.\nAlthough Leo didn't want to expose his shopping mall to danger, he believed Acku and his orcs might be more trustworthy than werewolves and elves from other worlds. He tried to search for Acku's name by typing it in a search panel.\nBZZZ\nThe search menu was more terrible than Micro****'s search engine. Instead of showing Acku's information or his name, it showed countless names of people with similar names instead.\nThe names were hilarious. Leo gazed at the name and snickered at first. But after he scrolled through 100 pages of names, he deeply frowned.\nThere were over 10,000 people whose name was \"A\".\n\"What the hell is wrong with these guys' mothers!? Are their brain cells dead?! Can't they give them a more creative name?!\"\nLeo gave up looking for Acku. He closed the menu and talked to the mannequin.\n\"Aside from serving free drinks here, is there anything you can do?\"\nThe receptionists looked at each other and shrugged. The girls pointed at the secret stairs behind the counter.\nLeo noticed the stairs of this facility. He thanked the girls and explored the staircase.\nAlthough the tavern was on the fourth floor of Leo's shopping mall, the tavern's second floor did not connect to the shopping mall's fifth floor. Instead, it was an independent dimension.\nThe second floor and other floors of this tavern served as a hotel for visitors. Visiting guests could rent a room to rest there. Also, the tavern offered a monthly rent option. However, the facility required YOL as the standard currency according to the managing cashier mannequin.\nA king-size-bed room cost one year of lifespan per day for rent. A month cost less as the cashier set to price to only 10 YOL. An executive room with additional living space cost double. As for a suite with luxurious furniture, wider space, a swimming pool, and a Jacuzzi bathtub had a whopping booking price of 20 YOL per day or 300 YOL per month.\nLeo ignored the hotel part and proceeded to the secret stairs. He climbed the stairs and found a new world.\nNo hotel floor existed in this place.\nLeo found himself on a grassland. The blue sky and clouds were the same as the sky in the real world. However, Leo couldn't see any star or the sun here.\nIt was an artificial sky. Leo could tell as the lighting came from the floating clouds.\nHe paused for a moment and turned around to look at the stairs. The path to the tavern was still there. Seeing the way home, Leo let out a sigh of relief.\n\"For a moment there, I thought I no-clip into the backrooms. God damn!\"\nThe grassland was not empty. Similar to the boot camp, it featured two stone altars. Its architectural style resembled the Aztec pyramids.\nLeo leaped on one of the pyramids. Then, he noticed that the top of the pyramids hid secret stairways to the interior of the building.\nHe explored inside. Upon entering the pyramid, Leo found a massive modern suite. Bedrooms, lobbies, bars, kitchens, bathrooms, a swimming pool, and other utilities made this place a dream home for many modern men.\nHowever, at the center of the lobby, there was a magic circle under a large rug. Leo flipped the carpet over and inspected the magic circle.\nDING\n<You can invite your friend here.>\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nLeo understood the hint. This magic circle was a tool to summon his friends here. In addition, this pyramid served as a VIP suite to accommodate the guests.\nAs Leo couldn't use the feature, he stopped exploring and exited the pyramid. He then observed the grassland.\nLooking at the wide lushful land gave Leo inspiration. He wondered if he could grow crops or run a real estate business here.\nPutting his idea to the test, Leo purchased an RV car and parked it in front of a pyramid. But as soon as Leo put the vehicle there, he received the system's warning.\nDING\n<Warning! This facility automatically cleans itself and repairs the properties every midnight. All items, plants, crops, non-tavern facilities, and non-guest items will be automatically thrown out to the recycling center.>\n\"…\"\nLeo was disappointed. He put the RV car into his storage ring. Then, he exited this place.\n.\nAfter coming out of the tavern, Leo let out a long sigh. For the moment, he couldn't summon Acku or introduce him to his store yet.\nAs Leo couldn't rely on Acku or ask him for advice, he turned his attention to the other system buildings that he hadn't built yet.\n.\nAltar of War\nGate Size (0/25)\nTransferable Personal (0/25)\nDistance (0/25)\nCooldown Timer (0/25)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCannot be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nFate Crystal Radar\nOperator Automaton (0/50)\nDetection Range (0/50)\nPrice – 1,000 YOL\nCannot be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\n\"…\"\nLeo smacked his forehead. He realized that he should have built these buildings and stopped wasting time. After all, the key to completing phase 3's quest was right in front of him all along.\n\"This should be it. The system never gives me a quest that I cannot complete. Of course, it already provides a method for me to complete it! Man, I'm an idiot.\"\nLeo operated the domain system and built the altar and the fate crystal radar. He chose to place the two key buildings in the newly unlocked area north of the Tang Clan's manor.\nBoth buildings were situated adjacent to the main eastern road. They faced the west and served as a new landmark of Leo's domain.\nThe fate crystal radar emerged first. It came out as an Eiffel Tower, but it featured a floating blue crystal on top. In addition, it released a ripple-like transparent wave, which caused a strong gale.\nLeo's long silky hair fluttered by the wind. Even his beard threatened to fly away from his face. Fortunately, the hair roots were firm and healthy. Thus, not a string of hair escaped Leo's skin.\nMeanwhile, one hundred meters north of the radar, a humongous pyramid altar rose from the ground. Tall and steep stone stairs from the west side were the only path that non-cultivators could climb to the top.\nOn the top of the altar, a platform with a 500-meter-diameter magic circle occupied the roof. Aside from the magic circle which was carved into the floor, nothing else was noticeable.\nLeo upgraded both buildings to the highest level possible. As he didn't feel the need to bring many people to the raid, Leo adjusted the attributes according to his ideal.\n.\nAltar of War Level 15\nGate Size (1/25)\nTransferable Personal (1/25)\nDistance (13/25)\nCooldown Timer (0/25)\n.\nFate Crystal Radar Level 15\nOperator Automaton (5/50)\nDetection Range (10/50)\n.\n\"There's no need to bring other people along. It's not like I will invade a karmic sovereign's home planet or anything.\"\nThe two new buildings slightly changed. The Fate Crystal Radar pointed toward the void and pinged its transparent ripple while five new mannequins appeared from nothingness.\nThe new wooden mannequins came out as usual. However, these guys could use sound transmission techniques like the ones in the boot camp.\nOne of them greeted Leo and reported for duty.\n\"Master. We have activated the radar. We're expecting results within 24 hours!\"\nLeo nodded at them. \"Take your time. Work hard, okay?\"\n\"Yes, master!\"\nThe radar mannequins bowed. Then, they turned around and entered the tower's elevator to get to their new office.\nLeo didn't stop them. He shifted his attention to the altar instead. He rubbed his hands in excitement.\n\"Hehehe. What kind of players can I invade? Do I have to destroy everything to complete the quest? Can I loot or plunder some goodies from there? Oh, boy. I feel like a pirate.\"\nHe got to the platform and attempted to operate it. He wasn't disappointed this time.\nDING\n<Please choose the targeted planet or input the coordinate.>\n<Please note. The distance limit is 13 million light years.>\nLeo pursed his lips as the distance was quite short.\n\"What was the distance from Earth to Andromeda Galaxy again? Somewhere between two to three million light years? Maybe? Then, I can only find players within the same galaxy or neighbor galaxies, right?\"\nWhile speaking his mind, Leo read the list of other players' home planets.\nUnfortunately, there were only two on the menu. Leo narrowed his eyes and frowned as he had heard about them before.\n.\nPlayer List\n- Overlord Max\n- Overlord Milo\n.\n\"Where have I heard these names? I have a feeling that I knew them from somewhere. Déjà vu?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 245 Florida Man Crossed a Desert to Find Desert Monster, Found Area 51 Instead.\nChapter 245 – Florida Man Crossed a Desert to Find Desert Monster, Found Area 51 Instead.\nLeo selected the first name to satisfy his curiosity. The system prompted him with a new screen, showing the brief information of the deceased overlord.\n.\nPlayer Status\nPlayer: Overlord Max Fenrir\nPlayer Status: Deceased\nPlanets in Control: 35\nHeadquarter Level: 50\n*WARNING! Attacking a deceased player's home bases will incur a penalty: Ally players of the deceased player will be informed of your invasion, and they can freely deploy reinforcement to protect and claim the home bases.\n.\nExcept for the overlord's grey portrait and the useless information, only the warning part piqued Leo's interest.\n\"So, has this guy's home bases become ownerless? Can I claim them for myself?\"\nDING\n<Tips. If you manage to destroy the headquarters or a branch headquarters of the deceased player before the reinforcement can claim it, all system's buildings and automatons within in the domain will be converted into gacha tickets.>\n<Please note. All system's perks of the deceased player cannot be transferred.>\n\"Ah, that's fair.\"\nLeo didn't care about the dead guy's system perks. He was more interested in the free gacha tickets he could get from the raid.\nAs nothing else stopped Leo from proceeding further, Leo made his decision. He chose to invade the dead overlord's base.\nThe bottom of the status screen featured the invasion confirmation button. Leo pressed it without hesitation.\nVHOOM\nA small rainbow portal manifested and hovered over the platform. Leo closed the system screens and jumped inside.\nAs soon as Leo entered the portal, the exit was closed right away. He found himself on a stone cliff, looking down to a wasteland.\nThe air of this world was dusty and smelly like methane. The thick orange clouds blocked most of the sunlight from reaching the ground and made the ground temperature chilly. From a rough estimation, Leo believed the average temperature here was about 5 to 10 Celsius or 41 to 50 Fahrenheit. Strangely, no snow was presented here.\nA windstorm hit Leo's face and dirtied his skin with sticky yellow dirt. The muddy dirt in the air annoyed Leo as it blocked his vision.\nLeo snorted and exhaled all impurities and foul air from his lungs. He also released his Qi and created a wind element barrier around him.\nThe blue barrier repelled dust and particles in the air from getting inside. It also provided Leo with oxygen, nitrogen, and radiation that his body needed.\nAfter creating an air-filtering barrier, Leo could see a bit further. He continued expanding the dome to expand his visual range.\nWhen the dome reached 500 meters in diameter, Leo finally sensed movements and life signatures from the horizon. He closed his eyes and tried to feel them with his sixth sense instead.\nAbout 1,000 kilometers in front of him, a colony was situated there. A glass dome protected their population inside while several towers stood outside the barrier, circling their spotlights around and scanning for unauthorized visitors.\nLeo couldn't sense the interior of the mysterious city, but he could tell that it was bigger than the Australian continent for sure.\n\"Is that the place?\"\nLeo opened his eyes and took flight. He flew toward the dome colony while maintaining the air-filtering barrier around him.\nUnfortunately, when Leo flew closer to the orange clouds, they reacted to Leo's presence. It immediately unleashed heavenly orange lightning bolts toward him.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe thunderbolts struck Leo, but they only gave him a mild tingling sensation similar to being stimulated by a vibrator. It was a nice electric massage.\nLeo welcomed the free meal. He flew directly into the clouds and drained them into his dantian universe.\nThe clouds gradually moved toward Leo as if he were the center of a whirlpool. The thick massive tribulation clouds that were capable of blocking the sunlight vanished and left a large hole in the sky.\nThe orange gas entered Leo's dantian and gathered in one of his stars, which had been designated as a tribulation lightning star. It contained nothing but electric current and intense magnetic fields, which generated endless lightning storms.\nThe gas was devoured by the rainbow clouds of this star. The impurity of the gas was burnt away, leaving only a burnt smell of burning iron and ash.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 712 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 645 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 730 years.>\n<Your lifespan…>\nLeo was glad that he came here as stealing the star's tribulation lightning clouds was profitable. He vowed to do this again.\nHowever, his action also made his presence known to the population. When more clouds vanished, the two humongous Suns, which were 5,000 times larger than the Solar System's Sun, became visible. The biggest one was white while the smaller one, which was half the size of the white sun, radiated an orange flame.\nThe heat of the two suns instantly melted rocks, dirt, and humid sticky air they touched. Orange flames popped up one after another as the methane gas in the air caught fire.\nFlame rapidly spread along the wind and turned into flame tornados. They reached the thick orange clouds that were out of Leo's absorption range and ignited them on fire.\nOrange lightning bolts went berserk. They unleashed countless lightning bolts within the clouds. Some branches hit the ground while many traveled to the stratosphere.\nLeo turned around and gazed at what he had done. He shrugged.\n\"That wasn't my fault! It's the planet that's at fault here. Who asked you to orbit in a solar system with two freaking suns!?\"\nLeo flew away from the spreading chaos, but he never stopped stealing the orange clouds.\n.\nBy the time Leo arrived at the colony, the wasteland behind him turned into a sea of flame because of the endless methane gas in the air. His long black and white hair also emitted white smoke as the flame caught up to him while he was flying earlier. However, Leo was never harmed.\nAll the colony's tower spotlights shone upon Leo and fixated on him. Red siren flight flashed within the colony, but Leo couldn't hear anything from outside.\nVHOOM\nSuddenly, sentry machine guns emerged from the ground and pointed at Leo. Then, they started blasting.\nLeo was curious about the guns as he just experienced an alien invasion. He stood there and tested their power.\nTING TING TING\nAnti-tank shells, armor-piercing shells, explosive shells, and anti-domain shells were unleashed. Countless white and yellow needles flashed and hit Leo's face, chest, stomach, and legs without missing a shot.\nA hundred thousand flat bullet heads were deflected from Leo's skin upon impact. Some of them hit his nose directly, but they were flattened upon impact because Leo's body was as firm as a steel mountain.\n30 minutes passed by. The sentry guns finally ran out of bullets.\nBurying under the mountain of large bullet heads was Leo. He hummed while he collected every piece of bullet head into his storage rings.\n'Can my mannequins convert these metals into useful tools or guns for my future army? I hope they can make a better gun soon. Oh, wait. We might need some RPGs or anti-air missiles soon. Those drones and jets are nasty! Maybe something like the Israel's iron dome?'\nWHOOSH\nIn the blink of an eye, a million bullet heads vanished into Leo's storage rings. He patted the dirt on his clothes and proceeded toward the colony.\nLeo looked up at the colony. Although the half-circle dome covered it, the foundation of the colony was no different than a complex spaceship with gigantic metal spider legs and continuous tracks.\n\"A mobile colony? A spider colony?\"\nLeo was impressed. He thought of an old anime, which told a story of a dystopian world where humans could only live in mobile colonies similar to this one. The local population fought for natural resources while they avoided hazardous monsters outside.\nHe wondered if this world had a dangerous monster in the wasteland. He wished that there was one so that he could farm them for alchemy materials and random resources.\nRUMBLE\nWhile Leo silently approached the colony, he noticed some movements and life signatures of people getting closer. A shutter door of the colony gradually opened.\nA 5-meter-tall wolf walked out of the giant door. Following after him were 50 werewolves in sci-fi battle suits and sophisticated giant swords.\nLeo raised his eyebrows and stared at the blunt swords. Each of them was 10 meters long and 10 centimeters thick. From a glance, they didn't look like a good weapon for cutting.\nBRRRRRR\nThe werewolves flipped the switches of their blades and revealed their functions. The blades revealed saw teeth and started vibrating.\nThey were not regular swords. They were saw machines!\n\"Hey! I want one of those!\"\nLeo drooled. He wished his domain could produce one of those saw swords.\n\"$%@ NU'EARTHE @&#$!!\"\nThe werewolves yelled in an incomprehensible language and pointed their fingers at Leo's face. Although Leo couldn't hear most of the words, he could hear the N-word loud and clear.\n\"Goddamn. Are all werewolves in this universe racist? I wish the Earth's media could see this. They would have screamed \"HUMANPHOBIC\" and rallied a protest...\"\nWhile Leo imagined how the modern world would react to their racism, a dozen werewolves surrounded Leo and swung their sawswords at him.\nCRACK\nCRACK\nCRACK\nAll saw swords hit Leo, but they were instantly jammed upon impact. The saw teeth failed to slice through his skin.\nLeo widely grinned and grabbed two saw swords. He stored them in his storage rings.\nWHOOSH\nThe swords vanished. The wielders looked at their empty hands in confusion and started barking.\n\"NU'EARTHE &*#@$!!\"\n\"&$#@&%#&$#&@ NU'EARTHE &%$@#&#@&%&@&!!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He nonchalantly approached them and touched the nearest guy's battle suit.\nWHOOSH\nThe entire battle suit vanished and entered Leo's storage rings, leaving him butt-naked. Leo glanced at the guy and was about to kill him at first. But when he noticed how shiny the werewolf's golden fur was, he changed his mind.\n\"Thanks, puppy. Oh, hey. Your golden fur looks nice. Can I skin you and make your fur my doormat?\"\nFor the sake of preserving the fur, Leo pulled out his pistol and shot the werewolf's head.\nBOOM\nThe direct hit blasted the head of the golden wolf and splatted his brain everywhere.\nAfter the wolf died, Leo tried to store the corpse in his storage rings. However, he noticed that the rings were almost full to the brim.\nKeeping meat in a dimensional pocket full of floating metals and steel bullet heads was unhealthy. Although Leo was reluctant, he started using the system's inventory menu. He stored the corpse in there.\nDING\n<You have stored a carcass of Fenrir Werewolf.>\n<Please note. All stored items can be directly transferred to your shopping mall's warehouse.>\n\"HMM?!\"\nLeo widened his eyes. He learned a new thing.",

He shifted his attention to the colony and the werewolves in a space marine suit.\n\"Resources… Materials…\"\nThe werewolves sensed his killing intent. Their fur stood up while their tails tugged between their legs.\nIt was too late for them to retreat. Leo charged at them.\n\"THIS IS ROBBERY!! GIMME YOUR WALLET, YOUR CLOTHES, AND YOUR MEAT!\"\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nThe airtight room's interior automatic door was opened. The elder in a suit entered the colony's entrance door and looked inside. The interior was a steel corridor resembling the interior of a spaceship.\nLeo hummed as he got several sets of bulky spacesuits and saw swords. He looked forward to reselling them to his employees.\nRUMBLE\nSteel shuttles descended from the ceiling and trapped Leo in front of the airtight room. The air vents poured green gas into the sealed area.\nLeo was amused. He sniffed at the green gas and compared it to the toxic air that he once tasted.\n\"About the same smell as the mustard gas but the potency is lacking. Godzilla's bad breath is stronger than this. At least their breath can melt diamonds, concrete, and metals. This thing only burns.\"\nLeo purposely inhaled the gas, treating it as good smoke. He exhaled and licked his lips.\nThe gas did nothing to Leo's lungs, skin, or internal organs. Instead, it only made them slightly tingling as if someone stroked his internal organs with a feather.\n\"Ah, that's a good smoke right there. It's a shame to waste it. Can I have some more?\"\nLeo tested his inventory system by gathering green gas with his Qi. He then shoved the mass of the gas ball into the inventory screen.\nThe gas passed through the screen, but it wasn't stored. The system also warned him.\n<Only solid materials can be stored in the inventory.>\n\"Shame.\"\nLeo shook his head and leisurely browsed his system shop. He searched for tools to compress air into a container, and the first result was a balloon.\n\"Ah, yes. Balloons! I miss my childhood days. Those helium balloons were the funniest toys back then.\"\nWhen Leo was a child, he got stuck inside a room with nothing but glass windows around him. He remembered that his parents sometimes visited him in his room and brought him either food or toys. Usually, they were accompanied by strangers in white coats.\nIt was a vague and hazy memory. Leo roughly remembered that his parents reluctantly showed him a helium balloon and inhaled the air inside. Then, their voice changed. Leo also tried it and got addicted to the weird gas.\nAfterward, strangers in white coats brought various balloons with unknown substances and smelly air to Leo. They forced him to inhale them and watched him suffer from various side effects. Fortunately, the pain never lasted long as his parents always returned to feed him delicious water.\nThe strange memory was short as Leo's parents brought him home when he was 10. He then met a sibling, who came from the adjacent glass room.\nThe rest of the memory was confusing and hazy. Leo couldn't recall anything after that, except the time when he emerged out of the alien spaceship.\nThus, the balloons gave Leo a nostalgic feeling. He purchased a package of a thousand balloons and used his Qi to fill them with gas. When a balloon was filled, Leo tried to store it in his inventory.\nDING\n<You have stored a soul-corrupting balloon in your inventory.>\nIt didn't pass through the inventory screen this time. The system recognized it as an item and listed it as a balloon.\n\"Soul corrupting? More like a mild weed to me. Anyway, thanks for the treat. I need those. I miss smoking. If I can mix this with those abundant immortal grass and sweet dream mushrooms, I should be able to make the ultimate joint!\"\nHad Esen and others heard and understood Leo's intention, they would have cursed him for decades because of his stupidity and silliness. No sane cultivator smoked poisonous gas or used it as a reliever.\nAs Leo stood there and collected the gas leisurely, the vents kept pouring gas inside while the CCTV cameras fixated on him.\nAn hour later, the vents stopped releasing gas. Instead, they poured sticky liquid inside the sealed area.\nMeanwhile, Leo just stored the 1,000th poison gas balloon in his inventory. He was about to quit as he ran out of containers.\n\"Oh? What is this? Gasoline? Tar? Oil? Or… is this new meth I can use?\"\n.\n.\nWhile Leo forgot about the urgency and messed around, a large portal in the void was opened, and a large battleship exited the gate.\nThe battleship was one of many survivors from the previous raid. Overlord Milo personally took control of the ship and used it to travel here.\nAt the bridge of his battleship, a system screen informed him of the raid.\n<A Player has invaded your Max Fenrir's home planet. The population of your friend's capital city is requesting reinforcement.>\n<If you can repel the invader, the local population will acknowledge you as their lord. You may also claim his system perks, system buildings, and assets as quest rewards.>\nOverlord Milo reread the message for the 10th time. Although he wasn't fond of Overlord Max, the rewards were too tempting. He wanted all colonies of his dead friend right away.\n\"Which idiots raid an overlord's town? Are they dumb? Don't they know that poking an overlord's town is automatically a death sentence? There are a bunch of system users in hiding. It's not like all system users show up at the Fate Stadium and register their names. Max also befriended a hundred system users. They should have arrived here by now.\"\nThis wasn't Overlord Milo's first rodeo. He had claimed several cities of his dead friends, and he used to defend ownerless cities several times. Thus, he was familiar with the clan battle system.\nThe key to victory wasn't just defending the main base. It required the defenders to buy time and run the clock. After all, the invading side only had 24 hours to destroy or take control of the main base. In case of failure, the invaders would always be sent home and suffer from a system's penalties, such as their bases being exposed to other system users.\nOverlord Milo operated his ship's console and deployed a hundred observation drones. The drones descended the atmosphere and entered the orange world.\nEach drone was as large as a F16. Its main equipment was cameras, a pseudo-deity shield system, and an emergency bomb, which could turn the observation drone into a suicide drone if necessary.\nThe drones scattered and passed through the tribulation lightning clouds. Orange thunderbolts hit them as a result, but none of them were harmed. An energy shield protected the hulls and the components, allowing them to enter the hazardous world.\nBecause of Leo's previous deed, several parts of the world were in flame, though most of the fire died down because this world contained very thin burnable gas.\nAside from the colony that Leo was in, this planet was a wasteland with nothing but raging tribulation lightning bolts.\nOverlord Milo deeply sighed while he gazed at Max's home planet. He complained.\n\"This is what happens when you ignore the laws of a mortal world. If an immortal, a deity, or any powerhouse prolongs its stay in a mortal world, orange tribulation clouds will descend and burn the entire world. Now, look at your population. Only one city is left standing. I bet they already run out of food and resources.\"\nMilo stood up. He vanished from his spaceship and reappeared directly on top of the colony dome. He looked down and observed the local population.\nBetraying Milo's expectation, there was no population. Only a bunch of players and their subordinates were inside. As for Milo's subordinates and his population, they were piled into a mountain in front of the gigantic manor, which was Max's former house and headquarters.\n\"News travels fast. That idiot died a few days ago, but hyenas from various clans already made their moves. I bet the other city has already been raided and robbed clean. Still, why haven't they destroyed the manor? They could have gotten everything that way…\"\nMilo was baffled. He teleported again and appeared directly inside the colony.\nOverlord Milo reverted to his true form, which was a gigantic Fenrir wolf. He landed in front of Max's manor and found a dozen werewolf sages in the front manor's yard.\nThe sages sensed the presence of a great wolf. They rushed toward Milo and lowered their heads.\n\"Greetings, overlord. Are you here to raid this domain or are you here to defend it?\"\nThe 12 sages were bolder than Milo had imagined. He questioned them.\n\"You should be answering my question! What are you doing here?! Don't you know that Overlord Max is my colleague?!\"\n\"…We know. That's why we have been protecting this headquarters since Overlord Max died.\"\nMilo narrowed his eyes as he discovered the inconsistencies in their words. First, Milo just received a report that a player had recently invaded this planet an hour ago. This short timeframe wasn't enough for these hyenas to enter this colony before him.\nSecondly, the corpses of the local population seemed fresh. Judging from the scent, they died a few hours ago, which was definitely before the invader appeared.\nThe evidence showed that they didn't come here through by relying on the system's help. Instead, they traveled here by themselves and slaughtered the local population for some reason.\nMilo turned around and observed the life signatures in the massive colony. Several Fenrir werewolves still ran inside the skyscraper buildings as if they were searching for something. Many objects inside the buildings vanished whenever a werewolf got closer.\nIt wasn't hard to guess what they did. There werewolves were looting and plundering the empty city.\n\"Smart, but not wise,\" Milo commented. \"You people came here, slaughtered the townspeople, and robbed them without destroying the main headquarters. Because you traveled here yourselves and the local population opens the doors to welcome you, the system doesn't inform me or others that the domain is invaded. Even after you killed them, the system ignores it because it treats the incidents as local genocides.\"\n\"…\"\nThe expressions of the sages changed. They pulled out their weapons and glared at the giant wolf.\n\"Overlord. Please respect our choices. Overlord Max is dead. His properties, cultivation resources, and artifacts should be passed down to fellow fenrirs of the junior generation. You can't possibly hog all of them since they are not yours.\"\n\"PFFT! You finally show your true color, you hyena thieves!\"\nOverlord Milo opened his mouth and pulled out a long burning sword from his throat. His wolf's hand transformed into monkey-like hands so that he could hold the giant flame sword.\n\"Drop all your spatial rings and all items in your inventory system. Otherwise, I'll cut you down and attack your colonies, too! You don't wanna know what I can do to your families, do you?\"\nThe sages glared at Overlord Milo and shouted. \"Don't get cocky! Our cultivation bases are only better than ours! You alone can't defeat us all!\"\n\"Wanna try?\" Overlord Milo cackled and was about to swing his black flame sword.\nBOOOOOOM\nSuddenly, a large explosion erupted from the front of the colony's entrance gateway. It was so loud that Milo turned around to look.\nWHOOSH\nA black silhouette flew out of the dust and floated in the sky under the colony dome. He patted his suit and looked around.\n\"This is getting annoying. I just want some good smoke. Why did those wolves fire rocket launchers at me? I've come in peace!\"",

I came in peace. I cum in peace. Meh, whatever.\" Leo shrugged and gazed at the ruined town below.\nThe city consisted of tall buildings, concrete roads, and cars. If he didn't know that the city was a colony of an alien, he would have mistaken this place as a city in the modern world.\nAlthough the landmarks and the high-rise buildings seemed interesting, Leo found it weird as none of the street lights shone. None of the operating cars and other vehicles were visible on the street. Instead, only wrecked cars and burning cars could be found.\nMoreover, piles of corpses exuded a foul iron-like scent in the air. Their blood soaked the streets while their innards and militated flesh dirtied the sidewalks.\nLeo glanced at a large square building with a large parking lot. He spotted several shopping mall carts there and figured that the building might be a supermarket. However, corpses of werewolves were scattered everywhere.\nIn the middle of the parking lot, Leo found an unsettling scene. A female werewolf corpse with a hole in her head still held three puppies in her arms. The babies barked at their mother in a hoarse voice. Next to the dead mother, a tattered bone plushy doll was left there on the ground along with the other grocery items in paper bags.\nThe massacre disgusted Leo. Even though he came here to destroy Overlord Max's headquarters, he never planned to harm innocent townsmen, especially kids.\nLeo's expression softened. He descended and rushed to rescue the three puppies. When he reached out to them, they bored their little fangs and barked in unison.\nLeo flinched and recalled that they would die if he touched them. Thus, Leo ejected the good old hazmat suit and put it on. Then, he tried again.\nThe puppies resisted. They kept barking and threatened to bite the suit. Fortunately, their fangs were too soft to cut through it.\nLeo carried the puppies in his arms and weighed them. As they were werewolf babies, they were the size of a fat human infant. Leo felt like he was holding three chubby golden retriever puppies.\nThe dogs resisted and tried to flee from Leo's arms. The latter deeply sighed.\n\"Doge. Can you stop moving? I'll give you some meat if you cooperate.\"\nThe dogs still resisted as they couldn't understand Leo's words.\n\"Alright. Fine.\"\nLeo put them down and ejected a dead cockatrice from his spatial ring. He removed the feathers and tore the carcass meat apart.\nThe puppies froze and raised their noses to sniff the sweet scent of a raw chicken. They turned to Leo and drooled. One of them tip-toed toward him and wagged his tail, smiling.\n\"You stupid dog. How old are you? 2 weeks? 3 weeks? Can you eat hard food yet?\"\nThe dogs didn't reply. They only eyed the sweet chicken in Leo's hands.\nLeo wryly smiled and wondered if their stomach could digest hard food yet. He thought of purchasing an overpriced milk replacer from the system store, but there was a supermarket in front of him. They might have something for the babies.\n'Heh, I'm such as hypocrite. I killed so many people, but I become a softy when I see children. It doesn't matter. Saving lives come first. I can't get peace of mind if I let them die like this.'\nLeo stopped overthinking. He snapped his fingers and activated Overlord Mao Miaomiao's time and space domain.\nCLICK-CLICK\nThe entire star system stopped moving. All stars, asteroids, particles, and lifeforms were frozen in time.\nLeo rushed into the supermarket while the time was frozen.\nInside the supermarket, traces of combat and massacre were noticeable. Shelves and merchandise collapsed. Trails of blood and footprints soiled the clean marble floors. Canned products rolled on the bloody ground while the corpses of the shoppers still remained.\nLeo ignored the half-wrecked supermarket and proceeded inside. He prayed that the supermarket layout was the same as the modern world.\nHe wasn't disappointed. The milk section was next to the alcohol section. Thus, Leo found countless packages of dog milk on the ground and under the collapsed shelves.\nWhile Leo picked up the milk for the puppies, in the corner of his eyes noticed a group of werewolves around the alcohol section. He turned around to look at them.\nThe group of five werewolves huddled together. Two of them were in the middle of touching their spatial rings as if they were sorting their items. On the other hand, the remaining guys were busy shoving boxes of wine into their spatial rings in glee.\nLeo raised his eyebrows as he found them smart.\n\"Yup. The first thing you rob from the supermarket during the apocalypse should be booze, beer, and wine! You can use them to dress wounds. You can drink it to relieve boredom. Or you can even turn them into Molotov cocktails! This is killing three birds with one stone!\"\nBecause Leo approved of the action of these werewolves, he approached them and gently pulled their spatial rings. Afterward, he lightly punched their faces, causing their heads to distort.\nAfter giving them a well-deserved punch to the face, Leo copied their action. He stored every intact merchandise in his system inventory and spatial rings. When the booze department was empty, Leo returned to the milk section and collected them as well.\nRobbing a supermarket while stopping time was a fun activity. Leo forgot about the time while he was shopping.\nAn hour passed by, but everything in the solar system was frozen. Leo finished looting and sorting his inventory screen.\nHe was grateful to the system that the inventory existed. It solved a lot of problems when he had so many items inside as the items stacked. Every item in the system inventory showed up as an icon inside a grid box, and identical items were stackable. For example, two bottles of wine of the same brand took one inventory slot, but they showed as two bottles. As a result, it was a lot easier to sort and find a certain item.\nAlthough Leo hadn't checked the warehouse area yet, he stopped shopping for the moment. He returned to the puppies at the parking lot. When Leo reached them, he brought out cartons of dog milk and three dog bowls. He then poured some milk for them. While he was at it, he crushed the chicken's meat into tiny pieces and mixed them with the milk.\nWhen the preparation was ready, Leo resumed the flow of time.\nCLICK-CLICK\nTime resumed in the solar system. The five werewolves in the shopping mall earlier let out a weird whine as their heads exploded into blood mist. As for the puppies, they were surprised to see bowls of milk coming out of nowhere.\n\"Eat up before I change my mind. I'll be taking you home, okay?\"\nThe three puppies didn't pay attention to Leo. They rushed to the milk bowl and started drinking. Their tongues scooped some tiny chicken pieces into their throat.\n*COUGH*\nAs they had never eaten hard food before, the dogs coughed. Leo smirked and inspected them with his Qi to ensure that they weren't choked by the chicken meat.\nThe hungry dogs finished everything within 30 seconds. They licked the bowl clean and glanced at Leo's face in wary.\n\"Alright. I'll be back shortly. Stay here with your mom and dad.\"\nLeo patted their heads and turned around. He planned to stop time again and finish this raid.\nWhen Leo turned around, he sensed the aura of an entity like Aslan. However, his Qi volume and pressure were a lot weaker.\nOverlord Milo in his true form hovered in the sky while he held his black long sword. He glanced at the puppies for a moment and shifted his attention to Leo.\n\"STATE YOUR NAME, NU'EARTHE! WHO ARE YOU?! WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING THIS DOMAIN?!\"\nLeo snorted in a bad mood. \"None of your business. Get lost while I'm still feeling generous.\"\n\"…\"\nOverlord Milo didn't realize that Leo was the Florida Man he was looking for. He lowered his sword and turned around.\n\"Judging from how you treated the pups, I'll let you live for once. Go home while you still can. I'm taking over this domain!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and complained. \"Stop playing a cliché villain role. I've seen this type of trope multiple times.\"\n\"LISTEN HERE, NU'EARTHE!\" Milo turned around and pointed the giant sword at Leo's face. \"A weakling like you have no idea what the high-ups are doing. When the time comes, Queen Eleanor will purge the universe and unite all races as one! Your kind is fated to doom! Therefore, go home and treasure your life while you still can!\"\nHearing a piece of information, Leo pursed his lips. At first, he planned to end this guy right here. But judging how considerate he was, Leo changed his mind.\n\"You're very kind for a racist werewolf. Thanks for the tips. I'll let you live for another day.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nLeo snapped his fingers and stopped time again. This time, he activated a domain of death sword.\nTwo domains overlapped each other. The first was the time and space domain while the second one was the death sword domain. Everybody who was inside Leo's domain became a life target for him to cut down.\nLeo closed his eyes as he could sense the presence of 300 werewolves in this colony. All of them carried bloody weapons as they were responsible for the town's massacre.\nHe took off the upper hazmat suit and brought out the pen sword. He injected his Qi into it and turned it into a lightsaber. Then, he swung it once.\nThe lightsaber didn't let out a sound. However, the 300 werewolves in the death sword domain received a cut to their soul.\nLeo didn't stop there. He flew toward Overlord Max's manor as it emitted the strongest aura. When he got closer, his alien ring vibrated.\n\"Is it here?\"\nLeo followed his instinct and injected his Qi into the lightsaber. Instead of cutting the soul of a living being, the sword transformed into a large energy hammer. He swung down and hit the building.\nThe energy sword hit something hard and bouncy. However, the hammer crushed the barrier and destroyed the entire building in one hit.\nAfter crushing the building, Leo resumed the flow of time to check the result. As soon as he did that, the system prompted him with a confirmation message.\nDING\n<You have destroyed Overlord Max's headquarters!>\n<Overlord Max's domain had 52 system buildings and 0 system personnel. You have received 52 gacha tickets (Building).>\n<Overlord Max has zero treasure left in his warehouse. You have gained nothing.>\n<Overlord Max has zero lifespans remaining. You have gained nothing.>\n<You and your allies will be teleported home in 10 seconds. Please stand by.>\nRUMBLE\nThe entire colony shook and slowly dissipated into dust.\n\"WHAT?! HOW?!\"\nOverlord Milo witnessed the changes and was shocked. He looked around to find Leo, but the guy already disappeared from his sight.\nWHOOSH\nLeo returned to the puppies. He collected them in his arms and smiled at Milo.\n\"See you around, racist bitch. I'll be taking a round at the Fate Stadium soon. If you want to see me again, make sure to book a match there and wait for me.\"\n\"YOU WHAT?!\"\nWHOOSH\nIt was too late for Overlord Milo to capture Leo. He and the three puppies vanished.",

Some supplies, furniture, debris, and random objects remained. The corpses also remained in the same places.\nOverlord Milo watched everything in disbelief. A few seconds later, he gasped in realization.\n\"That's a player with a kingdom system! Damn, Nu'Earthe! Don't let me see you again!!\"\nMilo grudgingly turned toward the corpses of the hyena werewolves. He blamed them for the destruction of Overlord Max's headquarters.\n\"Tsk! If you hadn't been greedy, we would have crushed that Nu'Earthe and shared the city's loot! Serve you right!\"\nMilo was similar to Leo. He collected everybody's corpses and remaining supplies to his storage ring. Once everything was accounted for, Overlord Milo reverted to a humanoid werewolf form and teleported back to his battleship.\nUpon returning to the bridge, Milo ordered his soldiers.\n\"Set the course to the rendezvous point of the 7th princess. We'll regroup with them so that we can rebuild our mothership!\"\nThe crew silently barked in response and shifted their attention to the station console in front of them. They adjusted the ship's output, turning it around.\nBOOM\nThe battleship fired seven laser beams in front of the bow and opened a wormhole. It blasted its engine and disappeared into the warp gate.\n.\nWHOOSH\nA day later, Overlord Milo's battleship exited the wormhole and appeared 50,000km away from a fleet of a dozen artificial planets, five cubic motherships, and a thousand of star-destroyer battleships.\nOverlord Milo's ship seemed small compared to the local battleships here. He gazed at the dazzling lineup and snorted.\n\"As expected of the war-addicted princess. At this rate, she will become Queen Eleanor's successor.\"\nMilo thought of the princess with mental health issues. She might be the prettiest divine elf in the royal family, but her bipolar behavior made it uncomfortable to work with her. He still remembered how the princess killed her subordinates over the slightest disagreement.\n\"Ha… I still have to report back to her. I might die.\"\n.\n.\nLeo returned to his domain before Milo could even exit the wormhole. He and the three puppies appeared at the Altar of War.\nDING\n<You have successfully raided a player's home!>\n<The Altar of War will undergo a maintenance process for 360 days.>\n\"Holy moly!\"\nLeo was stunned by the cooldown time of this building. Realizing how long it took to recharge, Leo understood the importance of the cooldown level of this facility.\n<Quest completed.>\nFinally, the last phase quest was completed. With this, Leo could move on to the next phase and increase his domain's maximum level.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 3/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 300,000 Years of Lifespan, One Selectable SR Building, Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 17, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 17, and Enable TOP-UP Feature.\nPhase Three Tasks (10/10 Completed)\n- Recruit at least 2,000 workers.

Leo got what he wanted at last.\n\"Hah! Finally, I can WHALE the gacha! What currency do you need? I bet it's my lifespan.\"\nLeo closed the quest menu and checked the TOP-UP option. It showed a new textbox with a string of numbers. Leo's lifespan was highlighted.\n[16,912,248]\n\"Huh?!\"\nLeo hadn't counted his lifespan for a long time. When he saw the balance, he was taken aback.\n\"Man, I'm rich. I guess I can splurge a bit.\"\nThere was no button to recharge the currency. However, behind the textbox, another number textbox was visible and flashing. There was also a [+] icon behind the number.\n[0] [+]\nLeo rubbed his chin and grinned. He pressed the plus icon to check how he could top up the currency.\nDING\nA new screen appeared, revealing the exchange rate of the new currency.\n.\n1 E-CRYSTAL / 35 YOL\n10 E-CRYSTAL / 340 YOL\n100 E-CRYSTAL / 3,300 YOL\n1,000 E-CRYSTAL / 32,000 YOL\n10,000 E-CRYSTAL / 300,000 YOL\n.\nThe exchange rate looked average for a gacha game knockoff system. However, there were multiple tabs on this top-up screen.\nLeo pressed on one of them to inspect it. Unfortunately, the system informed him of a piece of bad news.\n<Promotion Feature is currently locked. Please complete more entity fate crystal quests to unlock this feature.>\n\"…Is this a scam?\"\nLeo deeply sighed. He tested the feature by purchasing the cheapest e-crystal package, aka the 10,000 e-crystal package.\nCHA-CHING!\nLeo's lifespan decreased, but the mysterious currency number box increased by 10,000.\nAfter getting the premium currency, Leo swiped the system screens. He navigated to the gacha page.\nAs Leo had been saving up, he had 62 tickets for building gacha and 10 tickets for servant gacha. This didn't include a selectable SR building ticket.\n\"Hehehehe! Alright, f2p rolls first. SHOW ME THE MONEEEEEEEEEEY!!\"\nRolled pressed the 10+1 button and gambled his life away.\n…\n66 rolls later, Leo glared at the gacha page with bloodshot eyes.\nHe didn't get a single SR building from the 66 rolls! Instead, he got 60 normal buildings and 6 rare buildings.\n\"THIS GACHA IS CURSED! MY ID IS CURSED! THIS IS A SCAM!!\"\nA PTSD flashback from the childhood days came back to haunt Leo. He recalled the days when he spent all his allowance on a gacha game and didn't get a desired character from the game.\nFortunately, the situation was different. Leo was no longer poor and dependent on his parents' wallets.\nHe had money to spend!\n\"It doesn't matter. Those were trash tickets. Come on. How much do you need to roll a 10+1?\"\nLeo rechecked the confirm button. The detail above the buttons changed.\nInstead of demanding tickets, the game allowed Leo to spend the premium currency to get the goodies. Still, the price was concerning.\n.\nOne Roll = 1,600 E-Crystals\n10+1 Roll = 16,000 E-Crystals\n.\nLeo almost vomited blood. This gacha was too expensive.\n\"Are you kidding me?! I swiped 300,000 YOL, but I don't have enough crystals to roll 10+1?! Which gacha game company runs this system?! EA?! MIHOYO?! Are you trying to compete with FGO?!\"\nLeo thrashed and tossed his arms in anger. He wished he could refund his lifespan.\n\"Dammit! Fine. It would have been a waste if I hadn't tried it at least once. I'll spend some more.\"\nAs Leo had two extra tickets, he received a small discount. He only needed an additional 2,800 crystals to do the 10+1 roll.\nUnfortunately, Leo's muscle memory acted up. He reopened the top-up menu and chose the 10,000 crystal package without thinking and confirmed the purchase.\nOld habits died hard.\n\"…Huh?\"\nLeo's brain successfully computed the data and made him realize the mistake one second after he pressed the button.\n\"NOOOOOO!! I WASTED MY LIFESPAN!!\"\nLeo shed a tear of regret. He scratched and ruffed his hair in frustration.\nA few minutes later, Leo recovered from the mental breakdown. He deeply sighed and switched the gacha page to the mannequin gacha.\nLeo had enough free buildings. He wanted more helpers.\nNot expecting anything, Leo pressed the 10+1 roll and spent the free tickets.\nDING-DING-DING\n10 grey balls and one blue ball came out. As Leo had seen them 66 times already, he closed the screen.\n10 mannequin workers and one cashier emerged. They stood in formation, looking at their new master.\nLeo blanky assigned them tasks according to their specialties. The crowd dispersed and ran toward their new workplaces.\nAfter the crowd was gone, Leo picked up the confused puppies and dragged his feet back to his bus. He ignored the local people and entered his bedroom.\nHe didn't notice that his people were busy carrying pieces of broken drones, jets, and battleships toward the junkyard.\n.\n.\nIn the bedroom, Leo found Esen sleeping in his bed. He frowned and checked the time.\n2PM. It was too early for someone to go to sleep.\n\"This brat. She's getting lazier.\"\nLeo carried the puppies outside the bus to find someone to take care of them. When he left the bus, he found Yao Qiqi, who explored the parking lot for fun.\n\"Oh, hey little girl. Come here for a second.\"\nYao Qiqi stopped exploring the empty parking lot and ran toward Leo. She spotted the three golden retriever puppies and brightly smiled.\n\"They are so cute! Can I have them?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo was about to ask Yao Qiqi to find a caretaker. Since Yao Qiqi was a monster tamer, she might suit the job.\n\"Alright. I'll give you some special food to feed them. Take care of these guys. They just lost their parents.\"\n\"Awww. Poor babies.\"\nYao Qiqi hugged the dogs. The puppies sensed her emotion and licked her to cheer her up.\n\"Hehehe! I think they like me!\"\n\"…Yeah. Sure. Take them to see your master.\"\n\"Yes, senior!\"\nYao Qiqi carried the three puppies and flew out of the parking lot.\nMentally tired and physically exhausted, Leo felt like taking a nap. He entered his bus and took a bath. Afterward, he slipped into the bed to cuddle with his lovely wife.\nSensing Leo, Esen slightly opened her eyes. When she noticed that he only cuddled with her and fell asleep, she faintly smiled and nudged her head against his chest to mark her scent on him like a cat.\n\"…Welcome home, hubby.\"\nEsen uttered in a faint voice. She was embarrassed but it gave her a fuzzy feeling in her chest.\nSoon, it would be their official wedding ceremony. She looked forward to it.",

      "content": "Chapter 249 Local Floridians Shocked as Snowstorm Approached While Ohio Man Mocked, “First Time?”\nChapter 249 – Local Floridians Shocked as Snowstorm Approached While Ohio Man Mocked, \"First Time?\"\nFate Stadium\nIn a lavish suite within the hotel, numerous bookshelves adorned the walls, holding thousands of substantial books. Seated at a central black wooden table was a sophisticated divine elf with refined blond hair.\nEllen reclined on a black leather chair, propping her feet up on the table. Using a Qi string, she meticulously trimmed her nails from the tips of her fingers, smoothing them afterward. \"Max's headquarters is destroyed by a random player. Am I hearing that correctly?\" Ellen sneered.\nMilo, the Overlord, remained motionless, folding his arms behind his back. He steadfastly maintained his gaze on his master, never shifting his eyes away.\n\"The opponent is a mysterious entity or a karmic sovereign. He is also a fate crystal bearer since he has a kingdom-building system. I can't help it.\"\n\"Is that your excuse?\"\n\"It is the unforeseen circumstance, not an excuse.\"\n\"It's the same. If you fail your mission, everything that comes out of your mouth is an excuse.\"\nMilo snorted and glared at Ellen, \"What do you want me to do then? Get myself killed pursuing the mysterious system user?\"\n\"Yes. Is there a problem with that?\"\n\"That's an abusive order and a waste of manpower. Would you prefer losing one of the few entities of our army before we could get a showdown with Overlord Xiaomao and his Cathulhu minions? This doesn't include Overlord Kishin who has been making suspicious moves recently. Had Overlord Mao never been killed, we would have been at risk of being besieged by three karmic sovereigns!\"\nEllen glanced at Milo's face. She sneered. \"I know. That was a joke. I was just testing you.\"\n\"…That wasn't even funny.\"\n\"Sometimes, you just have to act crazy to differentiate between competent subordinates and the bootlickers. I'm glad you're the former.\"\n\"…\"\nEllen stood up and snapped her fingers. The cabin's walls turned black as she released a domain to block their voices from leaking outside.\n\"In a few days, my mother will probably order me to return to the palace. But that's obviously a trap to lure me.\"\nMilo narrowed his eyes. \"Shouldn't you be complying with Her Majesty's mandate?\"\n\"And allow her to destroy my soul and steal my body and dantian? Why should I?\"\n\"…I don't understand what you mean.\"\nEllen widely smirked and walked toward a wine table. She poured a black wine into a glass and downed it in one gulp. Then, her expression turned dark.\n\"My mother has been cursed by the karma river because she destroyed and devoured too many souls. All fate crystals denied her existence and disabled her existence power. She could not increase her lifespan no matter how hard she tried…\"\n\"…Past tense? Does that mean?\"\nEllen deeply sighed.\n\"Her influence is far and wide. Years ago before I was born, she sold obsolete technologies to inferior races in various worlds in exchange for their research cooperation. Many divine elves were dispatched to inferior planets and disguised as the natives. One of them was a planet called 'Earth'.\"\n\"…\"\nMilo narrowed his eyes. He remembered the name as he once invaded the planet to search for Leo.\nEllen continued. \"At that planet, the dispatched divine elves received the order to establish a colony there permanently. Some of them married with a local and gave birth to inferior elves.\"\n\"Isn't that allowed? I mean, no law forbids them to do so.\"\n\"Indeed, it's legal. However, do you know what my mother ordered them to do next?\"\n\"…Please enlighten me, Your Highness.\"\nEllen burst into laughter. \"My mother went around and tricked Overlord Xiaomao, Overlord Mustafa, and even your lord Overlord Lucky. She offered them so many stars in exchange for a few drops of their blood essence. She distributed them to every research facility and ordered them to clone their blood!\"\n\"…What? Is that even possible?!\"\n\"Yes. It's obviously impossible since karmic sovereigns and entities' blood can't be cloned or reproduced with science or backwater technologies. But guess what? A bastard did it. You know who it was?\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Overlord Mao Miaomiao!\"\n\"!!!\"\nEllen slapped her forehead and burst into laughter.\n\"That man did something impossible! He demanded my mother to give him her blood essence and let him be one of her consorts!\"\nOverlord Milo widened his eyes in astonishment. He couldn't imagine how the matriarch would react in that situation. \"Did she kill him?\"\n\"No! Instead, she double-downed her insanity by ordering the man to create a homunculus using her blood essence and the other overlords' blood! They captured every child on the planet and experimented on them with the incomplete diluted blood.\"\nEllen walked toward her working table and pulled out a drawer. She picked up a photo of a young African-American child and a white boy with green eyes.\n\"Out of 100 million children, two survived. The black guy is none other than the husband of Ester. As for the other one, do you know what happened to the boy?\"\nEllen flickered the photo to Milo. The latter received it and gazed at the picture.\nThe brown boy resembled the infamous informant, who was known by the alias Ohio Man. As for another boy, his green eyes reminded him of the old man that he saw the other day.\n\"What happened to the boy, Your Highness?\"\n\"20 years later after the picture was taken, Overlord Mao Miaomiao who was a human at that time used a new technique that he and my mother researched on the test subject. Overlord Mao Miaomiao transferred his soul into the body and stole it!\"\n\"…What?\"\n\"Incredible, right? A human with no cultivation knowledge managed to do something that we, karmic sovereigns and entities, cannot accomplish. My mother was so overjoyed that she destroyed the entire planet's population and welcomed Overlord Mao Miaomiao as her consort. They even gave birth to the devil race!\"\nOverlord Milo was astonished. He had been wondering how and why Overlord Mao Miaomiao and his Devil Race suddenly appeared 50,000 years ago. Everything made sense after listening to Ellen's story.\n\"And that comes to my problem. You see, my mother completed the research on a soul transfer technique, but she can't simply use it recklessly. The old once said – A body is a container of a soul. If a soul is too big, the container will break. As such, to use that technique, my mother needs a sturdy container that can shelter her soul. You know that she's a karmic sovereign like me, right?\"\n\"!!!\"\nMilo was not stupid. He connected the dots and understood the hidden message.\nEllen stopped speaking. She grabbed the bottle of black wine and drank it directly. When Ellen was done, she told Milo her plan.\n\"I'll never return to my mother and die for her lust for youth. My body belongs to me, not her. This entire mobilization is a distraction. I'll be forming an alliance with the Cathulhu and Overlord Xiaomao with these forces instead!\"\n\"T-This…\"\nEllen snapped her fingers and dispelled the soundproof domain. She shouted and called the person in front of the cabin's door to come in.\n\"You can come in, brother-in-law. The door is unlocked.\"\nOverlord Milo turned around at the same time the door was opened. Behind the door was Simba in his human form.\nSimba entered the cabin and stood next to Overlord Milo. He crossed his arms behind his back like a modern soldier.\n\"Mercenary Ohio Man reports for duty!\"\nEllen nodded in approval. She shifted her gaze toward Milo.\n\"From now on, I want you two to work together. I want you to go back to my fleet and lead them toward the Cathulhu Star Sector. When they make contact with you, raise a white flag and surrender immediately.\"\nSimba nodded while Milo reluctantly placed his fist on his left chest to salute.\n\"You're dismissed.\" Ellen chased them out.\n.\n.\nFlorida Domain\nIn the junkyard, an extensive collection of spaceship parts, damaged hulls, and discarded spacesuits formed a towering heap. Local workers congregated around this heap, examining the unusual metals.\nAmong the workers, Wu Buyi and Tang Xuan were the most industrious researchers, scavenging for metal sheets to study. In the process, they stumbled upon several abandoned storage rings within spacesuits and miscellaneous containers.\nDespite both individuals having the rightful claim to the rings, neither chose to keep them. Instead, they entrusted the rings to the local mannequins, tasking them with passing the items on to Leo.\nRUMBLE\nWhile the alchemist duo rummaged through the junk, Ivy's team carried a half-destroyed battleship from the east and dropped them north of the junkyard. A portion of the spaceship touched the half-cooled lava field and sunk into the ground. However, none of the hulls showed signs of being melted or burnt.\nMarc and Beatrice took a short break and gazed at the spaceship. They let out a long sigh as they knew what it was.\n\"It has been a long time since I last saw this battleship. You know, sister. I used to dream about becoming a spaceship pilot when I was a little.\"\n\"What about now?\" Asked Beatrice.\n\"The divine elves are all racists! Because I'm a Molg, they disqualified me before I could even get a chance to take the admission test! They forced me to become a knight like you.\"\nThe Molg race represented among the various Halfling races scattered across the universe. Their lineage bore traces of both divine elf ancestry and an inherited true vampire bloodline. Consequently, every member of the Molg race possessed elongated fangs and distinctive white hair. They also exhibited an affinity for death magic and cultivation techniques associated with mortality.\nHistorically, the Molgs had served the divine elves as expendable slaves, deprived of proper resources for cultivation unless specifically permitted by their masters.\nThe Molgs' dynamic with the divine elves underwent a transformation with the arrival of Esen. At just five years old, Esen ascended as an immortal and utilized her authority to purchase 70% of the Molg population from their slaveholders. Procuring a planet, she liberated them from bondage.\nAmong the fortunate Molgs were Marc and Beatrice, profoundly grateful to Esen, pledging their unwavering loyalty to her.\nHowever, fortune took a turn. By the time Esen reached the age of seven, her younger sister, Ester, falsely incriminated her, leading to her banishment to a distant planet. Subsequently, Eleanor murdered Esen and placed a curse upon her and her followers, transforming them into undead beings. This dark chapter became part of their history.\nReminiscing about the past evoked deep emotions. They harbored gratitude towards Leo, who rescued Esen and facilitated their resurrection. They voluntarily worked without rest.\n\"I'm sure one of the battleships can be repaired. Let's find another one. I think it crashed somewhere south.\"\nBeatrice silently nodded and followed her little brother.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, the Yan Dynasty Planet's atmosphere underwent a dramatic shift. Vibrant rainbow auroras manifested above both the North and South Poles. The local temperature plummeted by ten degrees Celsius, leading to a segment of the sea freezing over. The planet's snowy expanse expanded, extending closer to the equator.\nThe planet was on the brink of entering an ice age, heralding the arrival of dense yin Qi permeating the air.\nConcurrently, the planet's core underwent a metamorphosis. The previously white core transformed into a rainbow hue as the exceedingly yang Qi from the atmosphere descended and condensed within the core. As the accumulation of yang energy intensified, heat surged.\nUnder the intense heat, rocks and minerals melted, giving rise to torrents of lava that gradually seeped through subterranean crevices. Volcanic mountains, both on the surface and submerged underwater, erupted in succession, spewing lava akin to fountains, inundating the land with molten soil from the depths.\nThe collision of extreme yin and yang energies caused a resonating buzz, solidifying into small hailstones. These condensed yin and yang energy formations descended to the ground as essence stones - a product of this natural phenomenon!\nUnfortunately, local cultivators found themselves unable to seize the opportunity to collect these naturally occurring essence stones. Most secluded practitioners fled from the volcanic mountains and the piercing cold, seeking refuge in warmer regions.\nOne such location was Leo's domain, positioned 3,000 kilometers north of the equator line, soon to face the onslaught of the extreme cold.",

      "content": "Chapter 250 A Florida Man Penetrated Airport Perimeter to Engage Alien Delegates on Runway for Cannabis Import Negotiations\nChapter 250 – A Florida Man Penetrated Airport Perimeter to Engage Alien Delegates on Runway for Cannabis Import Negotiations\nLeo, well-rested from a good night's sleep, took a leisurely walk through the junkyard to survey the amassed treasures. His expectations were met with satisfaction.\nThe diligent mannequins toiled throughout the day, managing to haul in two wrecked battleships. Regrettably, these spaceships were too large to fit within the confines of the junkyard. They were left north of the premises.\nShowing thoughtfulness, the elves and molgs froze a section of the lava field to serve as storage area for the ships, ensuring none of the salvaged spaceships disappeared into the molten pool.\nLeo gathered several pieces of metal hull and components, executing his plan. He transported them to the 5th floor of the shopping mall. Upon revealing them to the blacksmith mannequins, Leo's materials were swiftly retrieved and transported to their workshop's furnace, where they were melted down and refined.\nLeo received a system notification message:\nDING\n<You have discovered Styx Blood Metal.>\n<You have discovered Styx Blood Ore.>\n<New armors can be crafted.>\nMusing to himself, he wondered, \"What can these do?\"\nNo blacksmith answered Leo's inquiry. Focused on the furnace, the mannequins threw immortal coal, mined from the quarry, into it, intensifying the flame and generating extreme heat.\nAs the hive-mind mannequins shared their thoughts, ten junkyard workers brought over components and metal plates from the wrecked ships a minute later. They left large metal scraps in front of the blacksmith before returning to the junkyard for more.\nOnce again, Leo was curious, peering closer to observe what they would do with the metal plates.\nSeveral minutes passed, and the scraps and junk transformed into ingots. The mannequins cooled them and handed a sample to Leo for inspection.\nLeo touched the ingot with his bare hand, anticipating a mutation. Unfortunately, it showed no signs of reacting to his flesh, Qi, or blood.\nFailing to get an answer, Leo shifted his attention to the overall levels of every facility in the shopping mall. He upgraded the building and every facility to level 17.\nDING\n<New construction options!>\nRefusing to stop there, Leo opened his inventory menu and browsed the list of new buildings he obtained from the gacha. As most were common ones, he proceeded to build them to fill the shopping mall's empty slots.\nAmong the common buildings acquired in the previous gacha frenzy were 10 Alchemy workshops, 15 blacksmith workshops, 10 clothing stores, 15 gunsmith workshops, and 10 fast-food chain restaurants. Leo built everything and arranged them within the shopping mall.\nSixty new facilities occupied 60 empty slots in the mall. All workshops remained on the fifth floor, while the rest were placed on the first floor. The additional facilities increased the production rate, prompting Leo to upgrade their levels.\n.\nBasic Alchemy Workshop Level 17\nActive Cauldrons: (5/5)\nAlchemy Automatons (5/5)\nProduction Quality (5/5)\nProduction Quantity (2/5)\n.\nBlacksmith Workshop Level 17\nAutomaton Blacksmiths (5/5)\nFurnace (5/5)\nProduct Quality (5/5)\nProduction Speed (2/5)\n.\nGunsmith Workshop Level 17\nAutomaton Gunsmith (1/1)\nAutomaton Hand Loader (1/1)\nFirearm Technology (6/6)\nProduct Quality (6/6)\nStructure Quality (3/6)\n.\nClothing Store Level 17\nAutomaton Worker (4/5)\nAutomaton Weavers (3/5)\nWeaver Skills (5/5)\nStore Quality (5/5)\n.\nFood Court Level 17\nAutomatons Cooks (4/5)\nAccommodation Size (3/5)\nFood Quality (5/5)\nFood Variety (5/5)\n.\nFast-Food Chain Restaurant Level 17\nAutomatons Cooks (4/5)\nCooking Speed (3/5)\nFood Quality (5/5)\nFood Variety (5/5)\n.\nThe basic facilities nearly reached the maximum level, allowing some of them to commence producing top equipment immediately. However, the increased production came at a cost.\nThirty weaver robots from the new and existing clothing stores rushed to the fifth floor and surrounded Leo, requesting him to donate his flesh and blood.\n\"Dang it!\"\nLeo silently cursed the mannequins while reluctantly biting his arms, tearing his flesh and spilling transparent blood for the weavers. The clothing store's weavers retrieved Leo's pieces of flesh and paraded to their stores. Without relying on Leo's instruction, they learned the clothing designs from the existing stores and planned their merchandise.\nWhen everything was over, it was already midnight. Leo rested on the floor, focusing on regenerating his lost flesh and blood. All wounds instantly healed, but the pricking pain annoyed him.\nThe trouble persisted as new alchemy workshops started operating, and the alchemist mannequins required instruction. They gathered around Leo, pressuring him with their red eyes.\n\"Okay! Okay! I'll assign you a new task. Jeez!\"\nTen new workshops featured 50 cauldrons to work with. To acquire soul stones, he assigned all of them to convert existing essence stones.\nThe mannequins darted from the fifth floor to the first floor, some taking the elevator to the underground warehouse to fetch materials. After their departure, Leo let out a long sigh of relief, planning to check on the newly unlocked buildings.\nHowever, Leo forgot that other workshops also demanded new jobs. Blacksmiths, gunsmiths, and cooks mannequins gathered around Leo, menacingly staring at him.\n\"Oh, boy.\"\n.\n.\n3 AM\n\"Hah…\"\nLeo wiped his sweat and stood on the rooftop of his shopping mall. He finished assigning new tasks to the mannequins, including placing new orders to craft new weaponry and armor.\nThe previous prototype M16 was lackluster due to its limited firepower. However, Leo looked forward to seeing the other's reactions when the new weaponry emerged.\nSome of the employees still carried flintlock rifles around even though they were obsolete. He took notes to himself that he needed to order everybody to exchange their old weapons with the new ones.\nDING\n<Insufficient resources.>\n\"Hmm?\"\nSuddenly, the system message interrupted Leo's thoughts. He pressed on the notification message screen, asking the system to elaborate.\n\"What resources?\"\nDING\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 6 lacks ingredients to make spicy chicken noodles.>\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 7 lacks ingredients to make steak sandwiches.>\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 8 lacks ingredients to make Hawaiian Pizzas.>\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 9 lacks ingredients to make French fries and salad.>\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 10 lacks ingredients to make dim sum.>\n<Your fast-food chain restaurant number 11 lacks ingredients to make carbonara spaghetti.>\n\"Holy crap…\"\nFood suddenly became an issue before the stores could even operate. Leo rushed to the underground warehouse to check the storage in panic. Then, he was stunned.\nHalf of the shelves and baskets were empty. Even 90% of the fast-grown yin cabbages disappeared.\nThe self-grown food wasn't an issue since they could be harvested from the farms. However, the meat section was the big issues. All giant potatoes and thunder alligator's meat were gone. No cockatrice chicken remained in the coolers. Only the werewolf meat that the mannequins had extracted from the corpses remained.\n\"I guess I expected too much from the restaurant department.\"\nAt a time like this, Leo wished he could have a business partner who specialized in agriculture to assist him. He hoped that he could import meat, cheese, and other ingredients from elsewhere.\nThe system store was out of the question. A single cabbage cost over 1,000 YOL a piece. Thus, importing it from the system was money-sinking.\nNot all issues were impossible to solve. Leo smiled as he glanced at one of the two new system buildings.\n.\nTrade Center\nMax Visiting Merchants (0/10)\nReceptionist Mannequins (0/10)\nShipping Size (0/10)\nShipping Speed (0/10)\nPrice – 10,000 YOL\nCan be built in Shopping Mall.\n.\nThis was exactly what Leo needed. He hoped that the trade center would help him solve the food shortage issues.\nLeo built the new facility on the fourth floor, utilizing this section as an entertainment district and a guest center. He upgraded it to level 17 and operated it to test what it could do.\n.\nTrade Center Level 17\nMax Visiting Merchants (5/10)\nReceptionist Mannequins (5/10)\nShipping Size (5/10)\nShipping Speed (2/10)\n.\nThe trade center emerged on the fourth floor, boasting an interior far larger than the other stores and workshops.\nIt housed an entire airport!\nLeo hurried inside and discovered an airport terminal with a breathtaking view of a starry sky, intricate runways, a control tower, and endless space beyond the glass.\n\"What is this place?!\"\nFive female mannequins materialized from the floor, dressed in blue suits akin to the regular employees. One of them used a sound transmission technique to talk directly to Leo's mind.\n\"Welcome to the trade center, master.\"\nLeo struggled to acclimate to the talking mannequins, pondering if their intelligence relied on the shopping mall's levels or some other factor.\n\"Right. Well, what is this place? Where does the space lead to?\"\n\"The airport directly connects to the Orlando Realm, master. Sir Kitten has long secured this area, catering to visitors from other planets. It provides privacy and conceals the true coordinates of our planet from wandering visitors. It also prevents spies, restricting visitors from entering your shopping mall and other facilities.\"\n\"Oh, interesting. But what if they want to become my customers? What then?\"\n\"You can issue Visas to trustworthy visitors, master.\"\n\"…Oh.\"\nLeo was acquainted with this system, wondering if he'd have to establish a consulate or embassy on alien planets in the future to issue visas.\nBefore Leo and the mannequins could continue their conversation, the first visitor spaceship suddenly landed at the airport. Leo and the mannequins turned to gaze at the spaceship. When Leo recognized its shape and size, he gasped in astonishment.\nIt was the same model he had reserved at the Fate Stadium. It bore a striking resemblance to the spaceship he arrived in.\nThe ship landed, and a hundred humanoid aliens in snug spacesuits rushed out, carrying sci-fi rifles. After securing the landing site, their commander emerged from the spaceship - A human clad in bulky spacesuits and a space helmet.\nLeo squinted, attempting to gauge their cultivation base.\n\"Oh, just a bunch of immortals with railguns,\" he remarked, relieved.\nLeo departed from the terminal, approaching the uninvited guests with the mannequins trailing behind.\nAs the space soldiers spotted Leo, they aimed their rifles at him, even their leader brandishing a white pistol and a lightsaber handle.\nLeo folded his arms behind his back, maintaining distance, and greeted them in English.\n\"Welcome to my domain. Who are you, and what brings you here?\"\n\"…\"\nNone of the soldiers reacted to Leo's words, but their commander accessed a system screen and tinkered with it. A moment later, he lowered his weapon and spoke in English.\n\"I'm Caesar Ballers. We're from Planet United Nations.\"\n\"United Nations? UN? What the hell? Are you from Earth?\"\n\"Earth?\" The commander seemed taken aback. \"That was indeed our mother planet. However, we migrated from there several 10,000 years ago.\"\n\"…I see.\"\nThe commander sized up Leo before asking the crucial question.\n\"Mister, are you from Earth?\"\nLeo grinned widely, revealing his identity.\n\"Yes, I am Florida Man, the last survivor from Earth.\"",

Local Found Her a Day Later Having a Yoga Session With Homeless Florida Man Who Provided Her Temporary Shelter.\nChapter 251 – Woman Reported Missing after Business Trip. Local Found Her a Day Later Having a Yoga Session With Homeless Florida Man Who Provided Her Temporary Shelter.\n\"Florida Man? What an intriguing name. Are you truly rom Earth?\" the commander pondered aloud.\nLeo was startled. Something seemed awry with these individuals. \"Wait a moment. Is there a nation called the USA? The United States of America?\"\n\"Never come across it,\" came the response.\nLeo furrowed his brow in bewilderment. Then, he considered that 50,000 years had elapsed, so migrants might have forgotten about the country. Perhaps something had transpired during the time Leo was confined in a test tube.\nHe rephrased his query. \"So, which nation wields the greatest influence today? France? Germany? China? India? The UK?\"\n\"Oh, those ancient nations? I've read about them in textbooks. They collapsed when everyone gained access to cultivation methods. Governments fell within a year.\"\n\"Even China?\"\n\"Similar fate. Their supreme leader was assassinated, chaos ensued. Warlords and generals exploited the country's resources and tore it apart.\"\n\"...And which nation leads the UN?\"\n\"Poland.\"\nLeo had a hunch about the reason. He ceased prying for more details and changed the subject. \"Anyway, welcome to the Florida Domain. Regrettably, my airport can only host five delegates from your side. We beg your pardon for this, as it's related to our security.\"\nThe commander nodded in comprehension. He turned away and conversed in his native tongue, yet Leo still comprehended their words.\n\"Andria and the three of you, come with me. The rest, guard the ship. Oh, right.\" The commander pivoted and saluted akin to a modern soldier. \"I'm Lieutenant General Filip Petroski of the United Nations Self-Defense Force. You can call me Filip.\"\n\"Nice to meet you. Welcome again.\"\nFilip and four companions strode into Leo's airport. Some of the guards from the ship attempted to enter the terminal but encountered an invisible barrier. He stepped back, bewildered, and touched the transparent wall in surprise.\nSuppressing a smile, Leo guided the visitors to his shopping mall. While they walked, Filip and his soldiers removed their space helmets as a sign of respect.\nFilip, a middle-aged man with a crew-cut brown hair, a neatly trimmed full beard, and well-defined muscles, seemed to be in his 40s. Among his followers was a blonde woman with a pointed ear protruding behind her. She also possessed long, light brown hair and blue eyes. Judging by her lovely countenance and smooth skin, she appeared to be in her early 20s. The others, all with Caucasian features and dark brown hair, looked younger than Filip.\nLeo paid little heed to their appearances, surmising that their true ages might exceed their looks, given an air of immortality they exuded.\nAs the visitors departed from the airport, they furrowed their brows, surveying their surroundings. It had been a long time since they had last encountered a structure resembling a modern shopping mall.\n\"A shopping complex?\" Filip pondered.\n\"Yes. Welcome to my base. Apologies for the modest accommodations and lack of reception. I wasn't expecting visitors today.\"\n\"No, it's our fault for intruding on your domain. By the way…\"\nFilip glanced at the front desk of the fourth floor's casino and peered inside with his keen sight. He observed the interior's apparent size, larger than the shopping mall's slot, which puzzled him.\n\"By any chance, are you a master of time and space array?\" inquired Filip.\n\"Yes. Is that rare?\"\n\"It is indeed rare. Few experts in our world could practice it as the top brass kept the cultivation method a secret. Only the parliament cabinets and senators had access.\"\n\"Are they monopolize the methods?\"\n\"We had no choice. Otherwise, the local population might have obliterated every civilization for their own gain. It was for the greater good.\"\n\"I see.\"\nLeo escorted the visitors to the tavern of heroes and arranged a lavish suite for their accommodation. Seated in the lobby, he invited them to rest and began conversing.\nGetting to the point, Leo said, \"This might sound abrupt, but I'm pressed for time. I'd like to finalize negotiations and treaties here if you don't mind?\"\n\"No problem. It's better for us. Our men need to resupply. Our inferior technologies lag several million years behind the Divine Elves, Devils, Cathulhus, and Onis. We still rely solely on soul stones for space travel. So, could we begin by inquiring if we could purchase some soul stones from you?\"\nThis was what Leo had been anticipating. He readily agreed but sought information on trade methods and currency.\n\"How will you pay? Barter trade?\" asked Leo.\nFilip turned to the blond girl, who nodded and tapped a smartwatch on her wrist. A light yellow holographic screen projected from the device, displaying the ship's cargo goods list.\nShe presented the list to Leo, highlighting blue lumber, gold bars, tree saplings, fertilizers, and vegetables as the main items.\nLeo scanned the list and felt disappointed. Besides the vegetables, he had no use for anything else.\n\"How much veggies can I get for soul stones?\" inquired Leo.\nFilip wore a bitter smile. \"How about ten tons per soul stone? We don't have much. At best, we can trade for three soul stones.\"\nThe standard rate for fresh vegetables stood at 10 tons per soul stone in the Fate Stadium. Despite their rarity, not many immortal beings consumed them as food. They were primarily used for fertilizers and animal feed.\nFilip couldn't offer much else as his world lacked anything valuable beyond food and cultivated lumber.\n\"Would you consider trading your soul stones and other goods for our lifespan?\" proposed Filip.\n\"Lifespan?!\" Filip was taken aback.\nLeo demonstrated by revealing their lifespan status as an example.\n.\nName: Filip Petroski\nAge: 4,950\nRemaining Lifespan: 10,251 Years, 9 Months, 5 Days\n.\nThe others, surprised by the appearance of the system screen, heard Adria, the woman beside Filip, speak in astonishment.\n\"Are you a system user?!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Yes, I am,\" confirmed Leo.\nFilip's expression darkened, and he lowered his head without hesitation. \"Could you permit us to purchase your soul stones with our lifespan? We desperately need a substantial quantity!\"\nLeo chuckled, \"You haven't inquired about the price yet. Are you sure?\"\nFilip swallowed and looked up. \"How much, sir?\"\n\"I haven't decided yet. Normally, I've sold an essence stone for a year of lifespan each. It takes 1,000 essence stones to make one soul stone, so it will be quite costly. Not to mention an extra charge for the conversion process. But how about this? I'll offer you a wholesale price: 1,000 years of lifespan per soul stone. How does that sound?\"\nFilip and the others rechecked their lifespan, sighing deeply. Everyone in the group lived over 3,000 years, with an average lifespan between 7,000 and 8,000 years. Only their commander had a longer life expectancy.\nWhispering among themselves, they consulted the commander.\n\"Sir, what if each of us sacrifices one or two thousand years of our lifespan? With around 5,000 crew members aboard, we could acquire 10,000 soul stones. This would should be enough for our world for another 100,000 years.\"\nThe commander agreed. He shared a bitter smile with Leo and asking about their discussion.\n\"Would it be possible to pay with the crew's lifespan? Is that acceptable?\" inquired the commander.\n\"That's fine by me. But you should discuss with your crew on the ship if they're willing to donate 1,000 or 2,000 years of their lifespan for soul stones.\"\n\"Thank you very much.\" Filip glanced at Andria, who nodded and hurried back to the ship.\nOnce Andria had departed, Filip and Leo changed the subject, exchanging information about their respective cultures and origins.\n.\nAndria spent four hours persuading the crewmates. A few disagreed initially about sharing their lifespan. However, under their commander's direct order, they reluctantly consented.\nDuring her return trip, Andria encountered a familiar face. Hua Taixu emerged from the time chamber after training a group of curious youngsters. In the midst of seeking new prospects, their eyes met.\nAndria raised her eyebrows, recognizing him as a famous historical figure who aided their migration to another world and propagated the dao of swords.\n\"You, woman!\" Hua Taixu pointed at Andria.\n\"Me?\"\n\"You, strong! Come train. You stronger!\"\nAndria wryly smiled, unable to decipher his language. She excused herself, \"I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment. Please excuse me.\"\n\"Tsk!\" Hua Taixu didn't insist, turning away to seek new individuals to train.\nBefore leaving, Andria couldn't resist asking, \"Sir, are you by any chance related to the sword saint Hua Taixu?\"\nHua Taixu turned back, beaming with a bright smile. \"I, his shadow. Me, HIM!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You, come! WE TRAIN!\"\n\"Err…\"\nHua Taixu acted swiftly, seizing Andria's hand and pulling her into the time chamber. He activated the facility, locking her inside.\nLeo and Filip would need to wait a while before she could return. By the time they realized, they already waited for her for the entire day.",

Although the eternal nature of the immortals helped endure such waits, Leo felt a tinge of drowsiness after an intense staring contest with the visitors.\n\"Should we search for her?\" Filip inquired.\n\"Nah, I can sense her life force. She's likely around here, lost in something,\" Leo replied confidently.\nTrue to Leo's intuition, Andria eventually made her way to the tavern of heroes, accompanied by Hua Taixu. Strangely, both had ascended to the deity realm in their cultivation.\nHua Taixu sought Leo out for an upgrade, while Andria arrived to report her transformation.\n\"C-Commander, I've made it. I'm now a deity,\" she announced.\n\"What?!\" Filip exclaimed, attempting to gauge her newfound strength but finding it impenetrable.\n\"Me, STRONK! Master, Help, STRONGER!\" Hua Taixu chuckled, joining Leo and proudly brandishing a cup of the rare holy water of true fate crystal, which he obtained from the pylon tower's fountain.\nLeo, feeling a headache looming, reclined against his couch and accessed Hua Taixu's status menu to review the upgrade costs for the summoned shadow.\nHua Taixu stood at level 10, aka the deity realm's starting point. The next level required a drop of fate crystal's holy water and 1,000 YOL to boost his strength by a star. However, there was no maximum limit how many stars Hua Taixu could hold.\nLeo realized the potential for inflation and the financial drain this could become.\nTurning to Hua Taixu, Leo posed a pointed question, \"How many stars do you intend to attain, Hua Taixu?\"\nHua Taixu beamed, \"MANY!\"\n\"How many?\"\n\"MANY!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo couldn't justify expending 10 million years of lifespan just to bolster the foundation of one or two subordinates. He believed that one million YOL or 1,000 stars should suffice for an employee. If Hua Taixu desired more, he'd have to offer something in return.\n\"I'm using up so much life force for you. You've got to put in more effort than before, alright?\"\n\"ME STRONK! ME WORK HARDER!\"\nShaking his head, Leo lamented the investment of hard-earned lifespan into this caveman. Still, he elevated the guy's cultivation base to a 1,000-star deity.\nThough Hua Taixu's level remained at 10, his strength surged drastically. His aura emitted the presence of a supreme expert, and muscular size grew.\nHowever, overzealous upgrading of the shadow bore consequences. The system notified Leo of an unprecedented event.\nDING\n<Your subordinate Hua Taixu no longer shares a karmic tie with the original Hua Taixu's karmic soul.>\n<The soul of the original Hua Taixu has sensed your presence.>\nDING\n<Hua Taixu has sent a friend request.>\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo felt perplexed. According to the biography, Hua Taixu should have been long deceased. Yet, the recent message contradicted this information.\nThere was something off about this individual. Nevertheless, in the pursuit of gathering more information, Leo accepted the friend request.\nThe friend system became available after Leo constructed the tavern of heroes. He could add any system user as a friend, including Acku. However, at that moment, Leo tested it with the original Hua Taixu.\nDING\nUpon accepting the request, the name appeared, but strangely, the portrait depicted a different person. He seemed younger and considerably more astute.\n\"Um, could you finalize the deal?\" Filip interrupted Leo's absentmindedness.\n\"Oh, right. My mistake. Here,\" Leo activated his system and collected the payment, \"I'll go fetch the soul stones. You can rest here. But you, come with me, you monkey!\"\nLeo dragged Hua Taixu's shadow along, knowing there was much to discuss.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Filip inquired of Andria the reason for her delay.\n\"What happened yesterday? How did you ascend!?\" he asked.\nAndria admitted, \"That strange old man pulled me into an odd location. It felt like it existed within a space-time array. Time passed differently there, much longer than usual.\"\n\"I'm having trouble grasping this.\"\n\"You'd have to experience it firsthand. I was stuck there for what felt like over a year, I believe.\"\n\"…Incredible.\"\nFilip and the other three soldiers became intrigued, discussing a plan to visit the facility once their current deal concluded.\n.\n.\nAfter pulling Hua Taixu aside, Leo questioned him, \"Aren't you Hua Taixu? Why is there another individual?\"\nHua Taixu snorted, \"Me, shadow. He, real. We, no same!\"\n\"Yeah, I get that. But weren't you supposed to be deceased?\"\n\"Dead, he. Me clone! Me alive!\"\n\"…I see. Next question, why is the real one alive?\"\n\"Rebirth! He baby again!\"\n\"Ah.\"\nLeo found this explanation enlightening, yet it raised numerous questions and mysteries about the cycle of reincarnation. He wondered if Sierra's situation was similar.\nWhile Leo conversed with Hua Taixu, the original finally messaged him.\n\"You're exploiting my clone, aren't you?\"\nLeo replied, \"Your descendants longed for your return, but you never did. It's not my fault.\"\n\"Whatever you just did has damaged my reputation and my safety. I've recently reincarnated and am on the verge of becoming a sage. Raising my clone's cultivation base might have alerted my enemies to my existence. They'll start searching for me, and I'll be in trouble!\"\n\"But he isn't you.\"\n\"He's my shadow! He has my former face. His actions affect me!\"\n\"Ah, my mistake.\" Leo began feeling guilty about Hua Taixu. Yet, he believed it wasn't solely his responsibility as Hua Taixu never returned to assist Hua Jiashan and the Life Sword Sect.\n\"Anyway, I'm currently at the Fate Stadium. If you swing by, let me know. I have something to pass on to Hua Jiashan.\"\n\"…Alright.\"\nThe two conversed for a while before Leo resumed his duties.\n.\n.\nThe alchemy workshops had been bustling. Nearly reaching their maximum level, these buildings delivered satisfactory performances.\nSoul stones, grain pills, and other products poured from these workshops, their production rate so rapid that the alchemist trainees felt dizzy.\nArriving at the fifth floor, Leo hurried into one of the workshops and inquired about the storage of finished products. He then swiftly gathering everything.\nCreating soul stones proved simple using essence stones as primary materials. Moreover, the conversion rate was based on the workshop's quality. Instead of the usual one soul stone per 1,000 essence stones, each cauldron produced 50!\nLeo was astonished but kept quiet. He gathered these precious cultivation resources to exchange with the visitors.\nThese soul stones were significantly larger than hand-sized essence stones, each almost the size of an adult human. Leo stowed them in a spare spatial ring, aiming to fulfill the request.\nHowever, time was pressing. A workshop with five cauldrons managed 250 soul stones daily. With 10 workshops, Leo procured 2,500 soul stones for the moment.\n\"Well, this might take a while. They might need to stay for 3 or 4 days,\" Leo mused.\nReturning to Filip's group, he informed them of the delay.\n\"It'll take about 4 days to transfer 10,000 soul stones. For now, here's 2,500,\" he said, passing a storage ring containing the fresh soul stones to Filip.\nFilip examined the ring's content. His eyes lighted up at the sight of such potent soul stones.\n\"Senior Florida Man, this is incredible! We'll gladly wait! We'll gladly even if it takes a year!\"\n\"I see.\"\nFilip passed the ring around for the others to see. Andria and the rest were elated as these soul stones held more energy than any they had encountered before.\nRealizing they'd be stuck for a while, Filip turned to Leo, \"While we're here, could we explore your place? We're eager to check out the facility my comrade visited.\"\n\"Of course!\" Leo welcomed the idea. \"Some might require your lifespan as a fee. Talk to the mannequins by the shops. They'll guide you.\"\n\"Thank you! Oh, about the vegetables…\"\n\"I'll trade for those, too. They'll spoil if kept on your ship, right?\"\n\"Thank you for understanding, senior!\"\nFilip couldn't contain his happiness. This deal would benefit his world's local population. Plus, if Andria could advance her cultivation base within a day, Filip wanted to give it a try as well.\n.\n.\nLeo left Filip and the group alone. Again, he was a busy man. After all, he hadn't used the SR gacha ticket and the premium currency to try his luck yet.\nAs Leo believed that fate crystals affected his luck, he entered his bus and poured all collected fate crystals on his bed. He then knelt and prayed.\n\"Bless me luck, my lucky charms! I want some good URs!\"\nLeo spent 16,000 premium currency and drew 11 building gacha balls from the machine!\nDING-DING-DING\nLeo closed his eyes, afraid to face reality. He only listened to the sound effects and pursed his lips.\nDING-DING-DING\nThe sfx was loud and weird. Leo slightly opened his eyes to take a peek at the system screen.\nA rainbow ball…\nOne rainbow ball…? Wait, there was another…\nTwo rainbow balls…?\nTWO RAINBOW BALLS?!\nTWO RAINBOW GACHA BALLS CAME OUT!!\nLeo gasped for air. He smacked his chest as his heart almost stopped beating from shock.\nUnfortunately, this king of luck had a consequence. Two of the sky fate crystals turned into dust!\n\"WWWWHAAATTTT?!\"\nLeo noticed the dusty pile on his bed and realized why it happened. He collected all fate crystals and sweated profusely. Instead of praying for a good roll, he wished the fate crystals wouldn't be all broken because of his stupid desire.\nFortunately, aside from the two sky fate crystals, the rest remained intact.\n\"Whew.\" Leo wiped his sweat and glanced at the UR icons. He brightly grinned.\n.\nPortal to Cow Level\nNumber of Cows (x100) [0/25]\nQuality of Cows [0/25]\nRespawn Rate [0/25]\nPortal Cooldown [0/25]\nCan only be built on Mystic Realm Platform\n.\nPortal to Agriculture Realm\nNumber of Farms (x100) [0/25]\nNumber of Fish Ponds (x100) [0/25]\nNumber of Pig Pens (x100) [0/25]\nNumber of Chicken Barns (x100) [0/25]\nCan only be built on Mystic Realm Platform",

Tw*tter Exploded as Men Expressed Their Desire to Replace the Cow.\nChapter 253 – Florida Man Took Picture of a Cow on a Couch Surrounded by Five Black Horses.?Tw*tter Exploded as Men Expressed Their Desire to Replace the Cow.\n\"T-THE LEGENDARY COW LEVEL!\"\nLeo hysterically cackled like a madman, imagining himself engulfed by a horde of enraged humanoid cows wielding scythes and halberds. He eagerly anticipated the chaos and weirdness of the adventure.\nThe two structures appeared to be buildings but were, in fact, portals to another world. Leo was intrigued by these changes.\nEager to test the portals, Leo hurried to the platform. Upon arrival, he found Meowmeow, Lucky, and Mu-Nyang in their usual place. Meowmeow's attendants stood respectfully behind him as he was in the middle of recuperating from the previous skirmish.\nMu-Nyang exhibited a change in demeanor, closing his eyes in deep meditation, focused on internal digestion. Meanwhile, Lucky, true to his nature as a dog, wagged his tail and panted. His glittering eyes anticipated Leo's affection.\nFollowing his encounter with Hua Taixu's original soul, Leo discerned a unique quality about these statues. They seemed to be clones of an exceptionally skilled expert.\n\"Whose clone are you, damn statues?\" inquired Leo.\nLucky panted, responding earnestly, \"Overlord Lucky, woof!\"\nMu-Nyang cracked open his eyes slightly, offering cryptic insight. \"My essence derives from Overlord Mustafa of the Cathulhu, munya.\"\nTurning to Meowmeow, Leo sought an answer.\nThe black-winged angel replied promptly, \"Overlord Mao Miaomiao, my lord.\"\n\"...As expected. And Kitten?\"\nSpeaking on Aslan's behalf, Meowmeow replied, \"Overlord Xiaomao.\"\n\"So, everyone here is a clone of a super expert. But why claim to be my shadows? How are you connected to me?\"\nLucky panted as usual, yet he was the most forthright that day.\n\"You possess everyone's bloodline, woof!\"\n\"Everybody's bloodline?!\"\n\"You are also a... creation of those super experts, woof.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo paused to ponder. He remained silent for 30 minutes to digest the unexpected information.\nWhat was he?\nHe knew about the cultivation ranks and Karma River. He was aware of how to use them and how they functioned as a whole. However, nobody had told him about his origins.\nThen, Leo recalled a conversation when he secretly chatted with them regarding his origins and his power.\n\"Wait. That actually makes a lot of sense. You all mentioned the fate crystals before.\"\n\"Yes, woof! Initially, you were incomplete. But when your soul assimilated with the entity fate crystal left by your parents, you broke free from bloodline curses, woof! Doctor Mao Miaomiao might have taken your original body, but you're far stronger now, woof!\"\nLeo had heard similar details from the four guardian statues previously. Initially skeptical, he thought they emerged from the mysterious alien ring. Yet, as he learned more, he realized they might be sentient cancer cells that evolved independently from him.\nLucky intercepted Leo's thoughts.\n\"We're not precisely your cells, woof. We require your proximity. Otherwise, our power diminishes, and we fade, woof. Our existence is tied to your karmic river, woof!\"\nUpon Lucky's reminder, Leo noticed invisible strings linking the guardian statues to his dantian universe's karma river. He reached out, touching one.\nThe string connected Leo with Meowmeow. Upon contact, Leo could perceive Meowmeow's senses and glimpse a fragment of his memories.\nThe memory wasn't pleasant. It recounted Leo's struggles on Earth as an incomplete mutant facing tribulation lightning bolts. At that time, his cultivation was equivalent to a golden core cultivator about to reach the nascent soul rank in the Yan Dynasty's standards.\nUpon reaching the nascent soul level, instead of awakening a nascent soul or dao avatar, Aslan, Meowmeow, Lucky, and Mu-Nyang emerged.\nEach absorbed a different facet of Leo's bloodline, residing within him. However, none of them could emerged as the entity fate crystal suppressed their growth and tied them with Leo's soul.\nThe four resisted against the unknown force at first. But when they realized that their rapid growth rate might harm and destroy Leo's body prematurely, they stopped resisting.\nConstant interaction with the crystal granted them knowledge of Leo's bloodline origins. They gradually assimilated the abilities and knowledge of their blood donors.\nAs Leo grew stronger, so did they. The four guardians copied a portion of the donors' power, reaching their strength but unable to exist independently. They remained a part of Leo, reliant on him.\nMeowmeow was the most rebellious. After copying Doctor Mao's skills, he cultivated his dantian universe secretly while Leo was on Earth. He eventually selected three women to become his wives.\nAfterward, the four awaited Leo's daily growth. As they had too much free time, they delved into Leo's fate and potential futures. Everyone got a glimpse of his future.\nMeowmeow witnessed Leo marrying Esen and the tragedy. He also saw the event when Doctor Mao Miaomiao forcefully expelled Leo's soul before seizing his body.\nSensing he'd gathered enough, Leo paused Meowmeow's memory probe.\n\"Did any of you foresee my future?\" Leo asked.\nMu-Nyang laughed, \"Aside from the obvious, you'll adopt two daughters, munya. You know who they are, right, munya?\"\n\"Within my domain?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Young and talented individuals.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo ceased questioning Mu-Nyang. He got enough information, thus he refocused on his main goal.\nDING\nDING\nLeo constructed the Portals to the Cow Level and Agriculture Realm beside the mystic realm's main portal device. The agriculture portal appeared as a barn door frame without an energy layer, akin to a crystal-clear HD monitor. The cow level's portal, a blue oval mana gate, emitted a buzzing hum.\nPurposefully adjusting these portals, Leo tailored them to his immediate needs.\n.\nPortal to Cow Level (Level 17)\nNumber of Cows (x100) [10/25]\nQuality of Cows [5/25]\nRespawn Rate [1/25]\nPortal Cooldown [1/25]\n.\nPortal to Agriculture Realm Level 17\nNumber of Farms (x100) [4/25]\nNumber of Fish Ponds (x100) [4/25]\nNumber of Pig Pens (x100) [5/25]\nNumber of Chicken Barns (x100) [4/25]\n.\nLeo visited the agricultural world first. Upon entering, his feet were stuck on the firm ground. The intense gravity force of this world made him weigh 50 times heavier.\nThe gravity of a planet unveiled many things about its qualities. For example, the Yan Dynasty Planet's gravity force was merely five times stronger than Earth's. Even so, the Yan Continent was already expansive and larger than every continent on Earth combined.\n\"A big world, I see.\"\nLeo shifted his attention to the environment next.\nThe fresh scent of green grasses and clean air soothed him. The wide grassland, trees, and nature seduced Leo to sit down. He walked 10 steps and sat on a patch of short grasses, which seemed to have been cut recently.\nA second later, his expression changed.\n\"Oh, crap!\"\nLeo almost jumped back out of the gate as he realized his mistake. He didn't wear a hazmat suit to protect the environment from his radiation contamination.\nDespite touching the grasses with his bare hands, the green grasses never changed. Instead, Leo sensed the warm air produced by the grasses and trees. He narrowed his eyes and inspected them.\n\"Isn't this…\"\nThe warm air was colorless and scentless. The fresh scent of the grasses was the disguise of the anomaly of this world.\nThe warm air was the purest yang Qi, similar to Leo's Qi and blood. It gave birth to life and it protected nature.\nLeo was relieved to see his radiation neutralized by nature. At least, this world couldn't be contaminated if he accidentally touched any plant or tree.\nLeo explored deeper into the world. He ascended 10,000 kilometers to the sky to scan the world from above.\nHe couldn't see any structure or animal. He could only see tall oak trees, flower patches, and endless grassland.\nAs Leo could see everything from this altitude, he decided to take a world tour. He observed which direction this planet rotated first. After making sure that it spanned anti-clockwise, Leo flew in the opposite direction.\nAfter flying 10,000 kilometers east, Leo finally found what the system had built for him. There was a massive castle in the middle of farms, barns, and pig pens. The strange thing was, that everything was 50 times larger than a human's standard.\nFor example, the castle's brick walls were 500 meters tall and 150 meters thick. Each brick was three times larger than the pyramid's stone block, but they were much more durable and harder.\nThis aroused Leo's interest. Since this place had a strong gravity, everything in this world was forced to evolve to survive. He wondered how strong the tree of this world was.\n'Can it be stronger than sacred wood?'\nLeo wished to cut one of them down and brought it back for research. However, he was determined not to get sidetracked at the moment.\nHe gazed at the farms and counted them.\n.\nSeveral minutes later, Leo understood how this place worked. Every point allocated to an attribute increased the number of structures by 100 instead of one. Thus, 400 50-acre farms, 400 50-acre fish ponds, 500 gigantic pig pens, and 400 chicken barns extended around the castle.\nLeo ascended and landed on top of the castle roof. Upon landing, the system informed him of the status of this place.\nDING\n.\nAgriculture Realm (No Name)\nGovernor: None\nGovernor Effect: None\nPrimary Warehouse: Not Assigned\nCrop Respawning Time: One Hour\nCrop Mature Time: 24 Hours\nFish Respawning Time: One Hour\nFish Mature Time: 24 Hours\nPig Respawning Time: One Hour\nPig Mature Time: 24 Hours\nChicken Respawning Time: One Hour\nChicken Mature Time: 24 Hours\n.\nLooking at the menu, Leo was intrigued. He thought of the idle guardians and wondered which one he should assign here as a governor.\n'I sent Kitten to Orlando because it has a lot of crocs and fish. Should I send him here instead? I don't think Meowmeow is into agriculture stuff. Lucky doesn't fit it. I doubt that the dog is only good at guarding, not managing. He is more of a fighter. As for Mu-Nyang, that guy is as obnoxious as Cat. Since he's an octopus cat, should he be more suitable for a swamp world like Orlando Realm? Alright, I've made up my mind. Kitten will be transferred here. As for that stupid cathulhu, he's gonna go hunt thunder caimans instead.'\nLeo backtracked and exited the realm.\nWhen Leo came out, he asked Mu-Nyang to replace Aslan's duty.\n\"Go and bring Kitten back. You will govern that caiman realm from now on.\"\nGetting assigned a new task, Mu-Nyang was delighted, \"Sweet, munya! Caiman buffet, munya!\"\n\"HEY! Your job is to collect food, material, and lifespan from the monsters for me, not eating everything!\"\nIt was too late for Leo to reprimand Mu-Nyang. The octopus cat disappeared into the permanent Orlando portal. An hour later, Aslan returned and sighed when he saw Leo's face.\n\"A new job?\" Asked Aslan.\n\"Yeah, come with me to the new place. I need you to be this realm's governor and improve the quality of this agriculture world.\"\nAslan had no issue with that. Still, as Leo's father, he was concerned about the shortage of personnel. He knew that Leo would claim more worlds and realms in this universe, and he would soon lack trustworthy people to fill the governor positions.\n\"Master, if I may, may I suggest something?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Some of your subordinates, such as Sierra, can be used as a workforce. By chance, if you manage to draw a clone of a talented person from the gacha, you can even send them to work as a governor. Since their existence is tied to you, they will never betray you.\"\n\"…I know that.\"\n\"Then, could I recommend Sierra to fill this position instead of me? If you upgrade her to a deity, her talents and other abilities will drastically increase. I'm a clone of a fisherman overlord, and I'm only good at fishing karma embryos in Karma River. Sierra's abilities in the agriculture field surpass mine.\"\n\"…\"\nIt made sense. Leo totally forgot about the perverted cow woman.\nAs Leo agreed with Aslan's suggestion, he let the fisherman's clone guard the platform. He summoned Sierra instead.\n.\n.\nAn hour later, Sierra arrived on the platform. The first thing she requested Leo was predictable.\n\"Master, have you finally decided to milk me?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"I'm gonna upgrade you into a deity. Prepare yourself.\"\n\"Okay. But will you milk me? Or would you prefer to drink it from the source?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo thought to himself. He wished to put Sierra alone on a couch surrounded by five nightmare horses in season one day. He bet that the VDO would be a hit and become the next hot meme on the internet.",

He Was Later Found Humping a Cow That Day.\nChapter 254 – Mad Cow Disease Discovered in Florida Man's Butcher Shop. Store Owner Denied the Allegations and Ate Raw Beef in front of WHO Officials. He Was Later Found Humping a Cow That Day.\nLeo appointed Sierra as the new agriculture realm's governor as planned. He also spent a million YOL to upgrade her to the same strength as Hua Taixu. Then, they entered the realm together to finalize the appointment and the new working place.\nIt had been two hours since the building had been activated. Leo wondered what the respawn feature was.\nUpon arriving at the castle, Leo found his answer. All farms were covered in unknown green crops. The fish ponds bubbled and rippled as countless schools of fish danced like a Disney princess underwater. Every fish was as large as an adult tuna!\nThe farms and the ponds were nothing compared to the pig pens and the chicken barns. Leo and Sierra dropped their jaws, staring at the Jurassic Park.\nThere were Dinosaurs in the pig pens and chicken barns.\nThe chicks looked the same as modern chicken babies on a farm. Their yellowish fur and their round heads made them look cute, except for their humongous size of a T-Rex. Because their windpipe was wider than smaller chicks, their chirping voice sounded intimidating.\nKEEEEEEEECH\nEvery time they made a sound, the air trembled and rippled. Sierra frowned and picked her ears in frustration as their noise pricked her eardrums.\n\"Master, those chickens are not cute.\" Complained Sierra.\n\"I know.\"\nLeo glanced at the pig pens. There were even more heinous monsters there.\nInstead of regular chubby pigs, the pens were occupied by chonky four-legged pink orcs. They had the same face as piglets, but their staggering height of 100 meters and 300 meters long made Leo question where they came from.\nBefore Leo decided to make Sierra the governor, he stood on the castle wall and waited for another hour to observe the changes.\nDING\nIt didn't take long for the realm to create more creatures. Leo noticed how this planet condensed yang Qi in the air and manifested embryos of pig babies. As for the chickens and fish, the condensed Qi transformed into eggs.\nWhile the pig embryos floated in the air, they rapidly grew and matured into baby piglets. The newborn creatures softly landed in the pig pens and were automatically grouped in one building. As for the eggs, they gradually hatched. The fish eggs poured tuna-like fish into an empty pond while the chicks marched toward their new barn after birth.\nLeo witnessed how the pigs, chickens, and fish were born and grouped. He finally understood how the respawn feature worked.\n\"So, I'm getting all these livestock for free? Nice!\"\nThe last remaining question was, how big they would grow when they were matured. He decided to remain here for the entire day to witness the changes.\nWhile he was at it, Leo appointed Sierra as the new governor of this realm. He also allowed her to explore this planet to get familiarized with it.\nDING\nA system screen appeared in front of Sierra. She was taken aback at first, but she quickly understood her assignment. She fiddled with it to learn new things.\nA few minutes later, Sierra renamed the realm 'Tauron Farm'. Then, the status of the realm changed according to the governor's strengths and traits.\n.\nAgriculture Realm (Tauron Farm)\nGovernor: Sierra Tauron\nGovernor Effect: Increase the quality of livestock by 50%. Reduce the respawning speed of all livestock by 50%.\nPrimary Warehouse: B2, Shopping Mall Warehouse\nCrop Respawning Time: One Hour\nCrop Mature Time: 24 Hours\nFish Respawning Time: 30 Minutes\nFish Mature Time: 24 Hours\nPig Respawning Time: 30 Minutes\nPig Mature Time: 24 Hours\nChicken Respawning Time: 30 Minutes\nChicken Mature Time: 24 Hours\n.\nLeo could also see the changes, and he nodded in approval. Indeed, her abilities suited this place better than that fisherman statue.\n\"Now, we wait.\"\n.\n.\n22 hours later, creatures of the first batch grew up and reached maturity by consuming the yang Qi in the air as if they were plants.\nThe chicks grew even taller than Godzillas, but their feathers and appearance looked the same as mature chickens. A total of 100 edible kaijus hovered over the clouds and flapped their giant wings.\nPOKOK!\nThe system was merciless. As soon as they reached maturity age, all adult male chickens lost all feathers and stopped breathing. They died without realizing what killed them. Afterward, their stomachs were sliced by an invisible knife, while their blood and innards were extracted and separated.\nThe hens were different. They died as well, however, their stomachs were cut open. Inside every hen's stomach, a golden egg radiated a brilliant light and a transparent aura of pure yang Qi. These eggs were also collected and placed on a grass patch next to the exit portal. As for the chicken meat, they were cleanly cut and arranged in parts.\nThe pigs and fish suffered the same fate. A hundred megalodon-sized tuna were pulled from the ponds and descaled before the system collected their meat and edible organs. The pigs were cut in half and turned into hung meat in butcher shops.\nMeanwhile, the farms produced only wheat for Leo. However, the grains were as tough as steel and as big as an adult human's arm. When the system put a million grains together, they looked like giant pieces of white metal blocks.\nLeo stood there, staring at the wheat grains. He rubbed his forehead and pondered, \"How should I grind them? Can you even make flour out of these?!\"\nSierra noticed Leo's trouble. She advised him. \"You can just cook them or boil them directly.\"\n\"Oh, eat them the same way as rice?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLeo nodded. He wondered what they tasted like.\n.\n.\nThe business with the agriculture realm was over. When Leo exited the portal, a dozen warehouse and granary workers already stood there, waiting to enter the realm to collect meat and other goodies.\nLeo turned around and gazed at the barn portal. He doubted, \"Can you even bring those giant meat through here?\"\nThe mannequins ignored Leo's doubt and entered the portal. A few seconds later, one of them came out, pulling a piece of raw chicken drumstick out. The gate enlarged and expanded according to the size of the meat instead of squeezing it.\nAs the worker had no issue transporting his items, Leo entrusted the tasks to these guys. Still, he had some concerns as the transportation of giant meat was unhealthy. The mannequins carried them on their backs while some parts of the meat touched the ground.\nLeo glanced at Aslan. The latter noticed Leo's gaze and understood his intention.\nAslan assured Leo, \"I'll make containers for these. Actually, we can even use storage rings. I'll teach the automatons later.\"\n\"Please do. My kidneys are cringing. Imagine seeing a chuck of meat being dragged on the ground and finding the same meat on your table.\"\n\"I know. Give me some time.\" Aslan deeply sighed and vanished.\nLeo sighed and finally turned his attention to the cow level. He wondered if they had respawned enough cows for him to play with yet.\n\"BRING IT!\"\n.\n.\nLeo entered the portal to the cow level. Upon crossing to the other side, Leo found a world of frozen blood swamps. Opposite of the agriculture world, this place was full of yin Qi. Its absolute freezing temperature threatened to solidify Leo's bodily fluid and his blood while the extreme cold temperature pierced his bone marrow.\n\"…\"\nLeo silently exhaled a white fume. He thought of Earth when an ice Godzilla got into heat after seeing Mount Everest. That guy humped the mountain for a whole year until they merge into one mountain and froze everything in 10,000 km diameters. At that time, Leo was in seclusion under a thick layer of snow, causing him to be trapped there for 400 years.\nThe forgotten PTSD resurfaced. Leo sensed a shiver down his spine as he didn't want to be trapped in a cold place again.\nMOOOOOO!!\nWhile Leo was absentminded, the warcry of a cow vibrated the air, followed by loud footsteps and an earthquake. Leo turned around and found an army of 2,000 godzilla-sized humanoid cows wielding halberds approaching him.\n\"…Wow.\" Leo was astonished. He couldn't believe that the cow level was real.\nThe cow monsters raised their halberds and swung at Leo.\n…\nTen minutes later, Leo sat on top of 2,000 monster cows' corpses. While resting, he gently sliced a piece of a monster's neck and pulled a meat slice. He then cooked it using the flame generated from his yang Qi.\nThe makeshift steak was rough, but it was savory and delicious. Their fat seeped into every piece of their meat, making their flesh ideal for steak and grill dishes. Moreover, their meat was as soft and tender as A5 wagyu.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 10 years.>\n<Your lifespan has…>\nNot only the meat was delicious, but Leo's lifespan kept increasing because of their rich life force. He couldn't stop eating them.\nBy the time Leo was full, one hour had passed.\nMOOOOO!!\nA new wave of cow monsters screamed. An army of 10,000 cows charged from the north. At the same time, another army of 10,000 cow monsters launched a coordinated attack on Leo.\nLeo silently stored the corpses in his system inventory. He licked his fingers and widely grinned.\n\"This takes me back. COME ON, FOOD! LET'S EAT EACH OTHER!\"\nMOOOOOO!!\nA cow monster suddenly emerged from the underground and seized Leo. It stood tall and held Leo in his palm.\nLeo didn't flinch. He waved his fingers and calmly sliced the human hands of the cow monster. He also unleashed the abilities of Mao Miaomiao and Meowmeow.\nBlood Domain!\nPLOP\nPLOP\nInstantly, the blood of these cow monsters left their bodies through their orifices. They gathered and hovered over Leo's head.\nLeo collected them in his system inventory and watched the armies of cows collapse. He hummed and walked toward the endless supply of Wagyu steaks.\n\"Hoh, boy. Those cafeterias and restaurants are gonna get busy. Also…\"\nLeo picked up one of the giant halberds that the cow monsters had been carrying. Everything seemed to be made of a mysterious red metal, which emanated strong yin Qi.\nAfter holding the halberd for a while, it shrank to fit Leo's hands.\n\"OH!!\"\nLeo was pleasantly surprised. He wondered if the other halberds had this function as well.\nHe wasn't disappointed. Every halberd could shrink or expand to match the users. Leo wondered if he could sell them in his store.\n\"More merchandise! My store can now run a butcher shop! Right, I should add a meat section in the supermarket now. This is gonna be fun.\"\nLeo laughed and continued exploring the cow level.\n.\n.\nEvery hour, the cow level respawned 1,000 monster cows and 1,000 halberds. These guys had the cultivation base of a 17-star deity, and they could use providence domain of power and warcry.\nNormally, one of these cows could have stunned any intruder with their loud shout. Their absolute physical power also rivaled that of a sage, which made them a tough foe to fight in close combat. Thus, this realm was too dangerous for others to enter.\nLeo made a huge signboard in front of the portal.\n[DANGER! 17-Star Deities Inside! DO NOT ENTER!]\nAlthough not many people visited this place or Orlando Planet, some workers used this place as a hangout spot because of the beautiful view and scenery. Some of them used this place to cultivate their mind.\nWith the signboard, Leo was confident that no stupid person would enter the portal. He turned around and was about to bring the new Wagyu meat to the supermarket.\nDING\nAs soon as Leo was about to leave, the platform's elevator brought a new group of passengers. Among them, Gao Yan and Jin Yong tagged along.\nThe duo became friends, and they had been using this place as a gathering spot. Sometimes, they even tried to initiate conversations with the guardian statues.\nGao Yan and Jin Yong had already reached the immortal realm after the invasion incident. They also planned to visit the time chamber together tomorrow.\n\"Oh, master?\" Gao Yan was the first to notice Leo. He cupped his fist and saluted. \"Greetings, Lord Florida Man!\"\nJin Yong copied Gao Yan, \"Greetings, sir! It's a nice day, isn't it?\"\nLeo nodded at them and pointed at the signboard.\n\"There's new portals to other realms. Don't go into that blue portal, okay? That place is too dangerous for you two. There are deities…\"\nLeo couldn't even finish his sentences. Jin Yong burst into laughter and pulled a new weapon he salvaged from Overlord Max's battleship.\n\"Nice! I'm gonna go in there and test my new weapons!\"\n\"HEY!\" Leo bellowed and tried to stop the idiot alchemist. However, Jin Yong leaped over the signboard like a parkour master and vanished into the blue portal.\nGao Yan dryly laughed. He also sprinted toward the portal and brought out the full-charged lightsaber and Leo's upgraded pistol.\n\"Sir, I'll go in there and bring him back shortly. It won't be long!\"\n\"…\"\nThe two youngsters entered the cow level despite Leo's warning. The latter facepalmed.\n\"Damn idiots.\"",

However, the local monsters could no longer pose a challenge to them.\nThey needed something stronger.\nThis world fit their need. The extremely cold temperature and the overwhelming yin Qi almost killed them as soon as they entered their place. However, instead of taking the hint and leaving, these young men laughed in excitement.\n\"Is this a proper immortal realm?\" Gao Yan inquired.\n\"Probably something higher. Lord Florida Man's signboard said clearly; Deities are here.\"\n\"So, it's a world of deities?\"\n\"I don't know. I just want to kill something stronger than thunder caimans and cockatrices.\"\n\"Same.\"\nThe two guys took steps further and explored the surroundings.\nThe sky was crimson red, covered by the red clouds. Below their feet, several layers of ice hid the blood swamps underneath. Corpses of bull-like creatures could be seen inside.\nOnly 10 seconds had passed since they had arrived in this world. The humanoid cow monsters let out a warcry as they detected an intruder.\nMOOOOOOO!!\n\"!!!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe deafening voice of the cows stunned both cocky immortals. Their ears bled. Their vision blurred, while the muscles in their legs lost all strength.\n\"Yeah, figured as much.\"\nBehind the two men, Leo was there. He was in a hazmat suit.\nThe cow army was quick. While Leo was about to drag these young immortals away, one of them leaped over Leo and landed in front of the exit portal. It turned around and blocked the path. As for the rest of the horde, they stomped toward the three men.\nSeeing the lone guard, Leo lightly threw a light punch empty air in front of him.\nBOOM\nThe punch generated an air bullet, which blasted the head of a lone cow monster into pieces. The monster collapsed and stopped moving.\nLeo snorted and grabbed the collars of the idiot youngsters. He yeeted them toward the exit portal like a professional basketball player, scoring three points twice.\nMOOOOO!!\nThe cows were angry as their prey managed to escape. They launched their attacks at Leo.\nLeo grumbled in a bad mood.\n\"You livestock should know your place.\"\nJust by glaring at them, Leo unleashed an aura surpassing a karmic sovereign. The cow monsters froze on their track and collapsed one after another.\nAfter confirming that all cows were dead, Leo withdrew his glare. He silently turned around and exited the cow level.\n.\nComing outside, Leo inspected Gao Yan and Jin Yong's conditions.\nTheir souls had a short crack extending from their ears. Although the cracks were small, this injury might take several years to heal as no medicine could heal one's soul. In addition, Jin Yong's dantian was damaged, while Gao Yan's meridians almost shattered.\nThey found out.\n\"Yup. This is the definition of FAFO. Y'all gonna get stuck for a few years healing your wounds. I told you that realm was too dangerous.\"\nAlthough Leo scolded them, Gao Yan and Jin Yong couldn't hear him. Their eardrums were busted. He carried both men down the flying island and put them in his bus, locking them in there until they were healed.\n\"Hah.\"\nAfter dropping the two men on his bus, Leo visited the shopping mall warehouse to unload the cow's meat and corpses.\nA thousand cow monsters were big enough to fill the entire underground warehouse. Thus, Leo only unloaded 500 dead cows.\nLeo returned to the first floor. Along the way, mannequins from the restaurants rushed toward the underground warehouse, where Leo had dropped the dead cows. It seemed the food department would be busy for a while.\nGetting out of the shopping mall, Leo opened his system to check the last item he got from phase 3's quest.\n[Selectable SR Building]\nIt was different than the others. Leo could pick one from the list.\nLeo activated the item.\nDING\nA long catalog displaying a hundred icons flashed on the system screen. Leo skimmed through the list.\n.\nTrain Station\nCellphone Factory\nTheme Park\nZoo\n.\nThe list went on. However, Leo already made up his mind when he saw a certain building.\n.\n.\nA day later, Filip and Andria wandered Leo's shopping mall to explore the stores and services. They found the time chamber that Andria had mentioned.\n\"Is this the one?\" Filip pointed at the time chamber.\nAndria nodded, \"Yes. You can enter it if you find the sword saint. I don't know where he is now, though.\"\n\"It's fine. I don't think we have to wait long.\"\nAs Filip spoke, a new batch of trainees exited the time chamber along with Hua Taixu. The disciples were female teenagers of the Amazonian Sanctuary. However, their cultivation base boasted the quasi-immortal stage, while their sword mastery improved by leaps and bounds. They no longer needed to rely solely on their pets anymore.\nHua Taixu was elated as four new students inherited his way of swords. He shifted his attention to the other group next.\nThen, his eyes met with Filip's.\n\"YOU, STRONG! ME, STRONGER! Me, Train, You. YOU, STRONKER!\"\nFilip was taken aback. He looked at Andria in confusion, \"Is he always like this?\"\nAndria smirked, \"You will appreciate him when you are in there, commander. Now, follow him and seize this opportunity.\"\n\"…I don't know about this.\"\nWhile Filip hesitated, Hua Taixu threw ropes at the former and three other troopers. The sword saint's clone dragged everybody into the time chamber and burst into laughter.\nAndria sent them off and waved her hand at them. After everybody disappeared into the time chamber, she shifted her attention to the other facilities.\nThe casino didn't interest her. The boot camp reminded her of the PTSD training regime she had been through before she could become a crewmate.\nBut there was a new facility, which appeared recently. It was located far to the south of the shopping mall's fourth floor.\nThe facility took two slots in the shopping mall. Half of it was a bookstore. As for the other half, it was a library, but it was only accessible to staff members.\nAndria pouted as she wished she could enter the library to read free books. As she had no choice, she browsed through the bookstore. As an expert in this field, she skimmed through the sections of the bookshelves first.\n- Cultivation Methods\n- Sword Techniques\n- Spear Techniques\n- Pole Arm Techniques\n- Archery\n- Firearms\n- Finger Techniques\n- Fist Techniques\n- Palm Techniques\n- Elemental and Daos\n\"Huh?\"\nAndria frowned and rubbed her eyes for a moment. Making sure that she wasn't hallucinating, she approached the cultivation method section and checked the books. As most books weren't covered in plastic seals or wraps, she picked up a sample book and flipped it.\nThe book was 500 pages thick. The quality of the papers was also durable, and she felt nice when she flipped the papers. The pictures were in color and highly detailed.\n\"What?!\"\nThe book contained a detailed cultivation method from the muscle tempering stage to the quasi-immortal stage. It also provided tips and tricks that every commoner could learn and understand.\nAndria flipped around the book and read the cover.\n[Easy Cultivation Methods for Dummies]\n\"…\"\nAndria almost vomited blood. In her world, every commoner could kill to get their hands on such a cultivation method. As for her, she managed to learn a cultivation method from the military in exchange for 1,000 years of service.\nHad she gotten this before she joined the army, she wouldn't have had to get stuck in a spaceship for years.\nAndria put away the book and picked up another one nearby.\n[Foundation Building – I Wish I Knew Before I Cultivate]\nIt was a theory book, but the information seemed useful. It gave examples of the Dos and Don'ts, which cultivation beginners often overlooked in their early days.\nAndria stood there and read half of the book. She kept shaking her head and sometimes smacked her face in anger.\n\"I WISH I KNEW ALL OF THESE!! WHY CAN'T I FIND ONE OF THESE IN MY WORLD?!\"\nAndria carried the foundation building book in her arm and checked more books.\n[Life Force Gathering Method]\n[Pill Alchemy for Beginners]\n[How to Sleep as a Cultivator]\n[Overcoming Heavenly Tribulations like a Pro]\nBy the time Andria realized, she already had a dozen books in her arms. She carried them to the counter, where a lone wooden mannequin stood behind.\nAndria panted and asked, \"How much are these? I want to buy them all.\"\nThe mannequin picked the books and nimbly scanned the barcodes on the back of each book. When she was done, she showed the number and pointed at a signboard.\n[This store only accepts lifespan (years) as a currency.]\nThe mannequin pointed at the cashier machine on the counter and showed Andria the number.\n495 YOL\nThey were expensive!\nAndria's hands trembled as she didn't want to lose more lifespan. Her inner thoughts told her to return the books and read for free here. However, the other thoughts reminded her that she could share the books with others, which would be more worthwhile.\nAfter measuring the pros and cons, Andria made her decision to buy the books.\n\"I'll pay. I'll take these books.\"\nThe cashier nodded and pressed a button on the machine. As soon as she pressed it, Andria sensed a portion of her life force leaving her and entering the mannequin's body.\nAndria accepted the loss and took the books with her. It was worth the investment. Also, she suddenly gained an inspiration.\n'Right. I should go back to the ship and tell the others to buy other books. Then, we can share the knowledge among ourselves.'\nWhile Filip was busy in the time chamber, Andria rushed to the spaceship to tell her female friends about the bookstore.\n.\nAndria wasn't the only one who noticed the new bookstore on the fourth floor. The frequent visitors, such as Hua Jiashan, Tang Xuan, and other old men found them and had the same reaction as Andria's.\n\"WOW! YOU CAN DO THAT?!\"\n\"DAMMIT! I WISH I KNEW ALL OF THESE!! I'M STUPID!\"\nThe old men screamed in pain while they read the books on the shelves. 10 minutes later, they swallowed their pride and brought the books to the counter.\nHua Jiashan was decisive. He was the first to ask how Leo got his hands on them.\n\"Shopkeeper, could you tell me where your master is? I wish to know about the origins of these books.\"\nThe mannequin calmly pointed inside the library. She then pointed at a signboard, which was hand-written by Leo.\n[All books are written by ME! Don't question how I got these from. I won't answer you.]\n\"…\"\nThe crowd was speechless. Even Wu Buyi who came here with them dropped his jaw.\n\"M-My lord is so smart!\"\nHua Jiashan rolled his eyes, \"Obviously, he's a supreme expert. Who knows what his real cultivation base is. He must have learned everything firsthand to be able to write so many books.\"\nDongfang Mei ignored the crowd. She flipped through the intermediate section, where all books were related to immortals and techniques suitable for immortal stages. She wasn't disappointed.\n'This will be useful. I'll take this, this, that, and those.'\nDongfang Mei ended up purchasing 10 books, which cost her 900 YOL. However, for her, it was worth every penny.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo sat in the library, yawning and picking his nose. He currently took a short break after he had defeated random cultivators in the simulation mode 10,000 times.\nDING\n<Detecting new knowledge. Would you like to transfer your knowledge into books?>\n\"Yes.\"\nDING\nTwo books manifested and floated in front of Leo. He retrieved them and tossed the books toward a librarian behind the counter.\n\"Copy those as usual.\"\nThe librarian mannequin caught the books. She gently put them on the table and placed her hands on them.\nDING\nDING\nThe books gradually multiplied. While she did that, Leo received system notification messages.\n<You have spent 100 years of your lifespan creating 100 copies of 'Lamia's Anatomy, Weakness, and Strength'>\n<You have spent 100 years of lifespan creating 100 copies of 'Am'Sia Family Blacksmith Techniques'>\nThe newly copied books filled the bookshelves of the library first. After the librarian had finished registering the books, she transferred 10 of each to the bookstore and put them on sale.\nThe source of these books came from the system skills that Leo had copied from the simulation mode. Some of the tips and tricks also originated from Leo's understanding.\n.\nBook Complex of Singularity Level 17\nLibrarian Automaton (2/20)\nLibrary Size (5/20)\nBookstore Automaton (2/20)\nBookstore Size (5/20)\nBook Printing Speed (3/20)",

TikTokers Rushed to Drink It as Mosquito Worm Consumption Became New Trending.\nChapter 256 – Florida Man Invented Mosquito Worm Wines as New Local Merchandise. TikTokers Rushed to Drink It as Mosquito Worm Consumption Became New Trending.\nWhile Leo rested in the library, several mannequins brought a few bottles of wine over.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo glanced at the group of mannequins with wine bottles. He frowned as he didn't remember asking them to make wines.\n\"Which department are you from? Now, I have too many mannequins that I don't know where you are working anymore.\"\nThe mannequins pulled out a brush and ink from their pockets. They wrote a few words and showed them to Leo.\nThe handwriting was similar to Leo's as the mannequins were a part of his shadows. The message was simple.\n[Please accelerate the time of the wine.]\n\"Oh.\"\nLeo figured out what they wanted. However, he disliked their approach. Instead of accelerating the wine age of these few bottles of wine, he would rather do it with 10,000 at once.\nThe mannequins picked up Leo's thoughts and rushed back to their stores. Leo got curious and followed them to the first floor.\nIt turned out that the group of mannequins were the chefs from the restaurant department. They mixed the cow monster's blood, the giant chicken's blood, and the giant pig's blood together and made a new blood wine.\nLeo was confused about how they made those as mixing too many types of blood was a quick method to get AIDS. He wondered if the mannequins tried to honor a certain soldier who consummated with a monkey and brought this disease to the world.\nFor the sake of hygiene, Leo grabbed two of the wine bottles and brought them to an alchemy workshop. He researched it.\nDING\n<You have discovered Fresh Yin-Yang Blood Wine.>\n.\nRaw Yin-Yang Blood Wine\nThis wine is brewed by an anonymous master chef by mixing a cow deity, a yang pig, and a yang chicken blood together. The cow deity's extreme yin and yang energy from the pig and chicken created harmony, killing pathogens, bacteria, and parasites in the liquid. The mixed blood has been diluted with contaminated water from the Florida Canyon River and undergoes a fermentation and mutation process.\nUnfortunately, every good wine takes time to brew. This wine is only less than a day old. Thus, it cannot have any effect on the consumer.\nCannot be used in alchemy.\n.\nLeo let out a sigh of relief as the wine seemed harmless to cultivators and commoners. As long as the pathogens, viruses, and bacteria in the blood are killed, everybody shouldn't be infected with AIDS, EBOLA, or COVID-19 this way.\nStill, Leo wasn't satisfied with just one result. He activated a time and space domain on the remaining wine bottle, accelerating the time of the wine by 100 years.\nThis was one of many applications of the space and time domain. The user could rewind, slow, accelerate, or stop the time flow within the domain. He could also teleport anywhere within the range as the power distorted space and dimension.\nThe red wine in the bottle turned black. Leo shook the bottle a little to check the quality.\n\"Huh?\"\nThere was a little worm in the liquid. It looked like a hatchling mosquito in a water bowl.\n\"DISGUSTING!\"\nLeo smacked his lips in disgust. He believed that the wine had gone bad. Still, he tossed the entire bottle of content into an alchemy cauldron to research it.\nThe result was shocking.\n.\n100-Year-Old Yin-Yang Blood Wine of Time and Space\nThis wine has been brewed by Florida Man. It contains a tinge of his time and space dao and a mutated mosquito from the Florida Canyon River. Anyone who consumes this wine and eats the mosquito, their bone marrow and meridians will transform and evolve.\nIn addition, it has a strong flavor. It is the best liquor to go with a cow monster steak.\nEffects:\n- Evolve the consumer's bone marrows and meridians.\n- Increase the consumer's lifespan by 10 years.\n- Increase the consumer's yin and yang Qi by 1,000 years' worth of cultivation.\n- May intoxicate the consumer with low alcohol tolerance.\nCannot be used in alchemy.\n.\nLeo salivated. Unlike earlier, he wanted to drink the wine. However, he had already sacrificed the entire content for this research.\nFor the sake of a good drink, Leo rushed back to the restaurant's warehouse in the kitchen. He found the chef mannequin and ordered him.\n\"Gather all wines in your store. Go tell the other store's cooks to bring all their wines to the B3 floor. Remember this, whenever you brew fresh wine like this again, store them on the B3 floor. I'll check that place daily and accelerate the wine age for you lots, okay?\"\nThe mannequin repeatedly nodded. The hive-mind automaton twitched as he shared the information with his thoughts. A minute later, every mannequin from the restaurants marched out of their stores with hundreds of wine boxes in tow.\nTheir march attracted the attention of the visitors on the first floor. They wondered if Leo was doing something weird again. However, most of them ignored him and moved on to the fourth floor.\n30 minutes later, the same mannequins marched back to their shops and added the aged wine to their warehouses. They also listed the new liquor as their local specialty, which was shared in all stores. Some of them were also transferred to the supermarket to seduce drinkers.\nThe brief preparation of the restaurants was completed. A new trend in the Florida Domain slowly changed.\n.\nWhile Leo was busy with the restaurant's matters, the new bookstore became a new trend in the shopping mall. Young men and women gathered to purchase cultivation books and theory books.\nCommoners also flocked to the store. As they had a limited lifespan, they came up with a brilliant idea – They formed a group of hundred people who desired the same book to share. When they got the book, they made copies for everybody while their leader kept the original.\nSeveral cultivators also used the same method to get expensive cultivation manuals. Some youngsters with brilliant minds shocked others by investing in a cheap book and copying them to sell the copy version for essence stones.\nLeo didn't mind the cultivator world's pirate bay. After all, the copy versions might skip some details. Some of the photos and images also couldn't be mimicked by any artists here. Thus, martial arts practitioners still required a clear photo to understand the manuals. Even better, the pirates ended up promoting his bookstore and the overall strength of everybody in this world.\nIn addition, the restaurants obtained a new source of food from Leo and the agriculture realm. With more beef, chicken, and pork in stock, the cook mannequins came up with several modern dishes and featured in their stores.\nThe pleasant scent of the food drew commoners and cultivators over, though some were reluctant due to the expensive price tags. The poor only observed and salivated in front of the restaurants while rich cultivators, such as Tang Tian, swagged into one of the stores and ordered the best meal.\nTang Tian entered a steak house. He made an order to the waiter mannequin.\n\"Give me the most expensive one! Oh, I want the best wine, too!\"\nThe local workers didn't disappoint Tang Tian. 15 minutes later, he came back with plates of a medium-rare steak and side dishes. He also poured Tang Tian the new wine.\nTang Tian got used to the modern wine glass of these stores. He loved drinking alcohol from wine glasses as it tasted better than drinking from a porcelain cup.\nBut when the waiter poured black wine which contained a wiggling mosquito hatchling into the cup, Tang Tian was enraged.\n\"Hey! What happened to your wine?! Are you trying to raise some insects here? I don't drink this crap. Get a new bottle!\"\nThe mannequin didn't flinch. He wrote a note and showed it to Tang Tian.\n[The hatchling in the wine is the main attraction of the wine. You won't be disappointed if you eat it. Please be warned. The mosquito is a mutated insect from the Florida Canyon River. It carries a fragment of Lord Florida Man's aura.]\n\"WHAT?!\"\nTang Tian almost dropped his wine glass. He rubbed his eyes and stared at the swimming insect again.\nEating a mosquito was a repulsive thing to do even for a local cultivator. Tang Tian had goosebumps by thinking about chewing the live worm.\n\"DAMMIT!\" Tang Tian smacked his lips and glared at the waiter. \"If you lie, I'll turn you into firewood!\"\nThe mannequin nodded with confidence. He waited for Tang Tian to drink it by radiating his red eyes.\nTang Tian held his breath and gulped the wine content in the glass in one gulp. The worm entered his stomach and touched the digestive fluid. Then, the creature emitted intense yin and yang Qi and struggled to survive.\nInstantly, Tang Tian's eyes snapped open and reddened. Although he missed the savory of the blood wine, he didn't miss the extreme pressure that came from the living worm.\nThe dying worm released every bit of yin-yang Qi it had before it died. Tang Tian's digestive fluid dissolved the mutated worm and transferred the hidden essence of energy to his dantian.\nAs if a dam transferred half of the water to a farmer's reservoir, Tang Tian's dantian almost burst. He gasped for air while he released the excess energy out of his body to stay alive.\n\"AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!\"\nThe scream of Tang Tian erupted and interrupted the tranquil silence in the shopping mall. Everybody nearby sprinted toward the restaurant to see the commotion.\nTang Tian collapsed and squirmed on the ground. He hyperventilated and sweated profusely as if he had just survived an ordeal.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nSeveral blocked meridians that Tang Tian had given up working on suddenly opened by themselves. Gushes of Qi flowed through the channels while his bone marrows produced thicker and healthier blood cells.\nTang Tian crawled on the ground and salivated like a rabid dog. He gradually rose up on two feet, dragging his exhausted body back to his seat. He was in a daze for 10 minutes.\nWhen Tang Tian regained his senses, he stared at the remaining wine in the bottle.\nThere were three more mosquito worms in there.\nTang Tian widened his eyes and stared at the waiter in disbelief. \"Waiter, will I die if I keep drinking this?!\"\nThe waiter wrote him a response.\n[The wine goes along well with the steak. Try drinking it together while you eat the steak.]\n\"…\"\nTang Tian shifted his attention to the steak. Although 10 minutes had passed, it was still warm.\n\"Alright. Fine. I'll try it.\"\nTang Tian grabbed chopsticks and a fork. As he had never eaten a proper steak, he didn't know how to eat it.\nAfter struggling for a while, Tang Tian learned how to use a fork and a knife. He cut the steak into a small piece and ate it, using chopsticks.\nTang Tian paused. His mind wandered through space, and he saw countless big bangs and supernova explosions.\nIt was delicious! The taste was otherworldly to the point that Tang Tian questioned why he had been eating only grain pills all these years when such good food existed.\nMinutes later, Tang Tian stopped having a foodgasm. He slowly cut a piece of steak and ate it again.\nThe same reaction occurred. Tang Tian's mind entered a space program.\nThe spectators who had come to see a commotion found Tang Tian funny. They laughed and pointed at his face as the elder acted like an autistic commoner.\nOne of the crowd was curious why the current patriarch of the Tang Clan behaved that way. He ordered the waiter to get the same steak and wine.\n15 minutes later, the curious cultivator got the same set of food and wine. He also questioned the waiter about the mosquito worm in the wine bottle and got the same answer. And when he ate the steak, he had the same reaction as Tang Tian's.\nThe Florida Domain's mad cow disease made its first appearance.\nMeanwhile, Dongfang Mei and Hua Jiashan came to see the commotion while they were still carrying books from the bookstore. They had planned to come here to read books while waiting for the food.\nSeeing their mentor and senior in such as state, the husband and wife were puzzled.\n\"Is he infected by Wu Buyi?\" Hua Jiashan laughed.\nDongfang Mei shook her head. \"Master Tang has always been stupid when nobody is around. He must be acting to get our attention or some sort. He's such as spoiled master.\"\n\"Let's go tease him.\"\n\"Yeah. That stupid master. He deserves some bullying.\"\nThe couple sneaked behind Tang Tian and planned to steal the latter's food. But as the two got closer, Tang Tian suddenly turned around and hugged his wine bottle and the plate of steak.\n\"THIS IS MINE! GET LOST, YOU DUMB DISCIPLES!!\"\nWith a shout, Hua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were sent flying outside the restaurant. The aura of Tang Tian belonged to a heaven celestial cultivator, aka the fourth stage immortal.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei safely landed on the plaza in front of the four-armed guardian statue. They got on their feet and gazed at Tang Tian in astonishment.\n\"HUH?!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei had already entered the time chamber once, but they only reached the first stage immortal. They thought they managed to catch up to their mentor, but they were wrong.\n\"What have he been eating?\" Hua Jiashan inquired.\nDongfang Mei glanced at the restaurant. She pointed at it. \"Probably something he's protecting. Let's try that.\"\n\"…Okay. We need a place to rest and read our books anyway.\"\nThe duo entered the restaurant as customers. Tang Tian glared and barked at them, uncaring about his reputation and image.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei laughed at Tang Tian again. But 15 minutes later, the husband and wife could no longer bully their mentor – They fell into the same state. They also weren't aware that their cultivation base sharply rose.",

Investigation Found He Busted 90 Times Last Month Causing His Kidneys to Fail.\nChapter 257 – Florida Man Cosplaying as Game of Thrones's Character Blocked the Road and Kept Shouting \"Winter is Coming\". Investigation Found He Busted 90 Times Last Month Causing His Kidneys to Fail.\nThe next day, Filip and his friends finally came out from the hell hole where Hua Taixu was the demon king.\nTheir cultivation base broke through the bottleneck and reached the deity realm. Everybody learned how they could build stars in their dantian, and they already made several. Their sword mastery also improved. Although they were unhappy with the training regime, they were proud of themselves.\n\"Thank you very much, senior Hua!\" Filip bowed to Hua Taixu before he left.\n\"Come again. You. Stronger!\"\n\"…Yes.\"\nFilip dragged his sorry shape to the tavern of heroes to rest. Along the way, they met another member of the ship.\n\"Huh?\"\nSomething was wrong there. As only five of them could enter this place, another crewmate other than Andria shouldn't be able to enter.\nFilip asked the crewmate, \"Lieutenant! What are you doing here? Where is Major Andromeda?\"\nThe lieutenant saluted and replied, \"Major Andromeda Andria has returned to the ship and commanded me to purchase some books, sir!\"\n\"…Books? Why do you want those ancient outdated information sources?\"\n\"Sir, none of the books in the bookstore is nonsense. Every book is either a precious cultivation manual or a way of dao. It's highly detailed to the point that Major Andria has already awakened two new dao avatars.\"\nFilip squinted his brows. Because of his curiosity, he forgot about the mental and physical exhaustion, \"Where is that bookstore?\"\n\"This way, sir.\"\nThe soldier guided Filip to the bookstore. When they arrived, they found a long queue of cultivators and commoners who had been waiting to enter the store.\nSeeing the line and how busy the store was, Filip and the crew got interested.\n\"Is the bookstore that good?\" Filip inquired.\n\"Yes, sir. Any book of the store is a precious manual.\"\n\"But am I seeing things correctly? The price tag is… 100 years of lifespan!?\"\n\"It's worth the investment, sir. Oh, did you know that you can get your lifespan back if you eat food on the first floor?\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"The cafeterias and the restaurants there are running a promotion, sir. Their blood wine and beef steak are superb! If you manage to finish the meal, you will get about 50-100 years of lifespan back at the price of 200 essence stones!\"\n\"…\"\nFilip disagreed with the soldier because 200 essence stones were a lot for their living standard. As they had been relying on essence stones and soul stones to generate energy and Qi for them to cultivate or navigate their ship, the resources were invaluable. Spending them on food for personal interest was wasteful.\nStill, Filip couldn't stop his men from spending their hard-earned money. He too also possessed a stash of essence stones for his retirement. As his subordinate bought books from the store, he might as well get one so that the soldier would not feel left out. He went to the back of the queue and waited for his turn to enter the store.\nThe store was full of customers. The interior alone was large enough to accommodate at least 1,000 customers at once. However, only two bookstore clerks were present. Thus, they only allowed 100 customers to access the store at a time.\n30 minutes later, it was Filip's turn to enter. He strode with a long stride and beelined toward a cultivation manual section.\nThe cultivation manual section had four minor categories; Beginner, Intermediate, Advance, and Expert.\nThe beginner section featured simplified cultivation manuals, which made it easy for commoners and young cultivators to grasp the basics. The intermediate section shelves contained full cultivation methods with Leo's annotations. Similar to the beginner ones, Leo's extra comments in the books allowed readers to comprehend the techniques more easily.\nThe advance and expert categories, however, were dedicated to hardcore cultivators. Leo didn't comment on anything while the cultivation methods were complicated and complex for regular cultivators to understand. Practitioners were expected to spend at least years to fully master the methods.\nThe only difference between the advance section and the expert section was the quality of the cultivation method. A commoner could pick up an advanced book and cultivate all the way to the deity realm. On the other hand, no beginner could touch the expert section due to the pre-requirement of a deity realm; a practitioner needed a basic understanding of dantian stars, which only deities, sages, or stronger cultivators had.\nAs a deity, Filip checked the expert's zone first. He randomly picked the thickest book and scanned the table of contents.\nAt first, Filip snorted at the long list of topics. But as he kept on reading the table of contents, he realized the true value of the book in his hands.\nThe book was a precious cultivation method of an entity, whose cultivation base was two major realms higher than the deity realm. By practicing this method, Filip could potentially reach the entity realm and join the overlord ranks!\nIn astonishment and shock, Filip flipped the book to check the price tag.\n100 YOL\nAs the lieutenant had said, it only cost 100 years of lifespan!\nSuch an investment was worth it!\nFilip drooled and closed the book. He was about to bring it to the checkout cashier. As he took a step forward, the corner of his eyes saw a portrait of a black-winged angel on a book cover of the expert section's shelves.\n\"!?!\"\nFilip's feet stopped. He turned around and grabbed the book with a thick book cover.\n\"Overlord Mao Miaomiao!?\"\nFilip recognized the face of the man on the cover. The devil was an infamous villain that every textbook described as the traitor who sold mankind to the divine elves and destroyed Earth's ecosystem.\nHe hated this traitor with a passion even though he wasn't there when the calamity struck. Driven by his hatred, Filip picked the book and skimmed through it to mock the content.\nOne minute later…\nFive minutes later…\nTen minutes later…\nAn hour later…\nThree hours later, Filip stood there reading the book in earnest. He couldn't put it down as the book contained both the cultivation method and the dao of soul transfer, which enabled souls to change bodies.\nThe dao was the loophole in the karma river's system. As long as the body target was not naturally born, anybody could transfer their soul and steal the body. However, they would lose all cultivation base and progress from the discarded body.\nFilip thought of a forbidden project in the past. In the textbooks that he had read, there were incidents about scientists experimenting with human creation. Most of them ended up in failure. Only Overlord Mao Miaomiao and Doctor Void Singe succeeded.\nIn Mao Miaomiao's case, he transferred his soul to one of the test subjects and became the first man who gain immortality through soul transfer. As for Doctor Void Singe, he completed the research 20,000 years after the first incident and published the information to the government.\nUnfortunately, Overlord Xiaomao detected their movements and warned them not to improve their techniques due to the looming threat of the divine elves. The government officials cowered in fear and shut down the projects. All related documents were burnt and destroyed. Only the history books recorded the implications and events that led to the project's termination.\nFilip acquiring the lost research was a double-edged sword. He was at a loss for what he should do.\n'Publish it? Destroy it? Keep it to myself? What should I do?!'\nFilip scanned the bookshelves and found multiple books on the same cover. He gulped and made an excuse in his mind.\n'Yeah, there are too many books. None of them should notice that I have one right now. If anything happens, it's the bookstore's fault for releasing the techniques to the public!'\nFilip made up his mind. He grabbed the book and walked to the checkout counter. He put two books down.\nThe cashier mindlessly scanned the barcodes with the scanner. She then pointed at the number on the cashier machine.\n200 YOL\nFilip paid the price in full. He put the books in his spatial ring and was about to head out. While he was leaving, a group of beautiful elves and molgs passed by. None of them even paid him a glance as they were busy.\nThe group of women cut the lines and entered the bookstore. However, nobody bothered to warn them as if they knew who they were.\nFilip turned around and gazed at the women. He wondered who they were.\nBut as he looked at the blond elf's face, his face lost all color. The face of the elf looked similar to a common photo that every human was taught to be wary of – The Queen of Divine Elf, Eleanor.\nRunning for his life, Filip vanished and reappeared on the first floor. He kicked the ground and tried to leave the store. He didn't notice the four-armed statue behind him.\nQiang Qiang, aka the captive mutant, had lost all her memory. She served Leo and Meowmeow as a guardian statue of the shopping mall, and her job was to maintain order.\nWhen Qiang Qiang noticed a strong guest running away from the shopping mall, she pursued him. Using her four arms, she embraced him and pulled him back to the center fountain.\nFilip struggled to break free. Unfortunately, Qiang Qiang's current cultivation base was the same as Meowmeow – The Entity Realm.\nA newborn deity was not an opponent of an entity. Filip got stuck in her arms and wailed in fear.\n\"Please spare me!\"\nQiang Qiang didn't answer. She left him there until someone found him.\n.\nLeo entered the shopping mall 6 hours later. He found Filip getting a bear hug from the giant four-armed statue. He laughed.\n\"I didn't know that my dearest guest has a stone fetish. Would you like me to make you some sexy stone golems to take back home?\"\nFilip retorted, \"INSTEAD OF TOYING WITH ME, CAN YOU FREE ME HERE?!\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen, Ivy, and Beatrice were the ones who had visited the bookstore and met Filip. As none of them knew the guy, they ignored him like the others.\nEsen rushed to a romance novel section and picked several books. Ivy took theory books and science manuals while Beatrice picked a sword technique scroll. Everybody had their own preference. However, Esen felt like their lives were too smooth lately.\nShe thought about her old playmates. She wondered where Cat and Yao Qiqi had gone as the duo rarely appeared in the domain.\nEsen thought to herself.\n'I understand that Cat sometimes hunts for food herself. But I don't understand Yao Qiqi. What has she been doing lately? I don't see her around anywhere.'\n.\n.\nThe girl in question was indeed in hiding. Yao Qiqi had recently received three cut golden retriever puppies, and she had brought them to the Magpie City.\nThe three werewolf puppies followed Yao Qiqi around like she was their mother. On the other hand, Yao Qiqi's aura and demeanor resembled adults.\nYao Qiqi visited a black market. She exchanged some essence stones for spirit stones. Then, she fed the puppies with the lowest-grade stones.\nThe puppies ate everything as if they were dog food. They licked their lips and begged Yao Qiqi to give them more.\nYao Qiqi ignored their pleas as she understood what they actually thought. She yelled at them.\n\"If you think you can fool me with those eyes, you're wrong! Behave yourself, doggies!\"\n\"Woof!\"\nAfter feeding the dogs, Yao Qiqi marched home with the dogs following her as usual. Along the way, a merchant group offered her and her dogs a ride, which she accepted.\nWhile sitting in a carriage, Yao Qiqi heard a rumor.\n\"Did you know? The winter this year comes very early. I heard the Cauliflower is already covered in snow!\"\n\"Meh, you're crazy. I never snowed in Cauliflower City. Check your rumor's source!\"\n\"But I'm telling you! The winter is coming! Can't you sense the cold wind from the north?!\"\nYao Qiqi was interested in the topic since the weather affected the upcoming wedding ceremony between Esen and Leo. She wondered if they would continue to proceed with the ceremony.\n'I should finish preparing a gift for Lord Florida Man soon. Should I bring my pets to explore the world first?'",

Cops Arrested the Tourist Later for Attempting to Groom Minor.\nChapter 258 – Local Florida Men Saved Tourist Man from Ferocious Cannibal Disguising as Middle-Schooler. Cops Arrested the Tourist Later for Attempting to Groom Minor.\nAgriculture Realm\nWorker mannequins from various warehouses and free workers created by Leo's gacha entered and left the realm, transporting goods to their respective headquarters. Everybody walked in a single line like working ants while enduring the intense gravity of this planet.\nIt had been days since this realm's creation. Sierra, the current governor of this land, spent all day plowing and expanding more farmland. She had been working nonstop.\nSierra might be a clone of a real Tauron Princess. However, she also shared a hive-mind with other mannequins of Leo's store. She quickly learned the general situation of the restaurants and understood what the facilities were in urgent need.\nEven though the system farms generated countless giant wheat, it would only sit in a granary or a spatial ring due to the low consumption rate. In addition, wheat wasn't enough. They needed a more variety of crops, vegetables, fruits, salt, sugar, and other spices.\nWhile plowing an empty grassland, Sierra took off her dress and squeezed some of her milk on the ground. She injected her Qi into the liquid in the soil and activated her dao.\nSugar cane sprouts budded and emerged from the ground. Although its growth rate was far inferior to the system's crops, it gradually extended.\n\"…\"\nSierra frowned and gazed at her rough and blistered palms. She hated the touch of her hands.\n\"I wish Lord could milk me…\"\nThe complaints didn't enter Leo's ears but the working mannequins' non-existing ears. The female mannequins flinched while the male mannequins almost collapsed to the ground. Some of them gave Sierra a weird look.\nFortunately, the mannequins possess no sexual desire. They simply thought of Sierra as a weirdo among the consciousnesses in the hive mind.\nNoticing the gazes from the crowd, Sierra snorted. \"What? You've got a problem?\"\nEverybody looked away and resumed working. A few male mannequins secretly looked at their wooden hands and simulated a squeezing motion. Because of the lewd movements, they got bonked by other female mannequins.\nThe peaceful days in the realm continued until changes occurred outside.\n.\n.\n\"Have you heard about the new steaks?\"\n\"Yeah. You have to be stupid to not pay attention to those restaurants!\"\n\"Yup. The steaks are not only delicious, but it's also good for cultivation!\"\n\"Don't forget. It's impurity-free! You know my fatty niece, right? She has no talent in cultivation at all, but her father spent a fortune to buy her the steak. Do you know what happened? She has become a beauty, and she's now a soul formation cultivator!\"\n\"Only soul formation cultivator? Man, your niece is a wastrel! I also ate one. Look at my cultivation base! It was Golden Core before. But now, I'm a quasi-immortal! Situ Nantian? Yan Xiang? I'm a super expert now!\"\n\"You arrogant little shit! Super expert? Have you seen the people of Tang Clan and the Life Sword Sect? More immortals are being born every day in those restaurants!\"\nAfter Leo had added monster cow beef to the food ingredient, the restaurants became another main attraction of Leo's shopping mall. Commoners, newbie cultivators, and seasoned veterans gathered in front of the diners, admiring the menus. However, not everybody could afford the precious meat.\nEvery restaurant required their customers to pay with either essence stones or lifespan. Only rich merchants and established cultivators could enjoy the privilege.\nStill, there were multiple ways to acquire essence stones. Working for Leo was one of the options. As a result, commoners who had just emerged as newbie cultivators flocked to Leo's shopping mall to apply for a job.\nUnfortunately, Leo wasn't always around. His daily routine kept changing according to the shopping mall's needs. At the moment, he usually stayed in the library, visited the cow level, or helped the mannequins transporting goods from the agriculture realm.\nStill, the prospective employees were patient. They gathered on the shopping mall's third floor, hoping to get his attention. The number of job seekers started increasing every hour. From 100 to 1,000, from 1,000 to 5,000, the mall got crowded with cultivators and commoners.\nThe crowd indeed got the attention of the Life Sword Sect's elders and the Tang Clan's members.\n.\n.\n.\nSixth Element Sect's Alchemy Workshop, East of Florida Domain\nThe workshop was a copy of Leo's workshops when they were outside his shopping mall. Tang Xuan and Tang Tian were the ones who built it so that the sect's disciples could have a place to study and research.\nUnfortunately, most disciples chose to visit the workshops in the shopping mall to learn from the mannequins. Only a few elders stayed behind to concoct their pills.\nBao Xun was one of the old-school elders. He was 7 feet tall, 250 pounds in weight, and slightly muscular. His iconic smooth bald head and hairless face earned him the nickname of Second Sun, which was his current Daoist name. In addition, his green iris and black sclera always intimidated his disciples and peers.\n\"I heard Sect Master Tang and his ancestor are entering seclusion. Is that true?\" Bao Xun inquired his colleagues.\n\"Yes. I heard they have purchased pills and books from the store. They have left a message that they won't come out anytime soon.\"\nAs Tang Xuan and Tang Tian had purchased a lot of goodies from Leo's store, both elders stopped idling around. They entered seclusion to cultivate and stabilize what they had gained from Leo's food, pills, and books.\nWithout the two pillars of the Tang Clan and the Sixth Element Sect, elders of the sect temporarily took control of their alchemists while the Tang Clan operated normally.\nBoth the Sixth Element Sect and the Tang Clan functioned as one whenever Tang Tian was around. However, when Tang Tian was busy, the task of management fell into the hands of Bao Xun.\nBao Xun specialized in poison pills and all sorts of poisonous substances. He also worked as a sleeping agent for Yan Xiang, and he was in charge of assassinating every promising youngster who refused to work for the emperor.\nAfter Yan Xiang and his family had fallen, Bao Xun became independent. But as a soul transformation cultivator, he realized that he couldn't survive in this world without a backer.\nLeo's emergence gave Bao Xun a new hope. He wished to follow Leo and eat some scraps that he might leave behind. However, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian monopolized most of the goodies, which annoyed Bao Xun.\nWith both elders out of the picture for some time, Bao Xun decided to come out of their shadows to get closer to Leo. However, there was a problem.\nLeo never stayed in one place for long. Whenever he did, countless people flocked after him to get his attention. This troubled Bao Xun.\n\"I think it's about time for us to visit Lord Florida Man. What do you say?\" Asked Bao Xun.\nThe other elders shook their heads. Everybody disagreed.\n\"Lord Florida Man is someone out of our league. We should respect our differences in status and keep a respectable distance. Only when he summons us, we shall seek his audience.\"\nBao Xun was annoyed, \"But if we stay here, we will never get to enjoy what Lord Florida Man has made for us. He only delegated us a task to protect the commoners, but he never shows up to guide us!\"\n\"He has already helped us greatly. Everybody receives 30 essence stones every month for what we're doing. Don't you think it's a bit greedy to ask for more for what we've been doing? We pretty much have been freeloading him this entire time.\"\n\"Not at all! We are cultivators. We follow stronger ones in the hopes of getting recognition. We're not here to just sit here and beg for 30 essence stones a month. We need to strive to get Lord Florida Man's attention like what Elder Tang Tian and Ancestor Tang Xuan did!\"\n\"And what are you going to do? Be shameless and go see him while he is busy?\"\nBao Xun snorted. He was tired of the lazy elders. \"Shyness hinders one's growth. We need to be shameless to get something in return!\"\n\"…As you wish. I wish you luck.\"\nThe elders ended the conversation and continued concocting pills as usual.\nBao Xun had enough. He stomped out of the workshop. Making his way to the shopping mall, he flew toward the center of Florida Domain.\nCoincidentally, someone had just returned from a seclusion. A mysterious dark elf teenager donning in vine dress walked on the road barefeet. Her outward appearance and height resembled a middle-schooler, but she exuded the aura of an earth-celestial immortal.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow…\" (I'm hungry. I hate walking like a human. I wish I still had roots and vines.)\nCat had completed her humanoid transformation. As a newbie, she didn't know how to fly or use a light-feet technique.\nBao Xun noticed the aura of an immortal. He stopped flying. After landing in front of Cat, he cupped his fist to pay respect. The greedy elder didn't waste time trying to gain a connection with one of Leo's people.\n\"Greetings, fairy. I'm Bao Xun of the Sixth Element Sect. I think this is the first time we've met. Would you mind telling me which affiliate are you from?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nCat turned her attention to the stranger. As she didn't know how to react, she depended on her muscle memory.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Uncle, do you have food? I'm hungry.)\n\"What?\"\nBao Xun had seen Cat in her monster form several times in the past, but he never interacted with her. Thus, he was taken aback by her nom-nom language.\n\"No Nom-Nom?\" (No food?)\n\"Umm, what's nom-nom?\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\" (Nom-Nom is delicious food! Do you have one?)\n\"…I don't understand what you're saying.\"\nBao Xun and Cat awkwardly looked at each other. A few seconds later, Cat's stomach growled.\nThe growl soon developed into a roar. It was so loud that everybody nearby turned around to look at them. Then, the disciples of the sixth element sect noticed their elders.\n\"Elder Bao? What is he doing over there with that… girl?\"\nAnother disciple frowned as he noticed the long ears of Cat. \"Is that girl one of Lord Florida Man's bodyguards? They have long ears like her.\"\n\"But their skin color is lighter.\"\n\"You racist bastard! What's wrong with skin color?! Haven't you seen the people from the south? They're beautifully tanned!\"\n\"SORRY!\"\nTheir conversation caused a commotion. Everybody started paying attention to the strange girl.\nMeanwhile, Cat couldn't take it anymore. Her eyes span.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Uncle, you smell like one of those poisonous mushrooms. Can I eat you?)\n\"Err…what?\"\nCat opened her mouth wide and salivated. But before she could expand her head size and gobble Bao Xun whole, a working mannequin carrying a large chunk of mad cow's belly meat turned into Tom Brady; He threw the meat which accurately entered her mouth.\n\"MUFFU!!\"\nCat was surprised at first. But when she tasted the sweetness of the belly fat, she started chewing in glee.\nThe working mannequin patted his hands and gave Bao Xun a thumbs up. Then, he left without elaborating like a chad.\n\"???\"\nBao Xun was confused. He hadn't realized yet that he had just escaped the death penalty for not paying the nom-nom tax.\nStill, some of the Life Sword Sect disciples who had been observing them realized who Cat was. He muttered.\n\"That language… Isn't she 'CAT'?!\"\nAs soon as the name was mentioned, other local cultivators started recognizing her.\n\"Cat? T-T-THAT CAT?! THE MONSTER PLANT?!\"\n\"Wait a minute! High-ranking monsters can transform into a human! Don't tell me…\"\n\"IT'S CAT, YOU FOOL! DON'T FORGET TO PAY THE NOM-NOM TAX, OR SHE'LL EAT YOU!!\"\n\"SHIT!\"\nSeveral spectating cultivators rumbled through their spatial rings and fetched several packages of food. They rushed toward Cat and put the food down in front of her as a tribute while they knelt.\nCat smiled at the kind cultivators. She cheerfully patted their heads.\n\"Nom-Nom! NICE!\"\n\"T-Thank you, young fairy.\"\nThe cultivators hurried away after receiving her blessing. They touched the hair that she had touched, which emitted a chilling air.\nHer hand was full of extreme virgin yin energy. It threatened to freeze the cultivators. Fortunately, it didn't directly turn them into monsters like Leo's touch.\nAgain, Bao Xun looked around in confusion.\n\"What the hell is going on around here?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 259 Florida Man Sued Mother-in-Law for Snorting Coke Without Inviting Him.\nChapter 259 – Florida Man Sued Mother-in-Law for Snorting Coke Without Inviting Him.\nShopping Mall, Burger Kung Restaurant.\n\"Last Rizzmas, I gave you my Gyatt. But the very next day, Biboo taxes it away…\"\nWu Buyi hummed while he sang a weird song composed by a vtuber. He sat at the Burgur Kung Restaurant's table after ordering a double cheeseburger and a mad cow steak burger for 200 essence stones.\nThe food price seemed expensive to many. But in Wu Buyi's eyes, they were dirt cheap.\nHe was also different from before. Instead of indulging in the smartphone and the internet, Wu Buyi put an alchemy manual, which he had purchased from the infamous bookstore. Flipping a few first pages, he read the table of contents to find the topic he was interested in.\n\"There it is! Quick Alchemy!\"\nWu Buyi hummed and flipped more pages. He started reading in earnest while the waiter mannequin brought the ordered burgers to his table.\n30 minutes passed by. Wu Buyi was so absorbed in reading the books that he forgot about his surroundings.\nPOOF\nSuddenly, a person in a suit sat at the same table as him.\nWu Buyi glanced up, annoyed by the rude guy. \"Hey, man. The table is taken.\"\nTiger Swordsman rested his elbows on the table and leaned forward. \"I see that you bought the lord's book. What book are you reading?\"\nSeeing Tiger Swordsman's face, Wu Buyi snorted in disgust.\n\"Just alchemy book.\"\n\"Every book is a secret manual. It's not JUST a book.\"\n\"I know. That's why I'm reading it.\"\n\"Cool. Hey, have you entered the time chamber yet? Are you planning to enter it anytime soon?\"\n\"What time chamber… Oh, that.\"\nWu Buyi thought of Hua Taixu and his dojo, aka the time chamber. He had already entered it once, and he didn't want to take that Spartan training course ever again.\n\"I'm an alchemist. I'm not into sword fights.\"\n\"Aren't you vexed at all, buddy?\"\n\"Vexxed from what?\"\n\"The helplessness and the despair when the immortals and gods invaded us the last time.\"\n\"…\"\nUpon being reminded of the recent invasion, Wu Buyi's expression changed. As Tiger Swordsman had said; being useless during a critical time was frustrating. During the invasion, everybody from the Life Sword Sect and the others could do nothing but hide in the underground warehouse.\nThe shameful experience awoke Wu Buyi's pessimistic thoughts. He snorted in disgust.\n\"I'm planning to dedicate my life to alchemy. You and the swordsman freaks can keep on training and go fight in my stead.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" Tiger Swordsman didn't give up convincing Wu Buyi, \"The old once said, shedding sweat during training is a thousand times better than shedding your blood because you're unprepared. One day, you will be forced to get into combat, and you might regret it.\"\nWu Buyi closed the book and gave Tiger Swordsman a meaningful look.\n\"Look, Tiger. I know what I'm doing. From the very start, my cultivation base exists to support my career as an alchemist. I never seriously trained in any combat arts until I met Lord Florida Man. But that invasion taught me a lesson. You know what I learned from that?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Everybody has a role.\" Wu Buyi stood up and folded his arms behind his back. Then, he started walking around the table. \"Not everybody is geared toward combats. Indeed, cultivators usually can reinforce one's foundation or grow stronger by fighting someone strong. However, that doesn't mean every cultivator should fight all the time.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\nWu Buyi grinned. He recalled the knowledge that he had learned from the internet and taught Tiger Swordsman using his own words.\n\"Look, if we compare our raw martial arts skills without accounting for our difference in cultivation base, who do you think would win if we were to fight? You or me?\"\n\"Obviously me!\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"What's your point?\"\n\"That's my point exactly! I can't fight for shit! Do you think an alchemist like me should be put on the frontline while the other non-combatants can benefit the organization as a whole?\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi deeply sighed and explained. \"I've learned something important from a lost civilization called the US Military. Although most of their soldiers are trained and anticipated to fight in combat, some of them are actually supporters who specialize in other skills, such as medics, mechanics, engineers, programmers, and many others. Hell, even psychiatrists are a thing!\"\n\"…What?\"\n\"I guess I have to explain using baby vocabularies. Anyway, where do you think your weapons come from?\"\n\"A blacksmith.\"\n\"Good. Where do you think you need to go to when you're injured in combat?\"\n\"…A cave to recuperate?\"\n\"Idiot! A hospital or an infirmary! You need to see either a doctor or an alchemist like me!\"\nWu Buyi spent hours lecturing about the supporting roles in armies. Because his voice was so loud, several bystanders stopped to listen to Wu Buyi's lecture.\nBy the time Wu Buyi realized it, a hundred cultivators already sat around his table, listening to his teachings. Everybody got enlightened.\n\"I see! Everybody has a different role!\"\n\"We don't need to treat cultivation as an exclusive martial art. Instead, we use it as a supplement for our future career or goals, I see!\"\n\"I…I have awakened a dao…\"\nSeveral people murmured in astonishment and respect. A dozen of them showed respect to Wu Buyi by kneeling and cupping their fists.\n\"Great Teacher Wu! Thank you for your teachings!\"\n\"Great Teacher Wu! We're enlightened! Thank you!\"\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi blankly stared at the people around him in confusion.\n\"What the hell are you lots doing here? Get out of my sight! This ain't a zoo! SHOO! SHOO!\"\n.\n.\nLeo watched the crowd from the 5th floor's balcony. He faintly smiled as he enjoyed watching the local cultivators getting adapted to the new technologies and lifestyle. He was proud of them.\nWhile observing the people below, Esen, Ivy, Beatrice, and Marc approached him from behind. The elfen wife stood next to him and gazed at the crowd below.\n\"Are you free today?\" Asked Esen\n\"Somewhat. Do you need anything?\"\n\"Give me some books. I don't want to spend my lifespan.\"\nLeo snickered and patted her head. He then guided her and her entourage to the bookstore and granted them free access to the library.\nThe library contained more books than the bookstore. However, only three copies of each book were kept there to save space. Despite containing fewer duplicated books, the tall bookshelves, and endless room was full of manuals and books of various sizes.\nLeo reminded them, \"You can read free books here. But bear in mind that you can't bring it out when I'm not around. If you really need one, I'll print one for you.\"\nBeatrice, Marc, and Ivy bowed in gratitude. As for Esen, she puffed her chest in elation.\n\"Good job! This is what you should do as my husband!\"\nEverybody giggled as they found Esen adorable even though her appearance and body reached adulthood.\nLeo wrapped his arm around Esen's shoulder while she leaned her head on his chest. They wished that they could enjoy this tranquil and peaceful time forever.\n.\n.\nDING\nDING\nDING\nA hundred blue system screens flashed and orbited around a naked beautiful elf within a water capsule. Her face, skin, and body features looked the same as Esen's.\nShe was Eleanor, the Matriarch or the Queen of the Divine Elf. She was also one of the few karmic sovereigns of this universe.\nWhile being inside the water capsule, Eleanor slowly opened her eyelids. She woke up from her long dream.\n\"…Found you, Esen. It was the right decision to imprison you there. I knew someone would rescue you and unlock your potential. Now, I have two spare bodies I can transfer my soul into…\"\nEleanor rose up and pushed the hatch open. Her eyes glowed in green color while her rainbow aura exuded from her body. The water in the capsule glittered in rainbow similar to the water of Florida Canyon River.\nNext to the capsule, a silver werewolf stood with his arms crossed. He was none other than Overlord Lucky, the strongest werewolf overlord of the Fenrir Werewolf.\nHe only glanced at his master and gave a short report.\n\"Princess Ellen has betrayed us and joined forces with Overlord Xiaomao. From the report, Mercenary Ohio Man, Overlord Milo, and others followed her. What should we do about them?\"\nEleanor lightly sighed. She nonchalantly put on her clothes while being watched by the werewolf.\n\"Leave them be. Don't bother attacking them right now.\"\n\"Why? Isn't Ellen your spare body?\"\n\"It doesn't matter anymore. ANOTHER spare body has more potential.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"The crown princess Esen. Also, I'm interested in the person who unlocked her potential.\"\nEleanor swiped away the system screens in front of her except one. The monitor showed the portrait of a handsome young man in his mid-20s.\nIt was the old portrait of Mao Miaomiao. However, Eleanor knew who the real owner of that body was.\n\"Who would have thought that the boy back then would have risen up from the ash? I guess the Phoenix bloodline is not for show.\"\nOverlord Lucky didn't utter a word. He closed his eyes and turned away.\n\"So, what's next?\"\nEleanor walked out of her chamber and ordered him.\n\"Bring every overlord in our army. Capture a system user by the name 'Florida Man' and the crown princess at all costs.\"\n\"And if they resist?\"\n\"Cut off their limbs and bring me their limbless torso. I can still use them.\"",

Although they were scheduled to leave in 4 days, they extended their stay for a reason.\nFilip, Andria, and three previous members already returned to his ship. A new team of five representatives replaced them and visited Leo's bookstore. Everybody also avoided the time chamber like a plague.\nAfter taking turns and purchasing enough books, Filip and his crewmate decided to leave. They retrieved the rest of the soul stones from Leo and prepared to leave.\nLeo stood on the airport runaway to send them off. Filip also extended his hand for a handshake.\n\"Thank you for everything, Sir Florida Man. We're indebted to you.\"\nLeo glanced at Filip's hand. He calmly wore rubber gloves and shook Filip's hand.\n\"Please come again. Also, if possible, please tell the other earthlings that one of them is doing well on his own.\"\n\"I will. I'm sure everybody will be proud. Oh, by the way…\"\nFilip hesitated as he still had one doubt about Leo; He still hadn't learned the origins and the meaning of 'Florida'.\n\"Sir Florida Man. Could you tell me the meaning of 'Florida'?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"It's a hometown of cultured people.\"\n\"A cultural place, I see.\"\nLeo wryly smiled while he thought of stupid deeds that the local people had done in the past, such as breaking into a property and stealing valuables but forgetting his cell phone in the victim's house. This didn't include the daily news headlines in the local newspapers.\n\"Yes. A VERY cultural place for sure.\"\n\"I'm jealous. My home country has already forgotten about culture. They only pursue wealth and military might.\"\n\"…Just pass the sunshine law bill and your country will be very cultural.\"\n\"What's that?\"\n\"Never mind.\"\nLeo and Filip continued their small talk for a few minutes before the latter bid farewell and departed with his colleagues.\nAfter Filip's group had left, Leo checked his current bank balance.\n<Current Lifespan: 21,392,639 Years…>\nLifespan was no longer an issue anymore. Leo brightly grinned as he could splurge some to purchase top-graded motorhomes or RVs for the promising workers.\nMoreover, it was about time for him to go back to the Fate Stadium. The mystic realm season was also on the schedule. Afterward, there was a marriage ceremony to worry about.\nThe schedule was packed. Leo deeply sighed as he would be busy again.\n\"Even after I've become a supreme expert, I still have to work… Anyway.\"\nLeo returned to his domain. He planned to hold a meeting to select representatives for the next mystic realm expedition.\nBut as he left the shopping mall, a man from the Sixth Element Sect had been waiting for him outside.\nBao Xun politely bowed and greeted Leo.\n\"Greetings Lord Florida Man. I'm Bao Xun from the Sixth Element Sect. I have been waiting to meet you in person.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo sized up Bao Xun. He closed his eyes and stood still for five seconds. When Leo reopened his eyes, his demeanor toward Bao Xun changed. Instead of returning Bao Xun's greetings with respect, Leo snorted.\n\"What do you want?\"\nBao Xun was taken aback. He thought that Leo was a reasonable man, not a rude or arrogant expert.\n\"T-This lowly mortal just wishes to learn from you.\"\n\"I don't accept disciples. If you wish to learn, go buy my books at the bookstore. I'm a busy man, so I'll take my leave now.\"\n\"W-Wait.\"\nLeo didn't bother waiting for Bao Xun. He kicked the ground and vanished.\nBao Xun stood there, gazing at the empty air in front of him. He was confused as to why Leo avoided him.\n\"What did I do wrong?! Is he that arrogant? This is absurd!!\"\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nLeo reappeared on the parking lot building's rooftop. He let out a long sigh.\n\"Greedy bastard.\"\nA minute earlier, Leo sank his consciousness to his dantian universe and ran a simulation combat mode against Bao Xun's shadow clones. He quickly defeated Bao Xun's clones 10,000 times and learned his characters.\nBao Xun was a master of assassination dao. His Qi was corrupted by yin Qi while his meridians and dantian were full of impurity due to the negative karma. This aroused Leo's suspicion.\nLeo peeked deeper into Bao Xun's karma and learned of the ambition he had toward the Sixth Element Sect. It seemed that Bao Xun aspired to become the sect master and replace Tang Tian.\nAlthough Leo never intended to intervene in the external affairs of other sects, he hated schemers and bootlickers the most. Bao Xun had some of their traits, which earned Leo's disgust.\n\"Instead of working hard and earning my recognition, he tries to take a shortcut to get ahead. He should have learned something from Tang Tian and others. Hah…\"\nLeo shook his head and proceeded to his bus. He needed to consult Esen regarding their marriage ceremony and the upcoming seasonal expedition.\n.\n.\nDays passed by. It had been three months since the last seasonal mystic realm gates were opened. During this period, many events occurred, causing the majority of sects and clans to disband or dissolve.\nThe destruction of the Death Sword Sect, the Fatui Cult, and the Yan Clan caused a chain reaction on the mainland. Major cities and towns became lawless as cultivators no longer feared the law imposed by the royal family. Then, the repeated alien invasions terrorized the land, decreasing the local population by two-thirds.\nOnly one major organization survived the ordeal and stood strong – The Florida Domain. Although the Tang Clan, Amazonian Sanctuary, Sixth Element Sect, Life Sword Sect, and townsmen from nearby counties integrated into the domain.\nAs they gathered in one place, a new issue soon arose.\nLeo stood on the mystic realm platform and adjusted its level and status.\n.\nMystic Realm Portal – Level 17\nEntry Limit (Person) – (10/10)\nPortal Cooldown Reduction – (2/5)\nPortal Duration – (5/5)\nNext Destination: Unknown High Plane\nStatus: Ready\nNumber of Linked Planet(s): 1\n.\nThe number of people who could join Leo's expedition rose to 10. Leo simply needed to select nine people to come with him.\nUnfortunately, many representatives from various clans expressed their desire to take part in the expedition, especially the elders from the Life Sword Sect.\nHan Hao, Han Meng, Hua Jiashan, and Tiger Swordsman were the teams that aimed to join Leo even though they had another portal at their old sect. The Tang Clan, Amazonian Sanctuary, and Sixth Sword Sect were also the same. However, they chose not to go home and begged to join Leo instead.\nThis troubled him. Since so many people wished to participate, Leo asked Ivy for assistance.\nIvy immediately suggested an internal tournament to select the domain's representatives, to which Leo agreed. An odd tournament was abruptly initiated.\nThe tournament lasted three days. During this time, Tang Xuan and Tang Tian never came out of their seclusion. Gao Yan and Jin Yong were also injured, so they didn't participate. Esen, Ivy, Marc, and Beatrice weren't interested in the expedition, so they forfeited their rights to join.\nIn the end, it became a fight between the elders of the Life Sword Sect, the Tang Clan, and the Sixth Element Sect. After the dust settled, an unlikely winner emerged.\nThe winner was the underdog, who was also the mascot of Leo's domain.\nOn the training field's arena, the final round of the tournament had been concluded. Two fighters were on the platform, but one was on his knees. The victor stood triumphant, but she seemed unfazed by the workout.\nThe referee was none other than Leo. He deeply sighed while he announced the result.\n\"WINNER BY SUBMISSION, CAT!!\"\nThe young dark elf pouted and looked around. She was dying to get some food.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Can I go eat now?)\nLeo rolled his eyes and tossed a piece of mad cow's meat into her mouth. Cat transformed her head into a chomper plant and swallowed the large chunk of one-ton shoulder meat whole.\nAfter feeding the winner, Leo gazed at the second place. He bitterly laughed at the dark horse.\n\"I thought you would have won there, Ricardo.\"\nRicardo in his human form mumbled in embarrassment.\n\"Smash…\" (I thought my cultivation base was superior to hers and this would have been an easy win. I guess I was conceit.)\n\"It's fine. It's just that Cat is kinda… unique.\"\nAlthough Cat had recently ascended and become an immortal, she inherited some of Leo's original power, which gave her an edge over the other contestants.\nLeo glanced at Cat who already left the arena and was in the middle of sprinting toward the nearest granary for more food. He noticed how her three dao avatars hurried and followed after their master.\nOne was the spirit of a dryad woman. Another one was a man-eating chomper plant. As for the last one, it was a man with Leo's face.\nOne of Cat's daos was an overpowered guy!\nLeo massaged his forehead. He had a feeling that Cat should be added to the main combat force soon.",

Aside from him, there would be nine people joining.\nCat, Ricardo, Taxi, Tiger Swordsman, Hua Jiashan, Dongfang Mei, Han Meng, and Han Hao qualified for the final 8 of the tournament, so they were eligible to join. As for the last member, it was up to Leo to decide. However, everybody knew which one he was going to pick.\nThe morning of the next day, the qualified participants gathered on the mystic realm platform. Their friends and spectators also showed up there to send them off.\nWu Buyi, Xu Nuan, Yao Qiqi, and their disciples joined the spectators, watching their colleagues and seniors from afar. They wished them the best.\nWhile watching the people, Xu Nuan asked Wu Buyi.\n\"Doesn't the Life Sword Sect have one of the mystic realm portals? Why is everybody eager to use Lord Florida Man's portal?\"\nWu Buyi shrugged, \"They're probably thinking if they are with the lord, they would be safe. Something like that.\"\n\"That makes sense. Indeed, if the lord is with them, there shouldn't be any casualty. But why does everybody avoid using the free portals? I think the Death Sword Sect and the Fatui Cult also have theirs.\"\n\"Using a random portal? Pfft. Nobody is that stupid anymore. It's true that the portals are ownerless. But if you use that, only gods know where they will send you to. It's a gamble.\"\n\"It's not a gamble if you tag along with the lord, that's why you're trying to say?\"\n\"Yes. That's correct.\"\nXu Nuan understood Wu Buyi's reasoning. She also agreed with him.\nIndeed, as previous dominant clans and sects no longer existed, nobody protected the portal platforms of the destroyed organizations anymore. Any rogue cultivator could easily seize this opportunity to use the ownerless portals and gamble for a fortuitous encounter or treasures.\nStill, this method came with a great risk. As no powerhouse or strong cultivators were there to protect them, the chance of dying in an unknown world was high. Therefore, sane cultivators chose not to use the old portals.\n\"By the way, isn't it a pity that Lord Florida Man only permits 10 people to enter? The Jianghu Alliance no longer exists. What's stopping him from sending more people?\" Xu Nuan inquired.\n\"Who knows? He might have foreseen danger, or he might have chosen this method to limit the potential casualty. The less people, the easier it is to protect them.\"\n\"Right. There's this reason. But really, do we need to take part in that realm anymore? The facilities here are more than enough for us to cultivate and progress to the deity stage with ease. What's the point of going there?\"\n\"Sightseeing, perhaps.\"\nXu Nuan and Wu Buyi let out a long sigh. One of the shopping mall's facilities alone was enough to make any major sect a top-tier sect that could dominate Jianghu or the Yan Empire. However, Leo had built so many.\nThis didn't include the unique business scheme that Leo had been using. Many young employees usually sat near the pylon tower and cultivated whenever they had free time. When they accumulated enough cash or lifespan, they always spent everything to purchase cultivation resources and technique manuals from the shopping mall.\nAlternate ways of cultivation enabled the local employees and visitors to grow stronger without participating in the mystic realm expeditions. Thus, this journey was unnecessary. It was only there for risk-takers to play.\n\"Yeah, sightseeing.\"\nBoth prayed for the participants to return unharmed.\n.\nLeo arrived at the mystic realm at 9 in the morning. Esen and her subordinates also followed after them. Everybody expected Esen to be chosen. After all, she was his spouse.\nBut then, Leo betrayed everybody's expectations. He announced the last member who would join them in this expedition.\n\"As you know, aside from me and the final 8 of the tournament, I'll pick one of the employees to go along. So… Lucky. You'll come along!\"\n\"!!!\"\nLeo pointed at the giant wolf statue. He wiggled his finger and called him over.\nThe statue transformed into a humanoid werewolf golem. His 2.5 meters tall and refined muscles made him intimidating. However, the waggling tail and smiling face gave off another impression.\n\"Woof!\"\nHe was a good boy.\nSurprised by the unlikely decision, everybody observed Esen's reaction. The latter snorted and waved her hand.\n\"I'm planning to enter the time chamber. I don't have time for some treasure-hunting trips.\"\nEverybody was relieved as the lord and his wife were in harmony. Still, some of the people had never seen the guardian statues in action yet. Their curious gaze fixated on the guardian.\nAfter the roster was full, Leo activated the portal and instructed them.\n\"For those who aren't chosen, you can enter Agriculture Realm to train your physique. The gravity there is helpful to your foundation. Also, if you want something to fight, you can try the Orlando Realm. Be warned, though. Orlando is full of 9th-stage monster beasts. Anyone under the quasi-immortal realm shouldn't enter there.\"\nHearing about the Agriculture Realm, the young spectators were excited. They checked their storage rings and began planning their luggage and food supplies.\nThe local elders were also interested in the two new gates. But when they saw the warning signboard in front of the Cow Level's gate, they got curious.\n\"What about that portal, senior?\" Asked Wu Buyi.\nLeo glared at the troublemaker, \"Only deities and sages can enter there! If any moron sneaks in and gets themselves killed, I won't bother bringing their corpses out!\"\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n\"Be warned. There are a hundred thousand deity-stage monsters in there. If you recklessly jump into the gate like Gao Yan and Jin Yong, you will end up in a worse state than them. Those guys are in a coma, and they won't be up for a few months!\"\n\"…\"\nThe people who had planned to enter one of the three gates earlier gulped. They took a mental note not to enter the cow level without Leo's permission.\nEverything was settled. Leo stopped talking and gestured for the participants to follow him.\n\"Let's go. I'll go clear the path. You guys follow me. Immediately retreat if a deity or someone of a higher cultivation base shows up, okay?\"\nThe expedition team nodded, except Cat who tilted her head in confusion. She smiled at Leo and mumbled.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Are deities edible?)\nLeo rolled his eyes and ignored the obnoxious monster daughter. He vanished into the portal while the people behind him delayed their entry, letting Leo clean the mess first.\n.\nAmong the crowd, Bao Xun smacked his lips. He wished he could peek into that world and snatch something. Because of the danger, he canceled his plans.\n'Fine. I'll stick with that O-Lan-Do Realm. I just need to ascend and become an immortal before they return. Then, I might get Lord Florida Man's attention.'\nBao Xun secretly left the platform and made his way to the time chamber.\n'Nobody should be there at the moment. This is a golden opportunity to train. I'll take whatever I need to get stronger!'\nHe rushed into the shopping mall and flew toward the fourth floor. He arrived in front of the time chamber.\nHua Taixu stood calmly in front of the time chamber, waiting for a new batch of volunteers to join his training sessions. When Hua Taixu noticed Bao Xun, he sized up the alchemist elder and snorted.\n\"Weak! Corrupted! Dumb! You. Me. Train! Me. You. REFINE!\"\nHua Taixu stomped toward Bao Xun and slapped his left cheek.\nPA!\nThe sound was crisp. The force behind the strike was also immense that Bao Xun's lower jaw was dislocated.\n\"!!?\"\nBao Xun was confused. He couldn't comprehend why he was slapped for no reason.\nIt was too late for Bao Xun to react. Hua Taixu exhibited a finger technique, pressing Bao Xun's acupuncture points and demobilizing him. Then, he slapped Bao Xun's right cheek.\nPA!\n\"?!?\"\nBao Xun was frustrated, but he couldn't move his body or utter a word. His eyes glared at Hua Taixu in anger.\nHua Taixu sneered. He bonked Bao Xun with the sheath of his sword.\n\"You. Discipline! Me. Refine. Character!\"\n\"???\"\nThe clone of the sword saint laughed and dragged the paralyzed man into the time chamber. He also didn't forget to let the cashier mannequin on the fourth floor deduct Bao Xun's lifespan for an entrance fee.\nAs Bao Xun had wished, he managed to infiltrate the time chamber. Whether it was according to his plan or not, nobody could tell.\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nLeo crossed the gate and emerged on the other side. When he looked up, he frowned.\nThe gate directly brought him to the middle of a forest city. A dozen oak trees around him were at least 50 meters in diameter, and their height exceeded 200 meters. However, wooden walkways and tree houses on the branches were so complex that they weaved like multiple layers of spider webs.\nIn addition, Leo sensed a hundred life signatures of immortals. He briefly saw a group of five children with green hair running across a wooden bridge above him.\n'Is this really a mystic realm? Or rather, did my stupid building directly send me to an alien planet?'\nLeo doubted this planet was a simple deserted planet full of monsters.\nWhile Leo looked around, an arrow flew toward his face. By reflex, Leo caught it with his fingers.\nGlancing at the arrow, Leo noticed a dripping purple arrowhead. It also smelled like acid.\n\"Poison arrow as a greeting? How civilized.\"\nLeo pulled out the arrowhead and tossed it in his mouth. He chewed it and crushed the purple metal like candies.\nCRUNCH\nCRUNCH\nHis teeth easily broke the arrowhead while his saliva melted its fragments into liquid. He then swallowed everything.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by one year…>\nAlthough Leo was rich, he never forgot his old power – Everything in the universe was edible, and anything he ate always was converted into his lifespan.\nWhile biting and chewing the wooden arrow shaft like a panda chewing a bamboo tree, Leo looked up and found the assailant. He waved his finger and called the guy over.\n\"HEY! YOU GREEN MAN OVER THERE! GET DOWN HERE!\"\nThere was a man with long green hair and green robes. He also wore a green hoodie cloak and a face mask. His long and thick green eyebrows and sharp eyes exuded green smoke as if they were on fire.\nThe man shouted back.\n\"STATE YOUR NAME, YOUR RACE, AND YOUR BUSINESS!! WHO ARE YOU!? HOW DID YOU ENTER THE NEUTRAL FOREST OF DEZNUTS!?\"\n\"… Deez nuts?\"\nLeo was taken aback by the weird name. He pondered hard and tried to recall some weird acronyms that he had learned from clones' memory.\n\"Ah!\"\nLeo vaguely remembered something. As Leo had fought Marc, Beatrice, and Ivy in his dantian universe during his sleep, he copied their daos, skills, and memory. Among the pieces of memory, there was information related to the DEZNUTS organization.\nDEZNUTS stood for 'Divine Elven Zenith of Neo United Terraforming Solars'. They consisted of Divine Elves, Molgs, Werewolves, and a few races who surrendered to the Divine Elf Matriarch Eleanor.\nIn short, DEZNUTS was a puppet organization, that existed to serve Eleanor and her Divine Elf Empire.\nLeo snickered as he found the name cute. He pointed at the guy.\n\"Go tell your friends that a FRIENDLY FLORIDA MAN has come to visit! If you attack us one more time, that FRIENDLY FLORIDA MAN will turn into ANGRY FLORIDA MAN! Do not take chances, boy!\"\n\"…\"\nThe green man frowned, but he cooperated. He disappeared into the distance while other town militias appeared and surrounded Leo.\n\"Sky celestials, heaven celestials, a mediocre realm, I guess,\" Leo commented.\nHearing Leo's remark, every militia's eyes were bloodshot. They nocked their great bows and aimed at Leo's head. Their killing intent emanated in the air.\nLeo let out a long sigh. He contemplated if he should erase everybody here.\nFortunately, a family of a mother holding her infant in her arms passed by. A blond elf and her child were walking on a bridge above Leo. They peeked down to see the commotion.\nLeo instinctively looked up. His eyes met with the elf woman's eyes.\n\"Huh?\"\nStrangely, the woman's face resembled Esen. Moreover, their life signature and aura were uncannily similar.\n.\nMeanwhile, Ester sized up Leo. She frowned as she couldn't see through Leo's cultivation base.\n\"Who is he?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 262 Florida Man Arrested for Trespassing into Area 51 to Learn Magic and Sorcery from Aliens.\nChapter 262 – Florida Man Arrested for Trespassing into Area 51 to Learn Magic and Sorcery from Aliens.\nMinutes later, Cat, Lucky, Hua Jiashan, and others entered the portal and arrived at the other side. As soon as their eyes adjusted to the light, they deeply frowned.\nA hundred immortals with green hair and green eyes had been surrounding the portal and Leo. Over a hundred onlookers also stood on the wooden hanging bridges connecting between tree houses.\nThe killing intent in the air was overwhelming. Fortunately, most of the people here had spent time and lifespan training in Leo's time chamber before. All of them had a firm foundation, and their celestial aura negated the pressure.\nAfter everybody got in, Lucky sneered at the green elves. He purposely revealed the aura of an entity.\nIn the universe, the power ranking was graded as follows;\nMortal\nImmortal\nDeity\nSage\nEntity\nKarmic Sovereign\nThe six realms were the major realms that everybody desired to overcome and ascend to the elusive realm, which no one had reached before. Moreover, all karmic sovereigns never recorded or revealed the secret of the next cultivation stage.\nThus, an entity was akin to the semi-pinnacle of the universe. When the aura of Lucky erupted, all green-haired elves coughed blood and fell on their knees. As for Hua Jiashan and Leo's allies, they weren't affected by Lucky's killing intent.\n\"T-This… sage's aura?!\"\n\"No! That's an entity!\"\n\"Dammit!\"\nThe elves gazed at Lucky in despair. When they noticed that the entity was a stone statue, they were flabbergasted.\n\"A-A-A golem?!\" One of them uttered in shock.\nLucky snorted, \"Don't lump me with those outdated automatons. I'm an entity created by Lord Florida Man. My status is the same as a karmic sovereign!\"\n\"!!!\"\nHearing Lucky's braggart, Leo shook his head while the elves swallowed their saliva.\n\"Enough, Lucky. Suppress your aura. Let's chat with them first and we'll decide our next moves.\" Leo reprimanded Lucky.\nThe statue was unwilling, but he eventually retracted his aura and concealed his Qi.\nThe elves could move again. However, most of them already suffered an internal injury due to the presence of Lucky. They remained kneeling or sitting, looking at Leo and his comrades.\n\"WAAAAAHHH!!\"\nThe wail of a baby alarmed Leo and everybody. They looked up and found the onlookers on the bridges coughing blood. Moreover, a baby in the arms of a blond elf cried in pain.\n\"Shit! You overdid it, Lucky!\" Leo cursed at his subordinate.\n\"I-I'm sorry, woof! I didn't target them. I only targeted those around us, woof!\"\n\"You idiot! There are innocent people here! Don't harm women, elders, and children!\"\nLeo quickly put on a hazmat suit and leaped to assist the people on the bridges. He fed them pinnacle-graded Hope and Dream pills, forcing them to fall asleep. As for the baby, he crushed a medium-graded one and fed him a smaller dose. While he was at it, he also fed the mother a pinnacle-grade pill.\nEster and her son slightly recovered. Fortunately, Ester was a lot stronger than the militias and her son carried the bloodline of Simba and the royal divine elf. Both made it through after they swallowed Leo's pills.\nThe mother resisted the sleep-inducing effect of the hope and dream pill. She checked the pulse of her baby.\nFortunately, no internal injuries harmed the infant. The boy only coughed and cried because of the suffocation earlier. Lucky indeed didn't intend to harm the women and the children onlookers, but the Qi pressure still affected their psyche.\nHours later, Leo wasted a thousand pills and rescued all the civilians. When everybody recovered, he leaped down from the bridge and landed in front of his people.\nHis actions didn't escape the eyes of their superior officers, who had been observing Leo and his people from afar since they had first arrived. One of their delegations stopped watching and made their appearance.\nThe representative of the green elf teleported from 100 kilometers away and landed 20 meters in front of Leo's group. He was a 7-foot-tall middle-aged man with long ears, short green hair, and thin physique. His seamless long-sleeved green shirts and pants were unique among the crowd of green elves who wore leather armor and brown clothes.\nAside from the clothes, the man's face was ragged and wide. He wasn't as handsome as other young elves in the forest.\nThe man introduced himself, \"I'm General Vendettito Sugondese the Third of DEZNUTS. We apologize for our poor reception. We didn't know that esteemed guests from another planet were visiting us today.\"\nLeo sized up the so-called general. His aura was similar to Lucky's as he was also an entity.\nSince eight of Leo's subordinates were merely immortals, he chose not to provoke this entity and untimely implicated them. Leo minded his manner and cupped his fist.\n\"I am Florida Man from Florida Domain. We have entered a local mystic realm portal to explore and search for a fortuitous encounter. We didn't expect the portal to directly send us to another civilization.\"\n\"Florida Man?\"\nVendettito raised his brow as he recognized the name. He secretly sent a sound transmission to his colleagues 100 kilometers away for confirmation.\n'General Antinuts, could you check the name 'Florida Man' in the database? I think I've heard this name somewhere before.'\nThe colleague 100 kilometers away was another teenager-like green elf with a scar on his face. He had short crew-cut hair and smooth skin. However, he was as old as Vendettito.\nAntinuts snorted and replied instantly.\n'Florida Man is a wanted man that Her Majesty personally issued a warrant a few days ago. She also warned us not to provoke him if we find him. Let's buy some time and inform Her Majesty about his location.'\n'Alright.'\nVendettito stopped sending secret messages to his friend. He gazed at Leo and returned the gesture.\n\"Understandable. We also experienced that in the past. Well, since you're here, how about we continue our conversation in the palace so we can get to know each other better.\"\nAs soon as Vendettito raised his hand, the green elf militias and the people on the bridges instantly recovered from their injuries. Ester also recovered from the side effects of Leo's pill while the sleeping elves woke up.\nLeo raised his eyebrows. He didn't sense a domain ability or Qi, yet everybody was fully healed. He smacked his lips and inwardly laughed.\n'Heh, a mass healing spell? That's a very good ability. Don't mind me if I copy that ability.'\nLeo turned around and glanced at Lucky.\n\"Transform into your wolf form. Let me ride your back.\"\n\"But why, woof?\"\n\"Just do it. I need to take a short nap. Let me meditate on your back for a couple minutes.\"\n\"…Okay, woof.\"\nLucky transformed into a 2-meter-tall wolf. Leo hopped on the wolf's back and firmly sat down. Before he closed his eyes, he ordered everybody to follow the big-faced elf.\n\"Let's go.\"\nHua Jiashan and the others nodded and followed the march. As for Leo, he closed his eyes and sank his consciousness to his dantian universe.\nVendettito sized up Leo and slightly frowned. He scoffed in his mind.\n'Meditating in the middle of a foreign land? Talk about naivety, he must have been living under a rock. Oh, well. Since he's na?ve, I might as well buy time and contact Her Majesty.'\nThe group proceeded toward the palace of the local Zenith Elf, aka the green elves.\n.\nMeanwhile, Cat looked around and drooled. She kept staring at the green elves around them.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (They look delicious. Can I eat them?)\nTaxi jolted and pulled Cat's collar dress, which she had gotten from Leo. It was a green dress that matched her nail color.\n\"Smash!\" (Not yet. Wait for the lord's permission first.)\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Does that mean we can eat them soon?)\n\"…Smash.\" (Probably?)\nRicardo smacked the back of Taxi's head and reprimanded his colleague.\n\"SMASH!\" (Don't give her hope, you idiot! As soon as we attack them, all hell will break loose! Think about the others!)\n\"…Smash.\" (Sorry.)\n\"…Meow?\" (Sorry?)\nRicardo shook his head and slapped his forehead. Babysitting these two immature monster beasts was a headache.\n.\n.\nAfter an hour of journey, everybody arrived at a white fortress, made of sparkling white jade metal.\n\"NOM-NOM MEOW?!\" (THOSE WHITE BRICKS LOOK DELICIOUS! CAN I EAT THOSE?!)\nRicardo bonked Cat's head.\n\"Smash!\" (Not edible! Don't eat!)\n\"…Meow.\" (Shame.)\nWhile the monster beasts made a lot of strange noise, Leo slowly opened his eyes and widely grinned. He gradually opened his palms and closed them, exercising and warming up his finger muscles.\nLeo removed his hazmat suit. He turned around and looked at Cat.\n\"Cat, come here.\"\n\"Meow?\"\nCat eagerly rushed to Leo's side. She looked up and smiled at him, displaying the beauty of a gorgeous dark elf girl who could awaken any man's father instinct.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Any food, dad?)\n\"Open your mouth.\"\nCat gleefully opened her mouth as ordered. Leo snickered and condensed the green light on his index fingertip. Then, he fired a streak of light into her mouth.\n\"!!!\"\nCat instinctively swallowed the strange light. It spread throughout her body, causing her body to glow in green radiant.\nA few seconds later, Cat burped. She was full. However, she wanted more.\n\"Meow?!\" (That was delicious! What was that?!)\nLeo placed his fingertip on his lips, \"Shush! Keep it a secret, alright?\"\nCat repeatedly nodded in excitement. She eagerly awaited for Leo to feed her more of those green lights.\nLeo snickered and closed his eyes. He rechecked the status of Vendettito.\n.\n.\nName: Vendettito Sugondese the Third\nRace: High Elf\nAge: 16,580 Years\nCultivation Base: 43-Galaxy Entity\nSkills: Providence of Nature, Creation Magic, Healing Magic, Mandate of Nature\nSpecials: High Elf Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Tesla AK50 Railgun\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nThe skillset wasn't as good as Esen's. However, the application of nature magic was useful.\nThe nature of magic was different than Qi; a magician could exchange their life force to create a miracle.?For example, Vendettito's clone could repeatedly create life forms by sacrificing some of his lifespans, such as trees, animals, and mortal creatures. It was a power befit of benevolent gods.\nLeo salivated while he memorized the faces of the local people. He wondered how many books he could sell by publishing the art of sorcery and magic to a cultivation world.",

      "content": "Chapter 263 Florida Man Arrested Again as His “Cat” Swallowed His Neighbor Whole. ?\nChapter 263 – Florida Man Arrested Again as His \"Cat\" Swallowed His Neighbor Whole.\nLeo secretly sank his consciousness into his dantian universe again. He had already defeated Vendettito 5,000 times, but he hadn't enough. He attempted to learn the combo of the guy's healing magic, creation magic, the mandate of nature, and the providence domain of nature.\nThe clone manifested in Leo's universe again. He stood on the grassland world that Leo always used as a battleground against all fighters in the past, brandishing a railgun rifle and aiming at Leo who positioned himself 100 meters away.\nPWHOOSH\nThe railgun uttered a muffled sound. A black lightning bolt traveled at the speed of light and accurately hit Leo's face.\nZZZZZZ\nLeo was knocked 100 meters backward. A burnt mark was left behind on his forehead.\n\"Dammit. I want to study your combo, not your stupid anti-domain railgun.\"\nVendettito's clone didn't bother listening to Leo. He kept firing while a green magic circle emerged under his feet. It expanded like a ripple, covering a span of 100 kilometers instantly.\nLeo had seen this move several thousand times. He wryly smiled while he swiped his dirty forehead.\n\"Here comes the mandate. So, the next move is…\"\nA black stone spike protruded from the ground, threatening to pierce Leo like a kebab. The latter shifted his body to the side and avoided the attack by a hairbreadth.\nThe black spike transformed into a black tree. Sharp branches extended from the spike and pursued Leo like a homing missile.\nLeo lightly kicked the ground and vanished. He reappeared behind Vendettito and threw a light jab.\nVendettito also instantly teleported like a character from DBZ. He reappeared behind Leo while he pointed the railgun at the back of Leo's head at point-blank range.\nPWHOOSH\nThe beam directly hit Leo, causing him to tumble forward. At the same time, a new spike emerged from the ground and came for Leo's head.\n\"Oh, boy. This combo again? I want to learn a new one.\"\nLeo purposely remained still.\nBONK\nThe spike failed to penetrate Leo's forehead. The surface of the stone shattered, but it managed to push Leo's head backward.\nVendettito's clone realized that no attack worked on Leo. He sacrificed some of his lifespans to cast creation magic and healing magic at once.\nA flat 10cm-diameter silver magic circle of a healing spell appeared first. But as soon as the creation magic combined with the old spell, the magic circle changed shapes, transforming into a black runic symbol.\nIt spelled 'Death'.\nLeo glanced at the spell and smirked. He took notes, \"Finally a new trick. I guess I have to let you attack me a few times for you to use your ultimate combo, I see.\"\nIn the previous fights, Leo didn't wait for the clones to attack him first. He fought like a game-speedrunner, defeating the clones within a minute of every fight.\nHe thought that he could master every skill that the clones had. Unfortunately, Leo had already absorbed so many fragments of memory and experience. All the experience he had learned so far wasn't warranted.\nHe needed to put them into practice by either learning it from the user or using it himself.\nGetting hit by their skill combination was a quick way to master their abilities. Within a minute, Leo was enlightened.\n\"Ah, yes. Mixing magic creates a new magic entirely. Also, that creation magic works with other magic…\"\nLeo vanished while being in mid-air. He reappeared a hundred meters away from Vedettito.\nThe death symbol missed the target. However, Vendettito put his right palm on his left bicep while his left hand formed a two-finger sword. He waved his fingers, commanding the death symbol to chase after Leo. While he was at it, a thousand black and white magic circles manifested and surrounded Leo from all sides.\nLeo glanced at the thousand silver geometric symbols. He thought of a certain healer in an 18+ anime and smirked.\n\"Right. Reverse healing. Thanks again. I learn a lot.\"\nLeo lightly stomped the ground. A flat silver magic circle manifested and overlapped with Vendettito's providence domain. Leo then snapped his fingers and imitated the abilities of Vendettito in a different version.\nHe imagined the word 'Steal'.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nAll magic circles in the air turned black one after another. They stopped moving toward him.\nVendettito flinched. A second later, he coughed blood as he lost control of his domain power.\n\"If creation magic can tamper with other spells, then will it work against Qi-based domain abilities and laws? I guess it works.\"\nAfter he had successfully stolen all completed spells in Vendettito's domain, including his mandate and providence domains, Leo had enough. He swiped his hand, gesturing a slice while aiming at Vendettito's neck.\nSWUA\nVendettito's head fell from his shoulder. His artificial soul was also cut in half and vanished.\nDING\n<You have defeated Vendettito Sugondese the Third.>\nLeo shrugged. He returned his consciousness to reality with the newfound power.\n.\n.\nWhen Leo reopened his eyes, the team already entered the fortress. The steel gate behind them lowered and closed the entrance road.\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo looked back and noticed that Vendettito's men quickly closed the gate right after everybody had gotten in. He raised his eyebrows in suspicion.\n\"Among Us?\"\nThe others looked at Leo, \"Among us?\"\n\"It's nothing. Just muttering to myself.\"\n\"..Okay.\"\nLeo inwardly laughed while the SFX of a certain game echoed in his mind. He wondered what Vendettito was cooking, and he couldn't wait to shove it up the chef's rectum.\nMeanwhile, Vendettito was satisfied with the preparation. He had bought an hour. With this much time spent, Eleanor should have learned about the wanted man's location.\n\"By the way,\" Vendettito glanced at the wolf golem that Leo had been riding. As it resembled the Fenrir Werewolf race, he couldn't help but ask. \"What's your relationship with the werewolf race? I see that you're using a golem of a Fenrir Werewolf. Are you close with them?\"\nLeo patted Lucky's head and feigned ignorance, \"What Fenrir Werewolf? Are they some kind of endangered species?\"\n\"…The Fenrir Werewolves are the second-class population of DEZNUTS. Although they aren't important, I hope you won't treat them as pets or anything similar. They have rights.\"\n\"If you mean the right to invade someone's planet unprovoked, I would like you to remove that soon. It's annoying.\"\nVendettito frowned and stopped walking. He turned around while the group was on the main road between two training grounds of local soldiers.\n\"What do you mean? Did they invade your planet?\"\n\"No. They actually invaded my friend's planet, and I don't like it.\"\n\"…I see. Who is your friend?\"\n\"Overlord Lucky.\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, Vendettito deeply furrowed his eyebrows. He was certain that Overlord Lucky was Eleanor's right-hand man. By logic, the overlord should not be Leo's friend.\nSince their relationship seemed complicated, Vendettito chose not to proactively attack Leo first. He continued buying time, waiting for Eleanor's troops to arrive.\n\"I see that you're friends with one of our great generals. For now, let's get inside the castle. We have prepared rooms to accommodate you. Also, at night, we shall hold a welcome banquet.\"\n\"That's very nice of you. By the way, I have another question.\"\nLeo scanned the fortress and checked the number of garrisons. A total of 2,000 immortals, 20 deities, five sages, and two entities were present. No mortal was nearby.\nAfter confirming the number of potential enemies, Leo requested something absurd.\n\"Does your planet have something like this?\"\nLeo brought out a piece of sky fate crystal from his alien ring. He flipped it around to show it to Vendettito and nearby elves.\nAs Leo had expected, Vendettito's expression turned solemn. He took a few seconds to pace his breath and inquired, \"What is that, sir?\"\n\"A fate crystal. I'm a collector, you see. I hope that your planet has these. I would like to make a trade with you for such crystals.\"\n\"Unfortunately, this is the first time I've seen the crystal. I doubt we even have one on this planet.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"We are sure.\"\n\"Cool. Then, let's not waste time. Could you open the gate and let my men return? Since there is no need for a trade, their trip will be in vain. Instead of letting them get stuck here for days, I'd like them to go back and spend their time cultivating back home.\"\n\"…\"\nVendettito glanced at the crowd of immortals. He sized up Hua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, and others. Since they were weak quasi-immortals and immortals, he thought they were Leo's luggage carriers.\n\"Since we're here, won't you let them have some rest and enjoy the feast first?\"\n\"It's just an hour walk. They're all immortals. I doubt they need rest.\"\nLeo glanced at Ricardo and Taxi. He secretly sent a sound transmission to them.\n'These green people are not friendly. I think they are planning to kill us here. Bring the others back first.'\nTaxi and Ricardo's expressions turned dark. They didn't move an inch, but they replied.\n'SMASH!' (Understood. By the way, would you like us to call for reinforcement?)\n'Lucky and I are enough. But if you're worried, go tell the devil and the fisherman statue that I might be in trouble.'\n'SMASH!' (Got it!)\nLeo shifted his gaze to Vendettito, \"Well? Can they go home first?\"\n\"What about you?\"\n\"I will stay, of course.\"\n\"Then, I don't see any problem. GUARDS! OPEN THE GATE AND ESCORT THE FRIENDS BACK TO THEIR PORTAL!\"\nGetting permission, Leo patted Lucky's head. He whispered.\n\"Go with them. Kill anyone if they play any trick.\"\nLucky's pupils dilated. He sneered at the elves, \"Woof!\"\nHua Jiashan and the others were still confused as to why Leo suddenly drove them back. But since Leo made the decision, they reluctantly followed the escorting soldiers to leave the fortress. Lucky followed after them while he observed the guards.\nNine guests left. Leo remained behind. The gate was closed again.\nWhile monitoring the group with his senses, Leo gestured to Vendettito, \"Let's get in. I can't wait to see the food.\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Cat was perplexed. She couldn't understand why Leo forced them to go home when the fortress seemed delicious.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Can I eat the fortress? The white metal smells really delicious!)\nTaxi patted Cat's head.\n\"Smash.\" (Not yet. The lord said that there were ambushes inside. He drove us out to protect us.)\n\"NYA?!\" (Enemies?! Are those green people enemies?!)\n\"Smash.\" (It seems that way.)\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3\" (Then, can I eat them now?)\n\"Smash!\" (Of course not-)\nIt was too late for Taxi to stop Cat. The group had only exited the fortress by a minute, but Cat already approached the nearest green elf soldier.\nThe soldier wore a set of thick black leather armor, made from a bear of this planet. Its odor was similar to a piece of dried meat.\nCat drooled when her nose caught the scent. She rushed toward the elf who followed them at the back, then she tugged his shirt.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Let me eat you, please.)\n\"What?\" The elf couldn't understand Cat's weird language.\nBy the time he turned to Cat, the latter's head expanded by 2 meters in diameter. Like a snake, her mouth opened wide and chomped down on the unsuspected elf.\nGULP\nCat didn't bother chewing the elf. She swallowed him whole and let her digestive fluid melt him.",

The Son Later Diagnosed with Autism.\nChapter 264 – Florida Man Implanted CPU Chip in His Son's Brain to Improve His IQ. The Son Later Diagnosed with Autism.\nTaxi and Ricardo were the only ones who witnessed the vore scene. They covered their mouths and looked around.\n\"Smash!?\" (Are you crazy?! You are going to kill us all!)\nCat instantly shrank her head back to a pretty girl's head. She licked her lips while the corners of her mouth curved up. Her smug smile annoyed Taxi and Ricardo.\n\"Meow?\" (Nobody was looking though. Look around. Has anybody noticed the missing guy yet?)\n\"…\"\nTaxi and Ricardo swept their gaze around them.\nThe escort soldiers didn't even notice the missing guy. Moreover, the pedestrians on the bridge and the road didn't even pay attention to them as they were at the back of the caravan – All eyes focused on Lucky and the squad leader of the escort troops.\n\"Meow <3\" (See? Nobody suspects a thing <3)\nTaxi had the urge to bonk Cat and reprimand her. Afraid of attracting attention, the pony man only gave Cat a solemn look.\n\"…Smash.\" (One is enough. No more, or we'll be killed.)\n\"Meow.\" (Fine. I'm full anyway. That guy was just a desert.)\n\"…\"\nCat hummed and followed the caravan as if nothing had happened. Ricardo and Taxi let out a long sigh before they followed the troublemaking kid. They positioned themselves on her left and right, sandwiching her and preventing her from breaking the formation again.\n.\nMeanwhile, a 5,000-year-old green elf slowed his feet and glanced behind him.\nRockhart Pepopile was his name. His handsome face perfectly fit the image of fantasy elves in Leo's imagination, except for his robust muscles. His cultivation base was a 7-star deity, and he was over 5,000 years old.\nRockhart had been monitoring Leo's subordinates since they had departed. Cat's action never escaped his detection range.\nDespite witnessing the assassination, Rockhart grinned. He secretly sized up Cat and checked her figure.\nHe loved little girls, especially dark-skinned girls. Cat's dark elf girl appearance fit his taste perfectly.\nRockhart was rock-hard. His pants swelled around his crotch area.\nHe wanted her.\n'Stupid girl. It's your fault for killing my soldier. Well, even if you didn't do it, I will still make you mine anyway. A brat like you needs CORRECTION!'\nHis lecherous thoughts synchronized with his aura. Purple air leaked from his skin's pores, causing everybody nearby to look at him.\nHua Jiashan, Han Hao, Han Meng, and Tiger Swordsman frowned. Their instinct cried that the man had a perverted thought. Dongfang Mei also raised her eyebrows as she recognized this strange aura color.\nAs for the subordinates of Rockhart, they got used to it. They were aware of this guy's fetish and hobbies.\n'Here we go again. This damn pedophile.'\n'Is he fantasizing about his slaves again? Or rather, is he eyeing on someone around here?'\n'Will he die if he stops kidnapping young women for a day? Because of him, all young elves have relocated to other provinces.'\nNot everybody had a high opinion of this captain. Most of them wanted him gone because of his sickening behavior and dark hobbies.\n30 minutes later, the group was halfway toward the portal. Rockhart started his scheme, ordering everybody to stop.\n\"Halt. Let's rest a bit.\"\n\"…\"\nThe elf soldiers weren't tired, but they rested as ordered. As for Leo's subordinates, they let out a long sigh as they were mentally exhausted. Hua Jiashan and the elders took this opportunity to rest under a shade and took a sip of tea.\nCat, Taxi, and Ricardo remained close to Lucky as their monster instinct made them attracted to stronger monsters. As for Lucky, he chose a large boulder to sit on and observed Leo's people.\nWhile everybody was resting on the side road, Rockhart took this opportunity to approach Cat.\n\"Hello, young lady. Is this your first time visiting our planet?\"\nCat innocently tilted her head and looked at the handsome elf's face. She meowed.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Do you have food?)\n\"Err, what?\"\n\"Nom-Nom?\" (I said, do you have food?)\nRockhart was confused. He looked at Ricardo and Taxi, asking them with his eyes to translate for him.\nBoth horses in disguise shook their heads and smirked. They glanced at Lucky.\nLucky noticed their gestures. He snorted and translated Cat's language.\n\"She simply asked you if you had food to spare, woof.\"\n\"Oh! That's what she means! But… what happens to her speech? Why is she talking like a cat?\"\nLucky snorted, \"She isn't even an elf, woof. She's a mutated dryad, born from our lord's essence. Because of the mutation and her age, she hasn't been able to communicate normally. It takes time for her to adapt and adjust her vocal cords, woof.\"\n\"…I see. But since you mention her age, how old is she?\"\n\"Less than a year old, woof.\"\n\"…\"\nRockhart dropped his jaw. Although he was into children and young maidens, he had never touched an infant before, especially monster infants.\nHe salivated. In his eyes, Cat's petite body and sexy figure were irresistible. He wanted her to join his collections.\n\"Can I ask you something specific?\" Rockhart smiled at Lucky.\n\"Speak, woof!\"\n\"Is she the lord's servant or slave? Can I purchase her?\"\nRicardo and Taxi jumped up from their seats and stood in between Cat and Rockhart. Their bloodshot eyes glared at the pedophile.\n\"SMASH!\" (This sicko deserves a thousand death! HOW DARE YOU?!)\n\"SMASH!\" (YOU WANT HER? OVER MY DEAD BODY, PUNK!)\nDespite being weak immortals, they showed no fear in front of a deity. As they still wore Leo's suit, they were confident that they couldn't be killed by a lowly deity.\nRockhart sneered at the ponies. However, he was conscious of Lucky's superior cultivation. Thus, he conceded.\n\"I see that she's a very important person among you. Please forgive me for my rudeness. Forget what I ask.\"\nLucky smacked his lips. He bellowed.\n\"Then, scram! There is nothing to sell here!\"\n\"…\"\nRockhart lowered his head and retreated without saying anything. He turned around and hid his cold eyes.\n'I guess I have no choice.'\nRockhart coughed and sent a sound transmission to his superior officer, who was another entity beside Vendettito.\n\"Sir, one of Florida Man's subordinates has killed one of us. They have an entity as an escort. I'm afraid that we might take a heavy casualty if we try to arrest them.\"\nAs soon as Rockhart sent the words, the reply from Vendettito's colleague echoed.\n\"I hear you. I'll take care of that entity. You should start calling for backup and have them arrest the intruders.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nRockhart licked his lips and ended the call. He rubbed his hands, looking forward to violating Cat and torturing Ricardo and Taxi.\n.\n.\nDING\nDING\nMeanwhile, 50,000km away from Ester's planet, Eleanor's flagship and the cubic motherships reformed their formation, preparing to enter the world's orbit.\nEleanor leisurely reclined her sofa, gazing at the bridge's monitor. The ship's captain stood behind her, acting as her aide.\nThe ship captain was a divine elf, whose blond hair, jade white skin, and beautiful face were not inferior to Eleanor. He looked like a young man in his 20s, but his real age surpassed 20,000.\nDowbad Dragondese was one of the few karmic sovereigns under Eleanor's command. His combat prowess was only second to Eleanor, and he was the grand commander of the DEZNUTS council.\nDowbad glanced at his system menu and pressed a few buttons. He adjusted his status attributes and ability points, preparing for another combat against an entity.\nHis system was a leveling system. He could get stronger infinitely as long as he could kill an opponent in the same cultivation base. However, as he couldn't find an opponent in the same cultivation base to kill, his level got stuck there for years.\nDowbad finished with his skill settings. He adjusted his white robes and checked his inventory system before he pulled out a long sword and a silver shotgun.\nOverlord Lucky was also behind Eleanor. When he noticed that Dowbad was eager to enter a battle, he snorted.\n\"Her Majesty hasn't asked you to make a move yet. Stand down!\"\nDowbad calmly refuted, \"I'm just preparing my gear. It has nothing to do with you.\"\n\"Yes, it has everything to do with me. I'm Her Majesty's bodyguard, and you're taking out arms while we're in the proximity of her grace. Unarm yourself before I cut you to pieces!\"\n\"Oooh. Scary.\"\nDowbad snickered and put his weapons away.\nEleanor ignored the banter. She closed her eyes and used one of her unique dao.\nIn her mind, she could see visions of the present events or secretly enter anybody's mind and spy on them, snooping the events from their perspective. She could also read their minds while her consciousness was inside her victim.\nHowever, there was one condition to use her ability. She could only spy on fellow Fate Crystal users. She could not possess others who didn't have a crystal in their souls.\nCoincidentally, Leo fulfilled this unique condition. Eleanor found his life signature and sent her consciousness to slip into his sea of consciousness.\nIt only took two seconds for her consciousness to enter Leo's mind. She hid in there and watched the scenery from Leo's perspective. While she was at it, she slowly collected and read his memory and mind.\n10 seconds later, Eleanor frowned. She couldn't hear his thoughts or see the images of his imagination. Leo only dully gazed at Vendettito, but his mind was blank.\n\"What's the matter with this man?\" Eleanor thought. She found Leo weird.\nHe had no thoughts! His head was completely blank!\nBaffled and perplexed by Leo's mentality and thoughts, Eleanor stopped reading his thoughts but focused on reading his memory.\nAs soon as Eleanor snooped into Leo's core memory, she found a mental wall, made of a divine elf's magic and unknown karmic sovereign's dao.\n\"Hmm?\"\nEleanor recognized this magic and dao. After all, she was the one who designed it. She once used it to brainwash countless races into submission.\n\"Aha! So, you were once my minion! I thought you were someone great, but it seems you are just one of my forgotten pawns. Very well, since you've returned, I shall welcome you to my army. Let me reactivate that magic seal and rewrite your memory again!\"\nEleanor burst into laughter. Her consciousness attempted to touch the magic wall.\nVHOOM\nSuddenly, the square, circle, and mathematic symbols on the magic circle moved and transformed into a large eyeball. It stared at Eleanor and emitted rainbow lights.\n\"!!!\"\nEleanor sensed something amiss. She retreated from the consciousness and snapped open her eyes.\nWhen she came back to her senses, she discovered that her back was full of sweat.\n\"That eye…\"\nEleanor deeply furrowed her brows. She screamed in anger.\n\"ASLAN! YOU DAMN TRAITOR!\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo scratched his head so hard that his hair got messy. He felt like a bug had been crawling inside his brain for a moment.\n\"Odd. I almost dug out my brain… Was there something in there?\"\nOn the other hand, Aslan who was still guarding the mystic realm platform, revealed a sarcastic smile. He inwardly laughed.\n\"Peek-a-boo, Eleanor. Do you think I didn't put a safeguard in my son's mind? You're na?ve! Now, your location is exposed, and I can send the coordinates to your enemies.\"\nAslan burst into laughter while he sent a sound transmission to various aliens in the Fate stadium. He revealed Eleanor's current whereabouts to everybody inside.\nAmong the people in the Fate stadium, Ellen, Milo, and Simba were a part of them. They picked up the sound transmission and looked up to the sky.\nEllen revealed a sinister smile. She clenched her fist.\n\"Aha! There you are!\"\nOn the other hand, Simba's face was as pale as a sheet. The location was too close to his home, where Ester and his son resided.\n\"Shit!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 265 Karen Called Cops on Florida Man for Marrying Her Daughter Whom She Attempted to Murder.\nChapter 265 – Karen Called Cops on Florida Man for Marrying Her Daughter Whom She Attempted to Murder.\nThe fortress \"Parodies\" was located in the middle of the province. Not only it was the home of Vendettito, but it was also the primary assembly point for soldiers. Thus, many strong sages and deities garrisoned in this fortress.\nThe primary materials of this fortress were strange white bricks and stones. They exuded strong yang Qi, soothing everybody within the fortress. Because of its nature, the weather inside the fortress was warmer than the outside.\nIn the fortress, Leo inspected the interior of the fortress. The ceiling was quite short as it was only two meters tall. Only two people could fit in a hallway at once, and many random jars and tables sometimes got in the way of walking. Moreover, no light source existed except for the glowing white stones on the floor.\nThe interior of the fortress was designed to hinder potential intruders or troops. As the hallways and the ceiling were small, not many troops could enter the fortress at once, making it easier to defend.\nIn addition, the hallways and the passageways in this fortress were a maze. He had been following Vendettito for 10 minutes in this building, but they hadn't found the stairs to the higher floor yet.\nLeo grumbled while he followed Vendettito into the fortress. The room temperature was already 60 degrees Celsius, which was absurdly uncomfortable for someone who always lived in a cold climate. Despite being in this environment, Leo never broke a sweat.\nVendettito, on the other hand, seemed comfortable in this temperature. He sneaked glances at Leo and inwardly smirked.\n\"How is the fortress, Sir Florida Man? Does the yang Qi of our palace suit your liking?\"\nLeo snorted, \"Are we there yet? We have been walking in this maze for a while.\"\n\"We can't help it. This fortress is already old. It was designed this way to defend against a siege.\"\n\"Yeah, right. Siege. A warship could have bombarded this place to the Stone Age. What's the point of this floor plan?\"\n\"Hahahaha! You must haven't heard about the Styx Clay before. This fortress and the walls are built using the Styx Clay. No anti-domain gun or mandate domain can put a dent on it unless you're a karmic sovereign.\"\n\"That's what I'm saying. It's pointless. If a karmic sovereign can destroy it, why bother making it complicated? Those guys can just simply teleport randomly and enter your house, no? I bet housemaids never last a month working here. Cleaning these hallways and the entire maze is a hassle.\"\nVendettito narrowed his eyes. He knew that Leo was strong, but he didn't believe that Leo was capable of destroying this fortress. He continued bringing Leo deeper into the fortress to buy more time.\nHowever, Leo was tired of this farce. He stopped walking and placed his hand on a wall.\nDING\nA large chunk of the wall vanished into Leo's system inventory. He planned to research this material late.\nVendettito didn't notice the disappearance of the wall. He continued walking, leading Leo.\nSeeing how Vendettito no longer paid attention to his actions, Leo grinned and hurried his feet. He followed Vendettito while he randomly touched things, storing and stealing everything he touched.\nLeo got greedier. Instead of touching the walls, doors, or random furniture on the way, he reached out and touched the short ceiling.\nDING\nDING\nLike a monkey, Leo walked while he raised his hands to the sky. He snickered and kept up the pace.\nAs Leo stole more walls and white blocks, the wind blew into the hallway. Vendettito noticed it and turned around.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo instantly stopped playing around. He deeply inhaled and unleashed his time and space domain.\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nThe clocks stopped ticking while the time in the solar system froze.\n'Time to finish this. I should start by getting rid of this fool.'\nLeo didn't bother waiting to confirm Vendettito's motive. He threw a punch to the elf's face, exploding his head upon impact. The pieces of flesh scattered in every direction for a few seconds before they were suspended in mid-air.\nUnfortunately, killing an entity was not a simple task. As soon as Leo destroyed Vendettito's head, his soul was ejected from the body and flew away even though Leo's time domain was in effect.\n\"Nope! You're not getting away!\"\nLeo extended his hand into a grasp motion. As soon as he clenched his fist, the transparent blue orb of Vendettito's soul shattered into dust.\n\"Alright!\"\nLeo laughed after confirming the kill. He turned his attention to the fortress next. He maintained the power of time domain and took advantage of it.\n\"It would have been a shame if we returned empty-handed. Time to loot.\"\n.\n.\nIn the flagship, Eleanor, Dowbad, and Overlord Lucky were about to teleport to the Parodies Fortress to assess the situation Dowbad vanished first as he was eager to play with the wanted man.\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nAs soon as Dowbad was gone, the time domain of Leo reached them. Everybody in the ship and the other motherships were suspended in the grey domain.\n\"Heh, a time and space law? How cute.\"\nOverlord Lucky snorted and broke out of the time domain. He rubbed his arms and prepared to destroy it.\nEleanor also easily broke free from the domain's restriction. However, her expression was still dark as she was still wary of a certain dead researcher.\n\"I told Mao Miaomiao to kill everybody, including Aslan and the local elves! How did he survive?!\"\nEleanor ignored the time domain. Because of her anxiousness, she teleported away and reappeared 50 galaxies away from the flagship.\nBelow here was the karma river of this universe. Although it was called a river, the mass of white water was larger than Earth's water mass. They covered the span of 49 solar systems combined.\nIt was a radiant ocean in the void!\nCountless souls hibernated in there, waiting for their reincarnation opportunities. At the bottom of the sea hid the embryos of new souls who were about to replace the destroyed souls.\nEleanor scanned through the White Sea and searched for the souls of Mao Miaomiao, Aslan, and the people who were involved in the project.\n10 minutes later, she managed to locate some of the scientists and relatives of the local elves. However, she couldn't find Aslan and Mao Miaomiao.\nThis confirmed her worries.\n\"As I thought. Aslan, you're still lurking in this universe. That was not just a typical will. It WAS your consciousness and your soul!\"\nEleanor smacked her lips as she remembered Aslan well.\n.\n.\nAslan was a famous divine elf who graduated from the royal academy at the age of 13. The man reached the entity realm at the age of 16, breaking all the records of divine elves.\nHis talent piqued Eleanor's interest in his bloodline and intelligence. She invited him to join her harem, hoping to merge his bloodline with hers to give birth to talented children.\nUnfortunately, Aslan was uncooperative. Instead of joining Eleanor's harem, he accepted a lowly spy job and was deployed to Earth. Coincidentally, the task was related to Eleanor's secret project – The Soul Transfer Research Project.\nEleanor was enraged when she discovered the news. She traveled to Earth to visit Aslan. Then, she offered him to become his mentor, hoping to win him back.\nAslan accepted. He became Eleanor's disciple for a while, and their relationship got closer. However, Aslan always rejected Eleanor's approach when things got too intimate.\nBecause of Aslan's dullness, Eleanor got bored of him. She returned to her constellation as she had a domain to manage. She thought that Aslan would still respect her as his mentor.\nAgain, Aslan quickly betrayed Eleanor. He fell in love with a female human scientist and married her. She soon conceived a baby boy named Leonardo.\nThe news of Aslan's marriage quickly reached Eleanor. Her pride as the queen shattered, and she wanted him and his family dead in the most painful way possible. Thus, she started colluding with Dr. Mao, who was a harmless earthling.\nBecause of Dr. Mao and the local governments, the kid 'Leonardo' was forced to join the project as one of the test subjects. Aslan and his wife protested at first. But when Eleanor made her appearance and personally monitored the project, Aslan and his wife were forced to cooperate.\nStill, Aslan was not stupid enough to sit idly and wait for his son to die. He scammed Eleanor to exchange her stars with the top overlord's blood to boost the project's success rate. He even seduced her, promising her that he would divorce his wife and join her harem.\nEleanor succumbed to Aslan's scheme and agreed to his request. She contacted several overlords, such as Overlord Xiaomao, Overlord Mustafa of Cathulhu, and the phoenix overlord for their bloodline. The valuable blood essence was cloned and distributed to the test subjects later.\nWith Aslan's help, the first few phases were successful. The test subject 'Leonardo' and 'Simba' evolved, and their physiques became compatible with a divine elf's soul.\nBut when it was time for Aslan to fulfill his promise and surrender himself to Eleanor, he escaped with his son and 'Simba'. They disguised themselves as commoners and hid in Florida for decades until Dr. Mao Miaomiao reported the news to Eleanor.\nAfterward, a tragedy struck.\n.\n.\nEleanor stopped thinking. She seethed her anger whenever she thought of her former crush.\n\"I taught you everything. I gave you wealth, status, and fame, yet you chose a powerless human. Very well, since that FLORIDA MAN is your son, I'll send you and him to hell together! But first, I have this!\"\nEleanor burst into laughter while she pointed her finger at the karma river.\n\"I command you! From now on, I'm your master! You all shall join my dantian universe and become my power!\"\nRUMBLE\nAs soon as Eleanor's mandate was in effect, the entire White Sea shrank and entered Eleanor's dantian. All quadrillion souls in the river vanished into her body.\nEleanor's cultivation base increased. As a karmic sovereign, every karma river inside her increased her strength by a stage. Moreover, each karma river could negate death, allowing her to self-resurrect whenever and wherever she wanted.\nAfter digesting the karma river, she thought of Mao Miaomiao. Eleanor still doubted how that devil perished even though he could consume souls in his dantian universe's karma rivers to self-resurrect.\n'Tsk. That moron. Well, it doesn't matter. With this, Aslan and that Florida Man won't be my opponent! I'll crush them myself!'\nEleanor teleported again and reappeared on top of the Parodies Fortress. Next to her was Dowbad, who had already broken free from Leo's restrictions.\nThe captain looked at his master.\n\"Are we attacking him together?\"\nEleanor snorted, \"Kill him in one attack. I don't care what happens to his soul. I want him dead.\"\n\"Good. I'll make the first move!\"\nA trail of water flowed out from Dowbad's fingers and the pores of his skin. They were the water from his karma river, which could instantly destroy any foreign entity or karmic sovereign's body upon touch.\nBut instead of aiming at Leo on the first floor, Dowbad gathered the water mass and targeted Leo's time and space domain. He made a slash motion.\n.\n.\nLeo looked up as he sensed two karmic sovereigns on top of the fortress within his domain.\n\"…Ah. Right. The domain vulnerability. How annoying.\"\nLeo retracted the domain. But instead of dispelling it completely, Leo cast a new spell to trick the two enemies.\nA magic circle appeared underground, covering the entire fortress. It was Leo's combination between the nature spell and the creation spell.\nThe spell transformed the geometric symbols in the circle into words – SLOW.\nRUMBLE\nThe spell worked as intended. Aside from the caster, everybody in the domain moved in slow motion.\nSWUA\nAs soon as the spell replaced the time domain, Dowbad's attack hit the spell's magic circle. It shattered the word in one hit.\nThe slow-motion effect was dispelled!\n\"Wow. That was close!\"\nLeo laughed and kicked the ground, teleporting himself to the sky.\nWhen Leo reappeared, he looked down and found himself above the fortress. On a fortress tower's rooftop, two karmic sovereigns looked up and stared at him.\nLeo and Eleanor stared at each other. The latter raised her eyebrows in astonishment as Leo's face looked exactly like Aslan's.\n\"…\"\nSeeing the child of the man she once loved, Eleanor's heart softened. She ceased her killing intent.\n\"Florida Man, I assume.\"\nLeo snorted, \"You look like Esen. Are you her mother?\"\n\"Oh?\" Eleanor was surprised. She narrowed her eyes. \"Do you know my daughter?\"\n\"She's my wife, of course!\"\nEleanor was taken aback. Because Leo's voice and face were similar to Aslan's, the PTSD of the past resurfaced. \"You father and son are the same. Your stupidity knows no bounds.\"\nLeo ignored her comment since he was used to being called stupid. \"Well, if you're her mother, I must express my gratitude. Thanks for giving birth to my cute wife and throwing her away. I'm not sorry that I banged your daughter, and I ain't refunding or returning her. Finder's keeper!\"\n\"…You, what?\"\n\"Anyway, what's your problem? Why the hell did you kill and curse your daughter? Are you one of those 'I'm a proud single mother, but I can't raise children for shit' mothers? Also, who's her father anyway, I'm curious. Don't tell me that you don't remember whose dick you rode, bitch. Should I change the questions to… wait a second. Out of context, what's your body count? 5? 10? 50? Spartan 300?\"\n\"…\"\nAfter witnessing Leo's weird tone and manner, Eleanor changed her mind. She wasn't into freaks or men with mental issues. Eleanor raised her arm and unleashed her power.\n\"Go to hell.\"",

He was slightly nervous if he should fight them before he could learn about their skills. After all, clones of \"Kitten\" managed to kill him several times in the simulation.\nIf an entity like Kitten could kill him, Leo was afraid that these two karmic sovereigns might be able to kill him as well. He decided to play it safe by not recklessly using a big skill, such as domains and power moves.\nLeo pulled out the staff of singularity in preparation in preparation.\nAs Leo had predicted, Eleanor made her move first. She created a thousand mysterious white liquid in front of her and fired everything toward him.\nAlthough the water droplets seemed harmless, Leo took a precautionary move. He blinked and appeared 100 meters away from the previous location. He stretched his arm and pointed his staff at Eleanor.\nRetaliating, Leo injected a star's worth of Qi into his staff, transforming it into a boomstick. He pulled the trigger. A thousand rainbow-colored laser beams repeatedly flashed, targeting Eleanor and Dowbad.\nAs soon as Dowbad and Eleanor noticed the rainbow beams, their expressions changed. Both vanished and reappeared 10 meters behind Leo.\nDowbad also drew his karma river to condense white water in his hand. The fluid condensed into a long sword while Dowbad swung it. At the same time, Eleanor transformed her karma river into strings and spread them around Leo, blocking his escape route.\nLeo raised his eyebrows while he glanced at the karma water strings. He raised his staff and blocked the water sword strike.\nCLANK\nThe karma water sword shattered upon impact. The liquid dispersed into fog and gathered inside Leo's stomach.\nDowbad dropped his jaw in shock, \"HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!\"\nLeo shrugged and pointed the staff's muzzle at Dowbad's face. He pulled the trigger.\n\"TSK!\"\nDowbad bent backward and narrowly dodged the beam by a hairbreadth.\nLeo sneered at Dowbad. He activated the second feature of the staff by flipping the hidden switch on the shaft.\nVHOOM\nThe beam faded. However, a thick rainbow plasma sword replaced it.\nUsing the staff as a plasma halberd, Leo swung the staff down, aiming to cut Dowbad in half.\nDowbad groaned and twisted his body in midair, dodging the unknown rainbow lightsaber. While dodging, he pointed his fingers at Leo and fired karma river bullets at him.\nLeo rotated his staff with one hand, deflecting the bullets. As for his other hand, he pulled out a pistol and started blasting.\nBOOM\nThe upgraded pistol unleashed a massive rainbow laser beam, devouring half of Dowbad's torso in one shot!\n\"!!!\"\nDowbad widened his eyes in shock as his body gradually disintegrated into dust. Protecting his life, ejected his soul from his brain, sacrificing his fleshly body.\nThe karma river in his soul condensed a new physique and resurrected him. The elf returned naked and weaponless. Saving his skin, he retreated, teleporting back to his battleship.\nLeo didn't pursue him. He shifted his attention to Eleanor.\nThe battle only lasted three seconds. However, those three seconds were enough for Eleanor to finish multiple incantations and spells.\nThe karma river strings around them shrank while the tips of the strings pursued Leo like homing missiles.\nLeo waved the lightsaber halberd. The rainbow plasma blade cut through the strings like paper. While defending himself, his other hand shifted his pistol and pulled the trigger.\nBOOM\nThe rainbow Kamehameha was too fast for Eleanor to react. She instantly ejected her soul from her fleshly body as Dowbad did. As for the soulless body of Eleanor, it disintegrated to ash!\nThe karma river in Eleanor's soul consumed the souls in the river and regenerated her fleshly body. As all her equipment, storage rings, and artifacts had been devoured by Leo's mysterious beam, she remained in her birthday suit.\n\"I see. You're definitely not an entity but a karmic sovereign like us. No one under the karmic sovereign realm can deflect or defend against karma river techniques.\" Eleanor praised Leo.\nMeanwhile, Leo deeply frowned. She looked too much like Esen, but her breasts and hips were superior to her. He wished that Esen had half of those assets.\n\"Is an assassination attempt on your son-in-law a tradition of your family? I don't understand your logic sometimes.\"\n\"If you want to blame someone, blame your father.\"\nEleanor snapped her fingers and opened five status screens in front of Leo. All of them featured different system perks.\nThe first one was a leveling system, displaying her attribute values, skills, magic, and various techniques. On the screen, Eleanor still had unassigned attribute points, which she could use to boost her strength.\nThe second window showed the description, power level, and strength of Leo. However, most of his information was censored because of his entity fate crystal.\nThe third revealed Eleanor's system inventory and her items. Similar to Leo's inventory, she had ten thousand different types of items in her inventory slots.\nThe fourth system screen revealed a shopping website. It allowed Eleanor to exchange her lifespan for system items.\nIt was the same shopping system that Leo had!\nAs for the last screen, it was the RTS system. It revealed the universe map and her galaxies in the universe, including the territory of her rivals and enemies. On the screen, her location was deep in her own domain.\n\"It's your mistake for intruding on my domain, Florida Man. Now that you attacked me, my system can kill you! DIE!\"\nEleanor pressed on something on her RTS system screen and cackled.\nLeo deeply frowned. He thought of the newbie's protection system that he had in the past, causing him to have goosebumps.\n\"Shit!\"\nLeo couldn't believe that someone else had that system too. He raised his staff, preparing to protect himself from random attacks.\nOne second later, nothing happened.\nFive seconds later, everything was quiet.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nBoth Eleanor and Leo blankly looked at each other in confusion.\n\"Hey, bitch. Are you sure your system works perfectly? Was that a bluff?\"\n\"T-This is impossible! My systems always attacked every intruder! Why doesn't it work?!\"\nNonchalantly, Leo blinked and teleported behind Eleanor. He peeked at her RTS status screen and saw a sentence below.\n\"Oh.\"\nAlthough Leo was silly and stupid most of the time, he didn't forget to give Eleanor a firm chokehold. He tightened his arms, making sure that she couldn't escape his grasp.\n\"Have you read the bottom sentence under the map, you dumb bitch? It literally said [The self-protection feature only works against system users with a lower cultivation base.]\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nEleanor already knew about it. However, the sentence implied another thing that shocked her.\nIf the system didn't work against Leo, wouldn't that mean his real cultivation base was higher than the karmic sovereign realm?\n\"IMPOSSIBLE! THE KARMIC SOVEREIGN REALM IS THE PINNACLE OF THE UNIVERSE! NO ONE HAS EVER REACHED THE HIGHER STAGE!!\"\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm probably… that.\"\nLeo gently exerted more strength and snapped Eleanor's neck.\nCRACK\nUnfortunately, snapping her neck wasn't enough to kill her. At best, it could only shut her mouth for a few seconds.\nLeo didn't waste time. While Eleanor was disabled, he closed his eyes to run a simulator. He quickly chose Eleanor's clone as an opponent to learn her skills, hoping to find a way to kill a karmic sovereign.\nFive seconds later, Eleanor's bones regenerated and self-repaired. She regained her senses and started summoning her karma river.\nCRACK\nLeo slightly opened his eyes and snapped her neck for the second time. He also chopped off her arms and legs, making sure that she couldn't use another body part to bring out deadly water from her dantian's karma river again.\nFive seconds later, Eleanor recovered. This time, she opened her mouth and vomited the head of a karma dragon.\n\"Annoying. Can you let me rest for a few minutes?\"\nCRACK\nLeo twisted Eleanor's head for the third time. This time, he grabbed her lower jaw and pushed it against the upper jaw, forcing her to bite the body of the dragon.\nThe dragon reverted into karma water and dispersed into a fog. They were attracted to a stronger karma river, which was located in Leo's dantian. The fog vanished into Leo's stomach.\nPreventing Eleanor from summoning something from her mouth again, Leo mimicked Eleanor's previous actions, drawing karma river water from his dantian to reality.\nA stream of rainbow water came out from his index fingertip. He twirled it around Eleanor's head and imagined a thick duct tape.\nThe stream of river transformed into black duct tape, which sealed Eleanor's mouth and her entire face.\n\"Ah, this is a lot better.\"\nAfter sealing her mouth, Leo searched for her karma strings.\nUnfortunately, karmic sovereigns were no longer tied to a karma river or a cycle of reincarnation. They were independent of the rivers, and they could even control them.\nAs Eleanor had no karma strings, Leo was unsure what he should do with her. He closed his eyes and returned to the simulator mode.\nUnfortunately, Eleanor was a force to reckon with. She kept restoring her limbs and reattempting to break free.\nLeo mercilessly snapped her neck, sealed her meridians, broke her dantian, and even drained her Qi. However, Eleanor always fully recovered within 5 seconds, making the task tedious and grindy.\n\"AHHHH!! ANNOYING!\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Aslan pondered about Leo's foundation. He was aware that his son never had a mentor to teach him about cultivation and the difference in cultivation base, he wondered if Leo could handle a veteran karmic sovereign like Eleanor or Overlord Kishin.\nWorrying about Leo, Aslan stood in front of the portal, scanning the leaking energy of the other side. He attempted to play a geo-guessing game, searching for the planet that the portal was connected to.\nSeveral minutes later, Aslan deeply frowned. He recognized the unique air and scent, which only the elf planets had.\n\"Really? An elf planet?\"\nAslan thought of the distance between Eleanor's territory and their location. As they were too far away, his power would be weakened if he traveled there.\nAs the planet was too far away, Aslan was helpless. He wished that he was the one tagging along with Leo.\nWhile worrying about Leo, Aslan sensed a slight change in the air on the other side. It reeked the smell of a werewolf.\n\"Oh, dear. Isn't that Overlord Lucky?\"\n.\n.\nOverlord Lucky had been watching enough. After Eleanor and Dowbad left the ship, he followed them and landed in front of Ester's house.\nOverlord Lucky blasted the front door open and entered the wooden cabin. He searched for a living person inside.\nUnfortunately, Ester was not home.\nOverlord Lucky didn't leave. He searched Ester's belongings, hoping to find sensitive documents or cultivation resources that Simba had left behind. After ransacking everything in the house, he visited the garage next.\nBut as soon as Overlord Lucky entered the garage, the caravan of Hua Jiashan, Cat, Taxi, and the others paraded on the street. The commotion got the overlord's attention.\n\"Hmm.\"\nOverlord Lucky was curious. He went out of the garage and levitated in the sky to see the parade.\nHe looked at the crowd of immortals in disdain.\n\"Weaklings here are everywhere. Tsk!\"\nOverlord Lucky swept his gaze over the caravan. Then, he saw the group of humans, whom he hated.\n\"And a bunch of Nu'Earthe! Who let those maggots here…HUH?!\"\nWhile glaring at the crowd of cultivators, the corner of his eyes spotted a strange individual. He had the appearance of a giant wolf, but his body was made of grey stone.\nOverlord Lucky found the guardian statue 'Lucky'.",

But why…\"\nOverlord Lucky was perplexed. He had memorized every face of the Fenrir entities, but he didn't remember seeing the golem before. It piqued his interest.\nLeaving Ester's house, Overlord Lucky leaped forward and landed on the road, blocking the path of the caravan. He turned around and menacingly glared at the green elves.\nRockhart recognized the overlord. He rushed over and yelled at him.\n\"Hey! You mutt! You should have come earlier! Now that you're here, kill these people for me! I want that little girl, you hear?!\"\n\"Ah?\" Overlord Lucky snarled. He didn't like the elf's tone.\n\"Don't AH me, you slave! You and all werewolves are our slaves! You will do exactly what I said!!\"\nRockhart disregarded the cultivation gap between him and the overlord. He brought out a whip and lashed at the latter's stomach.\n\"…\"\nOverlord Lucky felt nothing. His cold eyes stared into Rockhart's soul, not hiding his malicious intent.\nRockhart continued whipping while Overlord Lucky stood there and took it.\n\"Stop ignoring me, you slave dog! GO! I SAY, GO! KILL THEM!!\"\n\"…\"\nDespite possessing the power to crush Rockhart in one hit, Overlord Lucky snorted and caught the whip. The weapon dissipated into dust and burnt Rockhart's hands.\n\"AAAAHHH!!\"\nRockhart squealed like a pig. However, his hands weren't injured. Only a fragment of his Qi sent a false alarm to his brain.\n\"Y-YOU, DAMN MUTT!! HOW DARE YOU BURN ME?! I WILL SUE YOU AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING A DELEGATE OF DEZNUTS-\"\nOverlord Lucky had enough. His large hand grabbed Rockhart's head and pulled him toward his face.\n\"Listen here, you little shit. The only reason you're alive right now is because of the Oath of Fenrir. Even though we've pledged allegiance to the Divine Elves, we are not your slaves or servants!! If you run your mouth one more time, I'll gorge out your eyes, vocal cords, eardrums, and your limbs. I'll make sure you'll spend eternity living in the freezing abyss, unable to speak, hear, or see anything. Bear in mind that the Oath of Fenrir forbids us from killing elves, but it doesn't prevent us from torturing you!! NOW, SCRAM!\"\n\"H-HIEEEKK!!\"\nRockhart squealed and fell on his butt. He turned around and ran away without looking back.\nOverlord Lucky snorted and turned his attention to the golem who had the same face as him.\nBOOM\nSuddenly, Rockhart's head shattered and turned into blood mist. The guardian golem \"Lucky\" stood up and patted her paws after he had swiftly used a blood domain to devour Rockhart's lifespan and blood essence.\nThe clone faced the original. Both \"Lucky\" took one step closer to size up their opponent.\nLucky transformed into a humanoid werewolf, preparing for a potential combat.\nOverlord Lucky allowed the clone to finish his transformation as he was curious about it. When the golem finished his transformation, Overlord Lucky narrowed his eyes. The golem looked exactly like him. Overlord Lucky disliked this copycat.\n\"Is this a joke?\"\nLucky, the guardian statue, took one step forward and stared into the overlord's eyes. \"My life is never a joke, woof. But yours is.\"\n\"Aha! Is that a challenge, bitch?!\"\n\"We're trying to return home, woof. It's you who suddenly gets in the way. If you're smarting than dogs, MOVE… bitch. Get out of the way!\"\nOverlord Lucky sneered. Testing the water, Overlord Lucky deployed the blood domain and attempted to kill everybody behind the golem.\nThe shadow of Leo wasn't na?ve enough to overlook the domain. He countered it with the same domain while he created a black blood shield and a black blood sword. He slashed forward, attacking the overlord's domain.\nOverlord Lucky stepped forward and grabbed the blood sword before it could cut his domain. His other hand generated his blood sword and hacked the copycat's neck.\nLucky, the clone, simply glanced at the blood sword and snorted.\nBOOM\nThe blood sword of the overlord shattered and dispersed into blood mist.\nNoticing that his sword was destroyed, Overlord Lucky also clenched his fist and destroyed the copycat's sword as well.\nWithout a weapon, the guardian bashed his blood shield against the original.\nOverlord Lucky couldn't foresee a simple attack. The blood shield smacked his face and cladded his body with glowing black blood. Black lightning within the blood struck the overlord and paralyzed him.\n\"RUN, WOOF!\" Lucky ordered Leo's employees.\nHua Jiashan and the others realized the crisis. They ran past the overlord and rushed toward the portal in front of them. One after another, the cultivators escaped from the home base of green elves.\nTaxi, Ricardo, and Cat were the strongest trio in the group. They waited until everybody except Lucky to enter the portal before they made their move.\nUnfortunately, the overlord recovered from the paralysis first. He glanced at the trio and bellowed.\nLucky reacted fast. He threw a punch at the overlord's face and stopped the voice attack before it was completed. Overlord Lucky was smacked to the nose and long mouth, causing some of his teeth and fangs to fly.\nOverlord Lucky instantly regained his bearing and regenerated the lost teeth. He grabbed the copycat's arm and tried to throw him. However, he forgot that the black blood that got on him earlier was still under his opponent's control.\nZAAAAP\nBlack electricity ran through the overlord's physique and dantian. Some of his meridians and stars in his dantian universe were destroyed.\nOverlord Lucky shifted his attention to the copycat. He glared at him with hatred.\n\"YOU DAMN GOLEM!!\"\nOverlord Lucky had enough. As Qi, martial arts, and domain didn't work, he switched his fighting method. A black magic circle manifested underneath the overlord's feet.\nLucky sensed the life force in the magic circle below the overlord. He stomped on the edge of the circle and shattered it before the incantation was finished.\n\"TSK!\"\nOverlord Lucky was annoyed. He pulled an underhanded weapon which he didn't like to use – A system weapon. He pulled a gauntlet from his system inventory and equipped it to his right fist.\nLucky flinched as he sensed the threat of that weapon. Buying time, he threw the blood shield at the overlord.\nThe overlord swatted the shield away with his gauntlet, shattering it into blood mist. He also expanded his muscle mass and dispelled the black blood on him.\nThat short moment gave Lucky enough time to put on the Florida Domain's uniform, which was a custom-made suit, shirt, and pants, tailored for him.\nThe overlord directly charged at Lucky like a savage beast. He threw a straight right punch at him.\nLucky raised his guard like a boxer. Using his arm, he blocked the strike.\nBOOM!\nThe power of the system gauntlet pushed Lucky 10 meters backward after the impact. However, his arm and clothes were unharmed.\n\"What?!\" The overlord was in disbelief. His system boasted that the gauntlet boosted his attack power enough to kill any karmic sovereign, yet the copycat was unharmed.\nLucky glanced at the custom-made uniform and grinned. His opponent might have a weapon, but he had the strongest armor in his universe, aka Leo's flesh and blood.\n\"Enough messing around. You'll regret provoking me, woof!\"\n\"YOU DAMN HERETIC!!\"\nBoth wolves rushed at each other and exchanged punches. None of them bothered utilizing Qi or magic anymore as the fight became personal.\nCat, Taxi, and Ricardo sensed the opportunity. They sprinted and detoured around the two entities, fleeing toward the portal.\nBOOM\nSuddenly, an ugly green elf descended from the sky and blocked the exit. Rockhart returned and glared at the trio.\n\"You're not going anywhere!\"\nCat smacked her lips in disdain. She pulled out a new weapon, which Leo had given her before they entered the portal.\nIt was a resizable halberd that mad cows of the Cow Level used. Leo had also tampered with it a little.\n.\nRough Halberd of Anti-God\nThis halberd was mass-produced in a mysterious realm called 'Cow Level'. Its materials, aka deity's blood, and Big Dipper Gold, transform this rough halberd into a weapon, specifically designed to kill gods. No magic or spell can be cast when the user activates its power.\n.\nAlthough Cat didn't know what it could do, she had a feeling that it could be useful in this situation. She charged and swung her halberd at the pedophile deity.\nRockhart cackled and waved his hands, drawing magic circles. 16 magic circles appeared and covered his arms, enhancing his physical abilities.\nCat swung the halberd while Rockhart welcomed it by raising his arm to block it.\nCLANK!\nThe magic circles around his arms shattered upon impact. His right arm was sliced in half, and the halberd's dull blade sunk into Rockhart's chest.\n\"WHAT?! HOW?!\"\nRockhart was confused. He was a deity while Cat was just a fledgling immortal. By logic, Cat shouldn't be able to harm him at all.\nTaxi and Ricardo learned from the example. They ejected the same halberds from their spatial rings and rushed at the deity.\n\"DAMN YOU ALL!!\"\nRockhart grabbed Cat's halberd and tried to push it away. However, Cat reverted to her monster form while the halberd in her arms grew bigger. She used the enhanced physical power to press the halberd further.\nSWUA!\nThe giant halberd sliced Rockhart's torso in half!\n\"SMASH!!\" (NOW!)\n\"SMASH!!\" (I KNOW!)\nThe two horses dissected Rockhart's head and torso into a thousand pieces with their halberds!\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3!\"\nCat's long vine pierced into the stomach of Rockhart. She pulled out his physical dantian crystal and threw it into her mouth.\nCRUNCH\nShe chewed it in glee before she swallowed it. Then, she started stripping the corpse and began eating the flesh.\nMeanwhile, the soul of Rockhart was ejected from his dead body. A portion of his Qi in his dantian was transferred to his soul.\nHowever, as a deity's soul physique was inferior to a sage, an entity, or a karmic sovereign, he couldn't regenerate his physique like Eleanor or Dowbad. He became a vengeful ghost.\n\"YOU WENCH! I WAS TRYING TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE, SO I TOOK IT EASY ON YOU! I'LL SHOW YOU HOW A DEITY FIGHTS-\"\nBOOM\nThe ghost suddenly shattered and dispersed into sparkling dust as a rainbow laser beam flashed and punctured through Rockhart's soul.\nIn the sky, Leo carried the limbless elf queen on his shoulder. He scanned the battlefield below and found Lucky and Overlord Lucky entangled in a fistfight.\n\"Has the others escaped?\" Asked Leo.\nCat, Ricardo, and Taxi were relieved when they saw Leo.\n\"Meow <3\"\n\"Smash <3!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 268 Florida Man Allegedly Killed Stripper by Throwing Landmine on Her Dance Stage.\nChapter 268 – Florida Man Allegedly Killed Stripper by Throwing Landmine on Her Dance Stage.\nLeo stared at the fight between overlord Lucky and his subordinate. The two werewolves looked like heavyweight boxers duking it out.\nNo Qi, no magic, just pure manliness.\nLeo respected their choices. He glanced at the nearby green elves and lightly exuded his killing intent.\nThe immortal elves shrank back in fear. They also noticed the female divine elf on Leo's shoulder, but none of them dared to stop or call out Leo.\n\"You three, go home. You too, Cat! Stop eating random things around here and leave!\"\nCat was still busy eating Rockhart's corpse. She pouted at Leo.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow!\" (I haven't eaten enough yet!)\nLeo knew what she wanted. He ejected a chunk of raw mad cow's meat and threw it at her.\nCat's monster mouth was faster than a hungry dog's mouth. She caught it and chewed it in glee.\n\"You'll get more if you obediently return. Go home.\"\nCat repeatedly nodded. She transformed into a human while her mouth was still chewing the meat earlier.\nSeeing that the troublemaker chose to leave, Taxi and Ricardo nodded at Leo and followed after the dark dryad.\nAfter the liabilities were gone, Leo tossed Eleanor's limbless body on the ground and muttered an incantation of creation magic. He created a new magic spell – Soul Bind.\nSeven rainbow metal chains, made of karma water, bound Eleanor's body and latched her with the seven floating magic circles around her. They tightened the bind as if the chains wished to tear her body into pieces.\nLeo sat next to Eleanor to monitor her regeneration rate. While he observed Eleanor, he closed his eyes and returned his consciousness to the simulation mode.\n.\n.\nOn a grassland that Leo used as a battleground, a clone of Eleanor stood 300 meters away from Leo. Donned in a jewel crown and see-through dress, she seductively moved her hips and played with a wane in her hand in a sexual way.\nLeo gazed at the clone of Esen's mother. He let out a long sigh while he glanced at the clone's status.\n.\nName: Eleanor Sydin, the Transcendent\nRace: Divine Elf\nAge: 155,268\nCultivation Base: Transcendent Level 1\nSkills: Transcended Dao of True Immortality, Transcended Dao of Necromancy, Transcended Dao of Grand Curse, True Death Grand Magic\nSpecials: Divine Elf Bloodline, Grand Succubi Bloodline, Vampire Progenitor Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Divine Cane of Seven Virtues, Cursed Wane of Seven Sins\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nLeo miscalculated. Although Eleanor's current cultivation base reached the karmic sovereign stage, the system gave birth to a stronger version which became a huge issue. Because of her abnormal dao and cultivation strength, Leo kept losing to her.\nAs the clone had defeated Leo in the simulation mode so many times, she started to get cocky. She no longer proactively tried to defeat him after she was summoned. Instead, she teased him, tempting him with her bodily charm.\nThe clone slowly stripped her clothes, trinkets, and footwear. She shook her hips and touched various parts of her body.\nLeo was annoyed. Had the clone been Esen, he would have stripped naked and jumped her without hesitation. However, he was sane enough not to fall for a hag.\n'Should I lower the difficulty? But if I do, I can't copy her skills or materialize her personal weapon.'\nHe tried one more time. This time, Leo chose not to rely on any weapon, dao domain, or magic. He charged at Eleanor's clone head-on.\nEleanor giggled and tossed her weapons away. She opened her arms and allowed Leo to punch her.\nLeo closed the distance and reached a punching range. He threw a right hook toward Eleanor's face.\nTHUMP!\nSuddenly, Leo's heart clenched. His entire body was paralyzed for no reason.\nEleanor's eyes and her heart-shaped crotch tattoo glowed in pink light while she ogled Leo's manly physique. This wasn't her first time using the cursed wane of seven sins to bind Leo's soul. She gently stroked Leo's face and slowly stripped him.\nLeo knew what she was aiming for. This divine elf was not just a regular elf but a mixed succubus and vampire. Moreover, he once got bitten in various parts and lost all his blood before.\n\"Do you like my blood that much? Fine, I'll grant you something better!\"\nAs Leo understood that he would lose to the clone again, he chose to preserve his pride by self-detonating his body!\nBOOOOOM!\nLeo's flesh and blood radiated in rainbow light. A rainbow flame erupted, devouring the entire star system and Eleanor's clone with it.\nLeo's artificial soul ejected from his flesh. He mimicked Aslan's personal soul technique, regenerating his lost flesh and blood and restoring his fleshly body.\nRUMBLE\nThe destroyed planets also restored themselves. The grassland planet and the other neighboring stars looked brand new as if the fight had never happened.\nDING\n<Congratulations! You have defeated Eleanor Sydin's shadow at the maximum difficulty!>\n<If you defeat her 999 more times, you can learn one of her skills!>\n<If you defeat her 9,999 more times, you can manifest one of her personal weapons in reality!>\n\"…\"\nLeo landed on the grassland and pursed his lips. He managed to destroy Eleanor's soul by self-detonating. However, that wasn't the answer he was searching for.\nHe needed a better method to kill Eleanor. Destroying the entire planet to kill this woman was overkill.\nSuddenly, Leo had an epiphany. He thought of a partial destruction technique, which limited the blasting range. Testing his theory, Leo stretched his right arm and made it explode.\nBOOOOOM\nA massive mushroom cloud and a wide flame blast engulfed the entire planet. The star slowly cracked and was broken into pieces.\nRUMBLE\nAgain, the star repaired itself and became anew. Leo's arm, flesh, bone, and blood also regenerated.\n\"Still too strong. How about a finger…\"\nBOOOOM!\nThis time, a small nuke exploded. The blast consumed everything within 1,000 kilometers in diameter at first. However, the flame spread and consumed the entire planet in an hour, turning the entire planet into a new Sun.\nLeo stood in the sea of flame and gazed at his missing pinky finger. He deeply sighed.\n\"That's not it either. I can't detonate my flesh at all or the entire star will be destroyed. How about something smaller… such as a drop of my blood?\"\nThe experiment continued…\n.\n.\n10 minutes in the real world was equal to 10,000 minutes in the dantian universe. After seven days of experiment, Leo finished his preparation. He summoned Eleanor's clone to fight again.\nThe clone stopped playing around. She reinforced her clothes, wane, and cane with unknown pink miasma fog. Then, she glared into Leo's eyes.\nLeo flinched as he sensed something entering his brain. The next second, his physical brain melted into goo!\nLeo's soul was ejected from the body, but he didn't give up. He commanded his flesh and blood within the dying body with his Qi.\nThe melted brain reverted to a functioning brain once more. Leo's soul reentered the body and grumbled.\n\"Damn that mind attack again. That's kinda annoying.\"\nLeo stomped his feet and created a magic circle underneath his feet. He also poured karma water out of his skin pores.\nRainbow blood manifested from the circle. At the same time, transparent blood from Leo's body mixed with the magical blood, creating a new substance.\nEleanor's face changed. She kicked the ground and teleported 100 light years away from the planet.\nLeo finally confirmed his hypothesis. He burst into laughter and pursued the fleeing clone while bringing the mixed blood along.\n\"WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HONEY?! COME BACK HERE!\"\n.\n.\nAn hour passed since Lucky and Overlord Lucky exchanged fists. They took a step back and panted in exhaustion.\nThe overlord did everything he could, but he failed to crack the golem. Vice versa, Lucky did his best, but the overlord's regenerative power negated the accumulated damage on his body. In the end, both couldn't harm each other.\nOverlord Lucky finally smiled. He stood straight and extended his hand.\n\"Good fight. I'm Lucky of Fenrir Werewolf. What's your name, golem?\"\n\"Hmm, woof?\" Lucky was confused at first. But since the overlord showed his respect, he did the same. \"My name is also Lucky, woof! I'm one of the Florida Domain's Heavenly Kings, woof!\"\nThey shook hands and gazed at each other in the eyes. The overlord nodded in approval even though the copycat's name slightly offended him.\n\"I guess your creator used my blood essence to make you. Well, since you are my copy, won't you follow me and work for me? Our race welcomes you with open arms!\"\nLucky snickered and shook his head, \"No, thanks, woof! My place is very comfy, woof! I won't betray my master also, woof!\"\n\"…I see that you are faithful to your master. Is his name Florida Man?\"\n\"Yes. He's over there, woof.\"\nBoth werewolves turned and looked at Leo, who was still meditating next to Eleanor's limbless body.\nOverlord Lucky gave Leo a meaningful look. Although Leo looked defenseless, he chose not to provoke him. They might have a grudge against each other, but the overlord was not in the mood to exact his revenge.\nHe looked at the copycat and sized him up. Upon noticing the strange clothes on the golem, he bitterly smiled.\n\"Did Florida Man give you those treasures?\"\nLucky puffed his chest, \"Yes, woof! My master is very kind, woof!\"\n\"I envy you. I wish my master had half of your master's generosity.\"\n\"What do you mean, woof?\"\n\"…We're her slaves…Never mind.\" Overlord Lucky closed his eyes and deeply sighed. He patted the golem's shoulder, \"Cherish your master and your colleagues. I hope that you can replace me and become the new pillar of our race in the future.\"\n\"What do you mean, woof?\"\nThe overlord didn't answer. He faded away, leaving the entire planet.\n\"…\"\nLucky looked at the sky as he sensed the overlord's presence leaving this planet. He sensed a tinge of sadness in the overlord's voice.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Dowbad already put on his clothes and sat on the captain's seat. He gazed at the monitors, which broadcasted the movements of Overlord Lucky and Leo.\nSeeing that the overlord had retreated, Dowbad glanced at Eleanor who had become a captive.\n\"Heh. If you die, the DEZNUTS council's president seat will be empty. Since I'm also a karmic sovereign, I have the qualification to claim that! Thanks for driving your daughters away, idiot queen! Your throne will be mine!! OPERATORS, FOCUS ALL WEAPONS ON THAT PLANET! CONCENTRATE EVERYTHING ON THE QUEEN ELEANOR!! KILL HER AND ERASE THAT PLANET!!\"\nCubic motherships gradually transformed into cylinders. They rotated and condensed a massive black lightning ball, black fireball, and black karma water at the center.\nThe combination of three energies created a faint rainbow light. The motherships' modules and hulls cracked as they couldn't contain the rampaging energy anymore.\nOn the monitors of Dowbad's ship, the feed showed the capacity rate of 120%. The captain burst into laughter and ordered his men.\n\"FIRE AT WILL!! LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!! HAHAHAHAHAA!!\"\nAll cylinders unleashed faint rainbow beams toward the planet of green elves!",

      "content": "Chapter 269 Florida Man Constructs Space Shuttle, Sends Mother-in-Law to Space Without Return Instructions\nChapter 269 – Florida Man Constructs Space Shuttle, Sends Mother-in-Law to Space Without Return Instructions\nRUMBLE\nThe rays of faint rainbow light descended upon the green planet. They dispersed the ozone layers, atmosphere, and clouds instantly.\nLeo and Lucky sensed the beam's energy. They looked up and saw the oncoming rays of death.\nLucky's legs were frozen in shock. On the other hand, Leo bellowed and unleashed his time domain.\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nEverything turned dark. Amidst the darkness, the condensed heat of a death ray glowed in white light.\nThe tips of the death rays were 500 meters away from the ground. The emitting heat burned every atom of oxygen in the air and evaporated clouds. Fortunately, the chemical reaction paused because of Leo's time domain.\nLeo looked around and found several green elves caught on fire. None of them realized that they were about to be burnt alive.\nHe looked up and gazed at the source of these beams. Upon looking through the void, he found multiple warships and suspicious cylinders in space.\nUpon discovering the culprits, Leo smacked his lips.\n\"So, it was you. I shouldn't have let you escape.\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Dowbad realized that Leo relied on the space and time domain to stop the death rays. He broke free from the restraints and mocked Leo in his mind.\n'You fool! You could have let me kill Eleanor! Someone of your caliber could have escaped easily. Since you're foolish enough to activate your domain, you can die along with her and her planet!! After you die, I'll be the King of DEZNUTS and the Divine Elf!'\nDowbad summoned karma water swords from his palms. He laughed and swung his swords down, aiming at the empty air in front of him.\nCLANK\nThe swords hit an invisible object in front of him, creating a dimensional crack.\nThe crack was none other than Leo's domain energy. As long as Dowbad could destroy this, Leo would suffer internal injuries because of the domain destruction backlash. This was a common tactic of killing or defeating any deity, sage, or entity. Even karmic sovereigns weren't immune to this weakness.\nUnfortunately for Dowbad, the crack instantly mended and vanished.\n'Hmm?'\nDowbad was taken aback. He had used this method a thousand times in the past, and his attack always destroyed his opponents in one strike. This was the first time he failed to crush a domain.\n'If I can't destroy it in one hit, I can just repeatedly hit it!'\nDowbad tried again. Like a madman, he hacked the invisible wall in front of him.\nCLANK\nCLANK\nThe first few strikes damaged the dimensional wall at first. But after he hit it a few times, the domain grew stronger, resisting the attacks. It reached the point at which the domain repelled Dowbad's assault.\nBOOM\n\"WHAT?!\"\nDowbad's karma water swords shattered. Moreover, the time domain strengthened its power, paralyzing his arms and legs. In the blink of an eye, Dowbad was petrified by the power of time.\n.\n.\nOn the planet, Leo stared at the flagship and snorted. He patted the back of his left hand, which was wounded because of the damage inflicted by Dowbad.\nSeven shallow cuts were healed. In addition, Leo strengthened his physique with his Qi, which also enhanced his domain's durability and effectiveness.\nAfter making sure that Dowbad was stuck in the time domain, Leo walked toward Lucky and patted his head.\nThe wolf golem was freed from the time restraints. He looked around in confusion and turned to his master. He talked to Leo using a sound transmission technique as no sound medium could transmit his voice.\n\"What happened, woof? Oh, right. The time and space domain, woof.\"\n\"Help me something, doggy. Do you think you can bring people through the portal?\"\n\"Easy task, woof! Which elf fancy you, woof?\"\n\"Take as many as you can. Prioritize women, elders, and children. This planet might be destroyed soon.\"\n\"WOOF?!\"\nLucky looked up and found the frozen death rays from outer space. His expression turned dark.\n\"T-They're ruthless, woof! They resort to killing everybody here to kill you, woof!!\"\n\"Yeah. What a typical villain, right?\"\n\"B-But there are millions of people, woof.\"\n\"Take as many as you can. You have 35… no, less than 34 days to finish. Also, while you're at it, go fetch Kitten and Meowmeow. We need every hand we can get to evacuate the civilians. Oh, don't forget that once you go out, you can't return. Write something on a refugee's face as a message so that those guys can learn about the issue.\"\n\"OKAY, WOOF!\"\nThe evacuation mission started. Lucky grabbed the nearest green elf woman and threw her into the portal.\nLeo shifted his attention to another issue at hand. Because he spent too much time chatting with Lucky, Eleanor broke free from his time domain and regenerated her limbs. Fortunately, Leo's enhanced domain restricted her movement and Qi circulation.\nEleanor slowly tore the tapes off her face. She gasped for air while she glared at Leo.\n\"I'LL KILL YOU!\" She uttered a silent voice, but her expression and her mouth were enough for Leo to decipher the sentences.\nLeo silently walked toward Eleanor. He grabbed the back of her head and slammed her face to the ground. Transmitting his cold voice to her mind, Leo threatened her.\n\"Why don't you look carefully at what your friend has done? Here, let me help.\"\nPulling Eleanor's face out of the ground, Leo flipped her around and pushed her face against the frozen beam.\n\"Oh, right. The Bird Box meme…\"\nLeo recalled a great meme in the past. He pulled her closer and pried her eyes wide open.\n\"Feast your eyes with the deed of your subordinate! Do you think it's okay for you to launch a star-destroyer beam to a planet full of innocent lives?\"\n\"…\"\nEleanor stared at the light beam in the sky. Upon noticing the source of the beams, she stopped resisting.\nLeo slowly released Eleanor, but he kept on finger pressing at the back of her neck. A drop of his blood seeped out of his nail and glued on her skin.\nThat was Leo's last resort. With that bead of blood, Leo could detonate her soul and destroy this entire planet at will.\nAfter ensuring his safety, Leo threatened her.\n\"Let's get things straight. If you make any stupid move, I'll detonate your soul right here, right now. This entire planet can go kaboom along with you. I hope you won't do anything stupid. If you understand me, slowly nod. If you stay still or do something else I didn't ask, I'll kill you.\"\n\"…\"\nEleanor froze for a moment. Then, she slowly nodded.\n\"Good. Now, I'll start asking you questions. Let's get to know each other. Who are you?\"\n\"…I'm Eleanor Sydin, the Matriach of the Divine Elf and the Queen of DEZNUTS.\"\n\"Good.\"\nLeo asked a basic question first to decrease the tension and make Eleanor let down her guard. He continued asking.\n\"Did you try to kill my subordinates back there?\"\n\"…I only want your life.\"\n\"I see. What did I ever do to you? Why are you trying to kill me?\"\n\"You killed one of my concubines first. Also, you're invading one of my domains.\"\n\"Fair. Then, why did you kill your daughter, Esen?\"\n\"…\"\nEleanor slowly regained her Qi. She managed to fully recover from her injuries, but the bead of blood on her nape scared her. Her instinct screamed, warning her to remove it as soon as possible.\nHaving no choice, Eleanor played along with Leo and waited for her opportunity.\n\"Answer my question, queen,\" Leo warned Eleanor.\n\"…I forgot.\"\n\"Forgot? Is that an answer for someone who murdered your kin? If I were you, I would have plastered that memory into my brain forever. I would have even remembered how terrible it felt when someone I gave birth to gazed into my eyes and begged for help.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo's sarcasm sent a sharp pain to her heart. However, as Eleanor remembered why she gave birth to so many daughters, her guilty conscience vanished instantly. She snorted and belittled Leo.\n\"For us divine elves, sacrificing oneself for the sake of empire is an obligation! She died for the sake of the greater good!\"\n\"My ass! I heard from Esen. Her sister framed her something, and you expelled her to a godforsaken planet. Then, you killed her there and turned her into an undead!\"\n\"Oh. So, you knew.\"\n\"Of course, I know everything! Now, tell me! Why did you kill her?\"\nEleanor smirked. She slowly turned around and glanced at Leo, \"That's because she's a threat to me. She's too talented for her own good.\"\n\"…Are you really her mother?\" Leo narrowed his eyes. He couldn't believe that a mother could be this mad.\n\"All my children have the obligation to sacrifice everything for the sake of their mother. She is no exception. Unfortunately, a 7-year-old brat desired to take my throne. I had to nib the bud before other aristocrats and karmic sovereigns could use her to threaten my kingdom. It's a pity though. Had she been a good girl and listened to me, I could have let her soul die in peace.\"\nLeo was disgusted. He had no reason to talk to this evil mother anymore.\n\"Any last word?\"\n\"Hahaha! You can't kill me. If you kill me, all the remaining seven karmic sovereigns of this universe will hunt you down! Even the lurkers in the Fate Stadium will form an alliance against you!\"\n\"How so?\"\nEleanor boldly turned around and sneered at Leo. She swatted Leo's finger away from her face.\n\"Because I'm the only pillar of DEZNUTS council. Without me, this entire universe will be on fire. All entities, overlords, and karmic sovereigns will start plundering, ravaging, and monopolizing resources from every star in this universe. No star or planet will be safe anymore. No mortal can be born. No immortal can ascend. Gods will lose their followers. Sages will have no heaven to rule. All entities will fight each other to the last man for no reason! In the end, this universe will be full of corpses and ashes! NO STAR CAN EXIST WITHOUT ME!\"\n\"Good speech, but I don't buy it. I call your bluff.\"\n\"YOU!!\"\nEleanor screeched. Her eyes flashed as he reattempted to kill Leo by burning his brain from the inside.\nPA!\nLearning from the mistakes and failures in the simulation mode, Leo closed his eyes, preventing Eleanor's consciousness from entering his mind. He stretched his arm and seized her face. Kicking the ground, Leo dragged Eleanor to space while maintaining the time and space domain.\nBoth reappeared one light-year away from the planet. Leo turned around and gazed at a faraway planet where he came from. From the current location, the star was tinier than a grain of sand.\nEleanor resisted. She summoned lance spikes from her body, which hit Leo's face, arms, legs, chest, and crotch!\nPLOP\nBetraying Eleanor's expectation, all karma water weapons had no effect on him anymore!\nLeo reopened his eyes, revealing his cold murderous intent. Showing no mercy, he ordered the bead of blood on her nape to explode.\n\"FLORIDA MAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!!\" Eleanor sensed a crisis. She screamed with all her might.\nLeo scoffed and vanished, teleporting back to the planet before the time domain lost its power.\nBOOOOOOOOM\nA massive explosion devoured Eleanor's body and soul.\n.\n.\nUpon return, Leo reinforced the domain.\nThe beam descended by 200 meters while Leo had been away for a split second. Noticing how the beam almost hit the planet, Leo wiped the sweat on his face.\n\"That was close, dammit.\"\nLeo looked up and gazed into the outer space. Far, far away, where the light needed a year to travel and reach the planet, a massive explosion occurred.\nAlthough Leo could only see a brief flash, he confirmed that his blood bead detonated.\n'I hope that was enough to kill her. Well, next. I have to deal with this guy and the refugees. I have to hurry or do something… How should I deflect the beams? Should I partially accelerate the planet's rotation and orbit so that it moves out of the way? But that's gonna cost so much energy. Hmm…'\nLeo stared at the beams in the sky. He wondered what to do next.",

Nasa Baffled How He Got There.\nChapter 270 – Astronauts Discovered Intoxicated Florida Man on Space Station. Nasa Baffled How He Got There.\nLucky had been busy. He stripped female elves naked and wrote someone on their backs and chests. Then, he mercilessly threw them into the exit portal.\nMeowmeow and Kitten rushed into the portal after they had received Lucky's message. They rushed to Lucky's side and inquired about the situation. Upon learning the predicament, they helped Lucky transfer the elf civilians to their planet.\nLeo did nothing to contribute to the evacuation. He monitored the portal's timer.\nStrangely, even though Leo had been keeping the time and space domain active, the portal's timer continued ticking.\n<Remaining Time: 33 Days, 12 Hours, 47 Minutes…>\nThe time and space domain only sealed the time flow within the domain, but it was ineffective against the system's buildings and facilities. This warned Leo about the limit of his power.\n'System… Fate Stadium…'\nLeo thought of the time when the power of the Fate Stadium was down. At that time, his system stopped functioning, and he couldn't teleport home.\nCultivators, elves, overlords, or karmic sovereigns weren't a threat to Leo. However, the mysterious system and fate crystals gave him a sense of uncertainty. As the system's power seemed stronger than the power of a karmic sovereign, Leo was not sure if he could overcome someone with an overpowered system.\n'…System. Oh, right. Fate crystals. I haven't taken that woman's fate crystals or checked the quest yet. Is there even a quest in the first place?'\nReminded of the system and fate crystals, Leo checked his system log messages and the quest menu.\n.\n.\n<You have activated the mystic realm portal!>\n<A quest has been generated.>\n.\nPlanet DEZNUTS BMLB-49\nGoresaurus Race, a dominating beast species, once reigned this planet for 50,000 years until the High Elf Race from outer space invaded and occupied this land. It becomes one of 11 million colonies serving the high elves, divine elves, and the DEZNUTS council.\nCurrently, Vendettito Sugondese the Third acts as the governor of this colony. If you manage to kill him, you can steal this colony from the hands of high elves. Be warned. Vendettito is affiliated with another player. Attacking this domain will automatically declare war against that player. Think wisely if you wish to initiate this quest.\nPrimary Objectives:\n- Kill Vendettito Sugondese the Third. (Completed)\n- Eliminate the Player (Optional) (Completed)\nSecondary Objectives:\n– Locate and Collect Sky Fate Crystal Hidden in This Planet\nRewards:\nExploration Rewards: 100 Territory Expansion Tickets, Ownership of Planet DEZNUTS BMLB-49\nSecondary Rewards: 10 Lucky Draws (Automaton)\n.\nWithout paying attention to the quest, Leo already completed the primary objectives. The remaining task was to find an insignificant sky fate crystal somewhere in this world.\nLeo had no time for that. He closed the quest menu and continued reading the log.\n<You have killed Vendettito Sugondese the Third.>\n<You have collected two earth fate crystals.>\n<You have killed Eleanor Sydin, the Divine Elf Matriarch!>\nLeo let out a long sigh of relief as the system confirmed Eleanor's death. However, it didn't inform him about the rewards and the loot.\nHe smacked his lips and looked up. He planned to go back and get the fate crystals that Eleanor might have. He prayed that nobody would snatch fate crystals of Eleanor first.\nAlso, there was another issue. He had to destroy the warships in the orbit.\nPutting his plan into action, Leo teleported again. He appeared on top of a cylinder warship, which was firing a beam toward the planet. He glanced at the tip of the ray, which didn't move from the spot.\nLeo was relieved as his time-domain still kept everything frozen. Then, he began working, punching, and breaking the device and modules of the ship.\nThe cylinder ship broke in half with one punch. Its aiming trajectory shifted, but the released beam didn't follow after the barrel.\n\"I can't move the beams this way. Well, I'll start by killing these guys in the spaceships first. Wait, wouldn't it be more profitable if I kill everybody here and steal their ships? Man, I'm a genius!\"\nLeo cackled and whipped out a pen he bought. With a drop of Qi injection, it transformed into a lightsaber hilt and generated a plasma sword.\nHe coated his rainbow Qi around the sword, enhancing its property. Then, he swung it toward the space, unleashing a sword technique of death knights.\nThis ability allowed a death knight or a grim reaper to cut or kill any soul within their domain directly without touching them. It was one of Leo's favorite powers because of its decisiveness and usefulness.\nAs Leo swung his sword, he sensed a feedback of his lightsaber sword cutting through souls. However, he also sensed that someone among the targets blocked the strike with ease.\nLeo narrowed his eyes and pinpointed the person. Then, he found Dowbad, who got stuck in his time domain.\n\"Aha! Next prey!\"\nLeo cackled. He wondered what fate crystals Dowbad had.\n.\nWhile Dowbad was stuck in the time domain, he was conscious of his surroundings. He sensed Leo's presence coming closer to his ship.\nWHOOSH\nSuddenly, another barrier overlapped with the time domain. It enveloped him and everybody on the ship. The next moment, he detected an invisible ripple of energy passing through his body.\n'Shit! Block it!'\nDowbad condensed his energy to protect his soul.\nThen…\nCLINK\nSomething powerful hit his soul, but it was unable to cut through the soul physique of a karmic sovereign. Although the technique belonged to someone in the deity or sage realm, the powerful strike was as strong as a full frontal attack of an entity or a karmic sovereign's raw power.\n'That was close! If I hadn't blocked that, my soul would have been cut in half!'\nDowbad mustered all his essence and life force. He even burnt half of his life force to break free from Leo's enhanced time domain.\nHe had to retreat. Otherwise, he might die!\n'I'll remember this!'\nAfraid of Leo's retaliation, Dowbad opened his system menu and navigated to the PVP page. He pressed the monthly PVP button, which teleported him to the Fate Stadium.\nA second later, Leo's second attack arrived. Unfortunately, it missed him.\n.\nLeo deeply frowned after he swung his lightsaber for the second time. He could no longer sense Dowbad's presence and life signature.\n\"…Is he gone? Man. That was lame.\"\nHe looked around, tracking the presence of Dowbad. However, the guy's karma strings and his Qi trace vanished along with him.\nUnable to locate Dowbad, Leo stopped searching for him. He shifted his attention to the unmanned warships in space.\n\"Time to clean up this place.\"\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nDowbad emerged in the middle of the stadium arena. He looked around and discovered that the system matched him against another system user.\nThe elf stood up and gazed at his opponent. Coincidentally, his opponent was also an elf, and she was also a karmic sovereign.\nShe was none other than Ellen. The princess sneered at Dowbad as she recognized the guy.\n\"You look exhausted. Did you use the PVP system to escape?\"\n\"Y-You… YOUR HIGHNESS ELLEN?!\"\nEllen sneered and sized up Dowbad. As the guy appeared here naked, it was easy to guess the predicament that Dowbad had faced earlier.\nDowbad was one of Eleanor's subordinates, and he never left her side. His arrival only implied one thing – Eleanor fought someone and they lost!\nEllen cackled and summoned her scythe. She mocked Dowbad, \"Has my mother died, 'DOWN BAD'? Did my mother fight someone and lose?\"\n\"Y-You don't need to know!\"\n\"But I insist. You will tell me everything once I capture your soul!\"\n\"Y-YOU INGRATE WENCH!\"\nThe PVP match between Dowbad and Ellen began. The divine elf princess's laughter echoed in the stadium, followed by a man's desperate squeal.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile…\nWHOOSH\nEster and her son were thrown into the portal along with women and elders in her neighborhood. Her consciousness was blank when she was under the influence of Leo's time domain. But when she arrived on the other side, she regained her consciousness and could move again.\nLeo's time domain could stop the time flow within his domain, but he couldn't stop the time of the universe. Thus, time flowed normally outside of Leo's domain.\nEster and a thousand elves beside her were confused. They gazed at the portal behind them and inspected the surroundings.\nWhile they were puzzled about how they appeared here, three naked female statues moved and stood before them.\nEster scanned their cultivation base and was shocked. She recognized their aura signatures - They were entities whose faces resembled famous fallen entities in the past!\n\"…Overlord Zhu Qiao… Overlord Wei Yuan… and Overlord Xu Chu?! But they're dead!! Mother already killed them all, but how?!\"\nThe three statues immediately shifted their gazes at Ester. One of them waved her finger and pulled Ester out of the crowd. Then, she stared into her eyes while her voice resounded in Ester's mind.\n\"Child of Eleanor, I assume.\"\n\"Y-Yes,\" Ester gulped.\n\"You are under arrest for fraudulence, false accusation, and treason!\"\n\"W-What?! What do you mean?\"\nEster flustered and panicked. Because of her high-pitched voice, her sleeping infant woke up and cried.\n\"WAAAAAAHH!!\"\nEster snapped back to her senses and checked her son's condition. Upon noticing that he was just scared, she was relieved.\nUnfortunately, the statues were merciless. They used their Qi to pull the infant away from the mother. Without remorse, they declared the punishment sentence.\n\"Until the lord has returned, you will be imprisoned in our dantian universe!\"\n\"W-WAIT! I HAVE A CHILD! DON'T TAKE AWAY MY CHILD!!\"\nAs Ester screamed, a group of elves and molgs arrived at the platform. The leading figure was a blond elf whose appearance was a copy of Eleanor.\nEsen immediately found the aura of her sister. Although she couldn't remember her face, Esen never forgot the life signature of someone who falsely accused her of heresy. She waved her hands and pulled Ester's child into her arms.\n\"It has been a while, bitch.\"\n\"W-Who are you?! GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD!! SOLDIERS! HELP ME!\"\nThe green elves had been watching their interaction for a while. As soon as they realized that one of them was being bullied, they took arms and prepared to fight.\nUnfortunately for them, one of the statues shifted her attention toward them. Then, as soon as her gaze fell upon them, the elves were petrified into stones.\nThe remaining crowd behind the rioters shrank back in fear. As none of them was a combatant, the statue didn't attack them.\nEsen sneered at Ester and pulled out a knife from her spatial ring. Then, she pointed at the baby.\n\"Well, well, well. How the turntable. Is he yours?\"\n\"Y-You. WHO ARE YOU?! RELEASE MY CHILD!\"\nEsen's eyes turned cold. She reminded her sister. \"Look at my face carefully. Who do you think I look like?\"\nEster widened her eyes and paid attention to Esen's face. She finally remembered.\n\"M-Mother, no. YOUR MAJESTY?!\"\n\"Wrong. It's your damn sister, bitch!\"\n\"ESEN?!\"\n\"Glad you finally remember. Now, take her out of my sight!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 271 Florida Man Claims Immortality Achieved After 33 Days of Sunbathing\nChapter 271 – Florida Man Claims Immortality Achieved After 33 Days of Sunbathing\nWhile the clock was ticking, Leo floated in space, staring at the frozen beams from the cylinder warships. 50 beams formed 50 pillars, threatening to punch through the planet below.\n\"Pushing the entire planet out of the way? But if I do that, the planet might go out of the orbit path. It will surely ruin the ecological system and the weather cycles. Also, I have never pushed a planet in my life. Even if I do it, I might end up digging the ground and find myself in the depths of the planet instead. No rock or natural soil can withstand that force. Hmm… What to do?\"\nEven though Leo was not the smartest, he racked his brain to find the best solution. He always thought of the worst-case scenarios and the aftermath whenever he came up with a solution.\nPushing a planet out of the beam's trajectory was impossible as the planet couldn't withstand such a kinetic force. Leo might end up destroying it instead.\nMoving the cylinder ships was also not an option. As the beams had already concentrated a mass of Qi and unleashed a beam, 50% of the energy was gathered at the tips of the death rays. In addition, the remaining force still followed the energy balls within the light, and they would hit the planet eventually.\nThen, there was a third option. Leo could deflect, block, or absorb the concentrated energy balls at the tips of death rays first. Then, he could lessen the damage to the planet and protect the innocent people of the planet.\n\"Probably third choice. It's gonna be a grind.\"\nLeo tested his theory. He flew toward one of the mass of energy balls at the tip of a beam. Then, he punched it.\nThe hit connected and caused a ripple. The energy ball slightly shrank and bounced backward, dispersing energy everywhere. Some of the light particles fell on Leo's arms and hands.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,243 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,271 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,214 years.>\n\"HMM?!\"\nLeo widened his eyes in astonishment. He couldn't believe what the system had informed him.\n\"I CAN GAIN LIFESPAN FROM THIS?!\"\nEnlightened, Leo moved around and bathed himself in the particles of light.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,227 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,206 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,279 years.>\nThe system did not disappoint him. This confirmed Leo's hypothesis.\nHe burst into laughter. \"Oh, my goodness. What a hack!!\"\nInstead of punching the condensed ball of light, Leo stretched his hand and sank his fingers into the mass.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,298 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,294 years.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,211 years.>\nThis changed everything. Leo changed his plan.\nHe threw himself into one of the masses and bathed himself in the light.\n\"NOM-NOM MOTHERHUMPER!!\"\nDING\nDING\nDING\n.\n.\nWhile carrying a hundred innocent elves with his Qi, Meowmeow looked up and gazed at his master.\n\"What is he doing?\" Asked Meowmeow.\nAslan was nearby. He had been pushing a cartwheel, carrying a dozen of children toward the portal. He followed Meowmeow's gaze and looked up.\n\"Nom-Noming, perhaps.\"\n\"Nom-Nom…what?\"\n\"Energy draining. The usual stuff.\"\n\"Has he learned the vampiric touch or energy drain dao before?\"\nAslan snickered, \"Read his memory again. He has already copied a bunch of daos and skills from many experts. Your lord is a hard worker.\"\n\"Copy… Right. The simulation system. That system is a cheat. I still couldn't believe that you got your hands on that entity fate crystal with this system.\"\n\"That's where you're wrong. Entity fate crystals never have that ability. At best, it can only give some assisting perks and quality-of-life perks in exchange for a portion of the karma contract or life force. What he has is the latter type.\"\nMeowmeow nodded as he was less informed than Aslan. He gazed at his master, wondering what Aslan had planned for his son.\n\"Say, Aslan. I know he's your son, but what are you planning for him? I can't read his fate at all after he has unlocked the simulation mode.\"\nAslan shrugged, \"Returning the favor, I guess.\"\n\"Returning the favor? Oh…\" Meowmeow's expression changed. He recalled the secret of Aslan and Leo's existence. \"In the end, we're a bunch of NPCs, huh?\"\n\"Yup. From the very beginning, this universe is tailored for him all along.\"\n\"You sick son of a…\" Meowmeow wanted to curse Aslan for this master plan. Still, he couldn't hate the guy.\n\"Let's keep serving him.\" Aslan raised his fist, \"For the universe and our future.\"\nMeowmeow sighed and fist-bumped the guy, \"For your son and my future harem.\"\n\"Screw you, sicko. One of these days, I'll reincarnate you into a body of a clone and wipe your memory!\"\n\"Hehehehe! I've already foreseen my distant future. I'll have over a hundred sexy concubines and a warm family! I'll live a good fulfilling life!\"\n\"Yeah, and you will suffer. Your son will suffer. Some of your wives will also die and suffer because of you.\"\n\"…\"\nMeowmeow shut his mouth and pouted. He snorted, \"I'll make sure to learn one of our lord's abilities for that day.\"\n\"Yeah, you will. I suggest you master this time domain ability. It will be useful for the future.\"\n\"I know. I also want that simulation mode too…\"\n\"… You greedy dumbass.\"\nThe men laughed and continued working.\n.\n33 days later…\nMeowmeow, Aslan, and Lucky managed to transfer five million elves to the other side. They also sent messages to Meowmeow's concubines and Esen, asking them to assist them in accommodating and controlling the refugees.\nEsen and Meowmeow's concubines exchanged messages by throwing letters into the portal as they couldn't leave yet. They learned about the development and the predicament of the refugees.\nUnfortunately, there were over 100 million elves on the planet. Leo's subordinates couldn't save everybody by themselves, though none of them cared.\nAfter all, they were confident in their lord's abilities.\nIn the orbit, Leo bathed in the middle of the 48th beam. He snored and floated there, absorbing the light and the Qi.\nDING\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,235 years. Your lifespan has reached the maximum capacity. The excess life force will be converted to lifespan credit.>\n<Your lifespan has increased by 1,255 years. Your lifespan has reached the maximum capacity. The excess life force will be converted to lifespan credit.>\nEvery second, a message informed Leo of his gain. The number of unread messages accumulated, but Leo no longer looked at it. He was tired of reading every message.\n\"KOK\"\nFinally, Leo's pig-like snoring ended. He rubbed his eyes and deeply yawned. Glancing at the message screen, Leo pressed the [Mark All as Read]. Then, he checked his bank balance.\n<Current lifespan: 2,147,483,647 Years.>\n<Your lifespan has reached the maximum capacity!>\n<Tips. You can upgrade your soul by using lifespan as a currency.>\n\"Eh? Already? This is kinda déjà vu.\"\nLeo had seen this number before. He felt like it was yesterday.",

He shed a tear of joy and elation.\n\"Finally, my lifespan reaches the cap. Well, since it has come to this, I might as well splurge some.\"\nLeo tried to open his gacha screen.\nDING\n<You cannot access the page due to the restrictions of the Shop Domain System.>\n\"…\"\nUnfortunately, the gacha system was tied to the shop domain system. Because of the restriction, he couldn't access it outside of his domain.\nWithout a choice, Leo checked something else. He recalled that the excess lifespan was stored as online shopping credits. Thus, he opened the online shopping system to see what he could buy from it.\n\"The system mentions the soul upgrade thingy. I think I saw it when I was on Earth, but I didn't buy any for a reason. What was its name again?\"\nLeo input a search keyword 'Soul Upgrade' into the search box and proceeded. The online shopping system projected a loading screen for a moment before it displayed a new page.\nThe number of items was filtered from zillions of icons to seven. Leo read the list one by one.\n.\nSoul Upgrade (LITE)\nMax Cultivation Base: Immortal\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 255 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: E\nPrice: 10 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Upgrade (LITE+)\nMax Cultivation Base: Deity\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 65,536 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: D\nPrice: Earth Fate Crystal + 200 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Awakening\nMax Cultivation Base: Sage\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 65,536 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: C\nEnable Dantian Universe\nDantian Universe Capacity: 65,536 Stars\nPrice: Sky Fate Crystal + 10,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Awakening Pro\nMax Cultivation Base: Entity\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 65,536 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: B\nEnable Dantian Universe\nEnable System Hints & Quests\nDantian Universe Capacity: 65,536 Stars\nPrice: Heaven Fate Crystal + 30,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Enlightenment\nMax Cultivation Base: Karmic Sovereign\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 2,147,483,647 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: A\nEnable Dantian Universe & Karma River Hosting\nEnable System Hints & Quests & System Shops\nDantian Universe Capacity: 4,294,967,296 Stars\nPrice: Heaven Fate Crystal + 50,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Enlightenment Pro\nMax Cultivation Base: Transcendent Level 10\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 2,147,483,647 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: S\nEnable Dantian Universe & Karma River & Soul Creations\nEnable System Hints & Quests & System Shops & Simulation Mode\nDantian Universe Capacity: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 Stars\nPrice: Entity Fate Crystal + 1,000,000,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Matrix\nMax Cultivation Base: Singularity Level 100\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: EXTRA\nEnable Dantian Universe & Karma River & Soul Creations\nEnable System Hints & Quests & System Shops & Simulation Mode\nDantian Universe Capacity: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 Stars\nPrice: Karmic Fate Crystal + 1,000,000,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nAside from the Soul Matrix's package, the rest of the items were greyed out and were marked as [PURCHASED].\nLeo tilted his head in confusion as he didn't remember buying any of these. A minute later after reading the description again, Leo remembered why he didn't pay attention to these upgrades.\n\"Right. At that time, I was grinding for the transmigration fee. Man, if I knew I could cultivate, I wouldn't have spent two billion years on something nonsense. It was a scam!\"\nLeo regretted spending two billion years to transmigrate to a cultivation world. He wished he learned some cultivation techniques by buying something from the system shop instead of wasting his precious YOL for something he could have easily achieved.\nAs refunding was impossible, Leo accepted the reality and looked at the price of the last item.\nKarmic Fate Crystal…\nThat was Leo's bottleneck. He only had entity fate crystals, but he never came across the elusive karmic fate crystals. He wondered where he could get it from.\nSince Leo could not buy it now, he could only admire the system screen and the PNG icon. He deeply sighed and lamented his fate for being poor.\n\"Fine. I can't expand my lifespan cap right now, but I still have credits. Oh, wait. Is there anything I can gift my people or Esen in here?\"\nLeo thought about gifting this perk to Esen as a wedding gift. He checked the other upgrades that the store listed as PURCHASED.\nTesting the system, Leo added one of the items to a cart and proceeded to the checkout screen.\nUnfortunately, there was no [PURCHASE AS GIFT] button. Leo deeply sighed in resignation.\n\"You stinky system. Can't I buy something for someone else? You could have made more money. What a lousy business model. You should learn it from STEAM or AMAZON!\"\nDING\n<Tips: You can purchase the GIFT SYSTEM from the Online Shopping System.>\n\"…\"\nLeo was taken aback by the sudden response. In silence, Leo searched the keywords and found the perk.\n.\nGift System\nPrice – 1 Year of Lifespan\nThis system allows you to gift or bestow a friend your lifespan, system abilities, system skills, system attributes, or anything related to the system. You can also purchase a system perk and gift it to your friend.\nPerk Description\nEnable [Purchase as Gift] in the Online Shopping System\nEnable [Bestow System]\n.\nThis system was almost free. In Leo's eyes, it cost nothing!\n\"Dammit! You should have told me earlier that you have this! I wouldn't have wasted so much time and energy if I had this perk!\"\nDING\n<Tips: The system will not provide aid or show favoritism toward any player. System Tips only appear when you truly need a piece of advice or assistance.>\n\"Yeah, screw you, system.\"\n<Tips: The system detects that you are most compatible with one of the most popular systems, the PP stretching system. Rumors said an entity invented this system to have anal intercourse with himself.>\n\"HEY!!\"\nLeo screamed in anger and punched the system screens. However, his punches only hit empty voids.\nDING\n<Tips: Only autistic players punch system screens. Please be advised that system screens are holograms. Be a human, not an autistic monkey.>\n\"DAMMIT! YOU SON OF A %##@!!\"\nLeo lost it for 10 minutes.\n.\nAfter regaining his composure, Leo purchased the gift system. Checking the new toy, a new system screen appeared.\nThe screen displayed three tabs – Lifespan Bestowal, System Skill Bestowal, and System Perk Bestowal.\nThe perks were simple. Leo could give away a skill or dao that he didn't need to one of his subordinates or friends. However, Leo would lose that ability afterward.\nFrom his point of view, gifting a skill to a subordinate was excessive. He could always exploit the library facility to create skill books and gift them instead. Only the system bestowal and lifespan bestowal were useful.\nIn the past, Leo could trade lifespan by using the shop domain system as a medium. But with the lifespan bestowal ability, he could use it outside of the domain.\nAlso, the system perk bestowal might be in handy. Testing the system's perk, Leo tried to purchase the 'Soul Enlightenment Pro' package so that he could gift it to Esen as a wedding gift.\nA [Purchase as Gift] button appeared in the shopping cart menu as Leo had predicted. He grinned and pressed on it.\nA list of his friends and subordinates appeared next. Leo scrolled down and found Esen's name. He ticked her name and pressed [Proceed].\nDING\n<Please be warned. One of your entity fate crystals will be consumed!>\n<Please be warned. Losing one of your entity fate crystals might deactivate some of your system abilities!>\n<Will you purchase [Soul Enlightenment Pro] as a gift to Esen Sydin IV?>\nIt sounded painful to lose one of the few entity fate crystals. Still, Leo wasn't worried.\nHe gazed toward the distance where he had killed Eleanor earlier. Although it was faint, he sensed several glowing crystals floating freely in the void.\n'I should get those first and use them to exchange. I can't afford to lose my power.'\nAfter thinking it through, Leo reinforced the time domain ability, focusing on the suspended beams of death rays. Leo also circulated his Qi and rubbed the alien ring to warm it up.\nHis blood boiled while his muscles expanded. When the preparation was ready, Leo instantaneously blinked, teleporting a light years' worth of distance. He pressed the alien ring on the massive crystal one after another and hurried back.\nWHOOSH\nIt took Leo 0.25 seconds to complete the sequences. He returned before the time domain was dispersed.\n\"HMM!\"\nLeo reinforced the time domain again. This time, the ray of death beams didn't move an inch.\nThe mission was a success.\nDING\n<You have acquired 2 entity fate crystals!>\n<You have acquired 3 heavenly fate crystals!>\n<You have acquired 15 sky fate crystals!>\n<You have acquired 54 earth fate crystals!>\nEleanor was rich. She had been collecting so many crystals that Leo was envious of her.\n\"Your mother is rich, girl. Well… WAS rich. They're mine now! HEHEHEHEHE!\"",

She looked at the boy's satisfied face as he was fast asleep.\n\"…I wish I had a kid like this,\" Esen was jealous of Ester.\n\"You definitely will. Lord Florida Man is a vigorous man. As long as you show him your charm at night, you will surely receive his blessings.\" Ivy giggled.\n\"N-No way! H-How can I have my own baby?!\"\n\"Don't worry, your majesty. You will bear a child one day.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen blushed. As soon as she thought of their sexy time at night, smoke came out of her ears.\nIvy couldn't resist laughing. She giggled and gently patted her master, \"It's okay, your majesty. It's a very normal reaction. Don't worry. It's something you will enjoy and cherish for a long time.\"\nEsen squealed in her throat and ended up making kettle noise in embarrassment. As her embarrassment reached the limit, she moaned.\n\"Stop bullying me.\"\n\"Hahaha. I'm so sorry, Your Majesty,\" Ivy changed the subject. \"So, what are you going to do with your sister and her child?\"\nEsen gazed at the child and sighed, \"Children are innocent. They are not a part of this. Only Ester will be punished.\"\n\"But this boy will miss his mother.\"\nEster had already been imprisoned in Wei Yuan, aka one of\n\"…If push comes to shove, I'll find him a new mother.\"\n\"That's a good choice. This child is still young. He hasn't even developed his brain yet. If we introduce him to a new mother soon, he won't suffer from any implication.\"\n\"…\"\nEsen pitied the boy. She only hoped that he would live a happy normal life.\n.\n.\nIt had been 33 days since Dowbad was sent to the Fate Stadium. He ran into Ellen in a PVP match.\nThe result was obvious – Ellen crippled him and imprisoned him in her dantian universe. She had been interrogating and extracting information about Eleanor's remaining forces and her hidden armies.\nAfter 33 days of interrogation, Ellen received enough info. She killed him and stole his entity fate crystal and heavenly fate crystals.\nAfter securing Dowbad's fate crystals, Ellen called over Overlord Milo and Simba.\nIn her office in the Fate Stadium, Ellen sat at a coffee desk. Simba and Milo stood still like modern soldiers, folding their arms behind their backs.\nEllen revealed her next scheme.\n\"The queen should have been dead by now. It's about time we return to DEZNUTS star cluster and reclaim the authority.\"\nOverlord Milo was concerned as Eleanor had many consorts. Among them, there were a few karmic sovereigns.\n\"Are you sure? Shouldn't we wait and let the local karmic sovereigns kill each other first? I'm sure they will tear each other apart to steal Eleanor's treasures and mineral stars. Some of them originated from her dantian universe. They contain her dao. None of them can resist those.\"\n\"That's the point, Milo. When they're busy fighting, we march straight to Deswal Solar System and kill every senator of DEZNUTS. Once they're down, the local soldiers will join our cause and the media will be in our hands. With the media, we can frame the karmic sovereign consorts and the senators for the death of Eleanor and gain the public's support. We can't reign and govern so many stars and zillion of the inhabitants without a good public image.\"\n\"…That's true. That's a good plan.\"\nEleanor shifted her gaze to Simba, whose dark expression didn't hide his stress and concerns.\n\"Are you worried about your family, Ohio Man?\" Inquired Ellen.\nSimba let out a short sigh. \"The battle took place on my home planet. I need to go back and bring my wife and my child here. Can I get your permission?\"\n\"No.\" Ellen was firm, \"Going there immediately is too dangerous. Eleanor was already defeated by someone called 'Florida Man.' We really need to gather more information about this person. Speaking of which, remember how you used to provide misleading information about this person to Milo? According to what we know, you and Florida Man come from similar backgrounds. It would make sense, logically, to imprison you for investigation, but we're choosing to keep you here with us as a way of showing leniency.\"\n\"…\"\nEllen leaned forward, giving Simba a meaningful look.\n\"Listen, Ohio Man. We value your tracking abilities. Prove your loyalty to me, and I'll do everything in my power to rescue and protect your family. In case something happens to them, we will mobilize every able man to avenge them. Stay put and don't do anything. If you disobey my order during this sensitive time, we will deem you as one of Florida Man's allies, and we will kill you, your wife, and your child without fail.\"\nSimba narrowed his eyes. His killing intent erupted, revealing his cultivation base of an entity.\n\"Even if you're a karmic sovereign, that doesn't mean I will bow my head to you all the time. If you dare harm my family, you can say goodbye to your precious race 'cause I will massacre every green, white, blond, and black elf in this universe! You can rule over the kingdom of ashes and corpses as you wish!\"\n\"Hehehehe.\" Ellen giggled and stood up. She coyly walked around Simba and revealed her cleavage, \"You're quite feral for an entity. Say, if Florida Man actually kills your wife and child, will you stop working as a mercenary and join my army? I kinda like a feral family man… and your black skin.\"\n\"…\"\nSimba clicked his tongue in frustration, yet he maintained his composure and discipline, not resisting Ellen's hand stroking on his chest.\nEllen licked her lips in a lewd way. Teasing Simba enough, Ellen pulled her hand away.\n\"You're authorized to use your ability to track the location of your wife and child. After you use it, tell me their current location.\"\nSimba was relieved. He opened his system, and a transparent blue screen appeared in front of him.\nEllen glanced at Simba. As she had more entity fate crystals in her soul, she could see the system screen in front of him. Using this opportunity, she stood next to him and peeked at the status screen.\nThe screen showed Simba's signature perk. He could search and find anybody's name and find their location.\nSimba's hands trembled in hesitation. He clenched his fist and input the name of his wife. Then, he pressed the [Search] button.\nDING\nInstantly, a map appeared, revealing the location of Ester.\nHowever, Ester's status was strange. The map only revealed the last known location, but it didn't show where she was in real-time. Also, the status detail made Simba's heart sink.\n.\nName: Ester Sydin\nStatus: Missing or Dead\nLast Known Location: Florida Domain, Yan Empire Planet\nLast Detected: 33 Days Ago",

The system shall upgrade her soul to be compatible with fate crystals and systems.>\n<After the upgrade is completed, the consumed entity fate crystal will merge with her soul and enable a random system.>\nThe deed was done. Leo spent 500 million years' worth of lifespan credit, which accumulated from the excess YOL and Qi.\n<Current Lifespan: 1,647,483,647 Years.>\nLeo laughed and sighed. No matter how many times he saw his bank balance, his heart palpitated with pride and joy. The sense of a rich man's happiness was overwhelming.\nContinuing his work, Leo focused on draining the remnant energy in the frozen beams. He had less than 24 hours to finish what he had started. Also, he hadn't looted the spaceships yet.\nThinking of the limited time, Leo sent a sound transmission to Meowmeow, Lucky, and Aslan.\n\"Stop migrating the local people. I think it's time to plan our retreat. Come help me loot the spaceships. If you have any big, and I mean BIG storage rings, help me bring the spaceships to our domain. I need those.\"\nUpon hearing Leo's instructions, Aslan on the ground looked up. He bitterly laughed and shook his head.\n\"What a greedy boy. Alright, this daddy will help.\"\nMeowmeow and Lucky gave Aslan a weird look. They also gave up on the dotting father. Instantly, they kicked the ground and stood on a different spaceship.\nThe guardian golems gazed at the cylinder ships and cubic motherships. They also wanted the sophisticated warship of the elves, but it was impossible to transport something bigger than the Sun to their world through the mystic realm portal.\nThe only way to bring them there was to pilot the entire fleet back home!\nAslan faintly smiled while he envisioned how he should pilot the fleet back. As for Meowmeow and Lucky, they were clueless on this part. Instead of taking the entire ships, both Meowmeow and Lucky infiltrated the warships and collected their armory.\nLeo observed how Aslan slipped into Eleanor's flagship and activated a weird dao domain. As he thought that Aslan was scavenging for loot, he left the guy alone.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen was still on the bus with Ivy. Suddenly, a system screen appeared in front of her.\nEsen didn't have enough time to look at the screen. An endless stream of energy came out from the screen and dove into her forehead, knocking her unconscious.\n\"Your Majesty?!\"\nIvy couldn't see the system screen or detect the energy. She rushed to support Esen and checked her pulse. However, nothing seemed unnatural.\nShe was confused.\nAs Ivy was helpless, she sought help from her peers. She went out to find Beatrice.\nBeatrice and Marc had been guiding the refugees to the south of the slum and arranging temporary shelters for the foreign elves. One of Meowmeow's concubines was also there to maintain order and suppress Vendettito's men.\nWhen Ivy informed them that Esen collapsed, Beatrice rushed to the bus, letting Marc handle the task by himself.\nWhen Ivy and Beatrice returned to the bus, they found Esen sitting on the bed, gazing at a wall in a daze.\n\"Your Majesty?\" Ivy sat next to Esen and rechecked her pulse.\nEverything was normal, except her Qi flow. Some strange meridians were open, and her Qi flow's speed and quantity were much superior to the past. As if clogged pipes were either replaced by brand new ones or cleaned, streams of Qi from her dantian filled her entire body.\nBecause of the improved Qi flow, her skin radiated a faint rainbow aura. It was not as intense as Leo's, but she had a similar air as him. Moreover, her yin Qi reverted to pure virgin yin, unblemished by Leo's virgin yang aura.\n\"H-How?\" Ivy was astonished.\nEsen turned to Ivy and Beatrice. She wryly smiled and pointed at the two system screens in front of her, which her subordinates couldn't see.\n\"I think geezer… I mean, my husband has just given me a big present.\"\nOne of the screens was a message log. As for the other, it revealed Esen's unique system.\n.\n<Your husband, Leonardo \"Florida Man' Ariel, has gifted you a Soul Enlightenment Pro package!>\n<Your cultivation aptitude has been upgraded from B to S tier.>\n<Your cultivation ceiling potential has been upgraded from Entity Realm to Transcendent Realm.>\n<Your max lifespan capacity has been increased to 2,147,483,647 years.>\n<Your max dantian universe capacity has been increased to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 Stars.\n<A new system has been implemented.

Synchronizing…>\n<Synchronizing completed!>\n<Congratulations. You are the only one in the universe with WORLD TREE SYSTEM!>\n.\nWorld Tree System\nIntroduction\nWorld Tree, a creation of nature admired and worshiped by all lifeform is a symbol of peace and prosperity in many cultures. A world tree is usually unique as it grows and adapts to the local climate and environment.\nIn legends, a great man once mated with a tree, which later gave birth to thousands of saplings. One of them became a world tree, which later gained the enlightenment of a dao and gave birth to this system.\nThe World Tree System offers you the ability to cultivate as many world trees as you can. Each tree grants the entire planet one or more boons, depending on its maturity and your desire. They can be used as weapons or the ultimate protector of life. If you are desperate for a partner, you can even transform them into a dream spouse of your choice!\nThe System\nThe World Tree System consists of a World Tree Shop, a World Tree Nurturing System, and World Tree Management.\nWorld Tree Shop provides saplings, which you can plant and cultivate on any planet. It can rapidly grow as long as you cultivate the tree with love and care. Further details can be viewed in the help menu.\nWorld Tree Nurturing System allows you to check your planted trees. You may view each tree's status and choose how you will grow them in the future.\nWorld Tree Management can be useful when you have multiple world trees cultivated on many planets. As traveling between planets can be troublesome, you can manage them with this menu and save your time. Unlike the nurturing system, you may delegate your matured world trees to work automatically by setting POLICIES, such as domesticate enhancement, wartime agricultural focus, or many other policies that you can explore.\n.\nThere were other details. It would take time for Esen to study her new system.\nEsen closed the screens and sighed. She thought of Leo and his aura.\n\"So, is this your secret, geezer? No… Leonardo?\"\nShe giggled as she finally discovered Leo's real name and surname. She wondered if she should change her surname to Ariel like Leo's.",

Please return to your world or you will be trapped in this realm.>\nAfter working so hard, Leo managed to digest all beams and reduced their effectiveness to a minimum. Still, they might change the landscape once the time resumed.\nLeo stopped working on them. He ordered his men.\n\"TIME TO BAIL, PEOPLE! LET'S GO HOME!\"\nMeowmeow and Lucky promptly left the motherships and returned with two massive jiggling backpacks of spatial rings. They presented the bags to Leo with a bright smile.\n\"There're so many railguns and weapons, woof! They also have good pills and herbs in the rings.\" Lucky reported.\nMeowmeow was also elated, \"I manage to extract and smelt some of their ship components and hull using my Qi. You should turn those into ingots and make our original spaceships soon.\"\nLeo was proud of his minions. He ordered them to bring the bags home.\nHowever, one person was missing. Leo looked around, but he couldn't find Aslan.\n\"Where's Kitten?\" Leo asked Meowmeow.\n\"That guy? Didn't he enter the flagship? He never comes out.\"\n\"Huh.\"\nLeo gazed at the flagship of Eleanor. It was located in the middle of the cube ships and cylinders.\nSensing Aslan's life signature from inside the ship, Leo sent a sound transmission to Aslan again in case he didn't hear it.\n\"Time to go home, Kitten! Stop fishing and come out!\"\n\"…\"\nDespite the second attempt, Aslan didn't respond.\nLeo was annoyed. He rushed toward the flagship and planned to drag the fisherman golem out. However, as soon as Leo got closer, the entire flagship broke free from Leo's time domain restrictions. Its engines hummed in the void and turned the ship around.\nLeo, Meowmeow, and Lucky were shocked. They brought out their weapons and got ready for combat. Then, they finally heard Aslan's voice.\n\"Stand down, master! Guys! I was busy hacking the ship! It's very difficult to program something in the time domain, you know?\"\nThe group was relieved. For a moment, they thought that Aslan encountered something terrible inside and died like unfortunate employees in a certain scraps-scavenging-on-alien-infested-moons-to-feed-eldritch-tentacles-and-meet-quota-to-survive company.\nThe sense of relief soon turned into shock when Aslan navigated the flagship around and vanished entirely.\n\"DAFUQ?!\"\n\"WOOF?!\"\nMeowmeow and Lucky widened their eyes in disbelief. Even though they shared a hive mind, both of them couldn't perceive what Aslan was doing.\nBoth golems tracked Aslan's location with their psychic link. Then, they discovered the general location of the runaway guy and were flabbergasted.\nThe guy was already directly on the Yan Empire Planet's orbit!\n\"M-Master,\" Meowmeow shivered in disbelief and shock \"Kitten has just…\"\nLucky finished Meowmeow's sentence, \"Kitten just piloted that ship home, woof!\"\nLeo calmly nodded as he hadn't paid attention to their report at first. A second later, Leo thought of it and turned to them.\n\"What did you say?\"\nLucky and Meowmeow dryly laughed, \"Kitten… has driven that ship home, master.\"\n\"And how the holy hell did he do that?!\"\n\"…We have no idea either.\"\n\"…\"\nHad Eleanor been there with them, she would have mocked them for treating Aslan as a regular minion as he was a top genius that she had acknowledged. Hacking a spaceship's mainframe and learning a ship's navigation method on the spot was a cakewalk to that guy.\n.\n.\nDreadnaught Flagship \"Matriarch\"\nThe dreadnaught was the state-of-the-art hybrid battleship and mothership, specially designed to accommodate Eleanor and her royal guards. It feathered an instant omnipresent drive engine, which allowed the entire ship to teleport anywhere in the universe as long as they had the right coordinate!\nFrom afar, the dreadnaught looked like a rain dragon in Chinese mythology armed with modern weaponry. A humongous saddle on its body carried two pearls on the sides while its back was equipped with a massive cannon. Its six arms wielded a sword, a spear, a shield, a pistol, and a rifle.\nThe round pearls in the saddle's bags were the residential crew cabins, cafeterias, and entertainment facilities. They were connected to the middle section, where the sensitive modules were located.\nThe saddle, however, concealed hidden airship hangers and spaceports for smaller ships. A million unmanned drones were parked inside, ready to be deployed at any moment. In addition, moon-sized battleships docked on the saddle, and they were glued to the dreadnaught.\nThe front and the back, however, were shaped into a face and a rain dragon's long neck. Its 2 billion kilometers length and 50 million kilometers diameter in size could freely move like a real dragon. The scales on the outer hull were the hidden anti-domain weapon ports, where countless guns and missile launchers were equipped to deal with smaller vessels around the dreadnaught.\nThe left bridge, which was situated inside the rain dragon's left eye, was the primary navigation bridge. On the captain's seat, Aslan let out a long sigh.\n\"Man, injecting my Qi into the entire ship was too taxing. Eh, it was my fault. I should have told him about my plan. Anyway, it's good to be back home with a real battleship. This one is too good to be left behind.\"\nAslan was proud of his work. Still, as the massive dreadnaught was larger than the Solar System's Sun, he parked it a light year away from the Yan Empire Planet's solar system. He also reprogrammed the mainframe AI to follow the star system and protect itself from aliens or random asteroids.\nProgramming a new AI was easy, but editing and auditing the codes was hell. It took Aslan a day to complete the task.\nRUMBLE\nThe dreadnaught no longer needed a pilot. The AI of the ship took over the reign and moved according to Aslan's wish.\n<Greetings, Sir Kitten! The weather is nice today! What should we do?>\nThe newly born AI happily treated Aslan as its master. He was also glad that the AI was easy to talk to.\n\"Station here and slowly follow this star system's trajectory course.\"\n<Affirmative. The current star system travels at the speed of 250km/s. I'll adjust my speed to match it.>\n\"Good. I'll be leaving you for a while. Behave and wait until I return, okay?\"\n<Affirmative. Have a good day, Father.>\n\"…\"\nAslan scratched his cheek in embarrassment. He thought to himself.\n'Sorry, Leo. I guess you have a little brother now. Well, I should add a little detail to the AI later.'",

The gate will close in five minutes.>\nMeowmeow and Lucky brought their war trophies to the other side. Leo also undid his time domain.\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nTime resumed. Remnant light beams flashed and vanished. However, some death rays that Leo hadn't fully digested continued traveling and hit the surface of the planet.\nSmall bombs erupted. Several mushroom clouds shot up to the sky and evaporated everything on the 1,000km diameter. Lands turned into either lakes or seas while many lives, whom Meowmeow, Lucky, and Aslan failed to migrate, perished in the bombardment.\nLeo watched the small beams destroy the geography and nature. He deeply sighed as his guilty conscience reminded him that he was somewhat responsible for this massacre.\nHe clapped his hands like a Japanese praying. Then, he closed his eyes.\nThe souls of the dead left the planet and flew toward Leo. They were small sparkling light balls, containing no emotion. Even though some of them were immortals, the devastation power of the beams was enough to erase their entire memory and cultivation base.\n'Don't worry. I'll take you in and let you live in a better place. Please don't mind your new appearance of alligators. I only have those right now, but I promise to create a better lifeform.'\nLeo drew the souls into his dantian universe's karma river. Several million souls entered Leo's karma river and joined the queue. Soon, they would be reincarnated as alligators in Leo's universe.\nAfter collecting all the souls of the victims, Leo parted this planet. Even if he couldn't finish the secondary quest, the haul was enough to make up for the loss.\nDING\n<You have completed the second mystic realm exploration.>\n<You have completed the quest! You have obtained 100 Territory Expansion Tickets!>\n<You have become the owner of DEZNUTS BMLB-49 Planet. You may assign a governor and impose taxes from this planet.>\nAfter leaving the portal, the main gate behind Leo was closed. However, a new permanent portal was erected, and Leo could return to the previous planet at any time.\nLeo stared at the portal and pondered. He glanced at Lucky and Meowmeow, who were about to resume their roles as guardian statues.\n\"You there. Go back in there and continue looting. There are more treasures, right?\"\nMeowmeow and Lucky's faces twitched. They wanted to take a break.\n\"Can we rest for a day or two, woof?\"\n\"No. Go back and get as many treasures as you can. Oh, right. Where is that bastard Kitten?\"\nMeowmeow pointed into the void. A light year away in the darkness, a dreadnaught of Eleanor parked behind the belt of asteroids. However, Aslan was still busy with something.\nAfter pinpointing the fisherman golem, Leo smacked his lips. He shook his head.\n\"Forget it. Meowmeow, you help me send those refugees back home. I don't want them here.\"\n\"…\"\nMeowmeow would have vomited blood had he possessed flesh and human organs. He lowered his head and followed Leo's instructions.\n.\nAfter sending the lazy statues off to work, Leo flew around his domain to inspect the land. He prayed that no elf caused trouble here.\nWhile flying, Leo spotted Taxi and Ricardo's subordinates everywhere in the domain. They patrolled in pairs, walking in their humanoid form. They also carried the new rifles of Leo's domain and wore the suit uniform.\nIn addition, Esen's people gathered in two groups. One guarded the front of Leo's shopping mall while the other unit gathered south of the slum area.\nLeo found Marc in the slum. He wondered what he was doing over there by himself.\n\"Marc?\"\nMarc turned around and found Leo in the sky. He waved his hand in delight.\n\"My lord! You're back!\"\nLeo looked around and found the refugee camp of green elves. All of them glared at Leo, Marc, and patrolling molgs with hatred. Fortunately, as most of them were women and children, none of them chose violence in this situation.\nAfter landing, Leo questioned Marc, \"How are the refugees? Did they cause trouble?\"\n\"Some do, actually. We've already killed 500 rioters today. Ten of the molgs are sent to the temporary infirmary in the shopping mall. Also, we asked Lady Qiang Qiang to pacify the third refugee camp, but they keep calling us traitors even though we are helping them.\"\n\"Did you explain the situation?\"\nLeo referred to the general situation of their planet. As Meowmeow and others had sent many messages through the portal, Leo believed that Marc and others should have learned about the predicament.\n\"We did, but they didn't listen. Only after their ringleaders were killed, did they follow our instructions. But as you see, my lord. They're wary of us, and they are prone to riot.\"\nLeo gazed at the green elves in the camp. Some of them held their children dearly while they glared at Leo and Marc in resentment.\n\"Yeah, this is war,\" Leo lamented. \"I also didn't want this, but I did my best.\"\n\"I know, my lord. They would have died if you hadn't helped them. What a bunch of ingrates!\"\nAs if the elves could hear their conversation, one of the elf women yelled at Leo and Marc.\n\"HELP MY ASS! YOU ABDUCT US HERE! BRING US HOME, YOU TRAITOR MOLG!!\"\nAs soon as the first woman showed courage, the others berated Leo.\n\"I know what you ugly men are trying to do! You think we will cooperate if you threaten us?! You Molg and that NU'EARTHE can go suck dicks!\"\n\"Even if you force yourself on us, we will tear your balls and feed it to a Fenrir!\"\n\"Just you wait! The queen Eleanor will find you and destroy this world! You and your family will be hunted down like a dog!\"\n\"Don't get cocky because you capture us! Lord Vendettito will come and rescue us! You traitors are nothing!\"\nListening to the girls, Leo's mouth got itchy. He wanted to tell them that Vendettito and Eleanor were long dead, but he doubted they would believe him.\nSince they were so prideful, Leo chose a slightly violent method to control the crowd.\n\"Let's introduce them to a gas chamber.\"\n\"Gas chamber?\" Marc tilted his head in confusion.\nLeo wickedly grinned, \"They're gonna learn why they shouldn't insult artists, especially Austrian artists and Floridian Artists.\"\n\"???\"",

Marc glared at the women in annoyance and pulled out a bastard sword to threaten them.\n\"SILENCE, YOU INGRATES! YOU ARE INSULTING THE LORD!\"\n\"Ha! The lord? More like the toad lord! He's uglier than a tapeworm! I pity his wife and his family. I bet they are crying in regret that they marry-\"\nWHOOSH!\nMarc was ruthless. With a swing of his sword, he crushed the ground in front of the woman. The sword cut her dress and left a shallow cut on her body.\nThe woman was petrified. She slowly looked down and found a straight line of a shallow wound on her chest and stomach.\n\"EEEEEEKKK!!\"\nShe squealed in fright. The courage from before vanished like smoke as she ran away from Marc.\nMarc snorted and pulled his sword back. He then turned to the others.\n\"Too bad, I missed! Does anybody else want to bad-mouth my lord? Next time, I won't miss.\"\n\"…\"\nThe crowd backed away. Although they were scared out of their wits, some of them still glared at Marc in resentment.\n\"LISTEN UP!\" Marc seized this opportunity to pacify the crowd, \"The lord has promised that he will send you home as long as you behave yourself! We are finalizing the preparation at the moment! As long as you don't resist, we won't do anything harmful to you!\"\n\"BUTTSHIT!\" A woman in the back of the crowd suddenly yelled.\nMarc turned around. He activated a dullahan's ability and summoned a skeleton horse.\nA deity-realm skeleton horse manifested behind the woman. Its red eyes gleamed as it exhaled foul air on the woman's neck.\nThe elf woman slowly turned around and found the ghost horse. She shrieked in fright and collapsed on her butt. The ground and her skirt were soon stained by warm yellowish liquid.\nMarc snorted and recalled his summon. He continued pacifying the refugees.\n\"Again, we have no intention to harm you as long as everybody is cooperative. By tomorrow if no mishap occurs, we should be able to bring you home!\"\nAs soon as Marc revealed a rough schedule, the elf women were overjoyed. Their dark expressions brightened.\nStill, managing selfish elves wasn't a simple task. A few seconds later, an elf woman carrying a young girl rushed out of the crowd to see Marc.\n\"Sir, my child is sick. We need the local medicine from my home. Can we leave first?\"\nThe boy seemed to be only one or two years old. Marc looked at the boy and inspected him with his Qi.\nHowever, there was no illness or anomaly in the boy's body. The child also looked healthy and cheerful as he smiled at Marc.\nMarc frowned. He knew that the mother was lying. Even though it was a reasonable demand, allowing an exception might disrupt the order.\nTo deal with this woman, Marc came up with a trick.\n\"I'll treat the boy. Give him here.\"\nThe woman faltered, \"N-No. He really needs the herbs at my house!\"\n\"What's the name of the herb?\"\n\"I-I-I-Immortal grass! Yes, an immortal grass!\"\n\"…Wait here.\"\nMarc snapped his fingers and resummoned his skeleton horse. It galloped to the shopping mall. A few seconds later, it returned with a bundle of immortal grasses in its mouth.\nHe retrieved the grasses and showed them to the woman.\n\"Here, the immortal grasses. How many stalks do you need?\"\n\"E-Eh?\"\nMarc gave the woman a meaningful look, \"Take one of the immortal grass's blades and shut your mouth, you liar. Don't make me stuff this entire stalk to your son's mouth. Leave while I'm in a good mood.\"\n\"I-I-I'm sorry!!\"\nMarc shoved one of the grasses into the woman's hands. She gulped and deeply bowed at Marc, then she brought her son along and ran away into the crowd.\nMarc snorted and put the grasses in his storage ring. He then turned to the refugees.\n\"Anybody else wants to cause trouble?!\"\n\"…\"\nFinally, no one caused another commotion. Still, the appearance of immortal grasses stunned the elf women.\nTheir planet belonged to a deity realm, which limited the accessibility to deities, immortals, and mortals. Anybody with a higher cultivation base was forced to suppress their strength to the deity realm before they could enter, though Vendettito and Rockhart were an exception due to their statuses as governors of the world.\nBecause their world supported deities, their natural resources improved. Spirit herbs, grasses, and trees sometimes blessed them with rare flowers and fruits, which became important cultivation resources for the local population.\nHowever, immortal grasses, such as the ones that Marc had brought, were common. They existed, but Vendettito and high-ranked deities monopolized them.\nSeeing how Marc handed the grass to a cunning woman that easily, their greed and desire were ignited. One of them ripped her skirt and blouse, revealing a lot of her skin. Then, she coyly walked toward Marc.\n\"Erm, sir. I'm wondering… what can I do to exchange for the immortal grasses?\"\nMarc snorted and told her the truth. He pointed at the shopping mall.\n\"You see that?\"\n\"Umm, yes.\" The woman looked at the shopping mall building from afar.\n\"That place sells one blade of immortal grass for 10 years of lifespan each. However, we only trade with literate people, not hoodlums or whores! Unless you join us, we will not trade with you!\"\nThe woman was taken aback. The astonished crowd was shocked as well.\nStill, she didn't give up, \"S-Sir. What about the grasses that you have? C-Can I buy that with my lifespan… or my body?\"\nMarc glanced at the cleavage and gulped. However, he soon compared the green elf's face with his elder sister's face, he was instantly disillusioned and regained his composure.\n\"I'm not interested in green elves. I'm a molg. I can only marry a molg! Now, go back to your camp and behave!\"\nThe woman was offended, but she pushed her luck. She knelt and hugged Marc and whispered, \"Please, mercy, my lord. I'll do anything. I-I don't mind if you do…\"\nMarc flinched as he had never hugged a woman before. Facing such an aggressive approach, he faltered.\nWhile Marc was at a loss, Leo returned and found them hugging. He put on gloves and coldly peeled the woman from Mark, grabbing her clothes. As Leo didn't control his strength, he ended up tearing her clothes.\nAfter yanking the greedy woman away from an innocent Dullahan, Leo showed the green elves a Tupperware box, containing a piece of Sweet Dream Mushroom.\n\"Sorry to cuck you, bitch. Now, listen!\" Leo levitated and showed them the mushroom. \"Back to the main topic, let me introduce you to a gas chamber… made of these mushrooms! You know what they can do, right?\"\n\"T-That…\"\nMarc and the refugees were stunned. Some of them screamed in desperation and fear.\n\"Sweet dream mushrooms! NOOOOO!!\"\n\"NOT THAT MUSHROOMS!\"\n\"PLEASE NO!!\"\nThe threat worked like magic. The refugees scattered in every direction.\nLeo and Marc stood there and looked at each other. They widely grinned as they managed to disperse the mob.\n\"Say, my lord.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"How are we going to round them back to the camp? You've just scared them away.\"\n\"Meh, they will gather. Just publish a gathering point for those who want to go home. They will show up. But if they want to stay, they have to follow our rules.\"\n\"…That might not be simple. They might cause trouble.\"\n\"So do the local cultivators. What's the difference?\"\n\"…You're right.\"\nLeo and Marc continued staying there as they discussed a method to bring them home tomorrow.",

Because of the massive crowd, some of them stood in the middle of the southern farm.\nBecause they stood in the middle of the farms, they could see the crops clearly. When the cabbages, potatoes, and oranges matured, the girls gleefully stole them.\nThough most of them were ignorant of the vegetable's effects, a few of them were literate. The girl who tempted Marc yesterday pulled a massive potato from the ground. When it came out, the crowd was stunned once again.\n\"It's huge!\"\nMany green elves were vegetarians. When they saw a huge crop, they drooled as they also wanted to grow one in their home world.\n\"MINE!\" Shamelessly, a young elf girl touched the potato and stored it in her storage ring.\n\"Hey! That's mine!\"\n\"First come, first serve!\"\n\"You…\"\nSimilar commotions occurred as more elves ransacked the farms to steal crops. They ignored the local workers and farming mannequins in the area.\nAs most elves were immortals, the young workers didn't dare to stop them. As for the farm mannequins, they stood still, waiting for their master's permission.\nLeo stood on the rooftop of his shopping mall, observing the chaotic crowd. He let out a long sigh as these elf women were too rowdy and unorganized.\n'I shouldn't have saved them. Oh, well. Whatever.'\nThe faster they are gone, the better. Leo coughed and amplified his voice.\n\"We will now guide you home. I want you to form two lines and walk along the road toward the west! Follow after the boy with white hair and he will send you home!\"\nThe unorganized crowd cheered and ran along the road toward the west. As they ignored lines and order, elves with a stronger cultivation base soon pushed a weaker elf to the ground. The following women never spent a second to help or look at the victim. Instead, they started stepping on each other to go home first.\nFortunately, everybody was an immortal. Even though they were stepped on, their physiques could take some punishment. Some of them crawled out of the road with difficulty, but they were internally injured.\nMarc, who was the designated guide, gave up on these selfish elves. He glanced at Leo on the rooftop and spoke to him via telepathy.\n\"My lord, can we kill them all?\"\nLeo smirked, \"Be patient, young Padawan. Just fly and tell them to follow you. Bring them to the flying island and point at the right portal. Make sure not to block the entrance to the agriculture realm and Orlando.\"\n\"What if they enter the cow level, my lord?\"\n\"If they're that stupid, then they can enjoy their bonus stage.\"\n\"…You're cruel, my lord.\"\n\"I'm a benevolent lord, but I can't save stupid people.\"\n.\nMarc guided the elves to the platform as instructed. But as Leo had predicted, they fought to enter the portal to their world first.\nMeowmeow and Lucky stood directly in front of Orlando's portal and Agriculture Realm's portal. Because of their presence, the elves avoided them. However, the portal to the cow level was unprotected.\nA small portal to the elf world was narrow. Only one or two people could enter at a time. But when a crowd of millions of elves rushed to the portal, nobody could move.\nEverybody soon got stuck on the platform. They fought, scratched, and bit each other to get ahead. Still, the lucky ones managed to enter the portal in one piece.\nSeveral elves levitated and observed the situation from above. When they noticed how unorganized the crowd was, they returned to the refugee camp and waited patiently.\nUnfortunately, not everybody was that smart. They soon noticed the portals behind Lucky and Meowmeow. One of them was pushed outside, forcing her to stumble and fall next to Meowmeow.\nThe black-winged angel sized up the female elf. She secretly ogled her bosom and helped her up.\n\"Are you okay, ma'am?\"\nThe elf kept sneaking glances at the portal to the agriculture world, \"C-Can I use the portal behind you?\"\nMeowmeow shook his head, \"That is not the right portal. It leads to a dangerous world. If you go in there, you might die.\"\n\"O-Oh. T-Thank you for your advice, sir.\"\n\"You're very polite. Say, are you single?\"\n\"Umm, yes. Why do you ask?\"\nMeowmeow stroked his chin. He leaned closer to the maiden and whispered.\n\"I like you. Wanna stay here and be my concubine? I'm an entity. I can help you cultivate… or dual cultivate with you. I'm also one of the four heavenly kings under this domain's lord.\"\n\"…\"\nThe woman widened her eyes in astonishment. She wanted to decline right away.\nHowever, Meowmeow suddenly transformed into a humanoid angel. The handsome angel's face and his perfectly toned body were more attractive than male elves, causing the elf girl to be star-struck and speechless.\nMeowmeow seized this opportunity and pulled her into a hug. He glanced at one of his concubines and ordered her.\n\"Stand in my place. Don't let anybody in.\"\nOne of the concubines \"Wei Yuan\" nodded and positioned herself in front of the portal.\nAfter Wei Yuan got in position, Meowmeow dragged the elf woman into the agriculture world in glee. Without her consent, he made that girl his fifth concubine.\n30 minutes into the chaos, Meowmeow and the elf woman came out of the portal. The girl was still in a daze, intoxicated by Meowmeow's hidden abilities.\nMeowmeow whispered, \"I will ask my lord for permission. You may reside here with us. Oh, you can stay in the agriculture world for the time being.\"\nThe elf blushed and nodded. She turned around and vanished into the portal behind Wei Yuan.\nWei Yuan dully stared at her unfaithful husband. She deeply sighed and secretly complained to him.\n\"How many more do you need?\"\nMeowmeow giggled, \"Lots.\"\n\"Define 'Lots'.\"\n\"Until I have enough wife to consummate for 1,000 years without rest. You girls get tired too easily. I can't even warm up.\"\n\"…Pervert.\"\n\"Thanks!\"\nTheir interaction didn't escape the eyes of the nearby women. Some of them saw the face of Meowmeow and had the same reaction as the lucky girl.\nOne of the courageous women approached Meowmeow. She boldly took off her blouse, revealing her skin.\n\"C-Can I…?\"\nMeowmeow laughed and patted the elf's head. \"Of course. Elf women are beautiful by nature. If I refine you, you will be even prettier! Come with me. Let me show you what real HEAVEN is.\"\n\"Hehehe. Okay.\"\nAgain, Meowmeow guided another prey to the agriculture world. Half an hour later, only Meowmeow exited the portal. However, as the black-winged angel was a pervert by nature, he only wore a towel when he came out.\nMany angry women in the crowd stopped thinking when they saw Meowmeow's handsome face and firm abs. When they met his eyes, their legs guided them to him.\nWei Yuan sighed and opened the way for the girls. Meowmeow politely gestured, guiding them to his love nest. Because of his action, a strange queue was formed in the middle of the chaotic crowd.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo had been watching Meowmeow's interaction with the crowd. He facepalmed.\n\"I can't believe women fell for a freaking statue. What the hell is wrong with their taste in men?! Is it because the THING is ROCK HARD?!\"",

They stared at the portals behind other statue golems.\nOne of them checked the portal to Orlando, but Lucky barked at her. The girl stumbled and backed away from the doge. The others also respected the guard dogs and kept their distance.\nHowever, the other gate was unprotected. The cow level's portal was so alluring that one of the elves decided to take a peak.\nAs the portal to the cow level was near the agriculture realm portal, Wei Yuan glanced at the daredevil girl and warned her.\n\"That place is not your home. Go back to the line.\"\nThe elf didn't believe in Wei Yuan. She spat at her feet and vanished into the cow level.\nShe never returned.\nAn hour later after the first elf entered the portal, another silly elf tried her luck. Again, Wei Yuan warned the ignorant elf.\n\"That is not the way to the elf world. It's full of monsters. Do not enter.\"\n\"Ha! I'm not an immortal. I'm a deity! I'm not afraid of monsters!\"\nThe cocky deity elf burst into laughter and entered the cow level.\n.\n.\nIn the cow-level world, the sky was dark red as usual. No monster or traces of combat was in sight.\nThe deity elf pursed her lips and sneered. As she was experienced in space traveling, she flew to the void without hesitation.\n\"Foolish Nu'Earthe! I'm not na?ve! Even if it's not the right portal, I can fly my way through the void! I'm outta here!\"\nThe elf kept flying upward at 90 degrees. She broke through the red clouds in the sky and reached the atmosphere. Everything looked normal like she had experienced in the past.\nHowever, when she reached 50,000km altitude, her face hit a transparent wall.\nThe girl covered her face in pain. She looked up in frustration.\n\"Tsk! A barrier? For what?\"\nShe reattempted to break the barrier with her fist and kick.\nDONG\nDONG\nEvery time she hit the barrier, it generated a weird bell noise. The sound vibrated and echoed everywhere at the cow level.\nMOOOOOOOOO!!\nIn response, countless mad cows on this planet bellowed in rage. Some of them flew to the sky.\nThe elf woman turned around and found countless humanoid cow monsters, wielding giant halberds. Some of them even had crow wings on their backs.\n\"SHIT!\"\nThe elf gathered more strength and punched the barrier. However, it didn't budge.\n\"DAMMIT!! MOVE!\"\nFive seconds, ten seconds, 30 seconds, the elf repeatedly punched the invisible wall that prevented her from going to the void. She started crying in despair.\nMOOOOOO!!\nIt was too late for her. One of the cows launched an attack.\n.\n.\n10 minutes after the deity elf had entered the portal, a soul physique of a deity exited the portal. It was the soul of the second elf woman who had entered the cow level earlier.\nThe soul glared at Wei Yuan's face, but she couldn't complain. On the other hand, Wei Yuan scoffed, \"I've warned you. That is not the right way.\"\n\"…\"\nThe soul couldn't argue. She turned around and used her soul physique to pass through the crowd, entering the portal to the elf world in peace.\nAfter the unfortunate elf's soul returned, many elves realized the danger of the cow level. They stopped their silly thoughts to focus on reaching the right portal.\n.\nA day quickly passed by. Only less than 50,000 elves managed to get through the gate as too many people were uncooperative.\nOn the other hand, Meowmeow managed to score 200 elves. These girls would become new members of Leo's domain in the future. But for the moment, they had to pay the entrance fee with their bodies.\nThe second and the third day were the same. People flocked to the platform, competing to return home. A few of them, as usual, lost to the temptation of a certain angel statue, joining his ranks.\nBut on the fourth day, the crowd lessened by half. The elves learned the trend and finally decided to wait in the refugee camps. As less crowd was present, the lines flowed faster and more people managed to get home.\n.\n.\nOn the fifth day, Esen finally came out of Leo's bus. She grinned and carried a round pearl in her hands.\n[Seed of World Tree]\nIt was a seed that Esen had bought from her World Tree System. Although she was a newbie, she managed to complete a few tutorial quests on the bus and got her hands on a real seed.\nWhen Esen came out, she found a crowd of bored elves, queuing and waiting on the main road. They also looked back at her.\nEsen shrugged and turned around.\n\"Meh, high elves. I hate those arrogant hypocrites.\"\nEsen didn't have a good history with high elves. These green elves were known for their obnoxious nature. When she was a princess, the green elf representatives always pestered her and tried to make her a representative of the high elves instead of a divine elf. But when she was framed, the high elves were the first to condemn her and made the loudest noise to gain the favor of Ester.\nUnfortunately for Esen, the high elves kept haunting her. One of the elves recognized her appearance and mistook her identity with her mother.\n\"YOUR MAJESTY ELEANOR! PLEASE HELP US!\"\nThe scream of a desperate elf awakened the crowd's anger and desire for a bloodbath. They flew toward the parking lot and rushed toward Esen.\n\"YOUR MAJESTY! YOU'RE HERE!\"\n\"WE'RE SAFE! PLEASE HELP US KILL THESE KIDNAPPERS!\"\n\"YOUR MAJESTY! LET'S KILL THEM ALL! BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND!\"\nEsen flinched. She turned around and glared at them, \"I'm not your queen. Get lost!\"\n\"W-What?\"\nThe desperate high elves were heartbroken. They stumbled and fell to their knees at first. However, as Esen had guessed, they shifted the blame to Esen right away.\n\"Your Majesty! Did you betray us?!\"\n\"How dare you betray us, your majesty! You were supposed to protect us!\"\n\"Get us out of here! This is your job!\"\nEsen stopped her feet. She slowly turned around and gave them her brightest smile.\n\"You know, I've been having a headache about how I can increase my World Tree's level. I guess I was overthinking.\"\nEsen opened her system menu and read her tutorial quest detail.\n.\nTutorial Quest (7/10)\nYou have successfully purchased a world tree's seed. However, planting a world tree is a challenging task for a newbie. For an inexperienced world tree farmer like you, you should start by securing some fertilizer first.\nQuest Objective:\n- Secure 1,000kg of organic fertilizer (0/1,000)\nRewards:\n- Unlock Fertilizer Inventory",

She displayed a new power, which she had obtained after receiving Leo's system.\nLive Necromancy!\nThe crowd of green elves in front of Esen exploded, scattering flesh and blood everywhere. Their bodies left behind only bloody skeletons! Regardless of immortals or deities, everybody in her line of sight perished instantly, body and soul!\nThis new domain allowed Esen to transform living people with the same or lower cultivation base into an undead skeleton. Their soul's memory would be wiped clean, and they would be cursed into an undead forever.\nThat was not all. Her system reacted to the blood and militated corpses of the elves. The pearl in Esen's hands started sucking liquid, flesh, and innards of the dead. Within a minute, the stained parking lot was clean.\nDING\n<Secure 1,000kg of organic fertilizer (10,937/1,000)>\n<Congratulations! You have completed the 7th tutorial quest.>\n<A new feature has been unlocked. You can now access your Fertilizer Inventory.>\n<Fertilizer Inventory can only store organic objects. You cannot retrieve any item from this inventory like normal inventory systems. All stored items will be automatically converted into numeric values of fertilizer for your world trees.>\n<A new quest has been generated.>\n.\nTutorial Quest (8/10)\nAfter gaining enough fertilizer, you should think of a suitable place to plant the world tree seed. Since a world tree's characteristics, power, and blessings are at stake, you should plan out and cultivate the environment before completing the plantation process.\nAs this is a tutorial quest, the system will help you pinpoint a suitable location for planting. You can temporarily access the system map and see the recommended plantation spots, highlighted on the screen.\nQuest Objectives:\n- Mix the targeted area's soil with 1,000kg of fertilizer (0/1,000)\n- Plant the World Tree Seed (0/1)\n- Water the seed with any Holy Water every day for a week (0/7)\nRewards:\n- Unlock World Tree Status and Management Feature.\n.\nEsen grinned and opened her new system inventory menu. When she found icons of militated flesh, she snickered.\n\"I should have extorted this ability from him ages ago. Damn geezer. You're hiding so many secrets from me! Hehehehehe.\"\nIvy had been standing behind Esen. She sweated profusely and gazed at her master in admiration and astonishment.\n\"Wow.\"\nEsen turned around and gazed at Ivy, \"Look, Ivy. We have new workers! It doesn't even consume a lot of Qi. I think I can maintain 100,000 of them with one percent of my Qi.\"\nIvy dryly laughed, \"You're getting a lot stronger, your majesty. L-Let's go see his majesty and tell him about your new abilities.\"\n\"Of course! By the way, where is my husband?\"\n\"…Probably, up there?\" Ivy pointed up, gesturing that Leo might be on the flying island above them.\n\"Alright. Let's go see them… But on a second thought, let's do that later. Those annoying high elves might mistake me for my mother again.\"\n\"…True.\"\nAfraid of the complications, Esen stored the world tree's seed and left the parking lot, flying north. They traveled together to the black mountain, where Leo had left behind a black stone mine active.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, the planet of High Elf faced a new change.\nThe portal of Leo's mystic realm platform sent them to the destroyed fortress, where the bombs landed.\nWHOOSH\nA new batch of married elves came out of the portal. But when they exited the portal, they fell to the ground and hit other elves who had arrived before them.\n\"OUCH! Watch where you're going!\"\nMore elves kept pouring out of the portal and piled on top of the others below them. Some of them tumbled and rolled down from the mountain of bodies. The unfortunate girls underneath gritted their teeth and circulated their Qi to survive.\nSoon, a deity elf came out. When she found out about the situation, she pulled out every elf on the mountain and rescued the unlucky woman. She also created an ice slider, forcing newcomers to slide down the path she had created.\nThe slider allowed the newcomers to gain time to react. A minute later, more people arrived and fell into the slider tracks. As the deity had envisioned, the new people leaped or flew off the slider track, avoiding the congested front gate.\nWhen everybody gained their bearings, they finally noticed the disaster. The land that they once called home was left in ruin. A portion of the continent sank into the ocean while small craters riddled the afloat parts. As for the forest homes, nothing remained.\n\"WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!\" Everybody panicked and screamed.\nA few of the elves were enraged. They tried to go back to the Florida Domain.\nUnfortunately, more people kept coming out. They bumped heads and knocked each other out.\nFor a while, they got stuck there. More elves stared at the portal, waiting for the exodus to end. They vowed to go back and question the kidnappers.\n.\n.\n15 days later, the situation calmed down. More than 70% of the elves returned to their world. However, the rest of the elves chose not to return home.\nStrangely, 100,000 elves decided to stay here permanently. They built their homes in the slum district and started doing business with the local humans. Some of them even married to the rich men and cultivators.\n5,000 young elves fell prey to Meowmeow. They soon exited the agriculture world as elf golems, and they joined ranks with the worker mannequins, helping the local farms and other facilities in the shopping mall.\nBecause of the new influx of population, the stores had been busy again. Migrated elves were allowed to enter the shopping mall, and they quickly explored the facilities.\nThis day, the sky platform was finally devoid of elves. The last woman entered the portal, and the queue was no more.\nHowever, chaos never stopped. A few minutes after the last woman left, several elves returned to the Florida Domain.\nThe first group was a team of deities. They rushed to confront Wei Yuan and questioned him.\n\"WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR WORLD?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY PLANET?!\"\nWei Yuan's cold eyes fixated on them as she answered, \"From what the lord has informed me, one of yours is the one who did this. Our lord was the one who rescued you from the calamity. Also, you ungrateful brain-rot parrots-in-heat should watch your tone. Yelling and screaming like Karen-on-period will only get you killed. Not all of us are benevolent or kind.\"\n\"E-Eh?!\"\nCoincidentally, Meowmeow left the agriculture world after converting another teenage elf into a statue golem. He noticed a group of angry deity elves.\n\"What's up, ladies? Are you here to join my harem squad, too?\"\nThe elves were still angry. They looked at Meowmeow and were about to curse him.\nHowever, Meowmeow's pheromone and handsomeness stunned them. Their anger disappeared as fast as zoomers browsing through TikTok clips.\nSeizing the opportunity, Meowmeow soothed the crowd with his calm and deep voice.\n\"Say, girlies. Wanna chill and watch Netflix together in that realm? We have cookies, pizzas, and BIG rod.\"\n\"…\"",

But as the situation calmed down, Leo shifted his attention to the mountain of spirit stones, which Lucky and Meowmeow had looted from the spaceships. Everything was stored in the junkyard, waiting for Leo to sort them.\nLucky and Meowmeow collected over 500,000 spatial rings from the divine elf's spaceships. Inside the rings contained useful items, soul stones, essence stones, and random herbs. However, 70% of the items were nonsense junk, such as leaf gums, anti-viagra pills, skin lotion, and cosmetic creams.\nLeo wanted to stop time and sort everything. However, the time domain could only pause the time flow within a star system or a galaxy depending on Leo's seriousness. Using it too frequently might affect Leo's system domain. After all, the system wasn't affected by the power of time.\nAs the population grew, managing the domain got complicated. Thankfully, his 'free' laborers were competent.\nWhile Leo was at wit's end, Meowmeow sent a platoon of his elf wives to the junkyard. These girls had been turned into golems, and their cultivation bases increased by a major realm. The immortal elf evolved into 'stone' elf deities.\nThe elves received direct orders from Meowmeow. They approached the backpacks of spatial rings and started ejecting items out. Unhesitatingly, they threw away all common consumable items that high elves used – Creams and cosmetic items.\nWith a thousand helpers, Leo was overjoyed. However, the surprises didn't end.\nA thousand undead skeletons formed a patrolling army. They watched over the farms and chased away the remnant high elves, who attempted to steal the crops. A few molgs and death knights under Esen followed the army around and supervised them if necessary.\n\"So many GREAT ASSETS of the company, me like!\" He bet a certain space company would also approve this.\nAs things were automatically organized, it was time for Leo to clear another urgent matter at hand – His official wedding. As this matter was related to the morals of his people and his reputation, he needed to do this carefully.\nLeo thought of his facilities in the shopping mall. He wondered where he should hold the wedding ceremony. A few seconds after he fell into a deep thought, he smacked his forehead.\nHe had money – YOL. He could solve everything with cash!\n'Can I buy a freaking pre-made resource from the freaking online shopping system?'\nInspired, Leo checked the system shop. He wasn't disappointed. As soon as Leo put the keyword 'Wedding' into the search box, several item icons appeared in the menu.\nThe items ranged from a readymade garden to luxurious spaceship colonies.\nLeo looked at the price. Then, his expression turned dark.\nThe cheapest garden was only 1,000 YOL as it provided nothing but decorations. However, the acceptable ones, such as a transformable 5-star hotel resort truck, cost a whopping 10 million YOL. This didn't include their upgrade fees.\nLeo counted his fingers and sighed. \"Oh, boy. Should I just stick to RVs? But we don't have a proper hotel around here. Should I make one? Meh, 170 million YOL is nothing. I can get them back in a jiffy.\"\nHe settled with a premade transformable construction vehicle, which could transform into a 5-star hotel resort. Although it was upgradable, it couldn't provide perks and employees like the usual system buildings. Fortunately, Leo could build it anywhere or repack it like C&C headquarters bases any time.\nDING\nA moderate-sized spaceship, 500m long, 100m wide, and 10m tall manifested from thin air. It slowly descended and landed at the Tang Clan's resident district.\nLeo followed the spaceship to its landing site. When it landed, it automatically transformed into a luxurious 30-story tall grand resort hotel.\nLooking at it from the front, it resembled the US Parliament House because of its unique architecture. However, its bright yellowish LED light, maze garden, and fountain pool inherited the Las Vegas style.\nSandwiching the parliament-looking building at the center was a fortress-like L-shaped building. Its height was twice as tall, but every room featured a balcony with a personal swimming pool!\nLeo gulped and checked the description of the purchased item on the shopping menu. He was curious about what he had just bought.\n.\nMobile Construction Vehicle (Rizzler Resort)\nLevel: 1/17\nUpgrade Fee: 10,000,000 years of lifespan.\nThis vehicle can transform into a Rizzler Class resort, which is equivalent to a 4-star hotel according to Fate Stadium's standard. The hotel features a total of 1,000 luxurious suites, 10 grand suites, and 10 president suites for VVVIP guests. It comes with most basic facilities, such as restaurants, bars, nightclubs, theatres, casinos, fitness centers, meeting halls, cultivation rooms, spas, brothels, and many more.\nPlease note. This item does not come with workers, food, or cultivation resources.\n.\nLeo wryly smiled. He spent 160 million YOL and upgraded it to the soft cap level. Then, he waited for the building to change.\n\"…\"\nNothing happened.\nLeo shrugged and entered the building to inspect the interior. He understood that nothing might have changed from the outside, but a lot should have evolved inside.\nHe wasn't disappointed. As Leo had experienced, everything inside exceeded Leo's expectations.\n.\nMobile Construction Vehicle (Rizzler Resort)\nLevel: 17/17\nThis vehicle can transform into a Rizzler Class resort, which is equivalent to a 5-star hotel according to Fate Stadium's standard. The hotel features a total of 17,000 luxurious suites, 170 grand suites, and 70 presidential suites for VVVIP guests. The hotel comes with state-of-the-art facilities suitable for aspired cultivators under the entity realm.\nPlease note. This hotel automatically generates basic food, water, liquor, and electricity. However, it doesn't provide cultivation resources.\n.\nThe lobby was as large as an airport terminal in capital cities. Signboards showed a different section and different facilities, including various reception counters.\nLeo rubbed his hands and walked into the building to explore his new toy.\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nThe new building caused a commotion in the Tang Clan's manor. Many clansmen rushed out to scout the perimeter, and they instantly found a massive hotel a kilometer away to the east of their location.\nThe hotel covered a span of 50 square kilometers. Gardens, sports facilities, running tracks, a golf course, a water park, and a theme park took 30% of the land. 10% belonged to the massive swimming pool with stone bridges and bar islands. As for the rest, the hotel buildings covered the terrain.\nThe large building shocked the clansmen. Fortunately, they had heard and seen Leo's system buildings before. Everybody concluded that it was the work of Leo once more.\nThe clansmen returned to their clan lords. However, both Tang Xuan and Tang Tian were still in seclusion. The news reached Bao Xun instead.\nBao Xun rushed out of his home to see the hotel with his eyes. He arrived in front of the hotel's entrance and gawked at the massive structure.\n\"As expected of Lord Florida Man! Tsk. I need to gain his favor this time.\"\nGuessing that Leo might be inside, Bao Xun mustered his courage and was about to enter the building.\nTAP-TAP\nHowever, he wasn't the only one who gathered around this place to play. Behind him, a bored dryad and two elderly women arrived. The naught monster girl poked Bao Xun's shoulder.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Mister. Do you have any fertilizer?)\n\"Huh? What?\"\nBao Xun turned around. Then, he found Cat, Xu Nuan, and Dongfang Mei.\nDongfang Mei had been cultivating. After several days of hard work, she reached the Star Celestial Stage, aka the 3rd stage of the immortal realm. Xu Nuan also reached the 2nd immortal stage. As for Cat, ate her way to the 5th immortal stage naturally! Moreover, her physical prowess was already comparable to a 5-star deity.\nThe physical appearances of the two female elders also changed drastically. Dongfang Mei was natural as she mastered an age reversal technique – She looked like a mature lady in her mid-20s. As for Xu Nuan, her physical age decreased because of her cultivation base. At the moment, she looked like a 40-year-old aunt. As for Cat, she was still a usual pretty dark elf brat.\nSuddenly confronting three experts of Leo's faction, Bao Xun shrieked in fright. He deeply bowed.\n\"G-Greetings, senior. I didn't know that you were interested in this building as well.\"\n\"At ease,\" Dongfang Mei laughed. She gazed at the interior of the hotel. \"I guess Lord Florida Man surprises us again. What is he building this time?\"\n\"I-I don't know. Would you like to check inside with me?\"\nDongfang Mei shook her head. She gestured for Xu Nuan and Cat to stay outside.\n\"Let's wait until he gives us further instructions. He might be busy decorating or tampering with the building from the inside. If we suddenly interrupt his work, he might be very angry.\"\nBao Xun came to his senses, \"You're right, senior. I-I almost offended the lord.\"\n\"Good. Let's wait here together. You're curious too, right?\"\n\"Y-Yes.\"\nThe group stood at the entrance of the hotel, waiting for Leo to come out.\nMeanwhile, many disciples, commoners, and rogue cultivators in the area also gathered for sightseeing. But when they saw Dongfang Mei, nobody dared to enter the building.\n.\n.\nThree hours later, Leo finished inspecting the hotel. He was satisfied with the rooms and facilities. However, there was an issue.\nThis building lacked employees. Leo would need to assign some workers to this establishment soon. Moreover, many facilities required supplies from the shopping mall, such as spirit herbs, quality food, and cultivation resources – such as True Earth Fate Crystals.\nLeo grumbled while he walked into the lobby.\n'I need to make more true earth fate crystals, but they can be stolen. I need someone trustworthy to be this hotel's manager.'\nLeo reached the exit and found a crowd of people gathered outside. He looked up and found Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, and Cat.\nSeeing the trio, Leo had an idea.\n\"You've come at a good time, ma'am. Are you interested in an executive job?\"",

Do you have any related experience?\"\n\"OH?!\" Dongfang Mei repeatedly nodded after Leo mentioned 'tavern'. \"Is this place a tavern, sir?\"\n\"Yes. It's a high-tech one. You'll need to learn a lot before you can employ helpers.\"\n\"I DO! I WANT TO TAKE THIS JOB!!\"\nDongfang Mei was firm. Her life experience told her not to miss this opportunity.\nLeo approved Dongfang Mei's decisiveness. This was one of the required qualities of a good leader.\n\"Good. You're hired! I'll increase your wage and cultivation resources accordingly. So, here is your job. I want you to explore this place and remember how every facility works. You have 15 days to comprehend everything. As for the employees, you are free to hire anybody to work here. Make sure every business in this hotel is covered.\"\n\"Yes, sir! You can count on me!\" Dongfang Mei giggled and immediately turned to Xu Nuan. She smiled at her subordinate. \"You'll be my assistant, Xu Nuan. Oh, go call the girls that have nothing to do. Bring them here so we can learn about this place together! Let's go!\"\n\"O-Okay.\" Xu Nuan was still confused, but she rushed toward the clothing stores, where most of her disciples gathered to play or work.\nThe onlookers could only gaze at Xu Nuan and Dongfang Mei in envy. Even Bao Xun cursed his fate as to why he wasn't born a woman.\nMeanwhile, Cat was oblivious to the talk. She tilted her head and tugged Leo's clothes.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Daddy. Where food?)\nLeo shifted his attention to Cat. He wryly laughed and patted her head.\n\"Alright. Let's get you some crazy cows. Come inside with us.\"\n\"Meow <3\" (Yay!)\nThe weird family entered the hotel while Dongfang Mei followed him into the building. The door shut behind them, blocking the outsiders from intruding on the premises.\n.\nAfter the door was locked, the spectators whispered among each other before they rushed back, especially the people of the Tang Clan. They were the only group who didn't have a proper job other than maintaining the order of the western slum district.\nThe news about the new recruitment quickly spread. As the tavern job's concept was easy to understand, idle housewives and young maidens of the families were interested in the new opportunity.\nWithin 30 minutes, a hundred idle women from the Tang Clan made their way to the hotel. Xu Nuan also brought 50 of her disciples who were bored of working in clothing stores.\nThe doors were automatically opened, and the new employees entered. Dongfang Mei accepted them without an issue. Although 150 workers might not be enough, they were enough for the first batch of trainees. Also, it would take a while to learn the jobs and new culture.\nLeo also helped them integrate into modern technologies and culture, such as room services, spas, housekeeping, and the usage of various facilities and electric appliances.\nAlso, Leo combined another set of earth fate crystals. Another true earth fate crystal was born, and it was used to power the hotel complex. Another source of \"HOLY WATER\" emerged.\n.\n.\n14 days later, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, and 150 employees graduated from the hotel management crash course. As for Cat, she ditched them the first day when Leo started teaching the women housekeeping techniques.\nOn this day, the group gathered in one of the meeting halls in the hotel complex. Leo stood on a podium and gazed at the crowd of hotel employees, who had changed their dresses into a maid uniform. Only Dongfang Mei wore a modern white suit.\n\"It has been over a month since the last seasonal expedition. It's about time we prepare for my wedding ceremony. You know what to do, right?\"\nDongfang Mei brightly smiled, \"Can I also hold a ceremony for me and my husband afterward?\"\n\"Do whatever you want. Make sure you don't F up my wedding. I just want to get this over with.\"\n\"Of course! We'll do our best, senior! By the way, about the rental price and other fees, I think it's quite… cheap?\"\nLeo's facial expression distorted, \"Why? Is 100 years of lifespan per night too cheap?\"\n\"I mean… Sir, we should consider the perks of our facilities. Firstly, our hotel offers cultivation services. For example, the private yoga rooms are connected to a stream of holy water.\"\nDongfang Mei referred to the newly created holy water fountain, where the source of Qi and electricity of this hotel came from. She continued.\n\"Our customers can drink them for free! Drinking a mouthful of holy water gives the same Qi as cultivating at the pylon tower for a year! The fitness center also features unique training dummies and correction machines that adjust one's martial techniques! Training in such a facility for one day is more beneficial than training on their own for 10 years! Such privileges require a high price to pay. This doesn't include the luxurious suites where our customers can fully relax and enjoy their time. If I may suggest, a day of rent should be at least 10,000 YOL to make it worth it! Otherwise, every commoner and their chickens will be swarming this place and ruin our hotel!\"\n\"…I see.\"\nLeo nodded in acknowledgment. At first, he wanted the hotel to be accessible to all commoners so that they would be motivated to start cultivating. However, judging from the local standard, 10 years of lifespan seemed too cheap for such opportunities.\n\"How about 5,000 for regular suites, 20,000 for grand suites, and 50,000 for presidential suites?\"\n\"That's more reasonable for a promotion. However, the full price should be 10,000/30,000/100,000. In the future, more immortals will emerge. I'm sure a few thousand years of lifespan will become cheap changes to them. Well, I'm also an immortal, so I know how easy it is to increase our life expectancy.\"\n\"…If you say so. Okay.\"\n\"Oh, I almost forgot. About the currency, sir. Since you normally trade one essence stone for one year of lifespan, I suggest we standardize essence stones as the local currency. One YOL is one essence stone. Is that okay with you?\"\n\"Suit yourself. But wait, won't the price of our hotel be too cheap then? 10,000 essence stones per night?\"\nDongfang Mei widely grinned, \"Don't you need soul stones? I heard you have been mass-minting soul stones in the workshops.\"\n\"…\"\nIndeed, Leo had been printing soul stones to trade with people from the Fate Stadium. He hadn't visited that place for a long time.\nIn the end, Leo let Dongfang Mei run the hotel as its general manager or the CEO. Xu Nuan ended up being appointed as an accountant, and she would be in charge of managing the hotel's budget and finances.\nAs for the wedding, Dongfang Mei requested a week of preparation. They would also need to start sending invitation letters to their friends and families.\n.\n.\n\"Hey, have you heard?\"\n\"Again? The new building, right?\"\n\"Yeah, that. It's the building that we can't enter.\"\n\"I heard they aren't open for business yet.\"\n\"I know, but the lord's wedding ceremony date has been decided. I think they will hold the ceremony there.\"\nAs usual, poor workers and cultivators in the shopping mall gathered on the 2nd and 3rd floor, enjoying the fresh air from the air conditioners and absorbing mild lightning element Qi from electric outlets. Although they couldn't get as much Qi as the pylon tower's seats, they preferred this place because of the relaxing environment.\nAs for elders and rich cultivators, they usually stayed in either the fourth-floor casino or the first-floor restaurants. Only weirdoes and studious cultivators remained in one of the fifth floor's workshops, uninterested in worldly affairs.\nIn a small domain, news spread fast. Within a few hours, everybody heard about the wedding schedule. Fortunately, they heard about it a few months ago, and they had been preparing gifts for this occasion.\nHowever, the new residents of this domain, aka the elves, had never heard about it. Most of the remaining elves were women and children. Their elders and men either died rioting or returned home three weeks ago.\nA dozen elf women disguised as humans and blended into the crowd inside the shopping mall. When they heard about the wedding, their women's instinct kicked in.\nThey were jealous of the bride. They wished their husbands or future boyfriends would host a big wedding ceremony for them. Driven by emotion, they spent a whole day eavesdropping everybody.\nThe next day, the hotel's housekeepers brought leaflets to the shopping mall. They plastered them on every wall on every floor, advertising the wedding schedule.\nThe wedding would be held at the newly built hotel. All official employees could freely attend and enjoy free food and drinks. However, they were expected to bring gifts for the groom and bride according to their tradition.\nSome of the elves stole a few leaflets from the walls. They carried them back to their new village in the slum district to inform their colleagues.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, the bride had no idea what Leo was doing. She and Ivy toured the continent and arrived at the former home of the Joyous Yin Yang Sect and Tappaya City.\nAs Milo's people had abducted the local cultivators and civilians there, the sect was deserted. Only weird creatures remained behind.\nIn an abandoned ranch, Esen inspected the local bulls and realized what they were.\n\"Ah, it has been a long time. So, they're still around.\"\nIvy gazed at the bulls in front of Esen. Her expression was complicated.\n\"Spirit Bulls? If I remember correctly, the only good thing about them is their urine. Their meat is a bit meh compared to the supreme beef in the restaurants. Are we taking them with us?\"\n\"Of course. These bulls are necessary for my world tree. Their urine will be the best fertilizer. Actually, let's take the whole ranch with us. Can you help me?\"\n\"…\"\nIvy was reluctant as she knew how smelly the spirit bull's urine was. Moreover, these spirit bulls were infamous for their nasty behavior – They enjoyed consummating with other races, especially humanoid creatures!\nShe knew the reason why the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect kept these animals. Their purposes were solely for wild entertainment!\nThe bulls finally noticed the gender of Ivy and Esen. They lewdly snorted and stood on two feet. At the bottom, their pink organ extended like an elephant tusk.\nIvy and Esen clicked their tongue in disgust. The latter snapped her fingers and activated one of her dao domains.\nSNAP\nThe bulls flinched for a moment before they all collapsed on the ground, falling asleep.\nEsen sighed and waved her hands. A hundred fat bulls floated and followed Esen.\n\"Let's go home. We're done here.\"\nIvy nodded. She copied Esen and carried the rest of the herd, \"By the way, Your Majesty. Where are we keeping them? The unicorn's barn?\"\n\"Nah,\" Esen thought of the pervert cow woman. Sierra's face came to her mind. \"We have a lewd cow at home. She might like them. They're from a similar species, right?\"\n\"OHHHH!!\" Ivy remembered Sierra. She also wondered how the cow woman would react. \"Good idea! Let's bring these guys to her.\"\nThe duo flew home, carrying souvenirs for Leo. They, too, would be in for a surprise.\n.\n.\nDEZNUTS Council, Home Planet of Eleanor\nEllen's troops reclaimed Eleanor's territory without an issue. As soon as she returned, Ellen declared that Leo murdered Eleanor.\nThis news enraged all elves. The divine elf, high elf, forest elf, and dark elf population vowed to avenge their matriarch. As such, more people volunteered to join Ellen's army.\nMilo also brought a piece of similar news to his kin. As most Fenrir was loyal to Eleanor, they also joined Milo's troops, preparing to for a new fight.\nMeanwhile, Simba seized this opportunity to visit Ester's planet to find clues about his wife. He arrived home and found traces of disaster.\n\"…\"\nSimba remained silent while he levitated in the sky, gazing at the new lakes and sunken lands. The place where his house once existed was no longer there.\nIn addition, there was a strange gate not far from the ruined fortress.\nSimba narrowed his eyes as he saw several golems crossing the portal. When he looked carefully, he found that the golems looked like high elves of this world.\nCurious, Simba approached the portal.",

A player has entered one of your mystic realms!>\nWhile Leo helped Dongfang Mei and Xu Nuan adapt to the hotel, a system message warned him about the uninvited guest. He left the hotel in a hurry and rushed to the mystic realm platform.\nUpon arrival, Leo found Meowmeow and Lucky. Both of them still guarded the agriculture portal and Orlando portal as instructed. However, the number of stone golems drastically increased since Leo last visited them.\nA hundred concubines of Meowmeow stood in a formation while his initial three wives stood in front of them like platoon leaders.\nThe two heavenly guardians also detected the intruder's presence. They saluted Leo.\nLeo glanced at the army of elf golems. He complained, \"What are those? I remember that I told you to return them. Why the hell are you taking them in?\"\nMeowmeow widely grinned.\n\"Hey, master. Do you know that in terms of male human and female humanoid species breeding, elves are the most compatible partners for men? Not only are they beautiful, which is their main attraction, but their youthful appearance sticks with them forever. This means they stay sexy and fit, suitable to become a-\"\n\"Stop!\"\nLeo almost vomited blood from cringe because this silly statue recited a cursed copy-pasta verse in the elf version. Fortunately, he hadn't mentioned anything about orcs or something inappropriate yet.\nHe changed the subject, \"Where are the intruders? Which planet are they invading?\"\nAs Leo's tone was serious, Meowmeow stopped messing around. He revealed the location of the intruder.\n\"The elf planet, master. Should we repel the invader? Actually, I have been thinking of eliminating all male elves over there and brainwashing every female elf. We can get free laborers that way.\"\nLeo's turned solemn, \"I'm not afraid of bloodshed, but damn! You're a psychopath! Are you planning to create a harem of elves or what?\"\n\"Well, I was born from your inner desire, so…\"\n\"Screw you and your perversion, damn birb! Fine! You and I, we go back to that planet together. You can do whatever you want with the male elves. All I want is peace and order! Spread love, not hatred!\"\n\"That's my point, master! I DO spread LOVE – SEXY LOVE!\"\nLeo facepalmed and shook his head. He swore that he would either deploy or reincarnate this guy into somebody else's dantian universe one day.\n\"No more chit-chat. Let's get to work. We're going to see this visitor-\"\nLeo was about to enter the permanent portal to the elf planet. However, a male dark elf suddenly crossed over to Leo's domain.\nAlthough he was a dark elf, his face was as handsome as the other male high elves that Leo had seen. In addition, his physique was a lot bigger than thin elves.\nHe looked like a dark elf on steroids. That perfect toned muscle and his hidden abs would have charmed millions of modern women on Earth instantly.\nThe dark elf exuded the air of an entity at a glance. However, his eyes and his black aura strangely resembled Aslan.\nThe dark elf stared straight into Leo's eyes. He muttered.\n\"Florida Man, I assume.\"\nLeo snorted, \"Yes, and you are?\"\n\"Someone from Earth. My Daoist name is Ohio Man.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows, surprised. The corners of his mouth curved up, \"Well, well, well. A dark elf claiming to be one of my kin, how amusing. What did you do to get those elf ears?\"\nSimba swept his gaze across the platform and found several stone elves who stood still like statues. Upon noticing how the local high elves had been cursed by an unknown ability, his killing intent soared.\nLeo also noticed that. He calmly pulled out his pen from his pocket.\nSimba stared at Leo again. He slowly brought out a photo of a gorgeous female blond-haired elf holding a baby in her arms. Then, he showed it to Leo.\n\"Have you seen this woman before? Her name is Ester Sydin. She's the second princess of the Divine Elf Kingdom. I know that she has been imprisoned somewhere in this world because you link your domain with her home planet.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLeo's expression changed when he heard of the surname. Although Ester didn't have the 'IV' after her surname, she was still from the Sydin Family. Instantly, Leo figured that Esen and Ester were related.\nUnfortunately, Leo didn't remember seeing her. After all, he was busy watching over the crowd of unruly elves and the return migration.\n\"Never seen her in my life.\" Answered Leo.\n\"…\"\nSimba deeply sighed after a long pause. He shifted his attention to Meowmeow and Lucky next. Despite meeting them the first time, Simba inquired about them as if he knew they were alive.\n\"What about you two? Have you seen my wife?\"\nLucky barked, \"Nope, woof! Anyway, why should we even answer you?!\"\nMeowmeow scoffed, \"If I met her, I would have turned her into one of my collections. If she's not among the statues over there, then she might have been erased along with several people of that planet.\"\nSimba glared at Meowmeow and squinted his brow. He inquired Meowmeow again in a cold deep voice.\n\"I'll be giving you a second chance. Answer me honestly, and I won't do anything to you or anybody here. WHERE.IS.MY.WIFE?!\"\nMeowmeow didn't like the tone. He also replied in the same tone. \"I.DON'T.KNOW.FUCK.OFF!!\"\n\"…I see.\"\nSimba deeply sighed. Then, he slipped his left hand into his pocket.\nLeo immediately activated the lightsaber pen and pulled out the upgraded pistol. He aimed at Simba's head and was about to pull the trigger.\nVHOOM!\nSimba pulled out a finger-sized keychain knife from his pocket, but it instantly expanded into a 1.5m long plasma chainsaw blade. With a swing, he sliced Leo's upgraded pistol in half!\nLeo flinched when he pulled the trigger and discovered that the system gun was easily destroyed. As he got distracted, Simba closed in on him. The chainsaw blade came from Leo's right side like a baseball bat coming after a flying ball.\n\"HMMPH!!\"\nLeo smacked the flat surface of the chainsaw blade with his hammer fist. The core of the chainsaw bent 60 degrees, causing the plasma chainsaw to stall and cease functioning.\nBut as Leo blocked the chainsaw, Simba discarded the weapon and followed through with his right hook, aiming at the face of Leo. Moreover, he activated one of his dao domains, concealing him and Leo within a 5-meter cubic square meter domain.\nLeo ignored the weird domain and leaned forward, dodging the strike by a hairbreadth. At the same time, he head-butted the face of Simba.\nBONK\nLeo's forehead directly broke Simba's nose. However, the latter's face regenerated instantly as he pulled his head back. A right knee shot up, aiming at Leo's face.\nAs Leo's left hand still held the lightsaber pen, he swung it, aiming for Simba's neck.\nPOW!\nThe knee found Leo's chin and tilted his head upward. However, Leo's lightsaber hacked down and found Simba's neck.\nSSSSSSSHHHHKKKKKKK\nThe lightsaber emitted a strange sound as if it hit a metal plate. Moreover, the energy from the pen dimmed.\nUnafraid of the lightsaber, Simba grabbed it with his right hand. His domain also drained the energy of the sword.\nWithin a split second, Leo sensed that his energy was leaving him. He groaned and kicked Simba's chest, using his opponent as a foothold.\nGetting kicked in the chest, Simba's chest caved in while ten of his ribcages shattered instantly. He vomited several mouthfuls of blood while his body was knocked backward. His back hit the wall of his domain. Then, he fell on his knees.\nLeo's back also hit the small wall behind him. When he looked up, Leo discovered the domain's ability, which trapped him and his opponent.\nThe domain trapped both of them inside! Moreover, it leeched his energy!\n\"Annoying!\"\nLeo stopped time and overlapped his domain with Simba's.\nAs soon as the time domain reached Simba, he instantly healed the injuries and undid his domain. Instantly, he vanished and reappeared behind Leo.\nLeo sensed the dark elf behind him. Even though his time domain was active, this dark elf ignored the restrictions and stretched his hand, seizing Leo's neck from behind.\n\"DETONATE!\"\nBOOOOOM\nA large explosion erupted and Simba's black flame devoured Leo whole!\nUnfortunately, the touch was a mistake. Leo, being an absolute menace, turned his head 180 degrees. His spinal cord grew a dozen sharp spikes, which pierced Simba's arms, face, and chest. The transparent blood of Leo ignited a rainbow flame, which extinguished the black flame of Simba.\nDespite being pierced by Leo's bones, Simba lightly snorted and transformed into smoke. He leisurely reappeared five meters away while his body showed no signs of injuries.\nLeo calmly turned his body around. He grabbed his head and twisted it back to the right angle.\nCRACK\nAdjusting his spine placement, Leo tilted his head from left to right and right to left. Then, he rotated his shoulders while the spikes behind him slowly formed a pair of bone wings.\nSimba gazed at Leo in solemn. He recognized the traits of the wings and rainbow aura.\nHe was enraged. The wings reminded him of a certain murderer and the traitor of humanity.\n\"Rainbow aura of the phoenix bloodline and the wings of that devil? What's your relationship with Mao Miaomiao?!\"\nLeo slowly tore his suit, which was burnt and corroded by Simba's black flame. He tossed away the broken pen and resumed a kickboxing stance.\n\"Mao Miaomiao? Oh, that asshole? He's long dead.\"\n\"I know he's dead. Did you absorb his bloodline?! Or was you one of the people from that lab?!\"\nLeo didn't fully understand what Simba's problem was. He only remembered that he was a lab rat before, so he innocently answered.\n\"If you refer to the asshole's lab, yeah, I was a part of it.\"\n\"Good. Very good.\" Simba's expression changed. His killing intent exploded, and a menacing black aura of a draconic karmic sovereign was revealed. Black scales covered his skin while his face distorted, transforming into the face of a black dragon. A pair of black metal wings protruded from his back while his arm and leg joints twisted.\nA long white bone slowly exited through Simba's left hand. The humanoid dragon ruthlessly pulled out the piece of bone from his flesh.\nThe bone, bathed in his black blood, shapeshifted into a 3-meter-long blade. However, the movable joints on it implied that it was not a simple weapon.\nInstead of displaying the aura of an entity, Simba revealed his true strength as a karmic sovereign.\nLeo solemnly gazed at Simba. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he pointed at the void in space.\n\"How about we change location? You are here to rescue your wife, right? You probably don't want to kill her accidentally.\"\nSeeing how calm Leo was, Simba pointed his long blade at Leo's face.\n\"Ha! Now, you wanna talk?\"\n\"Will you stop fighting if we talk?\"\nSimba sneered, \"Nah. Once I get my wife back, you can say goodbye to your people and your world! A traitor of humanity like you doesn't deserve happiness and a good life!!\"\n\"Now, you're being excessive. I'm the victim here!\"\n\"Hah! Victim? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH BECAUSE OF YOU PEOPLE! NOW, DIE!!\"\n\"…Oh, dear.\" Leo cracked his knuckles. \"I guess we have no choice. I'll send you to your wife, then.\"\nLeo and Simba paused for a second. Then, they rushed at each other at the speed of light.",

However, nothing connected.\nThe same applied to Simba's attacks. Despite wielding an abnormally long sword, none of his attacks, punches, or kicks landed. He even mixed in a domain ability, which had the same effect as Leo's sword domain, yet Leo instantly threw a counter punch, which forced him to recall the domain to protect himself.\nBoth men weaved, vanished, and teleported on the platform, testing each other's limits and fighting patience.\nSimba grumbled in frustration as he was at a disadvantage. Leo already undid his time domain, but Simba was forced to maintain a cubic barrier. Even though it gradually drained Leo's life force to maintain the blockade, it was vulnerable to any domain-canceling attacks. If the barrier was destroyed, Simba's dantian would crack, which would lead to his demise.\nAfter five minutes of close combat, Simba lost the chicken race. He removed the barrier domain before Leo could destroy it. Then, he teleported 1,000 meters to the sky.\nBut as soon as Simba removed the life force leeching domain, Leo's both phoenix wings transformed into a rainbow scythe. Taking a firm step forward, Leo swung the scythe and unleashed one of his many domain abilities.\nThe domain was invisible and undetectable. However, the big movement hinted that a big sophisticated attack was about to hit him.\nSimba finally had a chance to use his bone sword. The long sword broke into 27 pieces like detachable razor blades, and all of them transformed into Simba.\nSWUA!\nNine fake bodies of Simba instantly shattered to pieces. In addition, the detached razor blades dissipated into dust.\nSimba squinted his eyebrows as he figured out what the previous attack was.\n'A karma attack? Are you kidding me? A karmic sovereign attacking another karmic sovereign with a karma domain? Is he stupid? No karmic sovereign can die even if their karma strings are cut. We're the absolute existence exceeding the laws of the universe! I guess his foundation is lacking. After all, he just appears out of nowhere.'\nSimba scoffed at Leo for being inexperienced in combat against a fellow karmic sovereign. He took his time and pulled out another piece of bone from his other hand to create another razor sword.\nBut Leo ignored Simba's action. He adjusted his stance and swung his scythe at empty air.\nSWUA!\nLeo cut through dimension and created a crack in front of him. At the same time, another crack appeared directly above Simba's head and sliced down.\nThe crack in dimension cleaved Simba's real body in half from head to groin!\n\"!!!\"\nThe crack in dimension sucked Simba's body and soul into the void. Simba immediately ejected his soul from his body, teleporting a kilometer away from the mysterious crack in dimension.\nThe cleaved body of Simba vanished into the dimensional crack before the mysterious portal disappeared.\nSimba's soul regenerated his fleshly body anew. Then, he mumbled to himself.\n'Time and Space Laws, Dimension Splitting Laws, Karma Cutting Laws, how many laws has he mastered?! No karmic sovereign has mastered more than two laws at once! If you cultivate multiple karma rivers, your lifespan capacity will decrease! Is he that dumb?! Or rather… is he using a system ability? Is that the case?'\nHe couldn't understand how Leo had mastered so many abilities. Still, as a system user, Simba believed that Leo cheated the natural laws and overly relied on the system.\n'Since he's using a system ability, I can win. I can do… THIS!'\nSimba ejected a fate crystal from his spatial ring – True Entity Fate Crystal!\nLike how Leo merged seven earth fate crystals into one true earth fate crystal, Simba also merged seven entity fate crystals into a true entity fate crystal.\n.\nTrue Entity Fate Crystal\nThis crystal can only be created by merging seven Entity Fate Crystals. Any True Entity Fate Crystal can be used as a consumable item, a socket item for system facilities, or an imprint on a soul.\nBy crushing this crystal, the owner can erase all system abilities from a nearby system user who has obtained their system abilities from entity fate crystals or inferior crystals.\nIf it is equipped in a system facility or system equipment's socket, it will grant a random blessing to the facility or the equipment. In case it is used to imprint a soul, a unique system will be generated and imprinted to the karmic soul.\n.\nDespite owning a precious treasure, Simba never hesitated to spend one or two to eliminate his enemies. He grabbed the true entity fate crystal and was about to crush it.\nSuddenly, Simba's hands lost all strength. He widened his eyes in shock as he sensed a hundred threads latching onto his fingers, arms, legs, and head like a puppet.\nBehind Simba, Aslan rubbed his temples while he held a fishing rod, which bound his adopted son before he could damage Leo's foundations.\nSimba also turned around and found the clone of Overlord Xiaomao. He instantly recognized the face of the golem. Then, he remembered that another golem on the platform also had the face of Mao Miaomiao.\n\"As I figured. You lots are into this together! There's no way Mao Miaomiao can get his hands on Overlord Xiaomao's blood essence without his help!\"\nAslan deeply sighed, \"Dammit, Simba. I gave you an entity fate crystal and sent you to Eleanor's side to hide you. I didn't send you there to JOIN her, you dumb kid!\"\n\"!!!\"\nSimba was taken aback when Aslan's sound transmission entered his mind. Moreover, he was shocked that the sentient golem knew his real name.\n\"WHO ARE YOU?!\"\nAslan rolled his eyes, \"I'm your father.\"\n\"BULLSHIT! MY FATHER DIED AGES AGO!!\"\nAslan shrugged and was about to explain everything. But when he noticed that Leo was about to charge at them, he cut the conversation short.\n\"How about you shut up and hide inside me for the time being? You're not supposed to fight your brother, you little shit.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nAslan reeled his fishing rod. The lines and Simba's body shrank into a tiny grain of dust and entered Aslan's dantian universe.\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nLeo arrived at Aslan's side. He looked around for a moment. Then, he stared at his subordinate.\n\"There you are, you lazy golem. Where is that dark elf?\"\nAslan laughed, \"I thought you were going to say the N-word for a second.\"\n\"I forgot about that word. Thanks for the unnecessary reminder. Anyway, where's that elf?\"\nAslan giggled and lied, \"I ate him. His soul is in my dantian universe now.\"\n\"…\" Leo gave Aslan a meaningful look. He mumbled, \"I wish I could press X to doubt you. You're very sus, do you know that?\"\n\"You don't have to worry about my credibility and loyalty, master. I'm always on your side, like a father looking after his son.\"\n\"Yeah, right. What an irresponsible father. Ha!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and shook his head. Despite the confession, Leo thought of it as sarcasm. He flew back to Florida Domain as the crisis was over.\nAslan deeply sighed and scratched his cheek. He wondered if his son purposely ignored the hints or if he was simply stupid.\nSince Leo stopped paying attention to him, Aslan sank his consciousness to his dantian universe to check on his adopted son.\nIn Aslan's universe, every star system and galaxy was symmetrical like an art. 256 galaxies contained a total of 4,294,967,296 stars orbited around an abnormally large white sun at the center.\nOn the surface of the white sun, a civilization hid behind a curtain of flame. Crystalized minerals which immune to extreme heat were carved into square houses. Countless white flame spirits wandered about, minding their businesses.\nSimba was tossed to the surface of the planet. The white flame immediately burnt away his disguise and Qi, revealing his true form of a jacked African-American man who seemed to be in his mid-20s.\nSimba panicked when the white flame devoured all of his Qi. He struggled to take a step, but the extreme gravity of this planet pinned him to the ground. Moreover, the fate crystal in his hand slipped away and vanished into the planet.\nAslan descended from the void and landed next to Simba. His appearance didn't resemble Overlord Xiaomao like his 'Shell'. Instead, he appeared as a handsome blond-haired divine elf in white robes. He sat next to his son and laughed.\n\"Sorry for the untimely reunion, son. It has been 50,000 years, hasn't it?\"\n\"You… who are you?\" Despite being exhausted, Simba managed to utter a few words.\n\"Again, I'm your father.\"\n\"…Don't pretend. Mao Miaomiao and Eleanor killed my parents. You can be him.\"\n\"What if I purposely faked my death and hid my soul inside Leonardo?\"\n\"…What?! Wait a minute.\"\nAslan gently pulled Simba off the ground and seated him. Then, he sat in front of his son.\n\"It's about time we have a heart-to-heart talk. There's a lot to explain, too. I don't blame you for the confusion, but for the sake of my grand plan, please cooperate with us.\"\nSimba narrowed his eyes and gave Aslan a meaningful look. Upon noticing that the stranger was a divine elf, his killing intent locked onto Aslan.\n\"All elves are the same. You scheming bastards always toy with us. You're no different from Eleanor and her cronies!\"\n\"Ah, yes. The blame,\" Aslan had a headache. He stood up and waved his hands, summoning a flame spirit.\nOne of the white flame spirits walked over. He bowed at Aslan and glanced at Simba.\nAslan ordered the spirit, \"Transfer a fragment of my memory 50,000 years ago to this brat. Show him the full event of how I died as Aslan Ariel and reincarnated as 'Kitten', the clone of Overlord Xiaomao.\"\nThe spirit nodded. He transformed into a stream of white flame and disappeared into Simba's forehead.\n\"!!!\"\nPictures of 50,000-year-old memories flashed in Simba's mind. A stream of knowledge followed along with vivid 3D scenes of events.\n.\nIt was when Leo and Simba were still stuck in the lab as test subjects. At that time, Simba was barely two years old. However, countless substances had been injected into his veins.\nEvery day, Simba felt like dying. He always had a high fever. His stomach cramped while every fiber of his muscles was in pain. Even his bones cracked and broke daily.\nSimba gave up living several times and waited for his death. However, someone gave him hope for living.\nNext to his glass cage, a cute blond boy also went through the same ordeal, yet his face never showed a hint of being in pain. He dully stared at the adults like a doll.\nAt first, Simba was jealous of the boy. He thought that the boy didn't get tortured like him.\nThe boy was none other than Leo.\nOne day, Leo noticed Simba's existence. He suddenly smiled and waved his hands. Then, he picked up a crayon and started drawing doodles on the glass wall to communicate.\nSimba couldn't even move at first, but the drawing interested him. He lay there in a blank room, staring at the weird drawing of Leo. The drawings soon became his beacon of light, which distracted him from the never-ending pain.\nDays passed by. Simba forgot how long they were in that hell hole.\nOne day, a couple secretly entered Leo's cage and brought him out. At that time, Simba was still wide awake because of the stomach pain.\nThe commotion set off the alarm. Guards rushed in to apprehend the couple, but the elf in a lab coat slaughtered his way out.\nSimba envied them. He thought that they were only there to rescue his neighbor.\nBut a miracle occurred. Leo screamed and pointed at Simba. He flailed his arms and legs while crying, refusing to leave.\nThe couple read the boy's thoughts and rushed into Simba's cage. When they brought Simba along, Leo stopped crying.\nThat was Simba's core memory. He remembered the face of his savior, who gave him hope.\nThe fleet of memories in Simba's mind suddenly paused and became static. A new memory overlapped with his.\nThe face of the male elf slowly became clearer. He started to resemble the divine elf in the dantian universe. Simba also learned of this man's identity.\nHe remembered the guy well.\nAslan Ariel, the Vice Chief Researcher of the Homunculus Project!\nThat man was Leo and Simba's father!",

      "content": "Chapter 285 Florida Man Forces His Son to Marry Vaporeon to Breed the Ultimate Pokemon\nChapter 285 – Florida Man Forces His Son to Marry Vaporeon to Breed the Ultimate Pokemon\nSimba witnessed the memory of Aslan. He saw himself from his father's point of view.\nAslan and his wife carried both Leo and Simba from the lab. He traveled everywhere, hiding them from the grasp of Mao Miaomiao and Eleanor. Countless pursuers died in the hands of Aslan. Even innocent police officers and soldiers who followed their superior's commands got entangled in the conflict and met their demise. The situation quickly escalated as the US military decisively deployed their superweapons.\nThe military followed Aslan to Alaska. A space warship, which the US government bought from Eleanor, unleashed its first nuclear missiles on the North Pole, hoping to kill Aslan and his family. Unfortunately for them, Aslan returned one of them to the sender, destroying the only space warship of mankind.\nA parent can sometimes do unexpected things for his children. After the incident, Aslan directly assassinated the president, wiped out half of the US military, and stole an entire nuclear submarine to threaten the states. He also massacred a million elves, who resided in the country to set an example.\nThe power of a crazy entity terrified the Earthlings. Eventually, the local government yielded.\nAslan was not that merciless. He assumed the presidential title and commanded the US government to protect his family as well as hunt down Mao Miaomiao. He also exposed the inhumane experiment to the world.\nThe crazy father was soon idolized as the IRL superhero. However, many families of deceased soldiers held grudge against him. Half of the country's population rejected his sovereignty and established a new government. Ironically, their leader was Mao Miaomiao, who claimed to have a close tie to Eleanor and divine elves.\nThe remnant elves quickly sided with Mao Miaomiao. They shared their knowledge with the new force and bribed many officials in other countries.\nThe rise of the US shadow government drew the attention of other nations. Many countries openly supported the new regime and denounced Aslan for being a terrorist.\nThe tension sparked a civil war. The glorious United States shattered in half as Aslan's supporters and Mao Miaomiao's supporters collided.\nAt first, Aslan overwhelmed Mao Miaomiao's force with his prowess alone. Elven sages and deities were no match against the genius divine elf in human disguise. Within three days, 90% of the elven forces under Mao Miaomiao perished.\nMao Miaomiao fled the states to the Middle East, where he had secretly formed an alliance with the local princes, promising technologies and immortality.\nThe princes sheltered Mao Miaomiao in exchange for a cultivation method. The mad scientist used these Arabians as a human shield and went into hiding.\nThe defeat of Mao Miaomiao's government solidified Aslan's status as the new dictator. European countries stopped sending support to Mao Miaomiao's forces and switched sides.\nPeace was temporarily restored.\nDuring the peaceful time, Aslan brought his family to Florida, which had become a sanctuary for his troops and his supporters. A naval base and a military base were all there, providing them options if another war might occur.\nLeo and Simba grew up there. Aslan hired private tutors for his two children.\nUnfortunately, there is always a bigger fish. 20 years later, another war broke out.\nThings changed when Eleanor's vanguard forces arrived. A hundred entities descended and wiped out Aslan's country. Only the eastern states, such as Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, and every state beyond these territories survived the purge.\nAslan realized his looming demise as he wasn't strong enough to defeat multiple entities at that time. He secretly drugged his wife, Simba, and Leo before he transported them to Ohio. As for him, he fought to the bitter end.\nThe result was as Aslan had predicted - He was captured while all his soldiers were wiped out. Eleanor also returned and forced Aslan to find his family.\nAnother tragedy struck. Eleanor found Aslan's wife. She killed her and read her memory, which led her to Ohio where Simba was in hiding. As for Leo's location, the wife didn't know as the man already run away from home.\nEleanor cut off Aslan's legs and arms. She dragged him to the children to let them see their miserable father.\nSimba, who had become an adult, revealed his exceptional aptitude for cultivation during the crisis. He defeated an immortal with brute force and caught Eleanor's eyes.\nUnfortunately, a newbie fighter was no match against a veteran entity. Eleanor defeated Simba in one hit and was about to kill him. Before she could deliver the finishing blow, Leo suddenly showed up, holding the mad scientist Mao Miaomiao hostage.\nLeo, at that time, offered a hostage exchange deal. He offered himself to go with Eleanor. In exchange, he wanted Eleanor to spare their lives.\nEleanor was amused. She agreed and let Simba live in exchange for Leo's cooperation. As for Aslan, she refused to release him due to her personal grudge.\nSimba scraped for his life, but Leo and Aslan became Eleanor's prisoners from that day onward.\nWith Aslan and Leo as their captives, Eleanor and Mao Miaomiao celebrated their victory. They resumed the soul transmigration research, using Leo as their prime guinea pig. As for Aslan, he was forced to cooperate or Simba and Leo would be killed.\nWithout a choice, Aslan worked for Mao Miaomiao and Eleanor once more. However, he asked the two dictators for permission to visit Simba once in a while.\nMao Miaomiao and Eleanor allowed Aslan to leave as Leo was in his custody. The father quickly initiated his plan B by injecting Simba's soul with an entity fate crystal. Then, he implanted Simba with a new memory, teaching him a disguise technique so that he could appear as a person of another race. After another meeting, Aslan teleported Simba away to the most unexpected hiding place – an elven planet deep within Eleanor's territory.\nAfter sending Simba away, Aslan cooked a new scheme. Using the entity fate crystal in his soul, he created a backup body for Leo and disguised it as a failed homunculus product. But by doing so, his soul would be trapped inside the entity fate crystal forever as a price. As for his real body, his will and a fragment of his soul would linger, allowing him to command his real body to work temporarily.\nAslan's soul merged with the entity fate crystal and transformed into a worthless rusty ring afterward. As for his fleshly body returned to work as if nothing had happened.\nYears later, Leo's fleshly body reached its prime. His physique was on par with a karmic sovereign, which Mao Miaomiao desired the most. The mad scientist stopped experimenting on Leo.\nThe next phase began. Mao Miaomiao wanted to transfer his soul into Leo's body. However, there was a problem with karma strings and the laws of the universe. Possessing someone else's body was against the karma laws.\nMao Miaomiao came up with a plan. He asked Eleanor to only kill Leo's soul. Fortunately, Aslan was there and overheard their conversation. He volunteered to murder his son.\nAmused by Aslan's offer, Eleanor and Mao Miaomiao gleefully permitted him.\nSeizing this opportunity, the fleshly body of Aslan and his soul fragment performed a ritual. He sacrificed his life and body to become a karma string, which attached to Leo's soul to the entity fate crystal that he had disguised as a rusty ring. Then, he secretly moved the soul into a newly created body in one of the dead homunculus capsules.\nAfter the ritual, Aslan's fleshly body dissipated into dust. Leo's soul migrated from his true body into a new physique. As for the empty shell, it ended up in the hands of Mao Miaomiao.\nAfterward, everything was history.\n.\n.\nSimba slowly opened his wet eyes while shedding tears. The memory of Aslan saddened him.\n\"F-Father. You have done a lot.\" Simba's voice trembled.\n\"Any father would have done the same.\" Aslan chuckled.\n\"…Yeah, I understand that feeling.\"\nSimba was also a father. He also rushed here without planning to rescue his family. Being reminded of his actions, he deeply sighed.\n\"Say, father. By chance, do you know where my wife or my kid is? My system tells me that she was last seen here.\"\nAslan raised his eyebrows in confusion at first, \"You have a wife and a kid?\"\n\"…Yes. That's why I'm here in the first place.\"\n\"I guess Leo accidentally visited your planet and kidnapped your family, huh? Man, sometimes, karma is a bitch...\"\n\"Do you know something, father?\"\n\"Can you show me what they look like?\"\n\"…The photo got burnt.\"\n\"Meh, forget it. I'll read your memory myself. Close your damn eyes!\"\nAslan pointed his fingertip at Simba's forehead and sent a string of karma into his mind. He closed his eyes and slowly digested the information.\nSeveral minutes later, Aslan retracted his karma string. On the other hand, Simba smacked his lips and gazed at Aslan in awe.\nSimba was familiar with this technique. When he did this, the ones getting their memory read always screamed in pain. But in his case, he felt nothing.\n\"How did you do that? I didn't feel any pain at all?\"\nAslan shook his head and sighed, \"You must have been inconsiderate when you used this technique. Instead of trying to plug your karma string inside someone's brain, you should have slid it into a blood vessel. Blood vessels aren't responsive to the nervous system, and the victim cannot feel anything. You can infiltrate someone's brain like this without spooking them.\"\n\"OH!\"\nSimba was enlightened. Again, he shed a tear of joy that he had a smart and caring father.\n\"Anyway, I think I know where they are.\" Aslan changed the subject, \"They're alive and well. But I think your wife has done something to your brother's wife. Man, who asked you two to marry the daughters of that bitch who killed me? You two have no taste at all!\"\n\"…Um, what?\"\n\"I said, you two suck! I wouldn't have complained if you married a Vaporean, a Gardevoir, a fleshlight… or a freaking alligator! Why do you two have to marry Eleanor's daughters!? DAMMIT!!\"\n\"…\"\nAslan bitterly laughed like a cramped-legged hyena having diarrhea.\nWatching his father malding, Simba was speechless. The fatherly image of Aslan shattered, replaced with a toxic loud-mouth nerd of a father.\n\"…Father. You need help.\"\n\"Shut it, you little shit! We're going to see Leo! You can stay here for the time being. I'll bring your wife and kid over in a jiffy!\"\n\"…Thanks, father.\"\nAslan turned around and gave Simba a meaningful look. \"Call me 'Dad', not 'Father'. I cringe every time you call me that.\"\n\"Err. Okay… dad?\"\n\"Yeah, that's better. No more cringe.\"\n\"…\"\nSimba gazed at his father while having a complex feeling. He wondered if he should be overjoyed or depressed because of this weird reunion. Somehow, his father was weird.",

Fortunately, the fight finished in a flash, and both men didn't use any wide-ranged skills. No one was harmed.\nAs soon as Aslan landed on the mystic realm platform, he looked around, observing the stone elf army. He then gave Meowmeow a weird look.\n\"Get some help, Meowmeow.\"\nMeowmeow was offended. He smirked, \"I've been working hard, and you're telling me to get some help? No. YOU get some help. You've contributed nothing.\"\n\"Hah. You have no idea what your wives have done. You almost ruined my plan.\"\n\"Ruin what plan? You lazy ass know nothing.\"\n\"…\"\nAslan shook his head, mentally exhausted from bantering with this immature angel. He shifted his attention to one of Meowmeow's mistresses 'Wei Yuan'.\nWei Yuan also looked back. She flinched as the gaze of Aslan seemed scarier than before. His bloodcurdling glare and Overlord Xiaomao's elderly face were so terrifying that she knelt and lowered her head.\nAslan approached her. He whispered, \"Transfer the prisoner to my dantian universe.\"\nWei Yuan nodded. She ejected a light ball from her stomach and sent it to Aslan. The latter directed it to his dantian and closed his eyes.\nIn Aslan's dantian universe, Ester floated in the void. Her body, covered in a bubble ball, gradually descended upon the white sun. She landed in front of Simba.\nThe husband and wife reunited. The bubble broke, but no one managed to move due to the extreme gravity.\nAslan's consciousness also manifested in the universe. He appeared behind the two and created a one-square-kilometer barrier array. The dome manifested, which lessened the gravity force within the domain.\nSimba and Ester could finally move. They hugged and consoled each other.\nAslan watched his son and daughter-in-law in solemn. A few minutes later, both husband and wife turned to him.\n\"Dad, about our son…\"\nAslan sighed, \"I know. He's somewhere in your brother's territory.\"\n\"Then, can you bring him here?\"\n\"Nope!\"\nSimba's expression turned dark. \"Can I ask why?\"\n\"I'll be taking him as a disciple and raise him myself. You two are in no condition to raise your child.\"\n\"Hah?! Wait a second, you're being unreasonable here. That's our child. Why are you taking him away?\"\nAslan reminded Simba of one fact, \"Have you forgotten what you are made of? It's already a miracle that you can actually reproduce. In fact, you're different from Leo who inherited my flesh and blood. You're a human, but the only human part inside you is your brain. The rest of your body is composed of countless monster parts and mixed blood of various powerful overlords.\"\n\"…\"\nSimba froze. He was aware of that fact. But for Ester, this was her first time hearing this piece of information.\n\"You are what, Simba?!\" Ester was shocked.\nSpeechless and flustered, Simba stuttered, \"I-uh-I'm sorry.\"\nAslan clarified the misunderstanding for the family. \"This is going to be a long explanation. How about we sit down and listen to me.\"\nThe father proceeded to explain everything he had done in the past and revealed his family's secret.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo was mentally exhausted after the brief combat against Simba. He returned to his bus, planning to get a good nap.\nReturning to his bedroom, he tossed his clothes to the floor and dashed into a bathroom. After an hour-long quality bath, he wiped his body and made his way straight to the bed. Without checking the bed, he slipped inside and prepared to enter his dream world.\nSuddenly, his arm touched something.\n\"WAAAAAAAAA!!\"\nThe thing that Leo accidentally touched suddenly cried. Leo widened his eyes and looked at the little thing next to him.\nThere was a little baby boy next to him. He was a light-brown elf infant.\nLeo sat up and gazed at the baby in confusion. He didn't remember having a baby. Moreover, Esen was never pregnant as he had been keeping her status after their sexy time.\n\"Who the hell are you, you little shit? Wait a minute. OH SHIT!!\"\nHe remembered that he accidentally touched the boy. He jumped out of bed and scoured for his clothes, searching for spatial rings that contained Hope and Dream pills.\nIt took Leo a minute to find the ring in the back pocket pants. He brought the pill out and bit his fingertip, extracting his blood. Then, he leaped back to the bed to check the boy's condition.\nThe boy never mutated. On the contrary, he looked healthy. His deep black eyes fixated on Leo's face.\n\"Huh? You're fine?\"\nThe boy stopped crying. He stretched his little arms and opened his palms.\n\"Dah.\"\nThe boy was attracted to Leo's blood. He waved his arms and legs, wanting to get the drop of transparent blood on his fingertip.\nLeo noticed the boy's gaze. He deeply frowned.\n\"Hey, you little brat. My blood is more toxic and poisonous than Chornobyl sewers. If you drink this, you'll turn into a zombie.\"\n\"DAH!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo grumbled. He might be an idiot, but he refused to play with lives. For the sake of the boy, Leo licked his fingertip to get rid of the blood.\nAs soon as Leo drank the blood, the boy wailed.\n\"WAAAAAAAHH!\"\nFacing a crying baby, Leo facepalmed. He picked the boy up and wrapped him with a dry towel. He purchased a pet bed from the system store and put the baby on it.\nThe boy stopped crying again. He looked around him in curiosity.\nLeo was relieved. Ignoring the responsibility, he returned to bed and was fast asleep.\nHowever, the nightmarish experience of keeping a baby had just begun. An hour later, the boy screamed.\nHe was hungry. He also defecated.\nThe foul smell of the baby's feces woke up Leo. He got out of bed and rushed to the source of annoyance.\n\"You…\"\n\"WAAAAAAAHH!!\"\nLeo had enough. He stripped the dirty towel and burnt it. Then, he carried the poop-stained boy out of the bus.\nAlong the way out of his bus, he ran into Beatrice, who had just clocked off work for the day. She noticed the boy and the dirty butt.\n\"Your Majesty… The boy…\"\nLeo grinned as he found a victim. He shoved the boy to Beatrice.\n\"I don't know how this little critter got to my bed. Find his parents and get him outta here. He dirtied my room.\"\n\"…This elf…\"\nBefore Beatrice could explain, Leo already stomped back to his room. He shut the door behind him.\n\"…\"",

He then gazed at the quest menu to check the progress.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 4/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 500,000 Years of Lifespan, One Selectable SR Building, Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 20, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 20\nPhase Three Tasks (7/10 Completed) - Get married (0/1)\n- Complete monthly PVP three times (1/3)\n- Complete mystic realm expedition three times (2/3)\n- Top-Up one time (Done)\n- Obtain two true earth fate crystal (Done)\n- Defeat 100 deities (Done)\n- Upgrade shopping mall to level 17 (Done)\n- Spend at least 1,000,000 years of lifespan system items (Done)\n- Manufacture at least 2,000 weapons using strategic resources.

(Done)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nThe fourth phase reached the bottleneck because of the monthly PVP and the expedition requirement. It would take 2 or 3 more months to complete it all.\nIn addition, the quest reminded Leo that he hadn't used the PVP mode for a long time. It had been months since he last visited the Fate Stadium.\nLeo wanted to get up, but he soon fell asleep because of the mental exhaustion.\n.\n'After the wedding, I guess. Come to think of it, I need to talk to Esen about the wedding arrangement.'\nLeo wanted to get up, but he soon fell asleep because of the mental exhaustion.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Esen and Ivy returned home with a herd of perverted bulls. They brought them to the agricultural world and shoved the responsibility to Sierra.\nEsen approached the Minotaur woman and chatted with her.\n\"I've brought something you will surely love, cow tits. Look at these stupid pervert bulls. I got them from the Joyous Yin-Yang Sect whatsoever!\"\nEsen expected a reaction from the pervert Minotaur woman. After all, this woman had been harassing her husband and seducing him for a while. Distracting this woman away from Leo was her idea.\nSierra was confused at first. When the bulls arrived, her expression changed. She knew what they were.\nInstead of being delighted, she complained.\n\"How unsightly. I can't believe we originate from the same species… Anyway, thank you for your contribution, my lady. I won't be raising them here. This inferior subspecies is best on the grill. Breeding them is a waste of space and time.\"\nEsen was taken aback, \"I thought you would treasure your comrades.\"\n\"What comrade? I'm civilized a Tauron, not some horny bulls or cows. They are not qualified to grant me seeds. The only one capable of doing so is obviously master.\"\n\"…Do you have any idea what you're talking about?\" Esen's face twitched. She couldn't believe that the woman had the balls to express her true desire in front of her face.\n\"Of course. I wish Master could milk me. When I'm in season, I wish he could breed me.\"\nEsen's expression turned dark. She let out a long sigh and looked at Ivy.\n\"Can we convince my husband to kill this cow?\"\nIvy shook her head, \"I'm afraid we should not. The Lord has been busy these days, and he needs every help he can get. Personal vendetta is out of the question, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Are you even on my side?!\" Esen pouted.\n\"I'm on your side. However, it's up to you to convince the lord yourself,\" Ivy leaned over and whispered, sending a sound transmission to her master's mind. \"Just make sure you keep him occupied at night every day. As long as he's happy in bed, he won't have enough time to look at other women.\"\nHearing the piece of advice, Esen smirked. She laughed at Sierra, \"Too bad for you. That's an impossible wish! I'll make sure he won't even have a drop of seed left when you're in season!\"\nSierra gazed at Esen with her usual dull expression, \"Then, I wish you take care of your body, my lady. I really hope you know what you're getting yourself into.\"\n\"Ha! You don't even need to warn me! I'll show you how it's done!\"\nEsen laughed and led Ivy out of the agriculture realm.\nAfter Esen and Ivy had left, Sierra snickered and secretly mocked Esen.\n\"Satisfying a transcended being? You will need to please him at least 4 billion times per second, my lady. His vigor is limitless, but your stamina will run out first.\"\nUnfortunately for Esen, she couldn't hear Sierra's advice. The divine elf princess paraded to the motorhome, where she and Leo usually spent their nights.\nBut upon entering the bus, Esen and Ivy found Beatrice and Marc. In the death knight's arms, there was a brown baby.\nEsen and Ivy gave Beatrice a weird look. They swept their gazes over Marc for a moment before they uttered in unison.\n\"Is that yours?\"\nMarc repeatedly shook his head, \"O-Of course not!!\"\nEsen and Ivy looked at Beatrice next. They widened their eyes, \"Then, who is the father, Beatrice?!\"\nBeatrice slightly shook her head. She was also puzzled, \"The lord, maybe?\"\n\"HAH?!\"\nEsen almost fainted from shock. On the other hand, Ivy raised her eyebrows as she had a funny feeling about this baby boy. Preventing the misunderstanding from escalating, Ivy tried to clarify things.\n\"First off, Beatrice. This is not your child, correct?\"\nBeatrice nodded. She also let out a long sigh of relief because of Ivy's quick thinking. Still, Esen hadn't recovered from the shock.\nIvy asked for more input, \"Is he the lord's biological child?\"\nBeatrice shook her head, \"Maybe, or maybe not. He smells like the lord, but he doesn't have his blood. It feels like he's a distant cousin or something.\"\n\"I see. Did you hear that, Your Majesty?\" Ivy smiled and looked at Esen.\nMeanwhile, Esen ignored the group. She stomped toward Leo's bedroom and got inside. When she discovered him sleeping soundly, Esen delivered a body-press like a professional wrestler. However, she ended up hurting herself doing the deed.\nThe impact was enough to wake up Leo. He sat up and stared at his weirdo wife, \"What are you doing?\"\nEsen, in frustration, jumped back on the bed and sat on top of him. She took off her clothes and yelled.\n\"GIVE ME A BABY!!\"\n\"WHAT?!\" Leo was confused.\n\"SHUT UP AND MAKE ME A BABY!!\"\n\"HAH?!\"\nEsen pushed Leo down on the bed. Even though she didn't have enough strength to make him budge, Leo allowed himself to fall back into the bed.\n.\nIvy, Beatrice, and Marc sneaked into the room later and discovered their lords. They silently left them alone.\nMarc's face was so red that white smoke came out from his ears. Ivy held back her laughter while Beatrice was as expressionless as ever.\nWhen Ivy noticed Marc's expression, she teased him.\n\"Was it too stimulating for you, little boy?\"\nMarc pouted, \"Who are you calling a boy?! I'm old enough to be an adult!\"\n\"Hehehe. But you've been sneaking glances at your sister, didn't you?\"\n\"W-WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!\"\nMarc got so flustered that he waved his hands and arms. Despite the rejection, he glanced at Beatrice's face again.\nBeatrice also noticed her brother's eyes. She let out a long sigh, \"I also think it's about time for you to find a good wife. How about it, Marc? Ivy has been with us for over 10,000 years. Will you consider her as a prospect?\"\n\"W-What are you talking about?!\" Marc was even more confused.\nIvy was surprised at first. But she teased him again, \"My, my. I didn't know that you fancied me. Well, if you don't mind an arch lich hag like me, I'll do my very best to please our little Dullahan.\"\nMarc screamed in embarrassment and sprinted out of the bus. Ivy heartily giggled while Beatrice revealed a faint smile.\nAfter Marc was gone, Beatrice stopped smiling. She asked Ivy in a serious tone.\n\"I was serious, though. Will you consider my brother, Ivy?\"\nIvy snorted, \"He likes you, though.\"\nBeatrice rolled her eyes, \"He's my brother.\"\n\"I know. But shouldn't you be clear about his feelings?\"\n\"If I do, he will break. It's better to let another woman win his heart. That way, he can forget about this sinful thought.\"\n\"…True. But why me, though?\"\n\"How long are you going to remain single? Another 10,000 years?\"\n\"…\"\nIvy rubbed her chin. She started thinking about her love life. When she thought about it, no one but Marc's face came to her mind.\n\"Tsk. I'm out of options. Fine, I'll take whoever wants me.\"\n\"Good choice!\" Beatrice grinned.\n\"What about you?! You're as old as I am. How are you going to find your mate?\"\nBeatrice finally showed her proud smile. She then revealed a shocking piece of information.\n\"I have a prospect in my mind.\"\n\"WOW! YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON SOMEONE?! WHO IS IT?!\"\n\"Hmm. It's someone stoic and funny. I won't tell you who.\"\n\"TELL ME MORE! I NEED TO KNOW NOW!!\"\n\"That's a secret.\"\nIvy's laughter echoed throughout the bus while other molgs and former undead warriors in the bus lobby silently eavesdropped on their conversation.\n.\nMeanwhile, in a small house, a certain alchemist was busy watching a VTuber video and cried. Wu Buyi lamented.\n\"Why do you have to graduate Coco?! You were so bright! How dare those people bully you into quitting?! The world you're in is not fair-ACHOO!!\"\nWhile crying, Wu Buyi sneezed. His boogers and snot drenched the phone.\n\"FUUUUUUUUUUCK!! MY PRECIOUS PHONE! NOOOOO!!\"\nHe took off his shirt and wiped the phone in panic. But while doing it, he sneezed again.\n\"AAAACHOOOOOO!! GOD DAMMIT! WHO'S BADMOUTHING ME?!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 288 – Wedding Tumble: Florida Man's Feast Turns Dance Floor into Slip 'n Slide Diarrhea Fest\nLater that day, Aslan visited Leo's bus. The guards in front of the bus bowed toward him and allowed him inside.\nUpon entering the bus, Aslan found himself in the lobby area. He looked around and found a dozen death knights, guarding this resident from potential intruders who could teleport directly into the bus.\nAslan nodded at them in approval. He turned his attention to the deepest part of the bus where Leo's room was located. As he walked further, the corner of his eyes detected a group of female molgs. They had been looking at something in a basket.\nCurious, Aslan walked toward them. When he could see the basket, he found what he had been looking for.\n\"There you are.\"\nInstead of taking the kid, Aslan snickered. He turned around and left the bus.\nUpon looking behind him, he found Ivy and Beatrice who were about to leave the bus as well. Their eyes met, and they greeted.\n\"Sir Guardian, what are you doing here?\" Inquired Ivy.\n\"Just checking the kid. Carry on.\"\nIvy raised her eyebrows, suspicious of the guardian. She probed for information, \"Do you know anything about the child? The Lord has entrusted him to us for some reason.\"\n\"Ah, him? I'll be taking him as my disciple. But for now, I'll have to ask you to be his nanny. Can you do it?\"\n\"…But none of us has any experience in this.\"\n\"I see. Oh, wait. I know. I'll bring him to Sierra, then.\"\nIvy wryly smiled as she could imagine Sierra breastfeeding the baby. Thinking about it for a second, she almost burst into laughter.\n\"Please do, sir. She's fit for the task.\"\n\"Good. I'll be taking the kid.\"\nAslan picked up the basket and left the bus. He visited the agricultural world next.\nSierra gazed at the brown baby. She brightly smiled at the boy. Without shame, she took off her shirt and revealed a massive pair of watermalones.\n.\nAgricultural World\nSierra gazed at the brown baby. She brightly smiled at the boy. Without shame, she took off her shirt and revealed a massive pair of watermalones.\n\"Can I really ask him to milk me? Can I ask him to sucky-suck mine?\"\nAslan was speechless. He silently wished for Simba and Ester's forgiveness as he was about to entrust their child to this pervert Minotaur.\n\"Do whatever you want. Make sure he grows up healthy… physically and morally.\"\n\"Don't worry, guardian. I shall raise him to be my finest stud. His life purpose shall be dedicated to me, my breasts, and the milking procedure! If necessary, I'll teach him how to mate with females-\"\n\"Never mind. I'll find another nanny.\" Aslan changed his mind.\n\"NO, PLEASE! LET ME RAISE THE BOY!\"\nSierra wailed and held Aslan by his legs. The latter sweated profusely even though he was a golem statue.\n\"…\"\nAslan hesitated. He knew that he couldn't trust this pervert cow woman, but nobody was trustworthy enough to take this role.\n'I can't bring Ester out either. If Ester and Esen met, Esen would probably kill her. It's already a miracle that Ester is still alive so far.'\nNot trusting Esen's temperament, Aslan chose to hide Ester in his dantian universe. Moreover, sending the boy back to his mother in his dantian universe was out of the question since the place was too dangerous for a mortal infant. Only deities or strong immortals could withstand the pressure and the extreme gravity of his giant stars.\n\"Fine. You take care of him. But if he grows up to be a pervert like you, I'll tell the lord to dismiss you.\"\nSierra beamed at Aslan with her brightest smile. She pressed the baby boy's face against her chest, \"You can count on my pregnancy… I mean, you can count on me!\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nTwo days later, Leo finally exited his room. Strangely, his skin was smoother and glossier than usual. He looked so healthy that the molgs and Ivy's subordinates were surprised.\nLeo whistled in a good mood and left the bus. After he had left, Ivy sneaked into Leo's room to check on her master.\nOn the bed, Esen was out of commission. She lay on her stomach. The traces of two days' worth of bed combat stained the bed sheets, blanket, carpet, and Esen's body. Despite the carnage, Esen's expression was strangely lewd as if she had been through a wild night.\nIvy giggled. She was happy for her master.\n\"Congratulations, Your Majesty. If he was this energetic, that stupid cow can't possibly take him away from you.\"\n.\n.\nLeo adjusted his pants. His body was strangely lighter than usual.\nWhen Leo exited his bus, he found Dongfang Mei and a few of her workers waiting to receive him. They reported the completion of their job.\n\"My lord. We have finalized your wedding ceremony schedule. The invitation letters have been distributed. You and Lady Esen will attend the official ceremony tomorrow at noon.\"\n\"Oh, I guess I've come out at a good time.\" Leo was relieved.\n\"Yes. I was planning to request Lady Ivy to inform you about your wedding.\"\n\"Good. What do I need to know or prepare, by the way?\"\nDongfang Mei deeply sighed, \"Please follow us to the hotel. We need to measure you and tailor your clothes. Also, we have to finish tailoring the bridge's dress as well. Can we visit Lady Esen?\"\n\"Err…\"\nLeo thought of Esen's condition. He scratched his head, \"You can ask Ivy for that. She will measure my wife's three sizes for you. I don't think she's in a good condition to meet anybody at the moment.\"\nDongfang Mei was perplexed for a moment before she figured it out. The elder covered her mouth and giggled, \"Please save your stamina for the wedding night, my lord. I know that you love her, but please don't overly LOVE her before the ceremony.\"\n\"…I'll try.\"\n\"Please follow me.\"\nDongfang Mei and her subordinates silently laughed while they guided Leo to their tailors.\nThe preparation for the wedding ceremony took all day. Leo got stuck in the hotel as Dongfang Mei and Xu Nuan rehearsed the event before the important day.\n.\n.\nWedding Day, 5 AM.\nAlthough the event seemed abrupt, everybody had been preparing for this day for months. Merchants, cultivators, and Leo's employees brought their gifts and treasures to the hotel, hoping to gain Leo's favor.\nHowever, no one could enter the hotel yet. In front of the hotel, Dongfang Mei and Meowmeow's elf concubines blocked the entrance. Instead of letting everybody in, they inspected the visitors' name tags one by one.\nEverybody was forced to register their name and hand over their presents. Then, the staff gave them a wooden plaque, which indicated their seat number.\nA merchant wrote his name on the paper as instructed. Although reluctant, he presented a wooden box to the female employees behind the reception counter.\n\"In this box, I've stored a precious 300-year-old spirit ginseng. Please inform Lord Florida Man that the Ginseng Pharmacy's director Wang Ao sends his regards.\"\nOne of the staff politely accepted the box, yet she mercilessly opened it to inspect the content. Then, she showed it to a stone elf next to her.\nThe golem gazed at it. Then, she gave it a score.\n\"Two points.\"\nThe receptionist nodded. She handed a wooden plague with a string of numbers.\n\"Table 10288, seat 5.\"\nThe merchant was confused but he received the plague nonetheless. Then, he followed another staff to his designated seat.\nWhen he entered a meeting hall, he discovered an endless field full of round tables, covered in white sheets. On the tables, empty plates and wine grasses were already prepared.\nThey were modern round tables, commonly found in modern Chinese restaurants. However, there was one issue – The table was not in the same room as the wedding event!\n\"Hah?! Why here? What about the wedding?!\"\nAn employee sighed and pointed at a large TV monitor on the wall. She whispered, \"You can view the event here, sir. The TVs will show the ceremony in the main hall.\"\nWang Ao was confused. As he had never seen a TV before, he stood up and pointed at the black screens.\n\"What do you mean by TEE-VEES?! Why can't I take part in the main hall?!\"\nThe employee's smile never faded from her face. She calmly responded in a friendly voice tone, \"Sir, this is a wedding ceremony between top experts. Do you expect to join the same table as immortals and gods from other worlds?\"\nWang Ao was taken aback, \"B-But my gift is very precious! A-At least, he should give me face and...\"\nThe employee gave the merchant an ultimatum by pulling out a treasure. The item was one of many treasures that Leo and his men got from the dead invaders. Although Leo never ordered anybody to sell them, the manager mannequin put them in the supermarket once in a while to boost the sales. In addition, there was a mysterious event 'BLACK FRIDAY' when Leo went on an expedition. At that time, many items were on discount, and several good artifacts were on sale.\nThe staff managed to snag this spiritual steel fan, which was capable of blocking any attack from a quasi-immortal! Moreover, she could pay with installments of 12 months, which cost only 50 essence stones or 50 years of lifespan per month.\nSeeing the treasure, Wang Ao was speechless. He stuttered, \"Umm, f-fairy miss. W-What is that?\"\n\"Of course, it's a mortal-grade treasure.\"\n\"Then, w-why do you bring it out? Are you threatening me? I-I'm only a mortal without a cultivation base! P-Please don't bully me!\"\n\"Who said I'm bullying you? I'm only showing you what a proper gift looks like. Unless you can procure something of this standard at the minimum, you can't possibly hope to get preferential treatment! Please understand your position, dear guest.\"\n\"O-Okay.\"\nWang Ao sulked and sat at his table. He regretted spending months and a lot of gold coins to get that ginseng.\nFortunately, the hotel employees were not that heartless. Even though the ceremony hadn't started yet, a waitress brought over a plate of food and a bottle of wine. She served it to Wang Ao.\n\"The wedding starts at noon. It might be boring to sit here without anything to do. Please enjoy this while you're waiting, sir.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nWang Ao sighed and looked at the parting employee. He smacked his lips as everybody was all cultivators, and a commoner like him couldn't possibly talk back to them.\nAs he had nothing to do, he gazed at the plate of food and a bottle of wine on the table. On the plate was a sunny-side egg, five stripes of bacon, a spoonful of boiled potatoes, garlic bread, and some salad.\nWang Ao snorted as he recognized some of the food, except for the garlic bread, salad, and bacon. As he didn't think much, he picked up a pair of chopsticks and started eating.\nUpon putting a piece of bacon in his mouth, he widened his eyes in astonishment. The warmth of the food and Qi enveloped his mouth and stimulated his taste buds.\nWang Ao froze on the table as the Qi from the food entered his veins and muscle fibers. He started breaking a sweat.\nWhile Wang Ao was sweating profusely, the previous waitress returned with a clean towel and a bathrobe. She then whispered, \"After you eat your food, you can take a shower in the bathroom at the end of the hall over there, sir. Actually, you can take a shower every time you eat a mouthful of your food. The impurity in your body might come out of your pores. As you know, impurity of mortals smells… unpleasant.\"\nWang Ao widened his eyes and looked at the bath towel. He then glanced at the food on the plate.\nWithout saying anything, Wang Ao grabbed the plate and the towel. He then ran toward the bathroom while gas inside his belly threatened to release everything through the number 2 hole.\nThe waitress giggled. She brought the wine bottle to the bathroom and placed it in front of the stall, where Wang Ao disappeared into.\nOne customer down, many more to go.",

      "content": "289  Surprise Gift at Florida Man's Wedding: Guests Unwrap Bag of... Fertilizer?!\nChapter 289 – Surprise Gift at Florida Man's Wedding: Guests Unwrap Bag of... Fertilizer?!\nThe registration progressed smoothly after the guests learned the trick. They handed over their gifts and received numbered plaques according to the value of their items.\nMost commoners and weak cultivators were sent to a meeting hall on either the first floor or the second floor, according to the value of their gifts. The waitresses served food, and all none cultivators got into the same predicament as Wang Ao. Only intermediate-level cultivators enjoyed their food without an issue.\nThe size of the hotel was also impressive. Two thousand guests entered the second floor's meeting rooms, but seats were still available. Moreover, the washrooms and bathrooms were never fully occupied even though half of the visitors had bowel movement issues.\nAt 8 AM, groups of stronger cultivators arrived. Led by Han Hao, a team of elite disciples under his guidance made their appearance. As a representative of his group, he showed the receptionist his wedding gift.\nIt was a glowing red sword, emitting intense yang Qi. Originally, it was an immortal-grade sword that belonged to one of the invaders. However, Han Hao tampered with it himself. \"Here is my gift 'Enchanted Immortal Slaying Sword'. I may not be an expert blacksmith, but I know a thing or two in the art of treasure refinement.\"\nThe commoners behind Han Hao's group were surprised to see a real artifact among the gifts. Some of them broke their queues to admire the weapon.\nStill, a few people questioned Han Hao's item.\nWu Buyi emerged out of the crowd. Unlike his usual antics, he wore proper robes. His body emitted no foul odor despite being a nerd who only took a bath once a week.\n\"An immortal-grade sword? Are you crazy, Han Hao? This is an important wedding. You should have brought something better!\"\nHan Hao snorted, \"Jokes on you. My sword might look inferior in your eyes, but it contains the dao of the sword! Anybody who holds it and uses it for a month can naturally learn the dao of swords! Even if the sword owner doesn't train every day, he will still gain enlightenment!\"\nThe crowd murmured in astonishment. Regular merchants and commoners drooled in envy as they had no mentor to guide them. They wished that they had the sword.\n\"As expected of the disciplinary elder. His sword might not be useful for the lord, but he can use it to pass down the sword daos to his descendants! Such gift will surely impress Lord Florida Man!\" One of the guests praised.\n\"Indeed. The quality of the item isn't everything. It's about the usefulness of the gift that counts!\" Another bystander chimed in.\nHan Hao puffed his chest and glanced at his colleague, \"How's that? What's your gift? Do you think you can come up with something better than me?\"\n\"Pfft. You braggart knows nothing. Here, hold my beer!\"\nWu Buyi cut the queue and stood in front of the counter. He presented a spatial ring to a receptionist.\nThe staff members received it and ejected a sample of the goods. A bottle of rainbow liquid came out.\nWu Buyi explained, \"My wedding gifts are 1,000 bottles of purified rainbow river! As you know, the southern river of our domain is heavily contaminated because of Lord Florida Man's pet. However, that doesn't mean that the contaminated water is unusable. As a veteran alchemist, I've dedicated months to research and come up with a purifying technique, which enables me to make the river water consumable! I call these 'Florida Drinking Water' to honor our lord's name! Also, I've tested it before. Anybody who drinks this can gain at least 1,000 years' worth of cultivation!\"\n\"HUH?!\"\nAlthough the domain was rich in cultivation resources and cultivation methods, most of them were inconvenient. For example, every employee could cultivate near the pylon tower for free, but they had to compete for the limited available seats.\nIn addition, consumable goods were expensive. Every grain pill had a price tag in Leo's store. Even the food cost essence stones. Despite the high cost of living, every cultivator yearned for Leo's cultivation resources because of their exceptional quality.\nThe emergence of a new cultivation resource aroused their desire and greed. Every cultivator gazed at the water bottle and salivated.\n\"S-Sir Wu, c-could you share the refinement method?\" A cultivator in the crowd asked.\nWu Buyi snorted, \"Ha, no! I've already presented the method along with the samples! The notes are already inside!\"\nA receptionist heard it. She ejected a book to check its authenticity. After flipping a few pages, she nodded.\n\"Here is your plaque, sir. You can attend the wedding on the fourth floor. Also, here is your room's key card. The Lord has instructed us to book a room for every VIP. You can stay in the designated room for a week, sir.\"\n\"Oh, nice!\" Wu Buyi laughed and took the table plaque and the keycard. He turned around to sneer at his friend. \"I wonder what floor you will get. First floor? Second floor? Hehehehe.\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao grumbled and shifted his gaze to the receptionist in front of him, waiting for her verdict.\nThe receptionist wryly smiled. Although she was a member of the Tang Clan, she was instructed not to give anybody preferential treatment. Thus, she picked a plaque on her desk and revealed the result.\n\"Sir Han Hao. You can attend the wedding on the third floor.\"\n\"T-Third floor?\" Han Hao was taken aback.\n\"I-I'm sorry, sir. I'm just following the guidebook. Weapons are less valuable than consumable goods according to the lord, sir.\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao was crestfallen while Wu Buyi cackled like a villain. The former turned around and pointed his finger at Wu Buyi.\n\"Don't get cocky, you little shit! Just because you're close to the lord, that doesn't mean you're superior to your peers!\"\n\"Heh, LOSER!\"\n\"YOU!\"\nHan Hao wanted to punch his friend in the face, but he was wary of the stone elves in the area. He smacked his lips and followed the lines out of the queuing area.\nBut as Han Hao was about to leave, his son followed the queue from the other line and presented his gift. Although he was Han Hao's son, they didn't share the same idea.\n\"Here is an ingot, smelted from the hull of broken otherworldly artifacts. I don't know what it is, but I think Lord Florida Man can appraise it. I hope it can be put to good use.\"\nThe receptionist in front of him was a former disciple of the Amazonian Sanctuary. She was as confused as the others when she received the item. But when she glanced at the guideline instructions on her desk, she wryly smiled and reluctantly gave Han Hao a few items.\n\"Here is your plaque, sir. You can attend the wedding on the fifth floor. Also, here is your keycard to your room. The King Suite section is on the 10th floor, and you can rest in the room for a month. All three meals will be provided for free, and you can order it by using the room service.\"\nHan Hao and Wu Buyi froze in their tracks. They turned around in unison. \"WHAT?!\"\nBoth of them stomped toward the young maiden. They inherited the spirits of Karens and yelled at her face.\n\"WHY ARE YOU SENDING HIM TO THE FIFTH FLOOR?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR GIFTS?!\"\nThe receptionist sweated profusely while the others next to her also flinched in fear. Fortunately, their superior officers had predicted this outcome and prepared for such a scenario.\nAn attractive lady slowly walked out of the office. She patted the nervous receptionists behind the counter and took over the role.\nDongfang Mei smiled at Wu Buyi and Han Hao. She explained, \"Don't be angry, you senile geezers. We're family here.\"\n\"But your subordinate…!\" Han Hao pointed at the girls.\n\"Listen here, you little shit!\" Dongfang Mei released her aura of an immortal. She stared down at Han Hao and Wu Buyi, \"If you want to blame someone, you can blame our lord for setting up with this criteria. I'll read it for you. 'Give preferential treatment to anyone who brings RARE MATERIALS. Give respectable treatment to anyone who CONTRIBUTED TO TECHNICAL RESEARCH! ANYBODY who brings non-consumable items or non-mineral items to the wedding should be sent to the third floor. Common items, to the first or second floor. Unless someone wants to give me a freaking spaceship, don't ask for my presence!' There you have it. Any question?\"\nWu Buyi and Han Hao were baffled. They looked at each other before they internally screamed in frustration.\n\"DAMMIT! I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!!\"\n\"I KNEW IT! WHY DIDN'T I THINK ABOUT THIS?!\"\nDongfang Mei sneered and waved her hands, shooing them away.\n\"Now, get lost, you idiots. Don't waste other people's time. We have more guests to welcome and entertain! SHOO! SHOO! Oh, junior Han Meng, you can head to the fifth floor. There's only one meeting room there. If you follow the sign, you won't miss it.\"\nHan Meng dryly laughed and glanced at his father and his uncle. As he had expected, Wu Buyi and Han Hao glared at him as if he had violated their grandmothers.\nThe three troublemakers left the scene quietly. Still, the commotion caused a stir among the crowd. Many commoners and merchants who initially brought rare herbs, medicines, or artifacts left the queuing lines to fix their presents.\nAfter the uproar, the following guests started showing weird items.\nA bundle of dirt near the contaminated water, a piece of obsidian, a bag of lava badger's poops – Weird stuff kept showing up as presents.\nDespite their attempts, Dongfang Mei and the employees were merciless. They had predicted this outcome, and they sent every weirdo to the first floor as punishment.\nThen, some idiots thought they were clever. They bundled a package of essence stones and presented them as gifts for the employees instead of handing over a wedding gift.\n\"Lady Dongfang Mei. Here is our sincerity. Could you please give us a plaque to the fifth floor?\" One of the merchant groups gave Dongfang Mei a bag of 50 essence stones as a bribe.\nDongfang Mei widely grinned. She accepted the bribe in glee. However, her next words shocked the merchants.\n\"Security, please escort these men out of the premises. They are banned from taking part in the wedding.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\" The merchant group was shocked.\n\"Thank you for your present, my dear. But since you don't have a present for the lord, you cannot enter this place. NOW, GET LOST!\"\n\"NO! WAIT!!\"\nIt was too late for the crowd of greedy merchants. Stone elves dragged the people out of the building.\n.\nThe hectic day continued as more people wished to attend the wedding. Because the front gate's reception counter was inadequate to sort over 10,000 guests, more employees came out of the building to help. Meowmeow also brought his concubines over to maintain the order.\nBy 10 AM, most of the guests were seated. Unfortunately, latecomers could not join this wedding ceremony as the first and second-floor seats were full.\nAs only the third floor or higher floors were available, most of the people left in disappointment. Still, this gave an opportunity to cultivators who were rich in resources.\nTang Xuan and Tang Tian came out of their seclusion and entered the hotel. They presented their gifts at the same time.\nTang Tian presented a diary, which contained his insight and his dao of poison. As for Tang Xuan, he presented an alchemy recipe book.\nDongfang Mei smiled at the two. Not even a blink of hesitation, she presented them keycards to King Suites and the plaque to the fifth floor.\n\"Congratulations, gentlemen. You are very thoughtful!\"\nBoth Tangs laughed, \"Smart men thoroughly prepare. Only silly men rush in.\"\n\"True,\" Dongfang Mei giggled.",

Most of them left in regret, lamenting that they should have come earlier than the people before them.\nStill, several cultivators fought for the seats on the third floor. Tiger Swordsman was one of them.\nUnlike the rogue cultivators, Tiger Swordsman understood the nature of Leo. He presented a round crystal to Dongfang Mei.\n\"Here is a 9th-grade monster core that I have been keeping for ages. I was planning to ask an alchemist to refine it, but I don't think I need this anymore. I hope our lord still needs this.\"\nDongfang Mei brightly smiled and nodded at Tiger Swordsman, \"You're correct! Lord Florida Man is always in need of such material. Here is your keycard and the plaque. Your seat is on the fourth floor.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nTiger Swordsman took the keycard and the plaque. The token showed the number of a seat on the fourth floor.\n\"F-Fourth floor's seat?!\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"B-But that core isn't that valuable…\"\n\"A man's trash is another man's treasure. Have you heard about that?\"\n\"…Yeah, I read that from one of the purchased books.\"\n\"Now, don't waste my time. Pack your things and enjoy. We need to welcome other guests.\"\n\"…\"\nTiger Swordsman reluctantly nodded and followed a path to the elevator.\nMeanwhile, the crowd finally grasped a clue to pass Dongfang Mei's test. They started offering monster cores, hoping to get a good seat in this ceremony.\n\"Fairy, I have a sixth-stage monster core. Can I join?\"\nDongfang Mei grinned, but she shook her head. \"Only the 9th grade monster cores or better are eligible. We don't need weaker cores.\"\nThe crowd was disappointed. This time, most of the rogue cultivators gave up and left.\nAfter most of the crowd was gone, the hotel entrance was clear. This allowed many groups of observers and strong employees of the domain to come in.\nThe gang of ponies arrived. As this was an important event, Taxi, Ricardo, and their friends polymorphed into humans. They also wore black suits and formal clothes.\nTaxi and everybody presented their gifts. They placed strange horns on the table.\n\"Smash!\"\nDongfang Mei deeply sighed as she was familiar with the SMASH language. She counted their heads and asked.\n\"How many horns?\"\n\"SMASH!\" (100! Everybody donates each!)\n\"I see. That must be painful.\"\n\"Smash.\" (Compared to what Florida Man gave us, this is nothing. Our horns can regrow.)\n\"Good. Then, I'll be taking these. You can go straight to the fourth floor.\"\n\"Smash?\" (Not fifth floor?! But we're comrades!)\n\"The lord limits the entries on the fifth floor. He values privacy. Also, he informed us that he doesn't want to meet too many people today. If you want to congratulate him, you can do so later.\"\n\"…Smash. Smash?\" (Fine. I'll chat with him later. Oh, by the way, do we get to play in the new rooms? I mean, there are a few female unicorns in season. We hope we can…)\n\"Dammit, you freaking pervert horses! Do it in your goddamn barn, not in this hotel! I forbid you to revert back into your horse form! You also cannot copulate with your mates!\"\n\"SMASH!!\" (NUUUUUU!!)\n\"NOW, GET LOST!\"\nThe group of ponies in disguise sulked and took their items. They proceeded to the fourth floor as instructed.\nDongfang Mei shook her head as she gave up on these perverted creatures. She wished that these guys could adapt to the human culture and ethics soon.\nAfter Taxi's people got their seats, the next batch of youngsters entered. Jin Yong, Gao Yan, Cat, and Yao Qiqi arrived with strange red bags.\nCat was in her humanoid form. Unlike the usual, she wore a white evening dress like a proper lady. Moreover, her demeanor and the way she walked were so refined that Dongfang Mei almost mistook her for a noble lady.\nYao Qiqi was the same as ever. She tagged along with Cat, holding her hand like siblings. The girl had been quiet for a long time as she had been in seclusion in the shopping mall every day. In addition, her cultivation was already in the quasi-immortal realm.\nWhen Dongfang Mei saw Yao Qiqi with this group, she flinched. She didn't expect the innocent girl to be this close to these troublemakers.\nThe elder looked at Gao Yan and Jin Yong. She inquired, \"You two are out already? How are your injuries?\"\nDongfang Mei referred to the old injuries that Gao Yan and Jin Yong got from the Cow Level Realm.\nThe duo brightly grinned and curled their arms, flexing their muscles.\n\"We're healed, senior,\" Gao Yan laughed.\n\"Our medicines and pills are the best in this world. Obviously, we easily made it through!\" Jin Yong snickered while he fetched a notebook from his storage ring. He put it on top of the counter.\nDongfang Mei gazed at the notebook. She revealed a faint smile, \"An annotation? A cultivation method? What are you offering?\"\nJin Yong puffed his chest, \"I've come up with a healing pill recipe! Although the ingredients require poisonous mushrooms, they can turn into a panacea, which can cure most mortal-grade poisons!\"\n\"But the store already has the Hope and Dream pills for sale though. Do you think Lord Florida Man needs this?\"\n\"We can try. It's my honest research. Well, he might find one or two inspirations from my note.\"\nDongfang Mei liked Jin Yong's attitude. She also rechecked the young man's cultivation base.\nShe couldn't help but impress. The external aura of Jin Yong was the same as any earth celestial, aka the first rank immortal. But deep in his dantian, Dongfang Mei sensed the turbulence of star energy, which reflected the nature of a celestial warrior – the fifth stage immortal.\nDongfang Mei was envious of Tang Xuan and Tang Tian that they had this young man as their core disciple. Since his future cultivation potential was limitless, Dongfang Mei gave him an exception.\n\"You go to the fifth floor. The room keycard is here. Don't waste this opportunity.\"\nJin Yong was surprised, \"I thought I would have gotten a pass to the third floor at best. Why the highest, senior?\"\n\"Just shut it and go. Also, take the notes with you. Give it to Lord Florida Man yourself.\"\nJin Yong dryly laughed and received his notebook back. He politely cupped his fist and bowed 90 degrees, \"I'll remember this favor, senior. When I reach the pinnacle realm, I'll come back and repay you.\"\n\"That sounds cliché as hell. Move along, you brat! Give the room to your friends behind you!\"\n\"Hahaha!\"\nJin Yong laughed and followed the employees to the elevator to the fifth floor. He didn't forget to turn around and taunted Gao Yan, \"Good luck, Gao Yan. I'll be waiting for you at the top!\"\nGao Yan smacked his lips and flipped his finger, \"Scram, you shameless senior! Just you wait!\"\nDongfang Mei watched their interaction with a bright smile on her face. Looking at their interaction reminded her of the time when she was young.\n\"You have a good friend, Gao Yan.\" Dongfang Mei praised the young man.\nGao Yan, the man who always walked around in a tactical suit, slightly shook his head and complained, \"He scammed me when we were recuperating. Last month, I was planning to visit the supermarket and buy a hope and dream pill, that idiot suddenly showed up and forcefully fed me his experimental pill. I was bedridden for a week after that. Well, my soul and dantian injuries are healed because of that though.\"\n\"Doesn't that mean his pills were legitimately good?\"\n\"A hope and dream pill could have healed me instantly. I wasted a week because of that.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\" Dongfang Mei changed the subject, \"What about your tribute, junior? What are you bringing?\"\nGao Yan sighed and brought plastic bags of his blood to the counter. He then explained, \"This is my contaminated blood.\"\nDongfang Mei was amused, \"Contaminated blood?\"\nGao Yan pointed at his antler horns, \"See these, senior?\"\nThe horns had been with Gao Yan since the Orlando expedition. Leo was the one who implanted them on him.\nThe horns contained several stars' worth of lightning Qi. Dongfang Mei measured it with her senses and discovered that the horns had the same energy as a star celestial immortal.\nShe checked his cultivation base next. Impressively, he was a stage higher than Jin Yong who was several years older than him.\nGao Yan was a celestial general, aka the 6th-stage immortal.\nCompared to Dongfang Mei, who was just an earth celestial, this junior could be considered the top genius of their domain. From Dongfang Mei's perspective, Gao Yan deserved Leo's guidance the most.\n\"What did you do during the past few months, junior? You have grown stronger so fast!\"\nGao Yan dryly laughed. He reluctantly revealed his secrets, \"I've been sneaking around when I was supposed to be recuperating, senior. Actually, when I was sleeping, I accidentally ejected my soul and wandered to a strange river full of spirits. By chance, I met a kind senior, and he taught me various things. When I returned, I was struck by a spiritual tribulation. When I recovered, I was already at this level.\"\nDongfang Mei had so many questions to ask the junior. Still, she was curious more about the contaminated blood.\n\"What about the blood? How was it connected to your horns?\"\n\"Oh, right. I got distracted. You see, senior. When I went through the spiritual tribulation, I split my body into two. My evil spirit possessed one of my bodies and tried to kill me. Well, long story short, I killed him. These bags of blood are the remains of that evil spirit and my discarded body. Oh, don't worry about the evil spirit, though. The lightning Qi in my horns already exorcized it.\"\n\"…\"\nDongfang Mei was speechless. She wondered if she had the qualifications to evaluate this young man. After all, Gao Yan's presence and air slightly resembled top experts in the past.\n\"…Anyway, you can have your blood bags with you. You can go straight to the fifth floor. Take your keycards and the plaque.\"\n\"Many thanks, senior!\" Gao Yan was overjoyed. He bowed 90 degrees and received his items. Then, he rushed toward the elevators, hoping to see his senior brother's reaction.\nDongfang Mei shook her head. She turned to the two troublemakers next.\n\"What about you, Cat? What are you doing here?\"\nCat widely grinned. She showed Dongfang Mei her palms.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Are there any food, senior?)\nDongfang Mei blankly stared at the dark elf dryad. Everybody else brought presents, but this girl audaciously demanded their presents instead.\nAs Dongfang Mei didn't want Cat to cause trouble, she passed her the fifth-floor plaque.\n\"Follow your friend to the fifth floor. The food is there.\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow <3!\" (Thank you!)\n\"Learn human speech, dammit.\"\nCat giggled and cat-walked her way to the elevator.\nAfter the cancerous monster had gone, a baby girl remained.\n\"What about me, grandma? Or should I say, Nom Nom Meow?\" Yan Qiqi copied Cat and showed Dongfang Mei her palms.\n\"…\"",

      "content": "291  Florida Man's Wild Wedding: Guests Get Free Smartphone Souvenir for Witnessing His Cat Giving Head to Cow\nChapter 291 – Florida Man's Wild Wedding: Guests Get Free Smartphone Souvenir for Witnessing His Cat Giving Head to Cow\n11 AM.\nBao Xun failed to enter the wedding because the first and the second floors were full. Beatrice, Marc, Lucky, Meowmeow, and Mu-Nyang, on the other hand, used their strength as a free pass and claimed the fifth floor's seats.\nIvy and Aslan got another role. The former was the bride's maid while Aslan self-proclaimed as the groom's best man. They naturally participated in this event on the fifth floor.\nThe seats on the third and fourth floors gradually filled after Esen's subordinates and Meowmeow's concubines entered the hotel. Smart merchants, who traveled to Joyous Yin Sect, brought back some of the loose spirit bulls from the wilderness and earned their third-floor seats.\nAt noon, Dongfang Mei immediately closed the entrance doors and fire exits. She joined the event on the fifth floor as the hotel employees still had jobs to do.\nLeo made his appearance in a white suit and a bow tie. Although he hated greeting or meeting people, he walked to every table on the fifth floor, chatting with every guest.\nOne of the tables belonged to Gao Yan, Jin Yong, Yao Qiqi, and Cat. These troublemakers already emptied all the food on the plates, and they were waiting for the next servings.\nUpon noticing Leo's arrival and his clothes, Gao Yan and Jin Yong gleefully saluted him.\n\"Senior Florida Man! You look handsome today! Congratulations!\" Jin Yong cupped his fist and laughed.\n\"Tsk. Mind your manner, fool. AHEM! Senior Florida Man, congratulations!\"\nLeo gazed at the blood bags and gave Gao Yan a weird look. He checked the duo's conditions with his eyes.\n\"Are you healed already?\"\n\"Yes, I'm already healthy!\" Replied Gao Yan.\n\"Hehehe. Those injuries were nothing, senior. Here, check this out. I've invented this recipe!\"\nUnlike Gao Yan, Jin Yong seized the opportunity to present his wedding gift first.\nLeo noticed the shabby-looking book. He received it and flipped a few pages. Noticing the content, Leo wryly smiled.\n\"Did you come up with these recipes and notes?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Yes, senior. I experimented with it with my body. I can reassure you that all my pills are perfect. If you can mass-produce this and sell it in your store, you'll reap a lot of profits! Err…Ahem. If you really put the pills on sale, can I get some share, pretty please?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo slightly shook his head and smiled. He had already fought Jin Yong's clones and learned all of his abilities, including his alchemy dao. He already knew what they were for, and how he could improve this incomplete recipe.\n\"This is the incomplete recipe of Soul Cleansing Panacea. Instead of using regular fiery hallucination mushrooms and metal-dissolving mushrooms as ingredients, you should use the True Death Mushroom. But since you can't use it directly due to its extremely toxic nature, you must remove its toxin first by mixing it with true earth fate crystal's holy water for 30 days. Then, the true death mushroom will mutate into an ascension mushroom, which can be used as a key ingredient in any healing pill or panacea. Now, you refine the ascension mushroom with the other ingredients in the list, and you can get a better healing pill that can heal soul damage and restore a star in your dantian universe.\"\n\"…Whoa.\"\nJin Yong was speechless and embarrassed. He had never expected to receive such a valuable lecture and tips in alchemy.\n\"S-Senior. C-Could you repeat it again? I forgot to take notes.\"\nLeo sighed. \"Fine. Here, take this book back. Cross those stupid mushrooms out from the ingredient list and…\"\nCalmly and patiently, Leo imparted the knowledge that was supposed to be Jin Yong's future dao and wisdom. The others who shared the same table also admired Leo's generosity.\nAfter correcting the recipe, Jin Yong shed a tear of gratitude. Still, he had other problems that he wished to consult Leo.\n\"Erm, about the true death mushrooms, how do I collect them? If I remember correctly, those mushrooms are contained in the southern array that traps a white tree in there along with other sweet dream mushrooms. I can't simply walk into the array and turn myself into a jiangshi, can I?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"We'll talk about that after we are done with the wedding. No work talk is allowed!\"\n\"Hehehe. Whoops.\"\nJin Yong was satisfied. He hugged the book and widely grinned.\nLeo shifted his attention to the others next. Gao Yan saw the opportunity and stood up, presenting plastic bags that contained his contaminated blood to Leo.\n\"S-Senior. T-This is my wedding gift. Senior Dongfang said that I can bring them here to give it to you myself, so…\"\n\"Blood?\"\nLeo brightly grinned and rubbed his hands in excitement. He received the plastic bag and gazed at the black blood. Without hesitation, he spat into the bag and tied it.\n\"???\"\nGao Yan was taken aback and widened his eyes. But when he remembered that Leo could mutate anything he touched, Gao Yan laughed and inquired.\n\"Senior, I'm curious. If I reach the deity rank, can I transform normal grass into immortal grass like you?\"\nLeo paused for a few seconds to think before he answered, \"Probably not. At best, you can turn them into one of those useless blue spirit grasses. Actually, you're an immortal now. You should be able to do it naturally. But don't expect high-quality spirit grass, though. It depends on your Qi volume and your primary element. Also… the heavenly lightning energy in your damn horns is the bane of all mutation. Suppress it if you want to mutate or evolve something.\"\n\"I-I'll keep that in mind.\"\nGao Yan bowed 90 degrees, but he widely grinned. He was enlightened, and he was eager to try evolving some regular plants into spirit herbs like Leo.\nLeo stored the blood in his inventory as he was afraid of the spill. He then turned his attention to the two girls.\nYao Qiqi was still a cute girl as always. Her bright smile and dirty mouth healed all of Leo's mental fatigue.\nOn the other hand, Cat who was in a dark elf appearance didn't maintain her disguise very well. Small worm-like vines slipped out of her nostrils and ear holes. The corners of her mouth spread wider than usual, which revealed the entire interior of her mouth whenever she opened her mouth to talk.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\" (Daddy, where is the food? I need more food.)\nLeo had a headache. He ejected a raw leg of a mad cow and shoved it down Cat's throat. Because of its enormous size, Cat's body bloated like a python which just swallowed a grown dog.\n\"Meow <3\" (SWEET! Thanks, daddy!)\n\"…\"\nLeo silently brought out five more pieces of raw mad cow's legs and placed them on the table.\n\"Feed her whenever her transformation is about to be undone. I don't want her to revert into a monster form and eat every guest here.\"\nGao Yan and Jin Yong laughed and assured Leo, \"Don't worry, senior. We'll take care of her.\"\nLeo put on a pair of white leather gloves and patted Yao Qiqi's head, \"As for you, I'll ask the cook to serve this table more food. I'll be checking the other table now.\"\n\"Thanks, senior!\" Yao Qiqi bowed, but she wasn't done with Leo yet. She boldly asked for something. \"Senior, I have a request.\"\nLeo stopped his feet. He turned around, \"What's up?\"\n\"Why aren't the thing senior Wu Buyi had on sale in the store, senior? I wish to buy one of those.\"\n\"Huh? Played with what?\"\n\"A small square thing that shows pictures.\"\nYao Qiqi referred to the smartphone of Wu Buyi. As she had no playmate in her age range, she was bored. In addition, she had been eyeing the phone for a long time. She wished she could watch more video clips.\nLeo nodded as he had an inspiration. He rechecked the store to see the price of a smartphone.\nThe AI-PHONE 69 of Wu Buyi was only 1,000 YOL, not including the upgrade fees.\nSince it was cheap, Leo didn't mind spending some of his precious lifespans to buy something for a little kid. He purchased three phones and upgraded them to level 17, enabling its infinite range internet connection and unlimited battery life. Then, he passed them to Gao Yan, Jin Yong, and Yao Qiqi.\n\"There you go. I'll only give them to you three since you guys are special. Learn the functions from Wu Buyi or study the manuals in the boxes, okay?\"\nThe trio gleefully accepted the smartphones and cheered. As for Cat, she only cared about food on the table.\nLeo excused himself and checked on the other tables next. His eyes then met with Han Meng's.\nThe elder dryly laughed while he pretended to sip some tea. Then, he stood up to greet Leo.\n\"Haha. I didn't expect to earn my place here. Well, congratulations, Lord Florida Man! I wish you and your spouse eternal happiness.\"\nLeo tilted his head in curiosity, \"What did you give Dongfang Mei that she gave you the seat?\"\n\"Oh, just a random ingot that I made. I smelted a hull of some debris and handed it to Lady Dongfang.\"\n\"I guess she must have been impressed. Well, good job earning your place here.\"\nLeo liked Han Meng's hardworking attitude. Since the guy was an old customer, Leo decided to help him a little. He pulled out a weapon, which he had gotten from Han Meng's clone.\nIt was a yellowish broadsword, containing a star's worth of earth element Qi. He passed it to Han Meng.\n\"This sword is called Guardian of People. It cannot kill innocent people. But when you use it against an evildoer or a crook under the sage realm, none of their dao or domain abilities can affect you. You can keep using this until you reach the sage realm, actually.\"\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\nHan Meng didn't expect to get a gift in return. He fell to his knees and kowtowed to Leo.\n\"THANK YOU, MY LORD! I-I'M MOVED! I DON'T THINK I DESERVE THIS!\"\n\"Meh,\" Leo rolled his eyes. \"This is my wedding day. Whoever earns this floor's spot deserves preferential treatment. You take it and flex it to your father. Oh, by the way, where is your father?\"\nHan Meng dryly laughed, \"He… is on the other floor, my lord.\"\n\"Ah, shame. Well, next time, I guess.\"\nLeo snickered and went to greet the others. He visited the table of the two Tangs next.\nThe two alchemists stood up and cheerfully saluted Leo. They had seen everything, and they expected to receive something nice in return as well.\n\"Haha, Lord Florida Man. Congratulations! It's very rare for someone our age to find a dao companion!\" Tang Tian started first.\nTang Xuan reserved his words, but he sincerely bowed, \"We wish you a fulfilling marriage life, longevity, and prosperity, senior!\"\nLeo returned the gesture. As Leo had already blessed several people, he might as well give these alchemists some boons.\n\"Pick one. A poison plant encyclopedia, a weapon compatible with your dao, a smartphone, or a random artifact?\"\nTang Tian was bolder than his father. He had seen Wu Buyi playing with a smartphone before. Thus, he requested an item exclusive to Leo's trustworthy subordinates.\n\"If possible, I would like to have the thing my disciple has, please.\"\nLeo nodded in approval. He kindly blessed Tang Tian with the same phone and upgraded it. Then, he asked Tang Xuan next, \"What about you?\"\nTang Xuan's eyes gleamed. Although he was reserved and well-mannered, he was smarter than Tang Tian. He requested a piece of information, which would help his clan in the long run.\n\"This might sound rude, but I wish for a cultivation method that even a cripple with crooked meridians can cultivate.\"\n\"Education, I see.\"\n\"Yes. The ones at the bottom are actually the pillars and the foundation of the upper echelons. Without mortals, there won't be immortals or deities. Without plants and animals, there won't be humans.\"\nLeo was impressed with Tang Xuan's vision. He pulled out a ring from his inventory and tossed it to Tang Xuan.\n\"It contained 100,000 books in there. Some may be duplicates because I never sorted them. Use whatever you find useful. As for the rest, you can keep it as your clan's heirloom or techniques. By the way, all of them are available in the bookstore.\"\nTang Xuan deeply bowed. He was happy with this gift.\n\"I shall not let you down. The Tang Clan will become the pillar of Florida Domain!\"\n\"Well, do your best.\"\nLeo excused himself and walked to another table. He didn't think much about Tang Xuan and his Tang Clan. However, Tang Xuan made an internal vow to himself.\nHe looked up and gazed at Leo in admiration.\n'Right now, our clan members might be useless to you. But one day, our clan will become a great force worthy of your trust! We won't be hiding behind you ever again!'\nThe humiliation from the invasions still got to Tang Xuan. He vowed that his clans could fight alongside Leo one day.",

      "content": "Chapter 292 – Florida Couple Taken to Hospital after Recreating 'Till Death Do Us Part' Wedding Moment With Super Glue on Their Lips.\nAt 12.30, Ivy led the bride to the wedding hall. The caravan's parade song attracted everybody's attention. Even the people on the lower floors could hear it.\nLeo immediately stopped talking. He stepped on the front stage and patiently waited. Aslan also stood next to his proud son, unable to stop smiling.\nThe staff switched the TVs on, showing the live feed of the caravan. The crowd stopped eating and queuing for bathrooms to watch the event.\nThe wedding ceremony followed the divine elf's tradition. The bride's friends or bodyguards carried a wooden palanquin, on where the bride sat. A parade led the caravan and played beautiful march songs, using harps and flutes. Everybody was dressed in green clothes and wooden masks.\nThe songs entranced the guests. All sound from the halls ceased – Only the parade instrumentals resounded. The music kept on going until the palanquin arrived at the designated wedding hall.\nIvy opened the palanquin's curtain and helped the bride exit the vehicle. Esen put her hand on Ivy's palm and slowly stepped out.\nAs soon as Esen revealed her wedding clothes, all the men swallowed saliva in astonishment.\nEsen's clothes were pure white. Long white gloves and silver stockings concealed her precious jade skin. Ironically, her wedding dress revealed her shoulders and improved cleavage. The thin skirt only covered the front and back, leaving the sides unprotected. As for her back, it was naked.\nIn short, her entire dress looked like it could slip or fall at any moment. All the men gazed at her in a daze, imagining impossible scenarios as they didn't understand how the dress worked.\nMeanwhile, Ivy and Esen secretly rechecked the invisible strings, which supported the dress. These transparent threads tied the clothes to her body, enabling her to move freely without worrying about potential cloth malfunctions.\nEsen looked up, highlighting her diamond tiara and her new hairstyle. Instead of letting her hair loose as usual, her hair had been braided into a bun, revealing Esen's smooth neck and upper back.\nTwo bodyguards walked in front of Esen. They carried a basket of flower petals and she spread them while they walked. Ivy held Esen's hand and followed the girls toward the front stage.\nWhen Esen reached the stage, Ivy helped her walk up the stairs. The bride's glistening high-heeled shoes made a clopping noise as she stepped up on the stage.\nLeo gazed at Esen's face. Because of her makeup, she looked more gorgeous than usual. Although he wanted to embrace her and kiss her right away, he maintained composure and followed the wedding procedure, which he had practiced according to Ivy and Beatrice's guidance.\nThe bride stopped at the center of the stage, staring at her husband. Meanwhile, Leo followed the divine elf tradition by turning around and picking a branch of a white tree, which had been soaked with earth fate crystal holy water. He then knelt on one knee in front of Esen and raised the branch.\nLeo recited the vow, which Ivy had asked him to come up with. He recited a traditional line to be safe as he had no idea what he should say on this occasion.\n\"I am Leo… Leonardo, the Florida Man!\"\nFor the first name, Leo revealed his first name in public. The crowd was surprised and widened their eyes. However, Leo didn't disclose his surname because he already forgot about it.\nLeo continued, \"I vow with my karma, fate, and soul: I will cherish, protect, and treasure your heart, your soul, and your smile. In good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, in Styx River and in Heaven, in bed and outdoors, I will love and honor you all the days… and maybe all the nights.\"\n\"AHEM!\" Ivy and Aslan coughed as Leo's vow was getting weird.\nEsen restrained her smile. She received the white tree's branch and bit the tip of her tongue. She blew a droplet of blood on the branch. Then, she gave the branch back and made an oath.\n\"I am Esen Sydin VI, the Empress of Molg and the crown princess of the Divine Elf Kingdom. I vow with my soul, bloodline, and karma: I shall dedicate my heart, body, and soul to you. In life and death, in dreams and reality, I will also love and honor you. But please show mercy at night. It's exhausting.\"\nEverybody burst into laughter, including Leo. Only Ivy and Aslan facepalmed.\nLeo wiped the tear at the corner of his eyes. He received the branch and followed the tradition of the divine elf by stabbing his neck with the branch. Although the branch was not strong enough to penetrate his skin, he secretly enveloped the branch with a thin layer of Qi, creating a razor blade. Then, he slightly cut his flesh with it to draw his blood.\nThe spectators were surprised yet again as they weren't familiar with this tradition. Everybody murmured, thinking that Leo was about to commit suicide.\nIvy had predicted this scene. She had informed Dongfang Mei and the hotel workers to inform the guests.\nMeanwhile, Xu Nuan and Dongfang Mei's subordinates started working. They explained to the guests.\n\"There is a legend in the Divine Elf Kingdom. In ancient times, the god of sincerity and honesty blessed a mortal world with white trees, which served as his avatars. The white trees inherited his power, and they were so sacred that their branches could detect dishonesty and evil thoughts of mortals. Any mortal wounded by a white tree's branch will be cursed and die within seven minutes. The divine elves in ancient times always used white tree branches in wedding ceremonies to test the grooms and brides of their hearts. The grooms and brides are required to prove their honesty and sincerity during the wedding by piercing their necks with a branch of a white tree. But because of the changes of time, only the grooms need to stab their necks.\"\n\"OH!!\"\nHearing a backstory, everybody was relieved.\nUnfortunately, none of them but the molgs and Esen's people knew that the tale was real. As soon as Leo stabbed his neck, a change occurred inside him. A sound transmission of a stranger echoed in his mind.\n'I heard the vow, but I didn't hear all of them. Can you repeat those? Of course, I'll use my dao power on you to prove your sincerity.'\nLeo deeply frowned. He asked the owner of the voice in his mind.\n'Who are you?'\n'I am Overlord Gawr Ghoul, the servant of Karmic Sovereign of Honesty. You who are about to marry one of my descendants, repeat your vow or I'll curse you.'\n'Umm. Okay.'\nSince the guy claimed to be Esen's ancestor, Leo played it safe. He repeated his vow in his mind.\nAfter repeating the verse, Leo's entire body glistened in white light. Moreover, his physical age decreased!\nHis white hair turned black. The long beard was shortened and trimmed while the skin on his face smoothened. Blemishes and hidden marks on his skin vanished. Even his aura and scent became pleasant.\nFrom the physical appearance of a 50 or 60-year-old man, Leo looked like a man in his 40s. As he became younger, his mature face looked dandy and handsome.\nIvy and Beatrice slightly blushed as the matured handsome face of Leo and his trimmed full beard charmed them. They averted their eyes and took several deep breaths to control their minds.\nEsen slightly dropped her jaw as well. She got used to seeing Leo in his old appearance. When she noticed how attractive Leo was, her heart skipped a beat.\nMeanwhile, Leo felt nothing. He only heard the praising of the unknown overlord.\n'I've confirmed your sincerity. As the avatar of honesty, I hereby bless you with longevity and a joyous marriage life. Oh, I enhance your vitality a little. Have fun at night, my boy.'\nThe corners of Leo's mouth curved up into a smile. He started to like the overlord.\n'Visit my domain sometimes. I'll introduce you to the bride.'\n'Yeah, I've pinpointed your location. I'll pay you a visit when I'm free. Now, I'll leave you alone. See you later, boy!'\n'You, too.'\nThe connection was finally cut. Leo looked up and pulled the branch away from his neck.\nWhen Leo stood up, Esen smiled at him and whispered.\n\"Did you have a good chat with the god?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Can't you tell?\"\n\"Yup. You look very handsome, Leonardo.\"\n\"Just call me Leo. The long name sounds cringe.\"\n\"Alright, Leo.\"\nBoth bride and groom smiled at each other. They forgot about the ceremony.\n\"AHEM!\"\nAgain, Ivy coughed as the ceremony hadn't been completed yet. She whispered Esen.\n\"The kiss, Your Majesty. You need to kiss him to complete the wedding ceremony.\"\n\"O-Oh.\"\nEsen flinched and glanced at the crowd below the stage. All their eyes fixated their gaze at Esen's white shoulders and long legs, which made her nervous.\nShe gulped, not wanting to stay here any longer. She looked at Leo's face.\nBecause of their height difference, Esen couldn't reach him. Even though she wore high-heeled shoes, the tip of her head only reached Leo's nose.\nWithout a choice, Esen levitated a few centimeters. She grabbed Leo's face and complained.\n\"Stick out your mouth, Leo.\"\nLeo snickered, \"Oh, it's kissy time?\"\n\"Shut up!\"\nEsen sealed their lips together.\n\"YEAAAAAAHH!!\"\nAs soon as they kissed, the crowd erupted. Some of the guests on the lower floors raised their glasses and toasted for Leo. Many people whistled and laughed.\nMeanwhile, Leo and Esen awkwardly stared at each other's eyes. Because of their good eyesight, they could even see the other person's cells within the eyeballs.\nEsen was embarrassed that she had enough. She tried to pull her head away.\n\"Hmm?\"\nUnfortunately, their lips were glued together for an unknown reason.\n\"Mmm?!\"\nLeo also sensed something weird. He pulled his head back, but he ended up dragging Esen along. The sticking-mouth-tug-of-war had been initiated. The laughter got louder as the scene was too comical.\nAslan glanced at Ivy who wryly smiled as she forgot to tell Esen and Leo a piece of important information.\n\"Oh, dear.\"\nAccording to the legend of Honesty God, the kiss had to be SINCERE as well. In elf's tradition, a puppy kiss couldn't be acknowledged as a lover's sincerity. Only when they started making out in public was considered SINCERE as the husband and wife openly claimed ownership of each other in front of many witnesses.\nLeo was the first to start opening his mouth. It was not because of the awareness of the legend or tradition but his naughtiness.\nBecause their lips were glued to each other, Esen's mouth was forced open. Leo then attacked her with his tongue.\n\"RERO-RERO- RERO-RERO- RERO-RERO- RERO-RERO- RERO-RERO- RERO-RERO!!\"\n\"!!!\"\nEsen flailed her arms and legs in panic, but Leo already embraced her and carried her with his two hands, grabbing her butt.\nA minute after the exchange, their lips parted while a thread of liquid still connected their mouths. Esen's face was bright red. On the contrary, Leo widely grinned.\nIvy coughed several times and quickly announced the end of this farce.\n\"As the witness of the vows, I announce you husband and wife.\"\nAslan raised his eyebrows as the order of the kisses and the announcement switched. He whispered to Ivy.\n\"No flower bouquet throwing, right?\"\nIvy whispered back, \"No.\"\n\"What about the next procedure?\"\n\"The groom must take the bride to the backroom and consummate with her for at least an hour. Also, because of the vow and the blessing, impregnation is guaranteed. Please tell the lord to wear some protection if he doesn't want a child at the moment.\"\n\"Who the hell made those karmic laws?! Was it Karmic Sovereign Wendy?!\"\n\"If I remember correctly, her name is Wen Dee, not Wendy.\"\n\"Yeah, right. When DEEZ NUTS hit your mouth. I remember that name now.\"\n\"…\"\n.\nAslan and Ivy told Esen and Leo the next queue, which ended up in another memorial moment. Leo happily princess-carried Esen to the room behind the stage while everybody laughed at them.\nFor hours, the groom and the bride were MIA, but the guests understood what happened behind the scenes. Everybody enjoyed the party until midnight before they dispersed.\nHowever, the missing couple never came out of the room. Only a week later, Leo and Esen had their fill.",

      "content": "Chapter 293 – New Cocktail Gone Viral: Bartender Offered to 'BUKKAKE' Florida Man\nIn the presidential suite of the hotel, Leo and Esen exploited their privilege and stayed there for the day. The exhausted bride collapsed on the 400x500cm bed and quickly fell asleep. As for Leo, he rechecked the quest progress.\n.\nEntity Fate Crystal Quest – Phase 4/13\nMission Objectives: Complete 10 tasks to complete this phase.\nPhase Completion Rewards: 500,000 Years of Lifespan, One Selectable SR Building, Increase the Shopping Mall's max level to 20, Increase the Sub-Building's Max Level to 20\nPhase Three Tasks (8/10 Completed)\n- Get married (Done)\n- Complete monthly PVP three times (1/3)\n- Complete mystic realm expedition three times (2/3)\n- Top-Up one time (Done)\n- Obtain two true earth fate crystal (Done)\n- Defeat 100 deities (Done)\n- Upgrade shopping mall to level 17 (Done)\n- Spend at least 1,000,000 years of lifespan system items (Done)\n- Manufacture at least 2,000 weapons using strategic resources. (Done)\n- Attain the strength of entity realm or higher. (Done)\n*For every completed task, you will receive one Lucky Draw (Building), and one Lucky Draw (Automaton).\n.\nThe next hurdles were two real-time PVP matches and one seasonal expedition. The latter was easy, but the PVP match sounded intimidating.\nAs Leo had to complete these quests eventually, he decided to do it right away.\nLeo wrote a note on the table, telling Esen that he might be away for a few days. Then, he opened the PVP system screen. Without hesitation, he picked the monthly PVP battle.\nWHOOSH\nLeo in the groom's white suit vanished and reappeared in the middle of the Fate Stadium Arena as usual. He opened his eyes, expecting to be alone in the arena and waiting for his opponent.\nBetraying Leo's expectations, his opponent had been queuing for a match and waiting on the stage for longer than him. Leo found a werewolf opponent.\nCoincidentally, he was none other than Overlord Milo, who came here to complete his monthly PVP and earn some rewards.\n\"You… You look familiar.\" Milo in his giant Fenrir appearance flinched.\n\"Oh, hi.\" Leo brightly smiled at a familiar face.\n\"…\"\nAs Leo's face changed, Milo took a few seconds to recall his memory. Eventually, he remembered Leo.\n\"YOU'RE THAT INVADER! WE'VE FINALLY MET! THIS TIME I WILL CRUSH YOU!\"\nMilo remembered Leo's face. They had met before when Leo officially raided one of a dead player's planets. Last time, Milo left Leo alone because he was not in the mood. But this time, he was eager for a fight.\nBut then, their names appeared on the scoreboard.\n.\nName: Leo [Redacted]\nTitle/Alias: Florida Man\nRace: [Redacted]\nAge: [Redacted]\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: [Redacted]\nRemaining Lifespan: 2,142,543,938 Years\n.\nDiscovering the nickname of Leo, Milo closed his mouth. He widened his eyes as he finally recognized his sworn enemy.\n\"FLORIDA MAN! SO, YOU'RE THE NU'EARTHE SCUM! I'VE FINALLY FOUND YOU!!\" Milo bellowed again.\n\"Umm.\" Leo pursed his lips in bemusement. He repeated a famous vtuber's catchphrase in an innocent voice once again, \"Oh, hi.\"\nMilo gnashed his teeth in anger. He invoked his Qi and scanned Leo's aura.\nHe was into a rude awakening. As Milo had been by Ellen's side, he recognized the aura of a karmic sovereign. But compared to Ellen, Leo's aura seemed more refined and controlled. Moreover, there was a tinge of strange air within his aura.\n'Right. Queen Eleanor invaded Florida Man and was defeated. If that monster lost to this man, I might not be his opponent.'\nMilo was not stupid enough to challenge someone whose strength surpassed Eleanor. He deeply inhaled and bellowed, \"I FORFEIT! GET ME OUTTA HERE!\"\nUnfortunately for Milo, per the rules, he could not forfeit a PVP match. Every system match could only be resolved after one party was incapacitated or dead.\nBEEP\nThe system arena ignored Milo's plea. It initiated the betting phase, allowing spectators to wager their lifespan. Because of Milo's outburst, all bet was poured on Leo's side.\nLeo gazed at the betting rates and snorted in disappointment. As a rich man, wagering a billion YOL for 100,000 YOL was pointless. He ignored it.\n\"Hey, wanna bet?\" Leo tried to scam Milo to make a personal wager.\n\"NO! GO TO HELL!\"\n\"…Shame.\" Leo was disappointed.\nThe betting phase ended. Then, the arena started counting down.\nMilo groaned in helplessness. He turned to Leo and prepared to fight for his life.\nMeanwhile, Leo was relieved. At least, he wouldn't have an issue this month. He started planning his schedule and thinking of the dwarf.\nBEEP\nThe fight signal sounded the beginning of the match.\nMilo held his breath and charged forward. He enveloped his arms with the power of karma and swung his right claw at Leo's face.\nLeo's eyes followed the trajectory of the claws.\n'Hmm?'\nA strange phenomenon occurred to Leo for the first time. He found Milo's movement slower than usual. Moreover, his inner Qi stimulated his entire body, which brimmed with power that could burst out at any moment.\nFollowing his instinct, Leo raised his hand and parried the wolf's paw with the back of his fist.\nPA\nUpon contact, the paw and the claws shattered. Half of Milo's front right leg exploded into blood mist.\nThe bullet-time moment never ceased. Leo frowned and observed how droplets and militated flesh of Milo's left arm scattered everywhere in the air.\n'Is this Matrix? How beautiful.'\nSince the fight was easy, he took a step forward. Then, he threw a straight punch toward Milo's chest.\n'Oh, wait. Fenrir's blood, heart, liver, and other things are valuable in alchemy. I shouldn't blast this mofo.'\nLeo pulled his fist back. Instead of aiming at Milo's chest, he threw an uppercut toward Milo's jaw. After all, the head of a Fenrir was less precious than the other parts.\nBOOM\nThe punch connected. Milo's head shattered and his brain exploded.\nThe bullet-time ended. The giant Fenrir collapsed on the stage.\nWHOOSH\nMilo's soul escaped the fleshly body and hovered in mid-air. He glared at Leo in resentment.\n\"I FORFEIT! I CAN'T FIGHT ANYMORE!\"\nLeo turned to the overlord. He pondered which domain ability he should use in this position.\nUnfortunately, the match was concluded.\n<WINNER OF THE MATCH, 'FLORIDA MAN'!>\n\"…\"\nThe spectators all cheered as most of them won the wagers. As for Milo, his soul escaped the stage.\nLeo sighed. He clenched his fist.\n\"I don't know how, but I got another one in the bag. Now, I have to wait a month and do it one more time.\"\nThe stadium glowed as it prepared to set up the next match. According to the rules, the winners and losers of the pvp arenas would be automatically teleported to either the front counter of the Fate Stadium or their reserved hotel room.\nWHOOSH\nLeo wasn't a permanent resident or reserved a hotel room. He was sent to the front counter for the second time.\nWithout asking anybody, Leo queued to buy an entrance ticket. When he reached the counter, he showed the identity token that he had purchased during his last visit.\nThe receptionist was the lamia that had advised Leo the last time. She checked Leo's identity.\n\"Your fighter pass has expired, sir. Would you like to extend it?\"\n\"Same price, right? 10,000 years of lifespan?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I'll take one.\"\nThe receptionist nodded. She updated Leo's information and checked his records on her computer.\nWhen the receptionist saw the updated lifespan in Leo's possession, she widened her eyes in astonishment.\n\"Um, sir. Would you like me to upgrade your fighter pass to the veteran pass?\"\nVeteran Fighter Pass was usually granted to elite fighters who fought in this arena more than 10 times. It granted small perks to the owner, such as unlimited access to the facilities, no expiry date, and access to exclusive services.\nLeo still remembered the condition. He doubted the lamia's motive, \"AM I eligible? I don't remember fighting here more than 10 times.\"\n\"Any fighter with more than 100 million years of lifespan can directly upgrade their fighter passes, sir. Would you like to upgrade yours?\"\n\"Are there any fees?\"\n\"It's free, sir.\"\nLeo shrugged. He never hated free stuff, but he hated hidden conditions and scammers. For the sake of his safety, he probed further. \"What's the catch?\"\n\"There is no condition, sir. The Fate Stadium welcomes all VIPs and potential investors.\"\n\"In short, you want rich people to spend their money in your stadium, correct?\"\n\"…Yes, sir.\"\n\"Hmm. Fine. Upgrade mine.\" Leo nodded and allowed the lamia to upgrade his pass.\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\nThe lamia replaced Leo's token with a platinum card. On the card, it showed the face of Leo and his alias. She then gestured for Leo to enter the VIP lounge behind her.\n\"You can enter the stadium this way, sir.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nLeo played along and followed the lamia into the lounge behind the counter area.\n.\nWalking into the room, Leo found a massive lobby. Some tables and couches were twice as large and taller than average human furniture. But in some sections, the furniture was small enough for children to use. Fortunately, there were enough chairs and tea tables for humans.\nThe lamia bowed and introduced the lounge.\n\"This place is reserved for crystal bearer pass and veteran fighter pass holders. The food and drinks of this lounge are on the house. But if you require assistance, such as hotel booking, you can make requests at the service center counter down the hallway.\"\n\"Oh, nice.\"\nLeo looked around and found food bars and a buffet area. He licked his lips.\n\"Oh, before I forgot,\" the lamia followed Leo's gaze and warned him. \"In the buffet area, using any inventory system or storage rings is prohibited.\"\n\"Eh? Why?\" Leo was dejected.\n\"In the past, some selfish players robbed the stadium's food and took advantage of other players. We almost ran out of food because of those gluttons. Anyway, please don't use any ring or inventory in the area, or you'll be arrested by the staff. If you're arrested, you might be thrown into a death chess game.\"\n\"…\"\nThe lamia bowed and excused herself. She returned to the counter to resume her duty.\nLeo gazed at the shaking hips of the lamia. He smacked his lips, but he shook his head afterward.\n'I'm a married man. No more lewd gaze, damn you.'\nLeo lightly patted his forehead, but the impact behind his strength dizzied him. It took a few minutes to regain his balance.\nAfter regaining his composure, Leo scanned the area. Fortunately, nobody lingered in the lobby lounge to mock him.\nAlthough Leo planned to return home early, he got sidetracked. His legs guided him to the buffet area to check the alien's food. The food didn't disappoint him.\nFrom raw blood to cooked food, the stadium featured everything. Meat for every type of creature, including humans, goblins, orcs, snakes, wolves, elves, and regular animals was on the menu.\nLeo bit his lower lips. He understood why the robbers stole food from here as everything seemed useful in alchemy. But as Leo had graduated from eating raw food, he picked some edible meat cut that could be cooked as steaks on his plate. He then passed them to the chef behind an island cook station.\n\"Medium rare, please.\"\nThe chef of the cooking station was a muscular green orc with two long fangs extending from his lower jaw. He gently took Leo's plate and humbly smiled.\n\"Would you like me to season your steak, sir?\"\nLeo glanced at the steak cut and counted it. \"One without seasoning, one controlled steak, and one of your recommendations, please.\"\n\"A gourmet, I see. Very well, sir. It shall be done in a few minutes. I'll serve them to your table.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nLeo was impressed with the service. He went to the bar counter next to order some drinks.\nThe bartender was also a green orc, but it was a SHE. The orc lady was as gorgeous as divine elves, but she had firm muscles and an impressive chest.\nLeo sat at the bar and picked a brochure. He read the menu for a moment. Then, his eyes found weird cocktails on the list.\nHe asked the bartender.\n\"Miss, what the heck is BUKKAKE?!\"\n\"Hahaha. That?\" The orc giggled, \"It's a white sticky cocktail that I will splash it from a hose to your face. Would you like one, sir? It's fun.\"\n\"…No, thank you. Just curious.\"\nThe lounge was wilder than Leo had imagined.",

The orc chef served the steaks along with side dishes 10 minutes later.\nLeo took his time to enjoy his food. While he ate, he observed every employee in the lounge with his Qi sense.\nAll of the employees here were all deities. Some were even stronger than Esen's minions.\nThis got Leo curious. He wondered how powerful the stadium owner was. Also, he hated the fact that his system was dependent on the stadium's system.\n'One of these days, I should seek the stadium owner. Or rather, should I search for a karmic fate crystal and increase my power ceiling?'\nHe inclined against his chair and looked at the ceiling, thinking hard. Because of the distraction, Leo stopped eating the steaks on his plate.\nWhile Leo was in deep thought, the crisp sound of footsteps came from the other exit of the lounge. A tall and sexy divine elf in a red dress walked toward Leo. Without asking for Leo's permission, she slid a chair and sat in front of Leo. She leaned forward and rested her chin on her hands.\nLeo stopped looking at the ceiling and slowly gazed at the mysterious stranger. Their eyes met.\n\"Hello, Florida Man.\" The woman grinned.\nLeo slightly frowned. The woman had a similar face and the same voice as Esen. However, she looked more mature. Her voluptuous chest, red lips, and smooth skin could fall any nation, but her palms seemed crude, hardened, and blistered.\n\"Hello, femme fatal,\" replied Leo. \"What do you want?\"\n\"How cold. Do you even know who I am?\"\nLeo scoffed and resumed eating. He cut a piece of meat and put it in his mouth.\nNoticing Leo's attitude, the stranger grinned. She introduced herself.\n\"I am Ellen Sydin, the new queen of the Divine Elf Kingdom and the president of the DEZNUTS council.\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Good for you. So?\"\n\"You're not surprised at all?\"\n\"I do, but I have no F to give. So?\"\nEllen widely smirked. She suddenly took off the upper part of her dress to show her bunnies.\n\"Are you either dumb or infertile? Can't you catch the hint?\"\nLeo glanced at Ellen's perfect breasts. But as Leo had unloaded so many bullets in Esen, his sage mode remained active. He clicked his tongue.\n\"As a proud married man, I'm not interested in affairs, especially my wife's sister. Go tempt someone else.\"\nEllen flinched for a moment. She slowly adjusted her dress and put it on. Then, she leaned back and crossed her legs. \"You know, 100 billion handsome elves would kill to catch a glimpse at my face. I'm offering you my body here.\"\n\"…Then, go ask them for their dicks.\"\n\"But I want you to join my harem. I need a quality stud to produce good seeds for my future children.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo put his knife and fork on the side of the plate. He wiped his mouth with a warm towel on the table and gave Ellen a meaningful look.\n\"Your mother said the same thing. Do you know what she got? Gender equality punch to the face.\"\nEllen giggled, \"Did you kill her?\"\n\"Deader than dead. She got MEGUMINed.\"\nAlthough Ellen didn't understand what 'MEGUMINed' was, she could guess the vocabulary. She was satisfied.\n\"Hmm. Very nice. Now, I like you more. Are you sure you don't want to be my consort? You just need to copulate with me when I ovulate. I can do many plays – submissive, femdom, BDSM, or any kink you dream of. Not only you can claim my body, but you can also enjoy my wealth and status as the prime consort of Divine Elf Kingdom!\"\n\"Too cliché. You elves are too horny! Get some help!\" Leo started to get annoyed.\n\"We are honest, unlike you hypocritical humans. That's why those lowly dogs keep calling you people Nu'Earthe. You need to accept your primal instinct and be honest with it. That way, the civilization can flourish.\"\n\"What a load of craps. Rapists would have dominated the society.\"\n\"I beg to differ. It's them who will have to work to get those rights. Women will be forced to rely on their strength to protect their bodies. As for men, they also had to compete with fellow men and overcome their prospect's strength. Because of such encouragement, our race never stops improving their cultivation strength.\"\n\"In short, if they are weak, they can either die a virgin or be enslaved.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nLeo shook his head in disgust. He didn't want to discuss another word.\n\"You people are disgusting. Your society must be one hell of a shit hole.\"\nEllen burst into laughter, \"That's the difference between us and you humans. We dominate the universe while you humans become wandering fugitives.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo stood up. As he lost his appetite, he planned to go home and return to his wife.\nUnfortunately, Ellen predicted Leo's thoughts. She also stood up and ejected a broadsword from her system inventory. The sword pointed at Leo's neck.\n\"Florida Man. Join me.\"\nLeo was relieved that Ellen finally used a forceful method. He was tired of this farce.\n\"How about no? Wanna settle this in the arena?\"\nEllen smirked, \"Heh. No need.\"\n\"Mhm. Get lost, bitch. Shoo, shoo!\"\n\"…Cool. Don't regret this.\"\nEllen pulled her sword away. She turned around and left without uttering a word.\nLeo scoffed and patted his clothes. Although he planned to visit the dwarf and the spaceship vendor, Leo opened his system menu and chose to press the 'Return' button.\nBut after pressing the button, the corner of Leo's eyes noticed that the whiskey bottle that he had ordered from the bartender was still full. He grabbed it along with the plate of steaks. Then, he vanished.\n.\n.\nAfter Leo had teleported away, the bartender and the chef changed their expressions. They lifted their collar cloth closer to their mouth and whispered.\n\"This is the VIP lounge. We are reporting another food robbery. The thief's alias is Florida Man. The stolen goods are a plate of steaks and a bottle of 20-Year Medusa Oak Whiskey.\"\nA few seconds later, the response came from the higher-ups. A voice entered their mind.\n\"The CCTV footage has been retrieved. Good job. We will apprehend him when he shows up here again.\"\nThe orcs nodded. The chef returned to his duty as if nothing had happened. Only the bartender widely grinned and commented.\n\"What a fool. Didn't he read that all food and drinks must only be consumed here? Bringing even a piece of food here to their homeworld is illegal. He's just asking to be enslaved.\"\nThe orc chef shook his head and deeply sighed. \"The rules are too strict. Sometimes, I wonder if I should report this matter to the superior officers. I mean, it's just a few pieces of cheap steaks and cheap whiskey.\"\n\"You know nothing, Yraunaj. It's a scheme of the higher-ups. We just want an excuse to enslave strong players and steal their fate crystals. Their dantian crystals are also valuable, especially the humans. If we can acquire one of them, we can learn the secrets behind Overlord Xiaomao's abnormal strength!\"\nAgain, the orc chef 'Yraunaj' disagreed with his partner and the stadium's ways of doing things. He felt like the stadium was scamming their valuable guests.\n'I hope he is strong enough to handle the Player Hunter Squadron. I wish your true strength is independent of the system… human.\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Ellen's expression was dark. He was disappointed in Leo.\n\"Foolish. Had he agreed, I could have made him the King of Divine Elf. He would have ruled half of the universe! I would have supported him and purged the Kishin Clan from the universe. Then, we would have formed a permanent alliance with Overlord Xiaomao…\"\nEllen deeply grumbled while she opened her system menu, planning to return home. But as the system screen appeared, a notification message screen manifested.\nDING\n<Breaking News: Fresh Warrant Issued for 'Florida Man' Who Allegedly Caught Stealing Food from Buffet Lounge. Player Hunter Squadron Has Been Deployed.>\n\"…\"\nEllen raised her eyebrows in bemusement. A second later, she burst into laughter.\n\"What a fool! I thought you were stupid, but you are downright autistic! How could you have fallen for the stadium's petty trick?! Had you simply left the table, no one would have batted an eye! Now, you're done for!\"\nThe new queen looked forward to seeing Leo and Esen struggle. After all, the army behind the Fate Stadium was the only one who could rival the divine elf kingdom's forces.\n.\n.\nLeo returned to his bus. He looked at the clock.\nOnly 30 minutes had passed. Leo was proud that he got home early. With free time at hand, Leo planned to manually improve his kingdom by purchasing some prebuilt houses from the shopping system.\nHe opened his online shopping menu. Then, he was prompted with a red notification message.\n<Warning! You have committed a crime in Fate Stadium. Please navigate to the PVP system screen and press the 'Surrender' button to turn yourself in. Failure to comply will result in additional charges, and the Player Hunter Squadron will be deployed to apprehend you. We don't guarantee the damage that they may inflict on your kingdoms or domains.>\n\"…\"\nLeo was confused. He didn't remember committing any crime in the Fate Stadium. All he did was take a whiskey and a plate of steaks back.\nSteak?\nWhiskey?\nLeo paused for a minute. He slapped his forehead.\n\"Those idiots. They should have told me that I couldn't take any food outside the buffet area in the first place! Is this a scam?!\"\nLeo navigated to the PVP system screen. His hand hovered over the 'Surrender' button. But then, he pulled his finger away.\nSomething seemed fishy when Leo pondered about it. Why would the rich and resourceful Fate Stadium deploy task forces to hunt down a little thief? Wouldn't that be excessive?\nHe closed the system windows and crossed his arms to think.\nHours later, Leo tilted his head in frustration. He had a headache as his thoughts were in chaos.\n'At a time like this, I shouldn't be overthinking things. Instead of wasting my time, I should waste other people's time! How about asking Kitten and Meowmeow about it? They are more knowledgeable than me, right?'\nBeing inspired, Leo left the bus and visited the mystic realm portal.",

Unfortunately, Meowmeow and Aslan were nowhere to be seen.\nLeo approached Lucky, who wagged his tail and expected a head pat. Satisfying the doggy, Leo stroked his chin and head.\n\"Hey, good boy. Where is that lewd devil and fisherman?\"\n\"Them, woof? That birb usually hangs out in Agriculture World with his new concubines. If it's Kitten, he said something about a parked spaceship on the asteroid belt or something, woof.\"\n\"Asteroid Belt?\" Leo was curious. He also recalled that Aslan once ditched them and disappeared along with Eleanor's dreadnaught battleship. \"What is Kitten planning to do with that ship?\"\n\"I don't know either, woof.\" Lucky pouted as he really didn't know.\nSeeing the innocent look of Lucky, Leo left him be. He changed the subject, \"Is Meowmeow in the AW (Agriculture World) right now?\"\n\"Yes, woof! But be prepared for some disgusting scene, woof.\"\n\"Meh, what can go wrong.\"\nLeo ignored Lucky's warning and proceeded to the Agriculture World Portal. He crossed to the other side and found a green world, filled with fresh oxygen… and a foul sultry liquid odor.\nTurning his head toward the source of the strong scent, Leo found a hundred stone elves lying on the ground, soaked in white liquid. He deeply frowned and looked at the queue of elf golems who had been lining and waiting for their turns.\nAt the front of the queue was a handsome man whose face resembled Dr. Mao Miaomiao and Leo in his youthful appearance.\nSeeing the angel with his face doing naughty things to other female golems made Leo nauseous. He stomped toward the golem and yelled.\n\"Meowmeow, stop banging other rocks! I have something to ask you!\"\nMeowmeow whose body part was connected to another elf golem turned his head and looked at his master, \"Oh, master. You've come at a good time. Wait a second. You look younger again! I bet your vitality is restored too! Wanna join me? We have so many girls to play with!\"\nLeo covered his face with his right palm and groaned, \"I said, stop banging your wives for a second and pay attention, okay? It will be quick. Once we're done, you can do whatever you want with them as long as they are happy with it. I won't interfere with your life!\"\n\"Oh, sure. What do you need, master?\"\nLeo got to the point, \"Do you know anything about Fate Stadium and their system manipulation abilities?\"\nMeowmeow flinched. His playful expression changed, \"Fate Stadium, you say?\"\n\"Yes. You know something, didn't you?\"\nMeowmeow paused for a long time. He slowly stood up and gazed at his wives, \"Leave us alone. We'll continue this in the other days.\"\nThe girls seemed disappointed. They bowed at Leo and retreated to the mystic realm platform.\nAfter both men were alone on the empty grassland, Meowmeow revealed a secret.\n\"Master, are you aware that we four guardian golems share our thoughts and memory, right?\"\n\"Something like that, but you have your own personality and conscience, correct?\"\n\"Yes. Everybody's conscience is unique because everyone inherits a different bloodline and abilities. Well, originally, all abilities are yours to begin with. We just inherit some that you haven't awakened yet.\"\nLeo found the info interesting, but that was not his purpose for visiting Meowmeow.\n\"Back to the topic, what about the Fate Stadium? Does anybody know anything?\"\nMeowmeow closed his eyes and confessed, \"I managed to peek into Kitten's unique memory. He seems to be an expert in this topic because he is more special than the rest of us.\"\n\"Ah, figured as much.\"\nAs Leo had predicted, the fisherman golem was the smartest guy among the four guardian golems. Moreover, something unique about Aslan gave an eerie feeling that Leo couldn't describe. It was neither dangerous nor pleasant, and that guy's tone and voice were always apologetic and happy at the same time.\n\"By the way, master. Do you know that Kitten has a soul?\"\n\"…A soul, you say?\"\nSomething clicked in Leo's mind. A puzzle piece filled the incomplete picture that Leo imagined Aslan.\n\"That makes a lot of sense. That guy is too weird to be someone who has been born from my shadow or thoughts. What kind of secrets he is hiding? Do you know anything else?\"\nMeowmeow nodded, \"We know that Kitten has visited the stadium more than once, but we can't dig deeper into his memory. That's all we know.\"\n\"Hohoh… Good. Good. Anything else?\"\n\"If it's related to the Fate Stadium, that's all we know.\"\n\"Alright. That's good enough.\"\nLeo rubbed his chin. He planned to confront Aslan after this.\n\"Also, master,\" Meowmeow was concerned about Aslan.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"I know that guy is sussy, but he means well. I can tell that he's trying his best to support you from the shadow. He gives off… an air of a dotting father.\"\n\"Pfft. Father my ass. If he has a soul, he must have harbored a hidden desire or a personal agenda. I'll go check him out.\"\n\"Please, master. Don't be too harsh on him. He's not your enemy.\"\n\"…I know.\"\nLeo returned to the mystic realm platform. He widely grinned, eager to meet his suspicious helper.\nMeanwhile, Meowmeow was no longer in the mood to play. He restored his outfit and followed Leo to the other side as well.\nBefore Meowmeow left, he turned around and gazed toward the direction of the farms. Over a thousand kilometers away, Sierra and Mu-Nyang were busy managing the livestock and the child of Ester.\nMeowmeow prayed for Mu-Nyang's sanity. After all, Sierra was even more perverted than him.\n'Mu-Nyang, can you read my thoughts? I hope your tentacles are safe and pure. Don't let that cow abuse you.'\nA minute later, Meowmeow heard the reply from the Cathulhu.\n'My purity has been soiled, munya.'\nMeowmeow burst into laughter and shook his head. He changed his mind, turning around and flying toward the cat.\n'Did Sierra bully you?' Asked Meowmeow.\n'She used my tentacles to squeeze her breasts, munya. This is sexual harassment! I want to report this to master, munya!'\nMeowmeow almost died laughing. He accidentally fell from the sky as he lost focus.\n'Maybe she's asking you to extract her breast milk for the baby?'\n'No way, munya! You can't see her expression. She's a SICK COW, munya!'\n'Okay. Okay. I'll be there to help you. I know how to handle ladies.'\n'Don't cross the line, munya. Her karma is connected to the REAL Sierra. As soon as the original Sierra is reincarnated, she can extract OUR Sierra's memory and discover us, munya!'\n'Oh, dear.'\nMeowmeow started to have a headache. He wondered what he should do to this unruly system clone.\n.\n.\nAfter returning to his domain, Leo flew to the void and scanned for the hidden dreadnaught.\nIt wasn't easy to locate a specific object several light-years away. Fortunately, the asteroid belt formed a dome curtain around the solar system, making it easy to spot.\nLeo stopped searching for a spaceship within the void. Instead, he flew toward the asteroid belt to measure the denseness and distance.\nAs the name implies, the asteroid belt was full of floating rocks, random minerals, space junk, and colorful gas. Leo entered the fog in space and accidentally inhaled a wisp of yellowish gas.\nHe coughed and spat a mouthful of saliva. The gas earlier was so rotten that Surstromming smelled like flowers. Even the contaminated food back on Earth could not rival this scent.\nStill, the foul gas contained a thick poisonous essence. Leo estimated that a deity could spend a day or two here to cultivate its Qi and condense a few poison stars.\nLeo slapped his cheeks to focus. He covered his mouth and plucked his nostrils with his fingers. Then, he flew into the space fog to scan through the asteroid belt.\nTraveling through the smelly fog full of floating asteroids was irritating and frustrating. Because of his traveling speed and poor vision, Leo bumped into giant rocks several times.\nAnnoyed by the asteroids, Leo waved his arms around. He stored anything he touched in his system inventory, exploiting his system features.\nThe trick worked perfectly in this situation. As the system inventory's collection range depended on the user's cultivation base, Leo accidentally turned himself into a black hole, sucking every hard object into his body.\nWithin a minute, a section of asteroids, minerals, junk, and a portion of smelly gas vanished. Everything within a 100,000km diameter disappeared.\nThe yellowish mist continued to follow the solar system's gravity as usual. Although they moved at the speed of 2,000km/s, they couldn't recover all the lost gas that Leo had consumed.\nLeo blankly gazed at his system inventory. 5,000 different items occupied 5,000 item slots, including the gas. Every item of the same type was stacked in the same slot.\nThe storage limit of the inventory system seemed infinite. Leo tilted his head in confusion as he vaguely recalled that it was supposed to be limited before. He wondered how it got overpowered.\n\"This system is quite a cheat, isn't it? Was it the white tree's blessing? Or was it Eleanor's entity fate crystal? But didn't I use it?\"\nLeo was confused. The more Leo learned about the system's perks, the more he was wary of the player hunter squadron and the Fate Stadium.\nBecause of the looming threat, Leo stopped being sidetracked. He continued to search for Aslan's hidden ship.\n.\n.\nTwo days later, Leo's inventory slots kept expanding. 60,000 slots were filled. Some of the item slots contained over a million objects of the same type.\nAlthough collecting resources was fun, Leo was not in the mood to enjoy being a loot goblin. He focused on clearing the path, searching for Aslan's ship.\nHard work paid off. Finally, Leo spotted a weird steel Shenlong dragon armed with giant cannons at a distance. It also moved like it was alive, swimming through the thick asteroid belt's gas.\nLeo pursued, hoping to find Aslan in the battleship. But then, the dreadnaught suddenly picked up the speed and teleported away, vanishing like it never existed.\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"\nLeo looked around and tried to track the dreadnaught battleships. He closed his eyes and read the karma of this universe.\nKarma in this universe came in various forms. For example, every living being was tied with at least one karma string and was bound with the local karma river. Cutting it would end the person's life and might erase the soul.\nOn the other hand, objects also contained karma in the form of object memory. Every solid material left behind traces of time, which any sage or stronger entity could read and follow.\nLeo reopened his eyes and found a trail of rainbow road. It led toward the deep space.\n\"Tsk.\"\nLeo grumbled in frustration. He turned around and rushed home as he didn't want to leave his domain for too long.\nAnother major battle might ensue. He needed some preparations.",

      "content": "Chapter 296 Florida Man Arrested for Joyriding Coffin Through Car Factory\n?296 Florida Man Arrested for Joyriding Coffin Through Car Factory\nChapter 296 – Florida Man Arrested for Joyriding Coffin Through Car Factory\nAfter Leo had returned home, the dragon dreadnaught mothership revealed its appearance near the location where Leo had been.\nAslan who was inside the mothership's main bridge faintly grinned, feeling proud of himself.\n'You still have a lot to learn, my boy. If you can be tricked with simple back-and-forth teleportation, you can't possibly catch top karmic sovereigns in this universe like Overlord Kishin or those player hunters.'\nHe had so many things he wanted to teach Leo. However, it was not the right time. Aslan deeply sighed and inclined on his armchair, recalling the faces of the Fate Stadium's mastermind.\nThinking of the person, Aslan's expression turned solemn.\n'Leo isn't ready for a karmic fate crystal yet. His foundation is lacking even though he can use the simulation mode. He needs more time to refine his soul and dantian universe. Even if he spends a year or two training in the simulation mode, I doubt he can catch up to those guys.'\nAslan was aware of the player hunter squadron's existence. He had met them before as Meowmeow and Leo had suspected.\nThe encounter wasn't pleasant. Thinking of the men, Aslan's blood boiled. He suppressed his anger and attempted to calculate the situation logically.\n'Those player hunters can easily disable every system and negate system skills. Leo has integrated some of the system skills, daos, and abilities into his own, but he hasn't mastered everything yet. If they suddenly take Leo's system power away, he won't be weakened. But that domain and his system buildings will disappear, including the lifespan that he stole…'\nAslan smacked his lips. Although he wasn't sure if the player hunters could erase Leo's hard-earned lifespan that he had accumulated, he didn't want to take risks.\nHe deeply sighed and closed his eyes. He decided to intervene.\n'I need to visit that distasteful man again. But first, I should tell Simba and Ester about this.'\nAslan sank his consciousness to his dantian universe.\n.\n.\nA month quickly passed by.\nIn the middle of the night inside the presidential suite room, Leo relaxed in the middle of the bed. Cuddling next to him was Esen who slept soundly.\nLeo stroked Esen's hair and smiled. The past month's marriage life had been fulfilling.\nThe relationship between Leo and Esen improved. She was no longer shy at night. Moreover, she often initiated or proposed a dual cultivation session with Leo.\nEvery time Leo dual-cultivated with Esen, her cultivation base increased. In addition, her clone's strength in Leo's simulation mode improved. Because of such boons, Esen was always by his side during daytime and nighttime.\nLooking at Esen's sexy body, ample chest, sexy hips, firm perky cake, and flawless smooth skin, Leo chuckled. He thought of the day when they first met.\n\"You were so skinny back then. If anyone could time-travel and told me that I would marry you, that me in the past would have laughed his ass out. Who would have thought that the loli corpse would turn into a gorgeous bombshell of an elf?\"\nSuddenly, a cough could be heard in the room. The voice of Ivy interrupted Leo's thought.\n\"Your Majesty. Her Majesty has become what she is today because of your hard work and care. Without your grooming… I mean, your love, she would have stuck being a living corpse. Look at her now. She's now a happy woman.\"\nLeo smacked his lips. This was not the first time that Ivy snuck into their room, so he was used to it. Furthermore, this woman sometimes entered the room while both Leo and Esen were in the middle of a night activity. Although Ivy never intervened or interrupted them, she always gave him the creep.\n\"Yo, peeping tom. Can you mind our privacy? You know, I want to be with my wife alone sometimes.\"\nIvy smiled and refused, \"I'm sorry, Your Majesty. Her Majesty is pregnant. I understand that you are mindful of your privacy, but you can be sometimes crude and rough in bed. It is my duty to be vigilant of her health and her actions until the delivery.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo didn't know what to say to this archlich.\nThat wedding night, Leo did it without protection. Because of the white tree god's blessings, Esen was pregnant. At first, Leo thought of it as a joke. But when Esen told Leo that her egg was fertilized, Leo realized the gravity of the situation.\n\"Fine, you perv. Even if you want to join us, I won't take you as a concubine.\"\n\"Don't worry, Your Majesty. I have a boyfriend.\"\n\"Oh!\" Leo laughed. \"I didn't know a lich like you have a sugar daddy. Who is the unfortunate guy?\"\nIvy widely grinned, \"He's a handsome little boy.\"\nLeo was taken aback, \"WTF?! Are you grooming a minor?!\"\n\"He's more of an innocent grandpa in a child-like physique, similar to your partner, Your Majesty. If you call me a groomer, you're no different than me. You groomed a loli. I groomed a shota.\"\n\"No, listen here, you predator bitch,\" Leo was dumbfounded, but he wanted to win the argument. \"I never did anything to her when she was in the child-like body or when she was still a walking corpse. We started getting more intimated when Esen has an adult-like body.\"\n\"Hahaha! Your Majesty, everybody knows that it's an excuse. Don't worry about it. We don't blame you for your fetish or your kinks. As long as you love our queen, we don't mind.\"\n\"But I DO MIND, damn you! I ain't a pedophile, and I don't groom minors! Don't randomly accuse me!\"\n\"Haha, my apologies, Your Majesty. Well, please resume whatever you're doing. Don't mind my presence here. Go ahead, continue.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and shook his head. He gave up on Ivy.\nAs a month passed, Leo prepared for another journey to the Fate Stadium. He opened the PVP system screen while he put on his clothes.\nAfter putting on his casual t-shirt and jeans, Leo reminded Ivy.\n\"I'll be visiting another planet for business. Tell Esen that I'll be away for several days.\"\nIvy raised her eyebrows, \"How many days exactly, Your Majesty?\"\n\"Probably more than a week. If I'm lucky, I might return within a day.\"\n\"Is it a dangerous trip? Do you want me to inform the other guardians to tag along with you?\"\n\"Nah. I'll be fine. Be careful about invaders, though. Tell Meowmeow, Kitten, and Lucky that I want them to patrol the star system. If they detect any uninvited visitor from other galaxies or dimensions, kill them on sight.\"\nIvy's expression turned solemn. She bowed 90 degrees, \"I understand. Please have a safe trip.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nLeo deeply inhaled and gazed at the real-time PVP screen.\n.\nYou Are Wanted by Fate Stadium Authority!\nA warrant has been issued. You have been charged with robbery, and you are expected to surrender to the authority within a month. Failure to do so will result in system cancelation – Your system perks, such as the Inventory System, Online Shopping System, and Domain System will be terminated. All items and perks acquired by the systems shall be erased. Furthermore, a task force from the Fate Stadium will be deployed to arrest you.\nIn case you surrender to the authority, you may keep the systems and the perks. However, you will be prosecuted according to the Fate Stadium's Laws.\nCurrent Warrant and Charge: Robbery\nSurrender Grace Period: 25 Minutes\n.\nThe red warning screen overlapped with the PVP screen. In addition, the [Surrender] button was highlighted.\nAs Leo hated misunderstanding and corrupted political systems, he decided to confront the Fate Stadium's officials to clear things up. He pressed the surrender button.\nAs soon as Leo pressed it, he vanished from the presidential suite room.\n.\n.\nDING\n<You have submitted to Fate Stadium Authority!>\n<Thank you for cooperating. We shall take your action into account.>\nLeo opened his eyes and found himself inside a transparent coffin. The 50x50cm square glass plate under his feet was enough for Leo to stand on, but the 2-meter-high ceiling and the glass wall were claustrophobic inducing.\nHe looked around and saw other glass coffins. Fortunately, the coffin allowed him to stand on his feet, so he could observe everything. Around his glass container, many coffins of a different size contained a hundred humanoid creatures inside.\nA factory belt gradually moved Leo's coffin forward until it reached a pushing machine. Leo's coffin was stopped in front of the pusher, but the machine allowed it to go further.\nAfter the first stop came another pushing machine. Again, the belt carried Leo's coffin deeper, but many other coffins of a bigger size were removed from the factory belt.\n30 minutes later, Leo's coffin was the only one on the factory belt. It reached a platform at the end of the line.\nCLANK\nThe coffin fell on the platform, forcing Leo to lie down. He grumbled and remained prone, gazing at the destination.\nThe platform was illuminated by white light, causing the coffin to float. It slowly moved upward into the void.\nFinally, Leo looked up and found himself and the glass coffin in the void, floating toward a weird palace situated on a thick white cloud. The coffin landed on the clouds and was stopped by a golden gate.\nIn front of the golden gate was a giant human with a halo and white angelic wings. He carried a golden harpoon in his left hand and a giant thick grimoire in his left hand. His flat silver hair, flat face, square facial outline, cube-like body, and square limbs made him look like a character from 8-bit games.\nThe Minecraft angel gazed at Leo. He uttered in a deep and loud noise.\n\"Criminal Florida Man! You have been charged with robbery! Will you pledge yourself guilty?!\"\nLeo smacked his lips and muttered, \"Please elaborate before you declare your verdict, sir judge. I don't even know what I stole.\"\nThe angel snorted, \"You stole FOOD from the Fate Stadium! Do you want me to show you the evidence? Once I show you the evidence, your sentence will be doubled!\"\n\"I'd rather see the proof, sir. I don't like being falsely accused. Besides, if I really stole something, I can reimburse the Fate Stadium with something of an equal value.\"\n\"SILENCE!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he didn't like the barbaric jurisdiction system of this Minecraft-like angel, but he remained quiet.\nThe angel flickered his fingers, and a floating monitor appeared. It showed the event when Leo picked up a bottle of whiskey from the Fate Stadium and vanished.",

What robbery? I only take what's mine.\"\nThe judge paused for a long time. He narrowed his eyes and gave Leo a meaningful look. \"According to Section 334, taking anything from Fate Stadium's VIP lounge outside is considered thievery depending on the value of the items taken!\"\n\"Tsk. That's butthurt crappy laws you have there,\" Leo quietly complained in a hushed voice. He wished to say to the angel directly, but he was wary of the 'Court Contempt Law'. Provoking the judge was not a good idea here.\nThe angel continued, \"The items you stole were a bottle of whiskey and three pieces of python deity steaks. The value of the items is…\"\nThe judge flinched and pulled a paper close to his face. His expression turned ugly.\n\"Well?\" Leo grinned. He believed that the value was not that high.\n\"The value of the stolen items… is ten essence stones.\"\nLeo almost burst into laughter. He fetched a handful of essence stones from his pocket and showed them to the judge, \"What's the fine? Can I pay for the stolen 'FOOD'?\"\nThe judge spat and pointed at Leo's face, \"Don't be arrogant! A crime is a crime! All your fate crystals and properties will be confiscated by the Fate Stadium! You will be thrown to the Chessboard of Judgment!\"\n\"…Are you serious?\" Leo's eyes turned cold.\n\"Ha! You idiot! That's Court Contempt! I charge you an additional 100 years and ten games of Death Chess! Guards! Strip this fool's fate crystals and give them to me!\"\nFour giant angels emerged from the white clouds and threw golden chains at Leo's glass coffin. Everybody had a square face and polygon-like physique, but everybody had four angelic wings and halos.\nOne of them mocked Leo. \"It's over, brat. Our 'Fate Crusher Chains' crushed countless entities to death in the past 1,000 years. Even karmic sovereigns are helpless against this artifact!\"\nAnother angel sneered and tightened his chain around the glass coffin. He sneered, \"You're lucky that the coffin is still protecting your soul, Junior. But it's too late for you. This coffin alone has the ability to seal your system abilities. The chains will continuously absorb your Qi to the last drop. And when your Qi is depleted, your cultivation base will regress until you become a helpless mortal. Once we're done with you, we'll decide what kind of chess piece we will assign you. For someone like you, a center pawn should fit you well. After all, almost central pawns die in early games, especially when the chess players are noobs.\"\nThe judge then added, blackmailing and threatening Leo, \"If you don't want to be reduced to a mortal, obediently take out fate crystals from your soul and give them to me. Then, we will lessen your sentence and free you from the glass coffin cage. You get to retain your cultivation base, too! What do you say? Are you willing to cooperate now?\"\nThe other two angels didn't speak, but their obnoxious smiles and ugly faces looked the same as the talkative bunch.\nLeo deeply sighed after he patiently listened to their schemes and unnecessary explanations. He opened the system menu and checked it.\nA red X overlay appeared on top of the system menu screen. A red message also informed Leo what the coffin was doing.\n[Your system has been temporarily sealed.]\n[You cannot access the Online Shopping System.]\n[You cannot access Domain System.]\n[You cannot access the PVP System.]\nStrangely, one of the systems could not be sealed.\n[ERROR! Failed to seal Dantian System!]\n[ERROR! Dantian System is the Host's Dao. Unable to steal the system!]\n\"…\"\nIgnoring the messages, Leo snorted. He gave up playing along with the crowd of clowns. As the negotiation failed, it was time to use force.\n\"It was not like he needed the systems in fights.\"\nHe raised his fist and lightly knocked on it.\nCLANK\nThe glass coffin shattered!\n\"WHAT?!\" The judge widened their eyes in shock. \"That's impossible! The coffins are made from a karmic sovereign's refined bones! How did a trashy thief like him destroy it?!\"\nThe four angels also wished to say the same words. They bellowed and commanded the golden chains to tighten, planning to crush Leo to death.\nThe gold chains tightened around Leo. The four guards injected their Qi into the artifacts, attempting to either kill Leo or drain his energy.\nLeo looked at the chains while he was wrapped into a semi-\nmummy. His eyes peeked through the chains and stared at the judge's face.\nThe judge wiped a drop of his sweat and laughed.\n\"Finally, you mess up, Florida Man! Nobody has survived against those chains! Fate Crusher Chains are made from 108 dead karmic river entities! Even if you're a karmic sovereign, your physical body and soul will mutate into a monster! You will lose all your sanity and revert into a mortal after the chains drain your Qi! Now, last chance! Give me your fate crystals, and we'll let you live!\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, Leo's expression turned dark. He deeply sighed.\n\"That was cringe, judge. Can't you come up with a better threat? You sound like one of those 3rd-rated villains in stories.\"\nThe judge was enraged. He pointed his finger and yelled, \"Just kill the fool and extract his fate crystals for me! END HIM, NOW!\"\nThe four angels exerted more force. Once again, they injected more Qi into the chains to drain Leo's energy.\nThe chains had two functions. They injected golden Qi into the victim to force the energy circulation, driving out all Qi from the victim's dantian. Then, the gold Qi would return to the artifact users.\nAnother function was the mutation ability. When gold Qi entered someone's body, the victim's DNA mutated. Afterward, the Qi would enter the host's soul and devour a portion of it, weakening the victim.\nThe judge and the four angels were confident in these artifacts. They had killed many arrogant karmic sovereigns who rebelled against the Fate Stadium before. None of them believed that a backwater cultivator like Leo could survive against their best weaponry.\nMeanwhile, Leo stood still and stared at the judge. He didn't move or utter a word.\nNone of his energy escaped his body. Instead, he gradually absorbed gold Qi from the chains into his dantian universe.\nIn Leo's dantian universe, alligators evolved into lizardmen. Some of them already learned how to cultivate, and a few already reached the immortal stage. Gold Qi from the chains entered Leo's universe and flowed toward the local population.\nWhen the wandering immortals noticed the new type of energy in the universe, they rushed to absorb it like a starving man seeing a bowl of soup. As soon as the lizardmen touched the gold Qi, they refined the new form of energy into their own while they excreted used Qi to the universe, working as a natural filter.\nThe used Qi was digested and purified by the dantian universe. Thick gold gas emerged and flowed toward the void in Leo's space. Soon, they condensed into a new star.\nBecause of the time dilation between reality and Leo's universe, his digestive speed surpassed the speed at which the golden chain could draw his energy. The dantian's suction force was stronger than the golden chains, causing the flow of energy to reverse.\nGold Qi from the chains slowly depleted. As soon as the artifacts were about to run out of Qi, they absorbed the energy of their owners.\nThe faces of the four angels were ashen. Sweat drops covered their faces while their knees slowly lost strength.\n10 minutes later, the four angels fell on their knees. Everybody lost 90% of their Qi.\n\"S-Senior Judge… Help.\"\nThe judge bellowed, \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! KILL THAT MAN ALREADY! WE NEED HIS FATE CRYSTALS, NOW!\"\n\"S-Senior…W-We…\"\nSoon, the angels ran out of Qi. Then, stars in their dantian universe exploded one after another to produce emergency energy and Qi to sustain their souls.\n\"N-No!\"\nOne of them realized the mishap. He let go of the chains.\nHowever, the tip of his artifacts moved as if they were alive. Two chains wrapped around his body instead.\n\"W-WHAT?! NOOOOO!!\"\nThe others also had the same fate. Their weapons stopped listening to their will and followed the command of the other user, whom they tried to kill.\nLeo licked the tip of his wounded tongue after he purposely spat his blood on each chain. He also connected his karma strings with the items, changing their ownership.\nReceiving such an immense Qi, the chains radiated rainbow light. They loosened the bind and moved according to Leo's will, tying the four angels instead.\nAfter the chains released Leo, he stretched and straightened his back. A loud spinal crack sound refreshed him.\n\"Ow, that's the spot!\" Leo let out a long sigh of relief. \"Chains, I want their life force.\"\nThe chains shone a blinding light. Radiating heat enveloped the four angels.\n\"NOOOOOO!!\"\n\"HEEEEELP MEEEEEE!!\"\nThe chains stole their life force and Qi to the last drop. The former masters of the weapons were reduced to dry mummies while their souls disappeared from the universe forever.\nAfter devouring the angels, the chains moved, floating freely like flying snakes. All artifacts coiled around Leo, protecting their new master.\nThe judge fell from his chair and failed to stand up. While backing away, he yelled.\n\"GUARDS! ARREST THE REBEL! ARREST HIM! NO, KILL HIM!!\"\nA hundred angels rushed toward Leo from all sides. Everybody carried a similar gold chain around them.\nLeo slowly walked out of the shattered glass coffin, approaching the judge. While walking straight toward the square angel, a hundred chains flew toward him.\nBOOM\nThe four chains of the four dead angels released rainbow light and repelled the gold chains for Leo.\nLeo glanced at the chains. He suddenly had a strange inspiration.\n'If I turn one of the local population in my dantian universe into super experts, can I bring them out to help me?'\nLeo sent his consciousness to his dantian universe to meet one of the lizardmen and alligators that he had been secretly raising.",

Although their vocabulary was limited, everybody understood each other by observing the speaker's gestures and annotations.\nImmortal lizardmen gathered and socialized. Unlike selfish cultivators in the universe, none of them competed for resources or took advantage of the others.\nLizardmen worked as one. Strong immortals selflessly imparted their knowledge to youngsters while regular immortals brainstormed and researched the way of daos together.\nBecause of their unity, most lizardmen and immortals had the same set of skills. There were also cons: Their culture made them lack imagination and diversity. Thus, their cultivation progress got stuck in the deity realm.\nLeo's consciousness arrived at a lizardmen-infested planet where lizard deities established cultivation schools. He revealed his appearance as a human with four rainbow phoenix wings.\nThat was Leo's serious form. He also nicknamed it as the 'Second Phase'.\nWhen Leo showed up in front of the lizardmen, the locals gazed at Leo in shock and astonishment, yet nobody attempted to challenge or provoke Leo due to their peaceful nature.\n\"Guys! I'm looking for volunteers! No, I'm taking in disciples! Those who are willing to come under my wings will receive my guidance!\"\nThe gators were taken aback at first. Fortunately, they understood Leo's words perfectly. Some of the deities jumped for joy.\n\"GYATT!\" (I volunteer!)\n\"GYATT!\" (TAKE ME, SIR!)\nInstantly, 50 deities volunteered. Leo was glad that they were cooperative.\n\"Good. But first, I need to test something…\"\nLeo proceeded with his plan. He drew four souls of the volunteers and attempted to bring them to the real world.\n.\n.\nLeo opened his eyes. It took him less than a second to visit the lizardmen and bring them out. However, as the souls lacked a host, they could not manifest in reality.\nWithout hesitation, Leo injected their souls into the gold chains.\nThe new souls were surprised at first. However, the gold chains contained several strong daos, which none of them had learned before.\nThe new knowledge excited the lizardmen. They absorbed the new daos like a sponge and figured out how the chains worked. Five seconds later, they mastered how they could manipulate and control the chains.\nLeo was relieved. He whispered to the four souls.\n\"This is your first test. Show your power against those birbs.\"\n\"GATOR GYATT!\" The four souls in the chains shouted in unison and dispersed, charging toward the surrounding angels.\nThe angels also retaliated, sending their golden chains to block the sentient artifacts.\nA hundred gold chains outnumbered the four gators. 20 of them latched onto the four newbies while 20 angels injected their Qi into their weapons.\nLeo saw that. He brought out 100 random rocks that he got from the asteroid belt. Flickering them with his fingers, the rocks were shot like bullets.\nPU\nPU\nExploiting the bullet time sense, Leo turned simple rocks into entity-killing bullets, shattering the heads of the angels one after another until the last man. Their souls escaped from the destroyed flesh and screamed in pain.\n\"W-What!?\"\nThe judge couldn't believe his eyes. His people were known to be the strongest karmic sovereign killers, yet everybody lost instantly.\nLeo ignored the judge's reaction. As the angels lost their bodies, the gold chains became ownerless. Leo hummed and collected everything. Then, he repeated what he had done to the four gold chains earlier.\nMore gators from Leo's dantian universe were summoned and injected into the weapons. The new artifacts became alive and wiggled in joy.\nHowever, the gators weren't satisfied with just the new bodies. They turned their attention to the escaped souls of angels.\n\"GYATT!!\"\nIn just one word, all 104 chains chased after the escaped souls. They captured everyone.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nReturning the favor, the chains absorbed the life force and Qi of the angels and transferred them into the gators. The lizardman deities devoured everything and improved their cultivation base.\nThe deities quickly adapted to the real world's cultivation method. They started condensing stars in their dantians, creating a lower dimension one their own.\nAs the gators grew stronger, the chains emitted stronger lights.\nLeo was happy with this experiment. He let the guys celebrate while he approached the judge. With a wiggle of his hand, he pulled the square angel to his palm and choked his neck.\nAfter the angel was in his hand, Leo started questioning him.\n\"Let's restart our conversation. How about something basic to break the ice? Who are you?\"\nThe angel growled in anger, \"LET ME GO, YOU TRASH! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I AM THE JUDGE OF HEAVENLY FATE STADIUM!\"\n\"Good start. How about your name?\" Leo shrugged and strengthened his grip. The choke squeezed the angel's neck so hard that his square eyes were almost ejected from the eye sockets.\n\"L-Let go…\"\nThe light warning worked like magic. The judge lowered his voice in fear.\nLeo asked him again, \"Don't test my patient. What's your name?\"\n\"I-I'm Brack of Jade, the Sentinel of Heavenly Fate Stadium…\"\n\"That's better. What is the nature of your job?\"\n\"A-As I tell you. I'm the sentinel of the stadium. M-My job is irrelevant to you-\"\nLeo inserted his other hand into the angel's fleshly body. He grabbed a string of karma, \"Strike two. One more time, I'll erase your entity forever.\"\nThe angel broke a cold sweat. He looked around and found 104 living golden chains circling around him.\nSeeing no way out, he trembled.\n\"P-Please don't kill me.\"\n\"As long as you cooperate.\"\n\"Y-Yes. Yes. I'll cooperate.\" The previous arrogant attitude disappeared like the wind. Brack confessed, \"I'm working for a transcendent cultivator by the alias Sieg.\"\n\"Okay? Who is this 'Sieg'?\"\n\"H-He's the owner of the Fate Stadium. He…\"\nBrack suddenly flinched and paused for a long time. His entire body bloated and expanded as if he were hit by Kenshiro's punches. Two seconds later, his body and soul exploded, scattering blood and flesh everywhere.\nLeo raised his eyebrows and looked at the exploded angel in confusion. Although his bodily cells could mutate and kill living beings, most of the entities were immune to his power. Brack, too, should have been able to resist his ability. Despite the potential immunity, he still died from mutation.\n'Was it because of me? Nah, my radiation can't destroy souls. I need to check…'\nDoubting Brack's cause of death, Leo picked up a piece of flesh from the pile. He licked it.\nThere was no taste of radiation or his cancer cells. Instead, it smelled like rotten chicken.\n'Yeah. That was not me.'\nConfirming that he was not responsible for Brack's death, Leo recollected the information. First, there was someone behind Brack. Secondly, he was a transcended being, whose cultivation base surpassed the karmic sovereign stage. Also, he had the power to destroy the soul of an entity like Brack.\nAnd lastly and theoretically, the mysterious guy by the name 'Sieg' might be the owner of the Fate Stadium.\nLeo opened his system menu and checked it. The screens showed up and worked as usual.\nAs the systems functioned once again, Leo stopped worrying about it. He closed the screens and examined his surroundings.\nThe clouds in the void were as bright as usual. However, no beings remained here but Leo.\nLeo took this opportunity to inspect the seat of Brack and his furniture behind the court stand. Upon reaching his chair, he found a cardboard box of jade slips.\nJade slips usually contained messages and thoughts of cultivators who left behind their thoughts. However, this was the first time that Leo encountered one.\nCurious, Leo picked one up to inspect it. He flipped it around confusedly like a monkey at first. Fortunately, he was smart enough to inject his Qi to inspect it.\nThe jade slip glowed and ejected the hidden voice of the previous owner. Ironically, the ex-owner was Brack.\n[Lord Sieg, I've collected two heavenly fate crystals from Player Xia Wu. His soul has been erased as instructed, sir.]\nLeo smirked. This was enough proof that Sieg was the mastermind behind the collection of fate crystals. He remembered the name, marking Sieg as his next hit list.\n'A transcended being… This might be troublesome. In the past, I've been fighting karmic sovereigns and entities. My true strength should be around the transcendent stage as well. If I meet that guy, I might be at a disadvantage. I never fought a transcendent before…'\nFor the first time, Leo was intimidated. He wished he had a higher cultivation base than Seig.\nBut then, Leo remembered that his system allowed him to upgrade his cultivation limit or cultivation aptitude. He only needed one karmic fate crystal to do so.\nFiguring a method to gain an advantage, Leo was determined. His next major project would be treasure hunting.\nNot wasting time, Leo opened the PVP menu. The screen showed up. Unlike before, the functions were restored, and Leo could join the arena again.\nLeo smirked and mocked Sieg.\n\"Your systems aren't that omnipotent, it seems. If you were a proper programmer, this system would have restricted my access. Now that the system allows me to rejoin the stadium, you've lost your initiative!\"\nLeo collected all the golden chains into his storage ring. He boldly pressed a button, challenging the monthly PVP match.\n.\n.\nWHOOSH\nLeo immediately reappeared in the arena as usual. He stood alone in the stadium this time.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\nWhen Leo appeared, the crowd looked confused. They muttered and whispered.\n\"I saw the news. Isn't Florida Man a wanted man?\"\n\"You saw that, too? The news is spreading fast. I thought the player hunter squadron had been deployed already. How is he still here?\"\n\"Maybe, he wants to submit himself to the authority?\"\n\"Probably. I think we might see a Death Chess Match here today.\"\nLeo silently eavesdropped their conversation. He also recalled the distasteful chess game that he once saw in one of the Fate Stadium's facilities.\nWHOOSH\nWhile Leo was waiting, a hundred entities teleported to the arena. They were also angels with square physiques.",

There's a warrant for you. Follow us obediently or lose the qualifications as a player forever!\" The speaking angel's killing intent and cold eyes fixated on Leo.\nLeo crossed his arms and scoffed at the angels, \"I already did, and that judge by the name 'Brack the Jade' released me! What's the point of arresting me again, may I ask?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe angels in the arena knew the name of the judge. They looked at each other in confusion while one of them transmitted his voice to his superior officers.\nAfter a few seconds of hesitation and confusion, the angels received a new order from the stadium's managers. Their expressions turned dark, and their killing intent exploded.\n\"Florida Man, you scoundrel heretic! Lay down your weapon and surrender, then we'll give you a peaceful death!\"\nAnother angel also shouted, \"HERETIC! CUT OFF YOUR ARMS AND SURRENDER!\"\nMore angels bellowed in unison, \"SEAL HIS SYSTEMS! REMOVE HIS SYSTEM POWERS!\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes as he was concerned about their system manipulation abilities. Since it was impossible to reason with them, Leo took the initiative by releasing the 104 golden chains.\nThe deity lizardmen's souls in the chains were ejected from Leo's storage rings and charged toward every angel in the arena. Half of them bound the agents and started draining their life force.\nLeo also attempted to move, but his feet were glued to the stage arena. He looked at the ground and smacked his lips.\n\"Annoying restrictions.\"\nUnable to move, Leo changed his approach. Again, he opened his system inventory and ejected a thousand small rocks. He flickered small asteroids at the remaining survivors.\nThe remaining angels managed to parry the attacks from Leo's chains. But the next second, finger-sized rocks beamed toward them at light speed, blasting their heads into shattering watermelons. Even the bound agents took the same hit.\nThe souls of the angels escaped the destroyed fleshly bodies. The souls of these entities continued screaming and ordering others.\n\"Why hasn't his system sealed yet?! Has anybody informed the Lord?!\"\n\"MANAGERS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\"\n\"CUT HIS SYSTEM ABILITIES ALREADY!\"\nTheir loud noise caused a commotion in the other arenas. The spectators also stood up and rushed toward the exits as if they were students getting stuck at school during a school shooting massacre.\nThe chains ignored everything and grabbed their souls. The lizardmen gleefully devoured the angels and stole their life force.\nLeo smiled at the golden chains as he was proud of his creations. Still, killing these annoying pests couldn't solve the trouble at the moment.\nHis feet were still stuck in the arena.\nAnnoyed by the fate stadium's power, Leo got serious. He used the previous power that he had shown in the fight against Simba.\nFour rainbow phoenix wings emerged from his back. His skin radiated in white light while blinding silver light came out from his eyes. In addition, his aura revealed his true cultivation base.\nSurpassing the karmic sovereign realm was the transcendent realm. At this stage, the minor rank was classified into levels.\nDING\nDING\nDING\nThe scoreboard of the fate stadium changed as it detected Leo's true strength. Instead of hiding his information as usual, the scoreboards revealed all of Leo's personal information.\n.\nName: Leonardo Ariel\nTitle/Alias: Florida Man\nRace: Chimera Homunculus\nAge: 50,035\nGender: Male\nLevel / Cultivation Base: Transcendent Level 10\n.\nLeo gazed at his status board and scoffed. He vaguely knew about it as he had learned about the cultivation potential ceiling from the system before.\nThis reminded him of how powerful the systems were. He got frustrated.\n'If the systems can discern my cultivation base and upgrade my cultivation potential, won't Sieg be stronger than I am? This is troublesome.'\nBecause of frustration, Leo exerted more strength on his legs. He managed to lift his right leg up and stomp the ground.\nBOOM\nThe entire arena cracked and was broken in half. The supporting structures underneath crumbled.\nThe spreading cracks reached the spectator stands and observer decks. The barrier arrays that had been preventing stray bullets shattered, and the ground sunk.\nAfter stomping hard, Leo's feet were free. He levitated and observed his deeds.\nRUMBLE\nThe whole arena area turned into ruins. The ceilings shook. Dust scattered everywhere, and the space vacuum underneath the stages sucked some of the debris into the void.\nThe whole Fate Stadium was on the verge of being destroyed!\n\"Erm, whoops?\"\nLeo awkwardly smiled. Destroying the entire Fate Stadium wasn't his intention. He only wanted to free himself from the predicament.\n\"I guess I have to stop throwing myself into trouble. I'm not that invincible. I have to remind myself that… Right. Be humble, Leo. Be humble.\" He reminded himself and slapped his cheeks. Then, he inspected the system menus.\nAll system screens turned red. A huge \"ERROR\" warning overlapped with the usual menus.\nLeo had expected this. The last time when the electricity went down, his system was affected. He believed that his system functions relied on the Fate Stadium's mysterious power.\nHe didn't like that.\n'What should I do to be the true owner of a system!?' Leo thought and accidentally sent his voice transmission to all his four heavenly generals.\nHis question was quickly answered. The voice of Aslan echoed in Leo's mind.\n'Find seven entity fate crystals and turn them into a true entity fate crystal. That way, your systems won't be affected by the Fate Stadium. If better, you just need to find a karmic fate crystal. Once you do, no one can influence your system powers.'\nLeo was overjoyed by the enlightenment. However, at the same time, he doubted how Aslan knew of this.\nIn solemn, Leo asked Aslan in his mind.\n'I'm going to be serious this time. I want a serious answer only. Kitten, I heard from Meowmeow that you had a soul. Who are you exactly?'\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Aslan had been sitting at a coffee table on a white cloud in space. His expression was pale even though he was a stone golem.\nIn front of him was a colossus being, whose body was as large as the Milky Way Galaxy. The being was an eyeball with eight angelic wings. However, its aura exuded the air of a level 10 transcendent being.\nThe eyeball glared at Aslan. He uttered in a deep voice, which sounded like a big man and a hoarse woman spoke in unison.\n\"You know what your son has done, right?\"\nAslan slowly nodded, \"Yes.\"\n\"He has troubled me greatly. Normally, I would have descended and killed him.\"\nAslan deeply inhaled. He mustered his courage and rebuked, \"Your subordinates are the ones provoking my son. Had they never framed him for a petty crime, the entire thing wouldn't have happened. Also, it was your subordinate who coveted my son's fate crystals. His actions are justified.\"\nThe eyeball flickered while his wings flinched. He didn't utter a word as if he was pondering what to reply.\nAslan pushed on, \"Senior Sieg. I know that you have been collecting entity fate crystals and you're on a quest to find the true karmic fate crystal as well. This time, we accidentally collide because of your greedy underlings. We are willing to let this bygone be bygone as long as you can pull back your player hunter squads out of our territory. What do you say?\"\nThe eyeball 'Sieg' grimaced. He hated the idea, \"Are you taking me for a fool? Why should I reconcile with you when I can even destroy your soul right now?!\"\nAslan sneered, \"My soul is connected to my son's karma river. If I die, he will know. Do you want to enrage a transcendent being who carries the bloodline of rainbow phoenixes? I'm sure Overlord Priscilla won't be sitting still if she heard about your deed that you're provoking one of her kin.\"\nRUMBLE\nSieg was enraged. His eight wings transformed into small tentacles and bound Aslan. Some of the tentacles cut his arms and legs, leaving Aslan limbless.\n\"LISTEN HERE, YOU ELF BRAT! DO YOU THINK A PUNY ENTITY LIKE YOU CAN THREATEN ME? A TRANSCENDENT BEING?! YOU OVERESTIMATE YOUR CAPABILITIES, AND YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR SINS!\"\nAslan gritted his teeth and bellowed.\n\"Yes, if you consider this talk as a negotiation, I'm not even qualified to have this talk to begin with. But as you can see, I'm the only one in the universe WHO CAN CREATE TRANSCENDENT HOSTS! MY SON IS THE PROOF OF MY CAPABILITIES!\"\n\"…\"\nSieg froze. The eyeball floated closer to Aslan to look at his face. He then glared into his soul, yet he waited for Aslan to make the offer.\nAslan kept pushing on.\n\"Here is the deal. Pull back your troops and promise not to attack or harm us for 10 years. In return, I'll create a new fleshly body to replace the old one that you lost to Overlord Priscilla.\"\nSieg closed his eyes and receded. He fell into a deep thought for several minutes.\nAfter thinking things through, Sieg opened his eyes.\n\"Let me confirm this. A 10-year truce in exchange for my new body?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Heheh, what if you rig something that shouldn't have existed as you did to Mao Miaomiao?\"\n\"I'm not that stupid. Mao Miaomiao was a greedy fool, unlike you who always thinks ahead.\"\nThe eyeball curved up his under eyelid. He laughed, \"Indeed, you're not stupid. You were the one who tricked Eleanor's downfall. Well, I don't trust you. I'm going to add a new clause to our agreement.\"\n\"A new condition?\" Aslan had a bad feeling about this.\n\"Well, yes. I need to make sure that you will work diligently to complete my new fleshly body. Therefore, I'll trap your soul in my dantian universe and link your existence to my karma river. Until you complete it, you can't go anywhere!\"\nAslan's expression turned dark again. He clicked his tongue, \"No can do. I need the best environment to work. If I leave my son, my existence will fade to nothingness.\"\nSieg laughed, \"As I said, I'm no fool. I read you like a book. Your soul isn't really tied to your son whatsoever. Instead, you left your true soul with the entity fate crystal in your son's soul. I just need to take that soul out of your son first.\"\n\"YOU!!\"\nAslan bellowed, but Sieg's tentacles pressed him down to the cloud floor.\nSieg laughed, \"Well, let me go find your son. Once we have your soul, we can make a deal. HAHAHAHA!\"\n\"BASTARD! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL MY SON?!\"\n\"HAHAHA! For the third time, Aslan. I'm no fool! Why should I let your son get stronger when I can kill him now?! There's no point in allowing another rival to emerge! Also, Priscilla and I have been sworn enemies since we were children. What's the difference between adding another grudge on top of what we already have? And once I'm done with your son, I get you who can work your ass off for me for the rest of eternity! HAHAHAHAHA!\"\n\"…\"\nAslan groaned and lowered his head, allowing the eyeball to feel good about himself.\nThe giant eyeball transformed into a small soul and faded. He teleported and rushed toward Leo.\nAfter Sieg had left, Aslan was freed from the tentacles. He regenerated his limbs and smirked. Afterward, he whispered.\n\"Did you catch everything?\"\nA second later, a female voice from a distance echoed in his mind.\n'Loud and clear. So, he's heading to that stupid Fate Stadium, right?'\n\"Yes, my son should be there at the moment.\"\n'Roger. I'll go intercept him.'\n\"Please remember our promises, Lady Priscilla.\"\n'Don't worry. I'm not like that greedy eyeball. I'll protect you and that boy. He has my bloodline, right?'\n\"Haha. Yes.\"\n'Although I've never had a child, he's born from my blood. In a way, he's my child as well. Should I say that I'm his mother?'\n\"That will complicate things… I'm his father, you know. He will think that you and I are married or something.\"\n'Pfft, hahahaha! Yeah, right. Anyway, we talk too much. I'll go now.'\nThe secret weapon that Aslan had prepared 'Overlord Priscilla' started to move. As for Aslan, he let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"All according to Keikaku.\"\nA few seconds later, Leo's voice entered Aslan's mind. His son yelled at him.\n\"What should I do to be the true owner of a system!?\"\nAslan was speechless for a moment. He then giggled. \"Oh, boy. What a needy child. I guess I should give him hints again.\"",

He wanted an honest answer for once.\nAslan didn't answer Leo for a long time. It annoyed Leo as he could sense that the golem was still alive.\nRUMBLE\nWhile waiting for the answer, the Fate Stadium crumbled. Spotlights shut down, and darkness devoured the entire colony. Leo's eyes still shone in white light, illuminating the destroyed arena.\nFloating alone in the darkness, Leo gave up waiting for Aslan's reply. He fluttered his four rainbow wings, preparing to blast his way out of this colony.\n\"I feel bad. Those little cat aliens and that weapon shop owner are gonna be pissed. Should I find them and get them to migrate to my planet instead?\"\nLeo looked below and noticed the gaps in cracked floors. He gathered more strength and stomped on the arena again.\nThe impact caused the ground and components underneath the stages to cave in as if a comet descended upon the colony.\nBOOM\nBecause of the great force, the impact pushed the components apart like a drill digging through soft ground, puncturing through all metallic objects.\nFinally, Leo could see the stars through the hole. He smiled and flew out of the colony.\nAfter leaving the crumbling colony, Leo looked back and pursed his lips. He thought of the innocent people inside, especially the cute octopus-cats.\n'Maybe, I should visit those cats one day. For now, I should find my way home.'\nLeo reopened his system menu. Looking at the screen with a large X mark, he shook his head. The systems no longer worked. At best, Leo could open the screen to check its function.\nHe turned around and scanned the stars around him.\nSuddenly, Leo sensed a chill running down his spine. He pulled the staff of singularity out of his chest and pointed at the empty void behind him. Without hesitation, he fired a beam cannon from his staff.\nThe rainbow beams radiated like the Sun. Even Leo narrowed his eyes.\nBANG\nThe beam hit something at a distance. A second later, Leo widened his eyes and flapped his wings in urgent.\nBOOM\nA rainbow beam originating from the distance broke Leo's beam and passed through the area where Leo had been. It grazed the stadium and evaporated everything in its path.\nLeo took a deep breath. He thought of the mysterious dark elf that he fought several days ago.\n'This is gonna be a hard fight. I wish he was as strong as the previous guy. I guess it can't be helped. I have been running amok in this universe for so long. It's about time I run into a REAL powerhouse being.'\nPreparing to fight with his life on the line, Leo removed his usual clothes and put on a set of armor and helmet, which he had obtained from Mao Miaomiao's clones. It was not the best, but a karmic sovereign's equipment was better than Leo's shabby skin suit.\nThe assailant from a distance transformed into a steak of light, blinking and flashing a thousand times within a split second. Instantly, it appeared behind Leo.\nLeo sensed the mysterious light behind him. He also teleported and reappeared one light-year away from the previous location.\nThe mysterious light chased after Leo. It directly flew like a bullet and instantly hit Leo in the chest.\n\"Ugh!\"\nFor the first time, Leo felt pain in the real world. The impact also broke Mao Miaomiao's plate mail and two of his ribcages. But after taking the hit, Leo finally identified the ambusher.\nThe assailant was a small eyeball with eight small wings. At a glance, it resembled the prosthetic eyeballs that Leo had once synthesized in the past. However, this one didn't actually have a physical appearance.\nIt was a mass of intense energy similar to Leo's dantian universe.\nAfter hitting Leo in the chest, it backed away and transformed into a giant eyeball mass. Then, it projected an illusion of a galaxy behind it.\nThe eyeball's under eyelid curved up as if it mocked Leo.\n\"Nice to meet you, Florida Man. Now, DIE AND GIVE YOUR FATE CRYSTALS TO ME!!\"\nThe galaxy illusion behind the eyeball manifested into the real universe. Over a trillion karmic sovereigns and entities flew out of the stars and chased after Leo.\nLeo was stunned.\n\"DAMMIT! YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT?!\"\nLeo gnashed his teeth. As he didn't have enough confidence to fight so many karmic sovereigns and entities at once, he turned around and flew away.\nHis speed surpassed the pursuers. The karmic sovereigns and entities could, at best, fly at the speed of light. On the other hand, Leo traveled at 10-light-year worth of distance within a second.\nWHOOSH\nBut he couldn't shake off one thing.\nBehind Leo, the transparent eyeball kept up with his speed. The monstrous angel also laughed.\n\"HAHAHA! KEEP RUNNING, YOU COWARD! ARE YOU REALLY A TRANSCENDENT EXPERT?! YOU ARE JUST A CHICK!\"\nLeo frowned. He wished he could turn around and fight the mysterious monster, but he was wary of the guy's power and tricky abilities.\nWhile fleeing, Leo guessed the monster's identity.\n\"You're Sieg, the master of the Fate Stadium, I assume.\"\nSieg cackled, \"You are well informed. Though, I'm quite disappointed. I thought the son of the divine elf's top genius inherited half of his abilities. It seems that his son is a wastrel.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo ignored the taunt even though he was interested in the topic. He kept teleporting while he pondered a way to combat this monster.\n10 seconds later, Leo ejected ten drops of his blood from his fingernails. After teleporting, he left behind one drop. Then, he vanished to another place.\nSieg reappeared at the place where the blood lingered. As Sieg was about to blink, the blood detonated.\nAlthough the explosion was strong enough to erase Eleanor's body and soul, Sieg smirked.\n\"Petty trick!\"\nBOOM\nThe explosion engulfed the eyeball monster. However, the being jetted through the blast and continued chasing after Leo as if nothing had happened.\nAfter another teleportation, Sieg found tree droplets of Leo's blood. The eyeball squinted.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nFacing three consecutive explosions, Sieg's teleportation rhythm was delayed by two seconds.\nThe eyeball came out from the blasts unharmed. It looked up and found Leo's life signature at the edge of his detection range.\n\"YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME!\"\nSieg got serious. He accelerated and blinked. Instantly, he directly appeared in front of Leo.\nLeo flinched when Sieg suddenly showed up in front of him. Still, everything went according to his plan.\nSix droplets of blood shot out from Leo's palm and hit Sieg. They glowed in rainbow light.\n\"STOP WASTING MY TIME!\" Sieg bellowed while his pupils dilated.\nLeo snorted and vanished. A split second later, a rainbow beam came out from Sieg's pupil and vanished into the void.\nThe beam missed the target. Sieg turned around to search for Leo's life signature.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe life signature was right behind Sieg.\n\"DAMMIT!\"\nSieg transformed his eight wings into rainbow shields. One of them shapeshifted into a giant tree, which grew into a world tree.\nFloating behind Sieg was Leo. He cut his left wrist with his nail and ejected a lot of transparent blood. He also pulled out a piece of his bone and turned it into a scythe.\nThe leaking blood transformed into white full plate armor, covering Leo from head to toe. Leo also swung his scythe down.\nSWUA\nLeo's scythe cut through the growing world tree and four layers of Sieg's shields. Unfortunately, the strike was too shallow. One layer of shield remained.\nThe destroyed world tree scattered a million golden apples everywhere. As if Sieg copied Leo's trick, they illuminated in rainbow light and bloated.\n\"Tsk!\"\nLeo vanished, teleporting away from the bloating apples.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThe apples exploded, generating supernova blasts.\nLeo reappeared 10 light years of distance away from Sieg. He rubbed his wrist, which was already healed. His bone regenerated, and he still held his bone scythe and staff of singularity.\nWHOOM\nWHOOM\nWHOOM\nSuddenly, a billion portals were opened, surrounding Leo in every direction. The trillion karmic sovereigns and entities earlier emerged from the portals and charged at him.\n\"ARGH! ANNOYING!\"\nLeo grumbled and activated his domain, covering everybody. Then, he swung his scythe.\nSWUA\nIn one swing, the trillion karmic sovereigns and entities were cleaved in half. The souls of the entities perished, but the karmic sovereigns ejected their souls and regenerated their fleshly bodies.\nThe distraction gave enough time for Sieg to catch up with Leo. The eyeball monster reappeared above Leo, and he came prepared.\nCLANK\nAs soon as the eyeball locked his sight on Leo, the latter's domain shattered. Leo coughed blood!\n\"IT'S OVER! DIE!!\"\nSieg transformed into a giant saber and hacked toward Leo's head.\nLeo bellowed and swung his scythe. The weapon parried the giant saber, but the bone scythe was destroyed as a consequence.\nHe didn't give up. After pushing the saber away, Leo pointed his staff at the saber and fired another rainbow beam.\nBOOM\nIt was a direct hit. The saber's blade was broken in half!\nThe transformation of Sieg was undone. His manifested soul physique reverted into a giant eyeball.\nA change was noticeable. There was a huge scar in his pupils.\n\"YOU BASTARD! HOW DARE YOU CUT MY SOUL!?\"\nLeo panted, but he smirked. He mustered his strength and teleported away once more. Moreover, he also triggered more massive explosions, created from the vomited blood earlier.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nThis time, a thousand supernova blasts hit Sieg unprepared.\n.\n.\nAn hour later, the center of the explosion subsided. All karmic sovereigns under Sieg perished.\nThe eyeball lost 70% of its mass. It was in a trance, panting and staggering.\nDespite the grave injuries, Sieg fumed in rage.\n\"FLORIDA MAN! ASLAN! I SWEAR, YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY WILL PAY FOR THIS!\"\n10 seconds after the outburst, Sieg slowly restored his mass. However, his energy and aura weakened. His majestic presence of a transcendent entity was no more.\nWhile recuperating, Sieg let out a long sigh. He gave up chasing after Leo or Aslan for now. He also let down his guard.\nHe temporarily forgot about his rival for a moment.\nAs if karma had eyes, a transcendent entity suddenly appeared behind Sieg. When he turned around, it was already too late.\nBehind Sieg was a galaxy-sized rainbow phoenix.\n\"Wah!\" Overlord Priscilla greeted her sworn enemy.\nSieg couldn't even utter a word. Her rainbow flame devoured his soul and evaporated his existence.",

After confirming Sieg's true death, she loudly screeched.\nRUMBLE\nThe screech created a sound shockwave, which revealed hidden karma strings and traces of the dead transcendent being. The space rippled, causing several elusive fate crystals to be visible.\nThe phoenix smiled and pulled a thousand crystals to herself. She hummed and sorted them in a good mood.\n\"Hehehe. Four freaking true entity fate crystals, 44 true heavenly fate crystals, and a thousand expendable junks. You have been working very hard, Sieg. Thanks for the hard work. I'll be taking them.\"\nSieg had been collecting and plundering fate crystals from many fate bearers by attracting them to the Fate Stadium. He also exploited his true entity fate crystals' power by infecting other players with his superior systems, binding their system functions to the Fate Stadium.\nWith him gone and the Fate Stadium destroyed, the virus would cease being active, allowing the other system users to be freed from the restrictions. However, the true fate crystals in Priscilla's hands could easily reseal everything.\nFortunately, that was not Priscilla's intention. She had other aims and goals.\n\"Finally, that stupid Fate Stadium can no longer trick innocent fate bearers into that death trap. With this, only two transcendent beings exist in universe 13. With me in charge, the next singularity ascension gathering won't be chaotic anymore… unless Ellen or Kishin Douji accidentally reach the transcendent stage.\"\nPriscilla clicked her tongue as she had some concerns. From her point of view, there were still two variables that could complicate things in the long run – Ellen and the patriarch of the Kishin Clan 'Kishin Douji'.\n\"If it wasn't for the oath, I would have unalived those two. Well, I can leave them to my NEW son, can't I? It's his business now, not mine. Hahahaha!\"\nAfter the laughter, Priscilla collected all fate crystals in the dimensional pockets in her wings, but she left one true entity fate crystal out. Her beak caught it and held it there.\nThat crystal was not for her. It was for someone else.\n\"Come to think of it, that bratty elf bragged that the boy just got married recently. Well, I should at least give my illegitimate son something.\"\nWHOOSH\nPriscilla vanished.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo freely floated in the void. He pressed his left hand on his chest while hyperventilating. Even though no oxygen was present in the void, polluted Qi and gas were still useful. Leo inhaled some of them and filtered them into useful Qi, restoring his energy.\nHis stamina almost ran out of the tank in the previous fight. Most of the stars in his dantian universe were barren except for the habitable planets of alligators and lizardmen.\nAfter staying in space for a day, Leo removed Mao Miaomiao's broken armor and checked his wounds. Most of his injuries were healed except for some internal damages. The domain-\nbreaking backlash did a number on Leo.\nLeo gazed at the dark void in a daze. He no longer sensed the life signature of Sieg and other pursuers, but he couldn't get rid of a dreadful feeling.\nThe fight took a toll on his psyche. He felt like he had just woken up from a hellish nightmare.\n\"How did I survive?\"\nConfused and flustered, Leo sought help from others. He opened the system menu to see if Sieg had already erased his power.\nDING\nThe X-mark layer on top of the system screens was gone. His lifespan shop, the quest menu, the inventory menu, and the shopping mall system resumed functioning.\nOn the other hand, the PVP tabs were removed. All gacha banners were erased from the screens and menus.\nLeo scratched his head as he realized the gravity of his current situation. He hated this development. Without the PVP tabs, Leo had no other method to find the way home!\n\"Crap. Where am I? How do I get home?\"\nLeo looked around, but he couldn't recognize any star around his vicinity. Moreover, the closest galaxy was at least 10,000 light years away, and it was an unknown star cluster.\nAs being panicked wouldn't help, Leo let out a long sigh and paced his breaths. His wings produced rainbow flame, illuminating a beacon in the darkness.\nAfter setting up an SOS beacon, Leo closed his eyes and searched for his familiars.\nThen, he found hope.\nIt was vague, but Aslan's presence was close by. He was just 800 light-years from Leo's current location. Moreover, he could sense the faint energy of a dragon dreadnaught that he had seen in the asteroid belt.\n\"Ah, there you are.\"\nA smile finally appeared on Leo's face. He began his journey toward his subordinate.\n…\nFlying through space was easy as no gravity influenced Leo's movements and speed. Even the heaviest stars in the area were too far away to affect Leo's flight course and speed.\nAfter flying for a day, Leo arrived at the place where he last sensed Aslan. He landed on a continent of white clouds in space.\nUpon arrival, Leo knelt and scooped the clouds. Instead of catching air, he got solid sparkling silver sand on his palm.\nInterested in the sands, Leo opened his inventory system. The screen sucked everything into the designated inventory slot. He totally forgot about Aslan and the emergency.\nTime passed. Leo forgot about time as the cloud continent was too massive. Meanwhile, his item slot had a long string of numbers as the mysterious silver sands stacked into one item slot.\nLeo hummed, \"How many pills or artifacts I can make with these sands? What are these sands, actually? But anyway, I'm rich! Hehehehe.\"\n\"You're greedy, I see.\"\n\"Well, yes. I'm a capitalist. I loot. I steal. I collect resources. Then, I turn them into something valuable to sell them. Then, I make a lot of money!\"\n\"What are you collecting the money for?\"\n\"Of course, increasing my lifespan!\"\n\"For what? Living longer?\"\n\"Well, that isn't wrong… but why am I talking to you? Who the hell are you exactly…?\"\nLeo pursed his lips as he couldn't sense the presence of the speaker behind him. He stood up and turned around calmly.\nBehind Leo was a unique gorgeous lady with rainbow long hair and four flame wings. Her humongous height of 5 meters and pale white jade skin forced Leo to look up in awe. But when he looked up, his face distorted.\nThe woman was stark naked. He could see everything.\nLeo frowned, \"Miss. I understand that you and I have a different culture, but I would like to sincerely ask you something rude. Is it your tradition that your race travel in space naked?\"\nThe mysterious giant woman laughed, \"Only small beings and overly critical races wear clothes. I'm a phoenix. I don't wear clothes. Actually, I transform into this form to hide my presence and Qi. Do you have a problem?\"\nLeo found it strange, but he nodded in understanding. In space, every alien was entitled to their culture and opinions. He couldn't enforce his standards on the others, especially strangers.\n\"No, miss. I have no issue with that. I'm just surprised.\"\n\"I'm glad you are quick to understand. You're smarter than you look.\"\n\"More like, everybody calls me I'm stupider than I appear to be.\"\n\"It's good to be humble, but you shouldn't call yourself stupid. You're berating your ancestors and families.\"\n\"…That's a unique take, but thank you for your advice.\"\nLeo smiled and took a few steps back. He then cupped his fist and stopped talking randomly.\n\"My name is Florida Man, an Earthling. Well, truth be told, I'm lost. I'm looking for the planet by the name \"Yan Empire\", \"Orlando\", or something similar. Do you know any?\"\nThe woman wryly smiled. She slightly shook her head.\n\"I take it back. You're stupid.\"\n\"…Thanks for the reminder, miss.\"\nAs Leo took the conversation seriously, the woman also introduced herself.\n\"I'm Priscilla, the Overlord of the Jewel Phoenix. Nice to meet you… son.\"\n\"…Son?\" Leo widened his eyes. He pointed his finger at his face then pointed at Priscilla.\n\"Yeah. I'm your mother.\"\n\"…Mother? Huh?\"\nLeo's complexion turned dark. He didn't know if he should take her words seriously.\nSeeing Leo's reaction, Priscilla giggled. She opened her mouth and spat out a clear white crystal as big as an adult man. It landed next to Leo.\nLeo glanced at the dripping wet giant crystal. He broke a sweat and covered his nose.\nIt was nauseously rotten. Combined with Leo's sensitive nose, the smell intensified by a hundred folds.\nLeo's facial color changed from black to white, from white to green, and from green to purple. He covered his nose and mouth.\nPriscilla laughed, \"Long story short, I heard you're getting married, so I've brought you a dowry gift. Also, this is the first time we have met. As a senior, I should give you something worthwhile. That crystal is my gift to you. Take care of it… son.\"\nLeo looked up while he covered his nose. As he couldn't physically speak, he sent a sound transmission instead.\n\"Thank you for the gift, miss. But could you explain why you are my mother? Did my stupid father have another secret family or something?\"\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!! I bet he wishes he did! Sorry to break this to you, but I've been single for a million years! Rather, I don't need a partner since I can lay eggs on my own!\"\nLeo's face was still purple, but his eyebrows were raised.\nSeeing Leo's funny expression, Priscilla scolded him, \"I know what you're thinking. My eggs don't need fertilization or seeds from male phoenixes. Also, I don't copulate with myself.\"\nLeo flinched as Priscilla read his thoughts. He feinted ignorance, \"What are you even talking about?\"\n\"Was the first thought you had was like 'Is she a FUTA?' or 'Did she inseminate herself with her secret dick?' or something?\"\nLeo resumed pokerface. His expression and face color hardened. \"So, are you a FUTA?\"\n\"Of course not! What the hell is FUTA anyway?!\"\n\"Too bad. You would have been popular in my world if you were.\"\n\"…\" Priscilla covered her face with her palm. She regretted everything. \"You're a cringe, son.\"\n\"Embrace the cringe, mother. Once you do, your life will be 100 times happier. Why so serious? Just throw away all logic and let your intrusive thoughts dominate you.\"\nPriscilla gave up on Leo. She turned and fluttered her wings, preparing to leave.\n\"Well, good luck out there, son.\"\n\"WAIT!\"\nLeo realized his mistake. He teleported and reappeared in front of Priscilla, floating in front of her face.\n\"What?\" Priscilla opened her mouth and yawned. She also released a mouthful of bad breath all over Leo's body.\nLeo calmly swallowed his vomit. He sent another voice transmission to her.\n\"Since you're proclaiming that you're my mother, can you take me home? I'm lost.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Please?\"\n\"…\"\nPriscilla rolled her eyes. Then, she pointed at the void behind her.\nFollowing Priscilla's direction, Leo looked at the direction. Then, he found the dreadnaught dragon ship 100 light years away.\nWHOOSH\nPriscilla vanished, leaving the giant crystal behind.",

Florida Man Found His Missing Father, Got Scolded for Not Inheriting His DNA\nChapter 302 – Touching Reunion? Florida Man Found His Missing Father, Got Scolded for Not Inheriting His DNA.\nAfter Priscilla had gone, Leo dryly laughed and scratched his head. From the very beginning, he could tell that Priscilla was a lot stronger than Sieg as he couldn't even scan or measure her cultivation base.\nHe was relieved and confused. Judging from the conversation, the giant woman harbored no ill intent against Leo. On the contrary, she seemed to be his ally.\n\"When did I meet that woman? I ain't a protagonist in a novel. I never saved a son or a daughter of a super expert. Also, I don't remember having more than one mother… Or did my freaking father cheat mother?! That bastard!\"\nHe stood there for an hour, cursing and yelling at his father.\n…\nMeanwhile, Aslan had been waiting for Leo in the dreadnaught mothership.\nEarlier, he navigated the ship away from the floating cloud continent to give space for Leo and Priscilla to meet and talk. After Priscilla was gone, Aslan stayed with the ship, thinking of various excuses.\n\"ACHOOO!\"\nEven though Aslan was a golem, he could sneeze. After blowing his nose, the fisherman golem broke a sweat.\n\"What is he doing over there alone? Does his schizo act up again?\"\nSometimes, Aslan was concerned about Leo's mental stability as the latter showed symptoms of a mental patient with ADHD, Schizophrenia, or autism. However, in many instances, Leo exhibited traits of OCD whenever he was alone.\nTaking care of a weird son could be handy. Aslan deeply sighed and prayed that Leo could be normal one day.\n…\nAfter swearing and cussing his father enough, Leo resumed collecting silver sand from the cloud continent. He also grabbed the wet sticky fate crystal ball to examine it.\nAs soon as Leo touched the crystal ball, it transformed into a streak of light and entered Leo's body. It traveled into his dantian universe and merged with his soul.\nAs soon as the true entity fate crystal merged with his soul, it reformed the order and reshaped his soul physique.\n\"Eh?\"\nLeo could also feel the changes in his body and soul. He remembered the feeling as he once sensed it in the past.\nIt felt the same when Leo first obtained the alien ring.\nDING\n<Congratulations. Your soul has absorbed a True Entity Fate Crystal.>\n<All system functions are now available.>\n<Your system functions can no longer be influenced by external forces and other fate crystals.>\n<You are now qualified to participate in the Karmic Ascension forces and other fate crystals.>\n<You are now qualified to participate in the Karmic Ascension Event!>\n<Due to the changes of ownership, the PVP systems and quest systems will be adjusted.>\n<Error! Fate Stadium Not Found!>\n<Removing PVP system…>\n<Rebalancing quest system…>\n\"Err…\"\nLeo stared at the series of system messages in shock. He stroked his chin and whistled.\n\"Wow. Jackpot! Thanks, Mom! I love you now! Also, thanks, dad! The second mom rocks! You should have introduced me to your second wife earlier!\"\nLeo cackled and rubbed his hands. He immediately navigated his system menus to find a button to return home.\nUnfortunately, the PVP system menu was removed. The 'Return Home' button no longer existed.\n\"FUUUUUUUUUUUU!!\"\nRealizing the changes, Leo collapsed to the ground, completing the OTL meme pose. He shed a tear of regret and desperation.\nHe wasn't worried about returning home. It was something else.\n\"How am I gonna complete my quests from now on? I need to fight one more PVP match to end the PHASE quests! What am I gonna do?!\"\nWhile Leo was screaming, the system finished updating Leo's systems.\nDING\n<Patching completed. New Phase Quests have been updated!>\n<Please read the patch note for more information.>\nLeo stopped making noise. He silently stood up and stared at the system screen with a hardened expression. While mimicking one of the Fist of the North Star characters' faces, Leo reopened his system menu to check the patch note.\nA few minutes later, Leo's expression brightened. He chortled like Agent Smith in Matrix.\n.\n.\nSix hours later, Rain Dragon Dreadnaught Mothership\nAslan was bored waiting for Leo. He warmed up his throat and prepared to send a sound transmission to his son.\nAs Aslan was about to speak, Leo directly teleported into the dreadnaught ship. He appeared in front of Aslan.\nUpon seeing Aslan again, Leo widely grinned and spoke in a second voice.\n\"Oh, hi.\"\nAslan had a bad feeling about this. He knew that nothing good would come whenever Leo started talking in a high-pitched voice.\n\"Welcome back, master.\"\n\"Yup. It's good to be back.\" Leo widely grinned. He then patted Aslan's shoulders several times. \"IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN! HAHAHAHAHA!!\"\n\"…\"\nAslan was not amused. He doubted why Leo was behaving this way.\nExploiting the perk of being Leo's subordinate, he sent a wisp of his consciousness to infiltrate Leo's mind to read his memory.\nBut as soon as he did, he ran into a problem.\n.\nIn the sea of Leo's consciousness, Aslan found the array that he had planted to protect Leo's soul from being attacked by external entities. Cracks and traces of usage riddled the dome barrier.\nAslan frowned. He remembered that the barrier only activated once. However, the current barrier array looked like it had been through wars.\n'What the hell happened here? Did he do something to the array? Or was Eleanor stronger than I estimated?'\nConfused, Aslan approached the array and touched it.\nCRACK\nThe barrier let out a rainbow lightning bolt and attacked Aslan!\n\"!!!\"\nAslan narrowly dodged the lightning bolt, but the fragment of his consciousness almost died. He looked at the thunderbolt and turned his gaze at the barrier array in disbelief.\nIt had been tampered with by someone!\n\"Not good. Leo's mind and soul have been infiltrated. But who could have… Shit. It's my fault, huh.'\nAslan smacked his forehead while he gazed into the transparent dome. As he looked further, he found a rainbow fireball in the middle of the array.\nThat fireball was the signature flame of rainbow phoenixes. It was also Leo's origin of power, which Aslan had secretly implanted in Leo's physical body 50,000 years ago.\n'No one tampered with this barrier. Priscilla didn't do it. That flame belongs to Leo. But how did he move it? I don't remember teaching him about the flame.'\nBaffled, Aslan flew around the dome to see if he could learn something from the phoenix flame in Leo's sea of consciousness. It didn't take long for Aslan to notice the source of these changes.\nAt the bottom of the fireball, there was a thread of karma string. It connected Leo's soul with the core of the phoenix fireball and the barrier array. Moreover, the soul of Leo in the sea of consciousness formed a clear crystal shape similar to entity fate crystals.\nSeeing the crystalized soul, Aslan understood everything. He shook his head and laughed.\n\"I didn't expect Priscilla to actually hand over a true entity fate crystal easily. I thought she would have taken everything back. I guess I called the right person for the job.\"\nAslan was no longer worried. The fragment of his soul left Leo's sea of consciousness.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo gazed at Aslan's face. He narrowed his eyes and uttered.\n\"Identity.\"\nAslan who just returned his soul fragment from Leo's mind heard the word. He was taken aback.\n\"What did you say?\"\nLeo ignored Aslan and looked at the semi-transparent screen in front of him.\n.\nName: Aslan Ariel\nAlias: Kitten\nRace: Soul Golem (Divine Elf)\nCultivation Base: Entity\nThoughts: Shocked, Concerned.\nSystem Note: He's your father. Treat him nicely.\n.\nLeo deeply sighed and nodded in approval. He found the new features useful.\n\"Alright, my dear subordinate. I would like to hear your confession right now, but I want to go home ASAP. Can you bring me home? I miss my wife and my shopping mall. I have a lot of work to do.\"\nAslan came back to his senses. He continued pretending to be Leo's loyal henchman, \"As you wish, master.\"\nLeo raised his hand and lightly karate-chopped Aslan's head.\n\"Another order, could you stop calling me 'Master'? I don't want to hear it from your mouth.\"\nAslan was surprised. He lightly patted his head as the smack was neither painful nor light – It was enough to make him dizzy.\n\"What should I be calling you, then?\"\nLeo gargled his saliva and spat on the ground like an elderly Asian man. He then sat at the captain's seat and inclined on his chair.\n\"Okay, let's be real, dad. How long are you going to continue playing dumb?\"\n\"…\"\nAslan's expression turned stiff. He cleared his throat and asked his son.\n\"What did you just call me?\"\n\"Didn't you hear me… DAD?\"\n\"…\"\nDespite being a stone golem, tears dripped from Aslan's eyes. He celebrated, \"You finally figure it out. I'm so proud of you. Finally, you graduate from being an autistic baby to a dumb boy.\"\n\"Oi!\"\n\"We should celebrate! Let's have a party when we return!\"\n\"OI!\"\nLeo widened his eyes and stared at his father. Aslan's reaction was not what Leo had expected.\n\"What do you mean 'Autistic Baby'?! Do you think I'm retarded?!\"\nAslan snorted and berated Leo, \"I told you many times that I'm your goddamn father, but you never believed me. How else should I evaluate you? A smartass jackshit? A dumb little shit? A moron who can't cook for shit?\"\n\"HEY! What the hell?! Is that something a father should say to his filial son?!\"\n\"Filial my ass. You caused so many problems that I had to wipe your ass every time! How do you think you survived that shit, huh? Who do you think I visited and groveled to save your life, huh?\"\n\"…\"\n\"Listen, you dumb duck. Now that you realize who I am, you'd better watch your language from now on! I want you to end your sentences with SIR every time you address me!\"\n\"…I should have pretended not to notice.\"\n\"Too late, moron. Now, keep calling me DADDY! No more spoiling for you!\"\n\"...\"\nLeo regretted exposing Aslan's secret. He wished he remained silent.",

No One Has Been Blinded.\nInstead of going home, Aslan and Leo sat on the bridge, discussing their past and what Aslan had been doing.\nLeo patiently listened to his father. After hours of narration, he finally summarized Aslan's excuses.\n\"So, Eleanor and Mao Miaomiao planned to kill you to steal my OLD physical body. You outsmarted them by transferring my soul to another experimental chimera homunculus you had created beforehand. Then, you crafted a special ring in my right hand and hid your soul in here to escape death?\"\nLeo pointed at the traces of his alien ring that had already merged with his skin.\nAslan grinned, \"Aren't I a genius? Without my trick, you and I would have died. That bastard Mao Miaomiao and Eleanor didn't intend to let any human live, but we managed to minimize the damage to Earth and save our asses!\"\n\"By putting me through 50,000 years of torture and random lightning strikes? Is that how you raise your son? Do you even know what I had been through to get here?\"\n\"It's called 'Cultivating', not torturing. Also, the lightning is heavenly tribulation lightning. You normally get hit by one when you try to cultivate Qi when the planet's laws don't allow cultivators to exist. Earth's environment is pretty mild for an evolved planet.\"\nWhen Aslan mentioned Heavenly Tribulation Lightning, Leo recalled that he and his subordinates rarely experienced tribulation lightning. He wondered why.\nAlthough Leo was curious about the lightning tribulations, he was too absorbed in the banter. He continued quarreling with his father.\n\"Mild my ass! I freaking mutated and vomited blood ten thousand times before I could even cultivate Qi!\"\n\"Bullshit. You devoured radiation like a starving baboon seeing a table of bananas! You pretty much ate Qi as breakfast!\"\n\"Screw you! Nobody taught me that radiation is freaking Qi!\"\n\"You never asked your goddamn ring!\"\n\"Your goddamn ring never replied to my questions!\"\n\"You forgot to enable the assistant option in the shopping menu option, you dumbass! Open your goddamn system and check it if you don't believe me!\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nLeo was stunned. He opened the online shopping system menu and looked around the screen. As he paid attention to every detail, he noticed a small cog icon at the top right corner of the monitor. He pressed on it.\nDING\nAn option menu appeared. It revealed options and abilities to adjust the screen size, sound, resolutions, subtitles, and popup tips. Upon checking the tips option, Leo found what Aslan had mentioned.\nThere was an option to enable \"Helper\".\n\"…Oh.\" Leo facepalmed. He couldn't believe that he spent 50,000 years on Earth without noticing this option.\nAslan smirked, \"Had you enabled that option, I would have been able to chat with you and provide you cultivation tips and guides. Instead of spending 50,000 freaking years eating shit, you could have ascended to the karmic sovereign realm within a thousand years or so! Well, your effort wasn't in vain, though. Because of your stubbornness in eating random junk and raw food, your soul grows so much that it reaches the pinnacle of the transcendent realm! Most credits still belong to me though. Your body is my finest creation!\"\nLeo deeply sighed as he found Aslan more annoying than before. His frustration was directed at his father.\n\"Why didn't you enable it by default then!? My entire life would have been much better!\"\n\"…Oh.\" Aslan flinched and broke a sweat. When he thought about it, he could have done so by tampering with the entity fate crystal a bit.\n\"See?! It's your freaking fault!\"\n\"Dammit! Don't shift the blame, you autistic brat!\"\nThe family banter continued…\n.\n.\nHours later, Leo and Aslan stopped talking about their past. The father decided to let Simba and Ester out of his dantian universe.\nFinally, Ohio Man and Florida Man met again face to face.\nLeo was surprised when the people that Leo had assumed dead suddenly appeared. He frowned and stared at his father.\n\"What now?\"\nAslan coughed and reintroduced everybody.\n\"Leo, let me introduce you to your missing brother. This is Simba Ariel, your younger brother. As for the girl, she's Ester Sydin, his wife. Oh, here. Simba. This is your elder brother, Leonardo Ariel…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nEster, Leo, and Simba awkwardly looked at each other and deeply frowned.\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Simba broke the ice, \"We meet again, bro.\"\nLeo tilted his head. He remembered that he had a brother, but he forgot his face.\n\"Are you sure you're my brother?\" Leo pointed at Simba and stared at Aslan.\nAslan coughed, \"He's adopted.\"\n\"How nice of you. For a moment there, I thought you banged a black woman and stole her child.\"\n\"That's rude! Who do you think I am?!\"\n\"A perverted elf who goes around to copulate with various races. You scored a white woman and a freaking giant phoenix. Why not a black woman?\"\n\"…You.\" Aslan was speechless. He gave up correcting Leo's attitude and misunderstanding as his son was too dumb to understand his explanation.\nLeo also gave up talking to his secretive father. He confronted Simba. \"So, did you attack me to rescue your wife or something?\"\nSimba deeply sighed, \"You seem stupid, but you're quick to pick up clues. Yes, I attacked you because I thought you imprisoned my wife.\"\n\"Fair enough. If you did the same to my wife, I would have blindly raided your planet too.\"\n\"So, are we cool?\"\n\"If you say so…\"\nLeo shrugged and raised his fist. Simba smirked and gave him a fist bump. However, the latter had questions to ask Leo.\n\"Say, bro.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Where's my son?\"\n\"Your son… oh, that stupid black kid on my bed? I gave him to a cow-tit nanny. Do you want him back?\"\n\"…Please.\"\nLeo deeply sighed as he had another headache to worry about, \"Fine. When we go back, I'll send him back to you.\"\n\"Thanks…\"\n\"Oh, yeah. You said that your surname is Sydin?\" Leo changed the subject and turned to Ester.\nEster nervously nodded, \"Yes, senior.\"\n\"I…kinda remember your name. Esen said you framed her when you were kids. Did you do it?\"\nEster was ashamed. She lowered her head.\nSeeing that Leo pushed his wife, Simba stood in front of her and warned his brother, \"That was 50,000 years ago, and they were kids at that time. How old do you think she was?\"\n\"I dunno. Tell me.\"\n\"Five!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Bro, don't dwell in a kid's fight. Blame their mother which escalated the situation.\"\nLeo pursed his lips and nodded in agreement. He turned around.\n\"Enough chatting. Let's go home. I have a lot of work to do.\"\nAslan agreed, \"Yeah, we've wasted enough time. Let's go home and have a family reunion celebration!\"\n\"Tsk.\"\n.\n.\nAn hour later…\nWHOOSH\nThe entire dreadnaught mothership teleported to the asteroid belt where it once parked. The dragon ship curled its body and turned off its lights.\nLeo, Simba, Aslan, and Ester were the only ones on the bridge. They gazed at the star system map hologram in the middle of the room.\nAslan smiled, \"We're home.\"\nLeo got up from his seat and teleported home without saying anything. As for Simba and Ester, they remained on the ship.\nSimba asked his father for permission, \"Can we stay on the ship?\"\n\"Why?\" Aslan was surprised.\n\"Although I want to live in Leo's world, I think his wife might still hold a grudge against Ester. I wish to avoid potential conflicts and dramas.\"\n\"…Are you sure? I can be the middle man and talk with her.\"\n\"It's fine. For peace of mind, let's live separately. I'll guard the ship for you.\"\nAslan gave Simba a meaningful look. Then, he deeply nodded.\n\"Well, I guess you're right. Oh, I almost forgot about this.\"\nAslan brought out a hand-sized crystal that he had seized from Simba. It was a smaller version of the true entity fate crystal.\n\"Instead of keeping it as a consumable weapon, why don't you absorb it? Your system is still down right?\"\nReminded of his system, Simba rechecked his system screen.\nIndeed, it was disabled.\n\"I didn't notice. Why is it disabled?\"\n\"Your brother destroyed Fate Stadium and killed the owner of that place.\"\n\"W-What?\"\n\"Anyway, things will get more complicated from now on. All previous system users will scour for entity fate crystals to reenable their system powers. Overlords will fight each other and galactic wars will be common. You have a completed true entity fate crystal in your hand, so you can get a head start.\"\nSimba retrieved the crystal back. He rotated it in his palm and hesitated.\n\"My system only allows me to pinpoint and find people. I doubt it will be useful.\"\n\"Just merge it with your soul and think of what you really need. Entity Fate Crystals always respond to the owner's deepest desire.\"\n\"…R-Really?\"\n\"Didn't you get what you wished? When you first got your entity fate crystal, you wished to find your lost family members. You got the search system as a result, right?\"\nSimba nodded, but he also had doubts, \"But I couldn't find you or Leo when I used it. Why?\"\nAslan shrugged, \"Blame Sieg. That guy suppressed everybody's systems to limit their growth. He owned multiple true entity fate crystals so his system was quite powerful.\"\n\"…I see.\" Simba understood everything, but this topic got him curious. \"What about Leo's wish? What is his system like?\"\nAslan rolled his eyes, \"That dumbass got too attached to the modern world's technologies. I still remember when he swiped my credit card to purchase weed.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, stop worrying about your stupid brother. Ask yourself what you really need at the moment.\"\n\"…Right.\"\nSimba gazed at the fate crystal in his hand. As his cultivation base was inferior to Leo's, he thought of a way to gain power.\nDING\nThe true fate crystal radiated in response to Simba's wishes. It merged with his soul and prompted him with a series of messages.\n<Detecting New Dao. Patching the system…>\n<Removing PVP System and Gacha System…>\n<Unpacking Completed. Your system has been updated.>\nA dozen system screens appeared and surrounded Simba. The latter bitterly smiled and pressed on one of the floating windows, naming his new ability.\nDING\n<Congratulations! Gold Dragon Overlord System has been integrated with your soul!>",

One of them stepped up and relayed a message from Esen.\n\"Your Majesty. Her Majesty has been looking for you. Please visit her at your carriage.\"\nLeo wasn't surprised. After the wedding, Esen got so clingy that she was comparable to the overly attached girlfriend meme in ancient legend, \"Okay. Keep up the good work. I'll go see her now.\"\n.\nEverything proceeded as Leo had imagined: Esen threw a tantrum that Leo didn't consult with her before he left. It took him a few hours to pacify the angry wife. Like new lovebirds, they attached to each other for the rest of the day.\nIn the deep night, Esen was physically and mentally satisfied with Leo's love. She fell asleep, allowing Leo to do his things.\nLeo reopened the system menu and reread his new abilities. After all, there was a lot to digest.\n.\nPatch Note – True Entity Fate Crystal 1.0\n1. System Adjustments and New Feature Introduction\n- Replace the PVP and Gacha system with the Fiefdom Design and Talent Scout system.\nInstead of drawing characters and buildings from the lottery, you can directly purchase unique buildings and characters from the list. The buildings originate from your imagination and desire while the characters are reincarnators or real people in the universe.\n- Online Shopping System Balance Adjustment\nAll items are upgradable by default, and the level cap has been fixed to 50. The item strength level increases by a major realm every 10 levels. For example, a level-11 gun has the power output of an earth celestial while a level-19 gun's destructive strength is as strong as a true immortal. Level-50 gun has the power of a transcendent being level 0.\n- Domain System Balance Adjustment\nDomain territory is no longer limited to the 1,000 x 1,000 grids or spaces from the free expansion tickets. Instead, your home planet will be your domain territory. You may construct, deconstruct, move, upgrade, or alter your system buildings and non-system buildings freely.\nSecondly, the building level cap is now fixed at 50. All upgrade price remains the same.\n- Home Planet Upgrade\nYour home planet is automatically upgraded according to your cultivation base. For example, if you are a transcendent being at level 10, the highest cultivation base ceiling of your home planet will be the level 10 transcendent stage. This also applies to the strongest subordinates that you can scout to join your domain.\n- Home Planet Protection\nThe removed newbie protection system shall be reinstated as the Home Planet Protection System. Your home planet will be immune to all attacks from karmic sovereigns and weaker cultivators. However, transcendent beings and 'Verified Players' can still damage your star and structures.\n- Territory Expansion\nInstead of using the PVP System to raid or conquer a planet, you may freely expand your territory by occupying any planet by subjugating the local lifeform by force, submission, or negotiation. When more than 70% territory of the occupying star or planet is under your control, the entire star or planet will automatically become one of your territory, and the local population can enjoy your domain's buffs and perks. You can also build another headquarters or establish your colony base there.\nAfter conquering a new planet or star, you may impose taxes on the local population or lifeform in exchange for your protection, system blessings, or other perks.\n2. Building Changes and Adjustment\n- General Changes\nThe max level of all buildings has been increased to 50. All structures constructed by the local people can also be upgraded and changed into system buildings.\nFor example, a regular house can evolve into a 'Level 1 House'. Then, it will be upgradable. You can also move or adjust the building's location by using the domain management option.\n- Shopping Mall > Shopping Complex Headquarters\nYour 'Shopping Mall' has been renamed to 'Shopping Complex Headquarters'. At level 50, there will be a total of 50,000 slots for you to install various shops, facilities, factories, training centers, or workshops in the complex. All system buildings can now be moved into the Shopping Complex Headquarters.\nIn case of emergency, the Shopping Complex Headquarters can transform into a spaceship colony and evacuate from the home planet. By moving the Shopping Complex headquarters to another planet in your territory, you can change your home planet to a new location.\n- Pylon Tower > Qi Generator\nYour 'Pylon Tower' has been renamed to 'Qi Generator'. After installing any 'True' fate crystal into the generator, it will provide Qi to the local planet and fuel the local system buildings.\nInstead of being limited to one per domain, you can now build multiple Qi Generators as long as you have enough True Fate Crystals.\n- Mystic Realm Platform\nYour 'Mysterious Realm Platform' has been renamed to 'Teleportation Center'. You can no longer explore random planets in the universe. Instead, this place will become an all-\npurpose teleportation device for your subordinates to travel between stars in your domain.\n- Farms, Quarries, Mines, and Strategic Resources\nInstead of providing local resources, you can now designate the resources you need. However, the available resources are determined by the planet's level, location, environment, and historical background.\nFor example, a level-50 planet with a temperate climate cannot have extreme yin or yang-related natural resources. A polar climate can have abundant yin-related natural resources but it cannot have any yang-related natural resources.\nIn addition, the material and resource encyclopedia is available.\n- Military Structures\nNew military structures and buildings have been added to purchasable system buildings, such as Spaceship Construction Centers, Anti-Meteor Cannons, and Planetary Shield Projectors.\nPlease be mindful of your mineral resources as military warships and related items can be expensive. Wars are money-\nsinking after all.\n3. Additional System Perks\n- Identify Feature\nThis feature allows you to identify any person, item, or material by saying the keyword 'Identify'. The system will accurately evaluate them for you.\n- Inventory System Sharing\nYou can now share items in your inventory with your spouses or trusted subordinates who own an inventory system. The number of available inventory slots is infinite.\n…\nThere were more details, but Leo already got dizzy. After all, the system changed the scope of management from a simple 1,000 x 1,000 grid domain into a galactic enterprise. At this rate, he might as well expand his territory to conquer the universe!\n\"Can I just mind my own business and live in peace? What do you say, system?\"\nLeo had already enabled the system's advice. He asked the system, hoping to get a valid suggestion or criticism.\n<There is more than one \"Verified Player\" in the universe. You should do everything in your power to increase your territory and military power for self-protection.>\n\"I know. But how many VERIFIED PLAYERS are we talking about here? Can you tell me?\"\n<Aside from you, there are two others: Overlord Priscilla of the Rainbow Phoenix Race and Overlord Seven Dipper of the Planet Eater Race. This doesn't include other players who aspire to become 'Verified Players'.>\n<In addition, Verified Players are not the strongest transcendent beings in this universe. Beyond the void, there are higher dimensions that my power cannot reach.>\n<In short, please do not be content with your current power. Otherwise, the entities from a higher place will eventually come down and take advantage of you and your people one day.>\nThat was not a piece of good news. Leo shook his head and almost screamed in frustration.\n\"Dammit! Are you saying there's stronger people than me and my family?! What the hell is this universe? A cliché wuxia novel? A multiverse bullshit story? Is the creator of his universe so lazy that he can't come up with something else? Like, oh my god, I'm running out of ideas on how to extend my freaking story. Oh, wait. Let's add a higher dimension so I can milk this story for one thousand more chapters!\"\nLeo was being sarcastic because of frustration. However, the system slammed him with another bucket of cold water.\n<Please remember that \"Fate Crystals\" can make anybody's wish come true. Therefore, a simulation scenario in novel stories can occur because of such influences from the other crystals.>\n<From my calculation, the higher dimension's existences are related to the Karmic Fate Crystals, which are stronger than True Entity Fate Crystals. Of course, there are still \"True Karmic Fate Crystals\" we have to look out for.>\nLeo closed his eyes and got back in the bed. He was mentally exhausted.\nFor the day, he wanted to forget everything. He simply wished for quality time with his family and his loving wife.\n\"Say, system.\"\n<Yes?>\n\"If I wish for a tranquil and peaceful life with my wife, what can you grant me?\"\n<The system will give you powers related to domain prosperity to fulfill the lifestyle of your dreams, but the system will also give you military power and helpers to ensure the domain's security and your privacy – Just like the current system features and powers.>\n<Unless you wish to be the number-one strongest cultivator in the universe, the system will not grant you a self-\nimprovement-related system.>\n<Would you like to change the policy to Self-Improvement instead of Tranquil-and-Peaceful Lifestyle?>\nLeo didn't even need to think. He glanced at Esen and answered, \"No. I want my family to prosper. I'm not alone anymore.\n<Affirmative.>\n<The system shall add another feature to secure and increase your family's overall strength.>\n<The update will take time. Please be patient.>\n\"…Thanks.>\n<You're welcome!>\nLeo felt good talking to his system. At least, it was more direct than his suspicious and idiotic father.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Simba had also been chatting with his system after the integration. He read the patch note of his version and asked for advice.\n\"What do I do with the dreadnaught ship?\"\nDING\n<You can recruit crews using the Recruitment Feature. Upon using this feature, you will summon souls from this universe's karma river and reincarnate them into your subordinates.>\n<After that, you can…>",

      "content": "Chapter 305 Florida Man Erects New Capsule Hotel INSIDE a Convenient Store\n﻿﻿Chapter 305 – Florida Man Erects New Capsule Hotel INSIDE a Convenient Store.\nAt night, Leo slipped out of bed and visited the shopping mall in secret. As the mall was closed at night, nobody saw him entering.\nIn the shopping mall, worker mannequins tidied and cleaned the stores. As for Hua Taixu and his time chamber, it was still operating overnight as the sword saint's clone was still entertaining the guests.\nEvery mannequin worked hard even though it was past midnight. Even several workers from the recycling centers and warehouses came to help with mopping and floors.\nThinking of the workers, Leo levitated and avoided stepping on the floors with his shoes. Then, he toured the mall as it had been a long time since he last visited it.\nThe first floor was tidy and clean as usual as Qiang Qiang was there to intimidate guests. The fourth and fifth floors didn't need help due to the local alchemist mannequins, store managers, and Hua Taixu's influence.\nOn the other hand, the second and the third floors were a mess. As no system shop was open here, there were no golems to watch over these floors. As a result, countless rogue cultivators, local employees, and visiting merchants used this place as temporary resting spots.\nRandom litter, wet floors, broken containers, and dirty footsteps were all over the place. This didn't include the filth in washrooms and toilet stalls.\nLeo looked at the mess left behind by the local population. He grumbled, \"Didn't I tell the managers to let those local people set up their stores here for a fee? Why didn't they take care of this place? System, what did I do wrong?\"\nDING\n<The Shopping Mall… or now 'Shopping Complex' emits strong yin-yang Qi which is beneficial to the local population. It emits the most in the free store slots. However, because of the high-\nquality Qi, cultivators can often get intoxicated by the newfound power and get distracted from reality. Thus, inconsiderate cultivators usually ignore common sense and leave behind litter.>\n\"I guess I should ban them from cultivating here, then?\"\n<It is not recommended to drive your customers away because your job is uncomfortable or troublesome. Instead of that mindset, you should solve the issues with your management skills or using system perks, such as adding new facilities to your Shopping Complex.>\nLeo agreed. Since the local people didn't treasure his building, there was no point in allowing them to use them freely. He might as well add more employees and stores to milk their lifespan to the last drop.\nHe opened the new Fiefdom Management System for the first time.\n.\nDomain and Fiefdom Design System\nIn this mode, you can freely move, rotate, redesign, or remove any system building within your territory. This system encourages you to improve your faction's military strength and endlessly expand your territory until you conquer the entire universe.\nYour Shopping Complex Headquarters is the heart of the territory, and it must be protected at all costs. If your headquarters is destroyed, the Domain System will be erased along with some of the True Entity Fate Crystal.\nThis system functions similarly to your previous Shop Domain System, except for the addition of purchasable facilities and system buildings. The more planets or stars you conquer, the more facilities and buildings you can purchase.\nMoreover, improving technologies and recruiting powerful subordinates play a powerful role in this system. Try experimenting with it to see the changes!\nFiefdom Status\nFiefdom Level: 1\nNumber of Stars/Planets Own: 5\nNumber of Hero Units: 0\nArmy Type: One-Man Army\nHeadquarters Status\nShopping Complex Level: 20\nNumber of Qi Generators: 0\nPower Consumption / Power Generated: 13/10\nStored Lifespan: 953,606 Years\n.\nAside from the explanation, Leo was curious about the headquarters status and the fiefdom's army-type details. He wryly smiled while he asked the system.\n\"One-man army? Really?\"\n<Aside from you, you have no other powerful subordinate that you can rely on. When a war occurs, you will likely be the only one who can make a difference. As for the rest, they will become your deadweights. Therefore, the evaluation is correct.>\n\"…You're harsh.\"\nAlthough Leo disliked the fact, he appreciated the system's frankness. At least, it never mocked or made fun of Leo for being silly.\n\"About the power consumption in the headquarters status, what is that?\"\n<Your system facilities require Qi from your headquarters building to operate or function. Currently, your factories, workshops, restaurants, and service facilities consume 1 unit. The airport consumes 2 units, and your Tesseract Time Chamber consumes 5 units. And lastly, your workers consume 5 units.>\n<In short, the headquarters require 13 units of energy to function. However, the headquarters, by default, can only generate 10 units of energy. Therefore, some of the buildings cannot function normally.>\n<Please move or construct a Qi Generator to enable every facility and worker.>\nLeo clapped his hands as he understood the explanation. He was familiar with this system as he remembered ancient real-\ntime strategy games of the pre-apocalypse era. Base-building games often ask players to build power plants or power generators to enable the other buildings or structures. The Qi Generator and the headquarters worked the same way.\nAs this matter was urgent, Leo opened the map of his domain. Then, the world map showed up in the new system screen window.\nLeo ignored the world map and pressed on the Pylon Tower, now renamed as Qi Generator. He moved it into the shopping complex, placing it on the third floor.\nFive of the slots were occupied instantly. The rooms merged and created an alternate world inside.\nLeo didn't stop there. He remembered that the maximum level of his headquarters increased to 50. He spent his abundant life force to upgrade it to the maximum level.\nIt was pricier than before. Increasing the headquarters level from 20 to 21 cost him 210,000 YOL. From 21 to 22 cost 210,000. Then, so on.\nIn the end, Leo spent a little over a million YOL to increase his headquarters level to 50.\nLeo didn't mind the cost as a million years of lifespan was nothing to him.\nRUMBLE\nThe Shopping Complex underwent an evolution. New floors were created on top of the old floors, and the entire building was transformed.\nRising on top of the previous building was a 10-story cylinder-\nshaped building. New elevators linked the shopping complex's old floors to the condominium-like structure. Combining two buildings together, it became a 15-story building.\nThat was not all. The greenhouses on the shopping complex rooftop were swallowed by the headquarters and appeared on the second floor, taking up available slots.\nLeo observed the internal changes. Aside from the relocation of the greenhouses, there was nothing worthy of his attention. He visited the rooftop to see the changes next.\nOn the cleared rooftop of the shopping complex, a large signboard was erected there.\nIt showed one message.\n[Only entertainment facilities can be built here.]\nLeo was bemused, \"Only entertainment facility? What can I build here?\"\n<Water Parks, Public Gardens, and Theme Parks, and so on.>\n\"Ah, I get it.\"\nHe left the empty rooftop for the moment. He went to see the newly erected condominium building next. Then, surprises awaited him.\nIn the condominium building, the rooms were replaced with empty lots. A wooden signboard [Residential Building or Hotel Building Only] occupied every space.\n\"Huh? This too?\"\n<This area has been allocated as the residential district. You can move residential-related buildings to occupy the empty slots. This area consists of 25,000 slots, so you should plan carefully which system buildings you wish to put in here.>\n\"The heck?\" Leo had a wild inspiration, \"What if I put the hotel building in one of the slots, will the entire place fit in?!\"\n<Some buildings may require multiple slots. For example, a level 50 single house only requires one slot. A mansion requires two slots. A five-story apartment requires three slots. A ten-story condominium takes four slots. Anything higher than 10 floors takes five slots.>\n\"…Condominium-ception?\"\n<You guess it right. Yes, you can put a WHOLE CONDOMINIUM inside another condominium's room.>\n\"…Wait a second. The hotel has a similar perk like this. Their rooms and stores contain more pocket dimensions inside. If I put them there, will those pocket dimensions remain the same?\"\n<Yes.>\n\"…Wow. Dimension-ception! Are you Backrooms System?\"\n<I am a sophisticated system whose existence is programmed to serve you, not a random horror myth.>\nLeo was convinced that his system was utterly broken. With this, a congested population might not be an issue.\nAs the condominium was geared toward residents, Leo had a clear idea of which system buildings he should incorporate into the free rooms. He opened the purchasable building list from the Online Shopping System menu.\nUpon sorting the list, the most expensive buildings appeared first.\n.\nSpace Colony (5 trillion square kilometers)\nPrice – One Billion YOL\n.\nLeo dryly laughed. He wanted one because it seemed funny.\n\"Say, system.\"\n<Yes?>\n\"Will it take only 5 slots if I stuff THE WHOLE COLONY INSIDE?!\"\n<Yes. Broken, right?>\nLeo burst into laughter. He reached out to press the button. However, the system gave him a warning message.\n<Please note. The upgrading cost is equal to the purchasing price. Are you sure that you wish to spend 49 BILLION years of lifespan to upgrade it to the max level?!>\n\"…\"\nLeo sweated profusely. He pulled his finger back.\n\"On second thought, maybe not.\"\nFor the sake of his long-term investment, he postponed the residential plan. Leo returned to the shopping mall and invested in something else, which was more worthwhile.\nAfter fiddling with the system, Leo upgraded the Vehicle Factory to level 50, which changed its name into \"Land Vehicle Construction Yard\". He also picked a few of the facilities and placed them on the shopping complex's fifth floor.\n.\nSpaceship Construction Yard\nPrice – 10 Million YOL\n.\nTech Center\nPrice – 1 Million YOL",

      "content": "Chapter 306 Florida Man Prevents Customers from Entering Shopping Mall by Exposing the Smell of His Balls\n?Chapter 306 – Florida Man Prevents Customers from Entering Shopping Mall by Exposing the Smell of His Balls\nEarly morning, merchants and rogue cultivators woke up early and visited Leo's domain as usual. They aimed to gather in the mall's second or third floor to cultivate free yang Qi or electric element Qi.\nHowever, the shopping mall was totally different from before.\nFirst, the physical appearance of the shopping mall seemed larger and taller. Glass windows, signboards, and cement exterior were replaced with seamless white metal as if they were the hull of a large warship.\nOn top of the building, a tall condominium replaced the sky elevator. The previously iconic sky continent, aka the Mystic Realm Platform, vanished from the sky along with the glass elevator.\nAnd lastly, the front entrance automatic glass doors were changed into a metal gate of a nuclear bunker.\nThe crowd gazed at the gate in confusion, wondering why Leo changed his shopping mall's exterior design overnight.\nRUMBLE\nAt 8 AM, the bunker gates automatically opened, pushing outward and revealing a massive hallway.\nThe cultivators rushed in, racing to get their cultivation spots. However, when they got inside, they were surprised yet again.\nThe walls, floor, and ceiling were all made of metal. Only brightly lit LED lights under the ceiling illuminated the dark hallway. In addition, the crowd came across a sealed gate of an airlock room ahead.\nThere was a large signboard.\n.\nAirlock Room\n1. This room can only accommodate 50 adults at a time.\n2. After entering this room, stay clear of the gate as it will automatically shut.\n3. The airlock room will adjust the air pressure. Do not panic or cause a commotion when the air pressure changes.\n4. When the air pressure adjustment has been completed, another door will open. Then, you can enter the Shopping Complex.\n5. Allow everybody from the airlock room to leave first so that the traffic flow will not be interrupted.\n6. DO NOT LINGER IN THE AIRLOCK ROOM! LEAVE WHEN THE DOOR IS OPEN!\n.\n\"What's this for?\" One of them read the instructions and was confused.\nThe others were also clueless. They stared at the giant gate in front of them as if they tried to comprehend a secret text behind the word [Airlock].\nAs people crowded in front of the airlock gate, visitors outside the shopping complex could not get in. They started making a commotion.\n\"HEY! STOP BLOCKING THE WAY! WE WANT TO GET IN!\"\nBeing pressured by the people outside, the cultivators inside started scouring for a method to get in. Several of them rushed to the sealed door and tried to pry it open.\nFortunately, one of the visitors was a smart and cultured man. Wu Buyi was among the crowd.\n\"Tsk. I thought I would get some quick fried chicken and pizzas. If I knew I would get stuck here, I would have cooked the leftovers at home. Anyway…\"\nWu Buyi found a square button inside a transparent plastic cover. He flipped the cover open and pressed the button.\nWHOOSH\nThe sealed door smoothly opened, revealing a chamber of airlock room. Chilling air flowed outside the building.\n\"What?!\"\nAlthough the crowd got used to the shopping mall's air conditioners, the wind contained thick yin and yang essence. They got caught off guard and accidentally inhaled several mouthfuls of Qi into their systems. As most of them were weak mortals under the nascent soul realm, their bodies couldn't withstand the pressure.\nHundreds of visitors collapsed on their knees and panted. Some of them rushed out of the building to get some fresh air outside.\nAs the air reached outside, more people fell victim to the overwhelming yin and yang Qi from the complex's air conditioners. Their faces reddened as their blood vessels bloated.\n\"NOOOO!!\"\nEverybody was in despair, afraid of Qi deviation or self-explosion. In desperation, they released their Qi to expel the excess energy in their bodies. Hot and cold Qi exited their bodies and were released outside, creating ripples in the air.\nAfter releasing excess Qi from their bodies, their complexion got a bit better, but they weren't safe yet. Everybody sat cross-legged and meditated, digesting and circulating their Qi.\nMeanwhile, nascent soul cultivators and Wu Buyi were unaffected by the simple wind. The latter snorted.\n\"Meh, it's just a few drops of yin and yang essence. What's the big deal?\"\nThe remark made the injured cultivators flinch. They cursed in their minds.\n'A drop of essence is worth 100 years of cultivation, damn you!'\n'This is the yin and yang essence we're talking about! Do you think it's easy to cultivate all five basic elements and unknown elements at the same time and maintain their harmony?! Do you think we can cultivate many elements like you?!'\n'Damn it, Wu Buyi! We're not as blessed as you! Look at you, living in a house made by Lord Florida Man! If we got to live in the same house as you, my cultivation base would have surpassed yours!'\nTheir red eyes glared at Wu Buyi.\nAs for the rude alchemist, he slipped his hand into his pants and scratched his balls. He sniffed it. Then, his expression turned ugly.\n\"Damn it! It stinks.\"\nWu Buyi looked around and found a cultivator who was busy meditating. He wiped his hand on the guy's sleeve and entered the building. As for the unlucky guy, he almost vomited blood as he had seen everything.\nOnly 30 people got inside the airlock room. Most of them were frequent visitors, whose cultivation bases surpassed the nascent soul level. One of them even had the opportunity to train in the time chamber with Hua Taixu, and his cultivation reached the pinnacle quasi-immortal stage.\nAfter everybody passed through the gate, Wu Buyi walked toward a console panel near the wall and pressed on it.\nAs if Wu Buyi had done this before, he pressed on the console, which opened a hologram screen in front of him. It prompted Wu Buyi with a message.\n[Sealing Room. Please stay clear of the door.]\nWu Buyi translated the text out loud, \"Stay away from the door, people. It should automatically close soon.\"\nWHOOSH\nAs soon as Wu Buyi said it, the door behind everybody was closed. Then, the wind blew through the ventilation holes in the ceiling, filling the room with more yin and yang essence.\nThis time, 20 nascent soul cultivators stopped moving. They shut their eyes and stood still, meditating and digesting the dense Qi.\nThey were suffocating. The essence in the air was too thick that they couldn't breathe properly.\nSeven soul formation cultivators also struggled. They sweated profusely, but they managed to hold on. However, judging from their complexion, they were about to give in like the nascent soul cultivators as well.\nThe two soul transformation cultivators looked pale as well. Although they could move around, their mouths and throats were dry. Their instinct cried that they had to leave this place ASAP or they might fall into a similar state.\nMeanwhile, the sole quasi-immortal realm cultivator and Wu Buyi were unaffected. They gazed at the struggling people.\nWu Buyi advised them, \"Y'all should wait in this room and wait for that gate to reopen. Once it does, leave.\"\nThe quasi-immortal cultivator gazed at Wu Buyi. He cupped his fist and politely asked him.\n\"Immortal Wu, do you know something about the changes? Why does this place suddenly emit stronger Qi than before?\"\nWu Buyi shrugged, \"I don't know the details. But judging from the transformation, Lord Florida Man must have upgraded his bases again. Don't be surprised if the shopping mall transforms into a world of deities.\"\n\"…I see. Thank you for the warning. I think I'll wait here and test my limits first.\"\n\"Suit yourself.\"\nWu Buyi glanced at the struggling cultivators and reread the instruction screens on the hologram. He pressed the [Open Exterior Door] to let the people out.\nThe same exit gate was opened again. Then, Wu Buyi ordered the people in the room.\n\"Leave while you still can. Also, tell everybody that nobody in the immortal realm should enter this place. The Qi inside is too hazardous for mortals.\"\nHis voice was crisp. Everybody outside the mall could also hear him.\nThe previous cultivators in the airlock room slowly dragged their feet outside while the people in the hallway suffered from another wave of thick yin and yang essence. They helped each other and dragged everybody outside.\nOne more quasi-immortal cultivator entered the airlock chamber. They turned around and looked at the leaving people in curiosity.\nHe was Tang San, a 19-year-old junior of the Tang Clan's branch which had just merged with the main Tang Clan's manor when Leo was away.\nTang San was 190cm tall, toned, and good-looking. His clothes were also unique as his robes looked like a coat on top of tight clothes. Unfortunately, his charm was inferior to Gao Yan because of his generic messy hairstyle and na?ve face.\n\"What happened here? Lord Wu, did you do that?\"\nWu Buyi glanced at the young man and raised his eyebrows in astonishment. However, his expression reverted to normal instantly.\n'Meh, just another lucky youth. Quasi-immortals are cabbages these days. In my days, they were powerhouses. I bet they are inexperienced in real combat. Typical nerd cultivators.'\nWu Buyi disregarded the man's talent and age. He nonchalantly answered.\n\"Lord Florida Man has upgraded his domain. It no longer supports mortals. Only immortals and probably quasi-\nimmortals like you can enter.\"\n\"I see!\" Tang San was excited. \"Actually, this is my first time visiting this place! I just moved in last month, and I was busy adjusting to the main house. Senior, can you recommend to me what I should be looking out for?\"\n\"…WHAT DID YOU SAY?! FIRST TIME?!\"\nWu Buyi and the quasi-immortal next to him stared at Tang San in shock.\nThere was a huge difference between frequent customers and new visitors. Newcomers tended to possess a lower cultivation base and weaker foundations. However, when the newcomers had a superior cultivation base than the locals, it told another story.\nThis guy didn't reach this stage by luck like the local cultivators!\nThis was a genuine heaven's chosen genius!\nWu Buyi couldn't contain his curiosity and excitement. He asked Tang San, \"Who is your master?! How long have you been cultivating?! How old are you exactly!?\"\n\"S-Senior, slow down!\" Tang San dryly laughed. He coughed and decided not to tell Wu Buyi everything. \"I don't have a master, actually. I self-taught myself.\"\nThe quasi-immortal next to Wu Buyi bellowed, \"Bullshit! Even I relied on the Sword Saint's guidance that Time Chamber for a year before I broke the soul transformation stage's bottleneck! There's no way a brat like you can reach this far by yourself!\"\nWu Buyi squinted his eyes and glanced at the elder. He raised his hand and stopped the guy.\n\"Let's not get overworked and pressure the kid, old man. Well, let me ask you one question at a time.\"\nWhile interrogating the new guy, Wu Buyi shut the entrance door of the airlock room, trapping them inside the chamber. He delayed opening the interior door.\n\"What's your name?\" Inquired Wu Buyi.\n\"Ah, I'm Tang San, senior.\"\n\"From the Tang Clan?\"\n\"Yes, I'm from the subsidiary branch from the north. We migrate here because of the blizzard.\"\n\"…Strange.\"\nWu Buyi doubted the information as he knew what happened to the north. Leo and Esen often toured the northern region, but they never found any city or village there. Only ruins remained.\n\"Which city did you belong to?\"\n\"My family lived in Xia Port, the north-most coast of the Yan Continent, senior.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Hahaha. It's not weird that you don't know. We're fishermen from the blizzard area. Nobody visits us anymore because of the extreme weather.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, about my age, I'm 19 this year. As for how long I have been cultivating… that's about the same as my age, I guess?\"\nTang San pursed his lips and fidgeted as if he was trying to hide his lies.\nThe quasi-immortal next to Wu Buyi still didn't believe in Tang San. He wanted to squeeze for more information, but he was afraid of the alchemist.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi inwardly laughed. He had a theory in his mind.\n'If I remember correctly, there's a trope in online novels I read. What was it? A master in a ring? A reincarnator? A regressor? A transmigrator from a higher realm possessing the frail body of a trashy young master? There's a lot of tropes that this guy fits in. Is he one of them?'\nWu Buyi swept his gaze over Tang San's clothes. Then, he saw a plain rusty ring necklace on Tang San's neck.\n'Yup! A master in ring. I bet there's an entity inside giving this boy guidance. Man, they really exist.'\nHe shook his head and gave up asking Tang San. He turned around and opened the interior door for the two.\nDense yin and yang Qi gushed into the airlock chamber. The quasi-immortal elder immediately sat down and meditated as he couldn't withstand the Qi pressure anymore. As for Tang San and Wu Buyi, they were unfazed.\nWu Buyi smirked.\n\"Well, Mr. Main Character. Would you like me to give you a tour?\"\n\"Main character?\" Tang San tilted his head.",

      "content": "Chapter 307 Florida Man Purposely Orders a Barrel of Chicken Instead of a Bucket to Spread the Dao of Florida\n﻿﻿Chapter 307 – Florida Man Purposely Orders a Barrel of Chicken Instead of a Bucket to Spread the Dao of Florida\nTang San and his mentor met six months ago.\nThe master's name was Kishin Douji. He was the famous overlord of the Oni race, and he was Mao Miaomiao's sworn brother.\nSeveral months ago after Mao Miaomiao died, Kishin Douji mobilized his force to protect the devil race that Mao Miaomiao had created. Predicting that Eleanor might use this opportunity to overtake their home planets, they prepared for a preemptive strike from the DEZNUTS council.\nFate took a turn when the invader was not from Eleanor's forces but the Fate Stadium. Sieg personally visited them and tried to steal Kishin Douji's fate crystals.\nA karmic sovereign like Kishin was not the transcendent being's match. His physical body was destroyed, and his soul was damaged. Fortunately, he managed to escape from the eyeball.\nAfter the escape, his soul wandered the universe, and he stumbled upon Mao Miaomiao's karma. He followed the trace and found the planet of the Yan Empire.\nAs Kishin cultivated Yin, his soul entered the world and chose the northern region of the continent. As his soul required a container to recuperate, he picked a rusty spatial ring in the middle of a frozen river as a host. Then, he hid there.\nIt didn't take long for someone to pick it up.\nA month later, Tang San fought with young cultivators from another clan. It was a desperate battle between a fledgling muscles tempering realm cultivator against five Qi condensation realm cultivators.\nKishin overheard their mockery. It appeared that Tang San's fiance had just broken the engagement with him to marry a prominent young master from the other continent. Then, the subordinates of the young master tried to dispose of him out of spite.\nTang San lost the fight and was thrown into the river, where he found the ring.\nAfter witnessing everything, Kishin thought of possessing Tang San's body. However, he pitied him and used his last bits of Qi to save his life. Then, the two got to talk.\nKishin quickly learned of Tang San's complications. It turned out that Tang San had a unique constitution and dantian compatible with every type of Qi and essence. Because of the combination of Qi, his dantian was larger than everybody else by a thousand times. Therefore, Tang San's cultivation speed and development were slower than the others of his age.\nIn short, a 19-year-old who could not advance to the second stage was considered talentless in other people's eyes.\nKishin adopted Tang San as a disciple. He taught the young man the cultivation method of the Oni Clan. Then, the disciple didn't disappoint him. Within two months, his cultivation base shot up from the first stage to the 9th-stage.\nThe blizzard, the changing atmosphere, and the overwhelming Qi in the environment played a big part in the ascension.\nBut then, the weather of this world changed for the worse. The northern continent that Tang San's fiance had migrated into became a death zone as everybody was frozen to death. Even Tang San and his clansmen couldn't bear living there anymore. They migrated south. Then, they found Leo's domain.\n.\nInside the shopping complex, bright yellowish light illuminated everything. After getting in, Wu Buyi and Tang San found Qiang Qiang's fountain statue in the lobby area. Nearby, a reception counter and a map were there, providing the new guests information.\nTang San was attracted to Qiang Qiang's statue. He walked toward her and drooled.\n\"Wow. This statue is so realistic and fine! I bet the artisan behind this is a master! Senior, do you know who made this statue?\"\nWu Buyi held back his laughter, \"You don't wanna know.\"\n\"Why?! Please tell me-\"\nSuddenly, Tang San flinched. A voice entered his mind and interrupted his words. Kishin warned him.\n'That is not a man-made statue, disciple. That's a sentient golem, and she's a deity at that. Mind your manner. This place is not simple!'\nTang San shut his mouth. He gazed at Qiang Qiang's face again and noticed that she slowly looked back at him. Nervous and afraid, Tang San awkwardly saluted.\n\"H-Hi, senior. P-Please forgive my remarks earlier.\"\nQiang Qiang snorted and resumed her original posture, pretending to be a normal statue.\nAfter getting ignored, Tang San wiped his face with his handkerchief. He let out a sigh of relief.\nSeeing their interaction, Wu Buyi was surprised, \"You caught on quickly. I thought for sure that you gonna get smacked for flirting with her.\"\nTang San almost cried, \"Senior! You're cruel! How come you didn't warn me?!\"\n\"I already did. I told you \"YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW\", didn't I? That's more than enough hint not to mess with her.\"\n\"But that's too vague!!\"\nWu Buyi cackled. It had been a while since he last teased a junior like this.\nSince he had a good impression of Tang San, he wondered if he could become an extra in this main character's story. He rubbed his hands.\n\"Well, then, Mr. Main Character. Do you think you need my guidance or are you going to wander around on your own here?\"\nTang San's expression was rigid as he was skeptical about this. However, his mentor spirit urged him.\n'Accept his proposal. Judging from the local's interaction earlier, this guy seems to be a respectable well-known figure. His cultivation base might be inferior to mine, but he seems trustworthy. It's better than running around in this mysterious place and accidentally offending a hidden expert here.'\nHis mentor's warning made sense. Although unwilling, Tang San cupped his fist and bowed to Wu Buyi.\n\"Please guide me, senior. I… don't want to provoke the locals.\"\nWu Buyi laughed, \"Good choice! Well, come with me. I'll introduce you to the BEST fried chicken store!\"\n\"…\"\nWu Buyi hummed and walked toward the nearest \"FFP\", aka Florida Fried Chicken store. It was his favorite fast food chain served the best cockatrice chicken meat and the best dipping sauce.\n.\nAt the shop, Wu Buyi quickly spent 299 essence stones by ordering the largest bucket of chickens. The store didn't take advantage of Wu Buyi. A few minutes later, the mannequins carried a barrel of freshly fried cockatrice chickens for him.\nCockatrices were large monsters. Even though their anatomy was almost the same as regular chickens, their massive size offered a lot of edible meat. The store cut them into several hand-sized pieces and sold them.\nThe wooden barrel, made of sacred wood, contained exactly a thousand pieces of chicken. Wu Buyi put the barrel next to his table and walked toward the sauce desk, where he could take the store's sauce to his table.\nTang San didn't order anything as he had no money. He simply stared at the barrel, smelling the pleasant scent of fried chickens and drooling.\nHis mentor whispered again.\n'Those are the meat of 7th-stage cockatrices. Normally, you can't eat it because of the toxin. If you eat it raw, your body will, without fail, turn into a stone.'\n\"B-But they serve the monster meat…\"\n'Yes. It must have been cooked by the finest chef. I don't sense any poisonous substance or toxic Qi from the meat anymore. As a matter of fact, I think they contain a lot of purified yin and yang Qi. The yang Qi from the oil suppresses the rampaging yin Qi in the meat so well that yin and yang harmonize. Eating one of these should benefit you, Tang San.'\n\"R-Really?\"\n'I never lie. I estimate that you might gain at least 100 years' worth of Qi by just eating one.'\n\"What about the impurity? I thought hard food was not compatible with cultivators. When I first met you, you stopped me from hunting and eating regular food. Why now?\"\n'Those regular meals you had back then are food for commoners. If you eat too much of those, your body accumulates toxins that will deteriorate your physique in the long run. A cultivator defies logic. Therefore, we cultivate heavenly energy to become immortal. But this… they are different.'\nThe mysterious master of Tang San couldn't finish explaining to his disciple. Wu Buyi returned with a bowl of black and orange dipping sauces.\nWu Buyi sat down and cleaned his hand with his Qi. Then, he looked at Tang San's face.\n\"Aren't you buying anything?\" Asked Wu Buyi.\n\"Erm, no. The store… is quite pricey. I don't have enough essence stones, let alone a thousand spirit stones.\"\nWu Buyi snickered, \"Just pay them with your lifespan! What the hell? You're already a quasi-immortal. Don't be a cheapskate because you gain some life force. Spend some and improve your cultivation! You'll be wasting a thousand years cultivating anyway. Why don't you spend a few hundred now and get Qi and essence from food right away so you don't have to waste a thousand years sitting alone in a damp cave?\"\n\"…\"\nTang San was speechless. He wished to argue, but he couldn't come up with a response.\nWu Buyi continued to lecture him.\n\"In this place, we speed-run the whole energy-gathering process. Look at me. I'm now an immortal. But do you know what I was 6 months ago? I was a nascent soul nobody! Three months later, I reached the earth celestial realm. And now, I'm a freaking 5th stage immortal – a celestial warrior! Do you know what I do every day? Eating, sleeping, and watching virtual girls!\"\n\"W-What?!\"\nThis time, Kishin Douji was shocked as well.\nBreaking through multiple stages at once wasn't something new to Kishin Douji as he had experienced it before. However, that privilege was only applicable to top talents who got the backing from their rich families.\nFrom Kishin's perspective, Wu Buyi's foundation and meridians were subpar, yet he managed to advance to the immortal stages so quickly. It defied the common sense.\nAs Kishin's interest was piqued, he finally noticed something strange about the shopping complex.\nThe yin and yang Qi from the air conditioner was too pure! It resembled the fresh Qi that the world tree of his planet produced every day.\n'Is this place… a sage realm? Is this the world of sages? But that's impossible! I thought this world was a newly evolved mortal world! Its Qi isn't supposed to be this thick!'\nTang San overheard his mentor's monologue. He whispered, \"What's wrong, master?\"\n'It's nothing. Try asking that man who the owner of this place is.'\n\"O-Okay.\" Tang San caught and relayed the question, \"Senior, who is the owner of this place? How come the Qi and essence in the environment are so dense?\"\nWu Buyi proudly smiled and puffed his chest.\n\"My lord is the greatest cultivator of all time! His name is FLORIDA MAN who masters the dao of Florida! I've been cultivating the same dao recently, and I must say… it's incredible!\"\n\"…Dao of Florida?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 308 Florida Man Mistakenly Brings Youth to Slaughter House Instead of School\n﻿﻿Chapter 308 – Florida Man Mistakenly Brings Youth to Slaughter House Instead of School\nBoth Kishin and Tang San were curious about this dao. The latter inquired further, \"What does 'Florida' mean?\"\n\"It has a profound meaning,\" Wu Buyi held back his laughter once again.\nAfter Wu Buyi received a smartphone, he had been exploring the internet. He also learned modern knowledge and comprehended some of the memes, including FLORIDA MEMES.\nAt first, Wu Buyi was taken aback by the stupidity of these memes. However, as he studied deeper, he discovered the sophistication and the Floridians' ways of life.\nWu Buyi clarified in a simple term, \"You can say that it relates to freedom of choices and consequences of your actions. For example, people who are only engrossed in negativity will never find happiness because of their trained minds. People with the power of positivity have more opportunities in life because of their mindset. However, there's a fine line between confidence and stupidity in life. Well, in short, if you F around, you will eventually find out.\"\nTang San was puzzled by the lecture, but Kishin understood it very well.\nBecause Tang San kept listening, Wu Buyi kept talking.\n.\nWhile Wu Buyi ran his mouth, several top workers of Florida Domain entered the shopping complex to explore the changes. Leading the group were Hua Jiashan and his elders, who already reached the immortal threshold.\nWhen Hua Jiashan reached the airlock room, he figured out why people gathered outside the building instead of entering.\n\"Has the lord bored of the commoners and rogue cultivators? Why is he driving out his customers?\" Hua Jiashan disagreed with the changes.\nDongfang Mei, his wife, followed after him. She inspected the thick metal gate and smacked her lips.\n\"The lord must have been preparing for another major conflict or something. Look at this gate and the surface of the wall. I can tell by just looking that they're a lot stronger than before. I doubt any immortal or deity from other worlds can put a dent in it anymore.\"\nHua Jiashan was enlightened. He turned around and inspected the wall with his Qi.\nBZZZZ\nThe wall reacted to Hua Jiashan's Qi. It repelled his energy and zapped him.\n\"Hohoh. Indeed, it has a defensive mechanism. I think it reacts to every attack. If we launch a strong attack at the wall or the gate, this place will counterattack the assailant with the same amount of force. I probe the wall just now, and I just got stung by the same Qi.\"\n\"Are you sure that you're not guessing randomly?\"\n\"Trust your husband, dear. Go ahead and lightly punch the wall. I bet you will get hit with the same punch.\"\n\"…\"\nTesting Hua Jiashan's theory, Dongfang Mei lightly punched the wall without using her Qi.\nBZZZZ\nThe punch did nothing to the metal wall. On the other hand, an invisible fist came out of nowhere and hit Dongfang Mei in the face. Fortunately, it was light as Dongfang Mei didn't put too much force into her attack.\nDongfang Mei rubbed her nose. She clicked her tongue.\n\"Fine, you win. Let's get going.\"\nBoth husband and wife stopped testing the durability of Leo's bunker passageway. They activated the airlock room and filtered out the bad air.\nIn the room, Hua Jiashan's subordinates were all present. Tiger Swordsman, Han Hao, and Han Meng tagged along to play. Like their former leader, everybody was an immortal. The oppressive Qi of the shopping mall did nothing to them.\nWHOOSH\nThe interior door was opened. All five cultivators walked with a long stride, visiting Qiang Qiang Fountain first. As if they were pre-coordinated, they saluted to her in unison.\nQiang Qiang glanced at them and nodded. She then ignored them.\nThis was everybody's routine whenever they visited Leo's shopping mall. By greeting the guardian statue first, they ensured that their visit would be welcomed.\nAfter getting Qiang Qiang's approval, they walked toward the fountain and brought out a teaspoon. They scooped the fountain water and sipped it. Then, they put away the spoon and sat on the ledge of the fountain.\nFive people sat there and closed their eyes to meditate.\nThe water from the fountain was none other than the holy water, made from the True Earth Fate Crystal. By drinking a sip of it every day, Hua Jiashan and his company increased their Qi volume by 1,000 years' worth of cultivation daily.\nThis was one of the perks of the shopping mall's employees. Leo told everybody that they could drink exactly one teaspoon of water each day to improve their foundation.\nThey once inquired why they couldn't drink more than one teaspoon. But Leo simply warned him.\n\"If you wish to explode, go ahead.\"\nThat warning was enough for everybody to be scared out of their wits. Since then, they had restrained their urge to drink more.\n30 minutes later, they digested the Qi from the holy water. They stood up and bowed to Qiang Qiang once again. Then, they left.\nThe group proceeded to the fast food area, where Wu Buyi always lurked. When they passed the FFC store, they found Wu Buyi as they had predicted.\nHua Jiashan smiled, \"There he is. He's fast today.\"\nHan Hao rushed toward the obnoxious alchemist without saying anything. He grabbed a chair and sat at Wu Buyi's table. Then, he grabbed a piece of chicken and put it in his mouth as if it were his.\nWu Buyi stopped lecturing Tang San and glanced at Han Hao, \"Are you broke or what?\"\nHan Hao smirked, \"A friend's food is always more delicious than self-bought food.\"\n\"Scram, cheapskate! Didn't you get your pay after the wedding? Go buy your own chickens!\"\n\"Nah, I'm broke. A few days ago, I bought two sword manuals from the bookstore. I have to rely on fasting pills again.\"\n\"Get your ass to work then! Stop freeloading me!\"\n\"I will.\" Han Hao laughed as he teased Wu Buyi enough. He then shifted his attention to the youth at the same table. Then, he noticed Tang San's cultivation base.\n\"Hey, you're quite impressive for a youngster.\" Han Hao praised Tang San, \"I thought all quasi-immortals are wussy. It's refreshing to see someone with a firm foundation for once. Buy say, I haven't seen your face before. Did you just come out from seclusion or the time chamber?\"\nTang San didn't know what to answer. He glanced at the group of immortals in front of the store and gulped.\n'W-Wow. Six immortals in one place?' Tang San thought.\nKishin Douji scoffed at his disciple, 'Immortals? Meh, they're just pushovers. Remember Tang San. Immortals and deities are nothing in this universe. Only karmic sovereigns reign supreme! Don't be satisfied or impressed by some locals!'\n'But, master. They must have cultivated the mysterious FLORIDA DAO! We know nothing about this dao. I think we should respect the locals a little and learn more about them.'\n'I know. This place is no longer some regular tavern full of delinquent youngsters. The whole building is a den of experts. DO NOT PROVOKE ANYONE! We don't want to die here.'\n'…I know.'\nTang San gulped and stood up. He then cupped his fist and bowed.\n\"M-My name is Tang San. I'm from the Tang Clan's branch family!\"\n\"Ah, the Tang Clan!\" Han Hao slapped his knee and laughed, \"Your patriarch Tang Xuan and Tang Tian are our friends. We visited the time chamber together twice! Sit down, boy. Let this uncle buy you a drink. Hey silly Wu. Go buy us some cokes.\"\nWu Buyi bored his fangs and fired a piece of chicken through the gaps of his teeth. The piece of chicken entered Han Hao's left nostril, which made him choke.\n\"Use your own money, damn broke!\"\nBecause of Han Hao's shamelessness, Wu Buyi lost his appetite. He packed the chicken barrel in his storage ring and stood up to leave.\nHan Hao managed to extract the piece of chicken from his nose. He dryly laughed, \"That's disgusting, bro!\"\n\"You're disgusting! Get lost!\"\n\"Oh, come on! Let's go play together like the old time! How about another year in the time chamber?\"\n\"SCRAM! I'm planning to study alchemy today! Don't interrupt me!\"\nIn anger, Wu Buyi stormed out of the store while walking like a crap.\nTang San broke a sweat and bowed to the group of elders. Then, he followed Wu Buyi.\nHe wasn't confident in his survival in Hua Jiashan's group. Being with Wu Buyi was more comfortable even though he was a weirdo.\n.\nAfter Wu Buyi and Tang San had left, Hua Jiashan and his people sat in the same store and ordered a few pieces of chicken and burgers. Then, they sat at the same table.\nAs there were not many topics to chat, Tang San's appearance gave them something to talk about.\nHua Jiashan was still impressed by Tang San's foundation and talent.\n\"Is that boy actually a newcomer or a frequent visitor?\"\nHan Hao's expression changed. He crossed his arms and pondered, \"Probably a newcomer. I always memorize every face around here to improve my memory capacity and calculation speed, but I've never seen him before. Also, his clothes are quite… unique.\"\nHua Jiashan and others had a solemn looks on their faces.\n\"If he was an old customer, his cultivation base and his achievement is nothing. But since he's a newcomer, I think we have to change how we approach things.\"\nDongfang Mei agreed, \"Indeed. Someone under 20 years of age with that cultivation base is abnormal. I think we should report this to the lord or scout him.\"\n\"Let's seek the lord and report this. If we can draw him to our side, we might get another Gao Yan or Yao Qiqi.\"\n\"Speaking of Gao Yan…\"\nThe elders thought of the youth who had two antler horns and a handsome face. They grinned and snickered, \"What's his cultivation base right now? Has he surpassed us?\"\nHan Hao grinned, \"I saw him, Jin Yong, Yao Qiqi, and Cat drag their feet out of the time chamber. I asked the manager that day. She said that it was their 10th visit.\"\n\"W-What? Ten already?!\" The group was shocked. \"Then, what about their strength?!\"\n\"The pinnacle of the immortal realm, True Immortal!\"\nHan Hao puffed his chest, proud of the former disciple. He wondered how high the guy would reach under Leo's tutelage and his store's influence.\nBut Dongfang Mei had other concerns.\n\"What about Qiqi and Cat? How are they?\"\n\"…\"\nHan Hao's expression changed. He deeply sighed and quietly muttered.\n\"Yao Qiqi and Jin Yong are true immortals like Gao Yan.\"\n\"Okay! What about Cat?\"\n\"…27.\"\n\"27?\" Everybody didn't understand.\n\"Cat is a 27 star deity.\"\n\"PFFFT!!?\"\nThe crowd spat their drinks. They widened their eyes in disbelief.\n\"WHAT DID YOU SAY?! HOW STRONG WAS SHE?!\"\nIf anybody else was a deity, none of them would have batted an eye. On the other hand, Cat's existence was another story.\nAfter all, she was Leo's daughter figure and she had THAT personality. Everybody prayed that Cat wouldn't start bullying anybody soon.\n.\n.\nOn the fifth floor, Wu Buyi and Tang San reached the workshop area. They entered an alchemy workshop and entered one of the pill-making rooms.\nTang San was excited to see how the workshop taught alchemists and visitors. He wondered if he could become an alchemist as well.\nBut as soon as they entered the room, they found a refined young girl with dark skin and long ears. She had been sitting on the spectator stand and staring at the mannequin next to the cauldron.",

      "content": "Chapter 309 Florida Man Deviously Tricks Teens into Auditioning as Gourmet Cuisine for his Pampered Pet\n?Chapter 309 – Florida Man Deviously Tricks Teens into Auditioning as Gourmet Cuisine for His Pampered Pet\nAs the alchemy workshops operated 24/7, pills and the sweet, bitter scent of medical pills flooded this area, which was suitable for a plant monster to take as a nest. Cat had been living in this shopping mall since she had reached the deity stage. By inhaling the medical scent and pollution from the alchemy cauldrons, her physique grew stronger. Each day, she condensed a new star in her dantian universe, enhancing her foundation and getting ready to challenge the sage realm.\nIn addition, the automatons occasionally discarded bad pills and expired pills from the supermarket. Most of the discarded medicines were thrown into the workshops so that the local workers could refine them into low-graded pills. That was Cat's greatest opportunity. She stole those pills and devoured everything regardless of their expiry dates. Furthermore, she also plundered expired food and junk from the restaurants. In short, this shopping mall was her paradise. She no longer wandered outside to find prey.\nAs a plant, Cat always slept standing or sitting. Even when she was in her human transformation, her habits never changed. In addition, this workshop regularly produced Floridian Dantian Pills, so the Qi in this room was denser than in other places. She chose this place as her favorite bedroom.\nFrom the onlooker's perspective, she was meditating with her eyes closed. Cat dozed off while she waited for the supermarket mannequin to fetch her another batch of expired pills. Meanwhile, Tang San was entranced by the girl's unique beauty. Even Kishin inwardly whistled in admiration.\nWu Buyi spotted Cat. He brightly grinned, \"I'm glad I always visit FFC first. Hey, this one is on me. Next time, you pay for the tax, okay?\"\n\"Huh?\" Tang San was confused, \"What tax?\"\n\"This tax!\" Wu Buyi fetched 10 pieces of chicken that he had bought earlier. He walked toward Cat and placed the food next to her seat. Then, he left her alone.\nTang San was baffled. \"Why did you do that?! She's not an animal! If you want to give her food, you should at least put it on a plate or something clean! That's disrespectful!\"\n\"Heh. You know nothing. Anyway, you shouldn't be staying here for too long. The Qi in this room is the thickest. I doubt your mortal foundation can last 10 minutes.\"\nAgain, Tang San couldn't understand anything. Frustrated, he walked toward Cat and brought out a wooden plate to use as a container. He reached out to grab a fried chicken.\nSuddenly, Cat's arm moved. She grabbed Tang San's arm while she gradually opened her eyes.\n\"No Nom-Nom My food, Meow!\"\n\"????\"\nTang San raised his eyebrows and looked at the small hand of Cat. Because Tang San could not react or utter a word, Cat strengthened her grip and warned him again.\n\"Let go of my Nom-Nom, Meow!\"\n\"OWWW!\"\nTang San screamed in pain as Cat suddenly clenched her hand to the point that his bone cracked. Only then, did he release the chicken that he was holding.\nUpon the release, Cat freed Tang San's arm and gently picked up the fried chickens. Without hesitation or etiquette, she widened her jaws like a snake and swallowed them whole.\nBURP\nCat hiccupped and wiped her mouth. She glanced at Wu Buyi who waved at her.\n\"You're welcome, kiddo.\" Wu Buyi laughed.\nCat grinned and nodded at him. Repaying the favor, she opened her palm and sprouted a rainbow leaf. She plucked it and flickered it at the elder.\nWu Buyi gleefully received the rainbow leaf and stored it in his spatial ring. Their interactions didn't escape Kishin Douji's sense. He exclaimed.\n'THAT WAS THE PRIMORDIAL LEAF OF THE VOID TREE! HOW DOES IT APPEAR HERE!?'\nTang San was stunned, \"Primordial Leaf of Void Tree?\"\nBecause Tang San suddenly uttered it out loud, Wu Buyi heard it. He smacked his lips, \"As expected of a main character, you know a lot for a mortal. Anyway, an advice from a senior, you shouldn't disclose today's event anywhere if you value your life.\"\nTang San closed his mouth. Afraid to be left out, he secretly asked Kishin.\n'Master, what's the primordial leaf? What's it for?'\nKishin had a heartache. He couldn't believe that the elusive void tree of legends had been hiding here.\n'Void Trees are the origin of our universe. From the rumor, it is said that it's key to enter the higher dimension or the upper universe.'\n'A-A higher dimension?'\n'This matter is too early for you. Let's say this. I need that leaf. If you can get your hands on one, I'll teach you everything I know. I'll also guide you to my hidden stash in my star sector. Right, have you been begging me for a good weapon? I have a thousand good blades at home.'\n'…M-Master?'\n'Just get me a primordial leaf of the void tree, and I'll do everything in my power to repay you! Don't ask too much!'\n'…'\nTang San was skeptical about this. He reluctantly sat next to Wu Buyi and asked him.\n\"Senior, if I bring fried chickens to her, will I get the same leaf?\"\nWu Buyi scoffed as he could see through Tang San's intention, \"Probably not. I've been paying taxes every day for half a year. Also, without me, she wouldn't have learned about this place. In a way, I'm her guardian, and she's my daughter. Well, she's actually the lord's daughter though. Hey, for your sake, do not attempt to woo her or you'll be eaten.\"\n\"…Eh? T-Then, how can I win her trust?\"\nWu Buyi smirked as he had an inspiration. Since the guy was down bad for the leaf, he might as well scam him.\n\"Well, kid. Since you wish to get your hands on the leaf so bad, I'll tell you how. First, you must keep feeding her and follow her instructions. In my case, I've been with her since she was young. But in your case, it might take longer to win her trust. For a starter, how about working here as her servant?\"\n\"…S-Servant? Me?\"\n\"Well, yes! Normally, someone like you would have been promoted to an elite worker because of your natural talent and cultivation base. But you know, nobody has ever obtained the right to be the princess's personal servant, even me.\"\nTang San's eyes spun. He was bad at turning down offers, especially seniors who showed him goodwill.\nWu Buyi continued, \"Since I'm generous, I'll use my connection with the lord to get you assigned to his daughter. How about it? Wanna work for our lord and become her servant?\"\n\"Wait a second!\" Tang San took a step back. Escaping from the conversation, he changed the topic, \"You said 'Princess'? Is she… a real princess?!\"\n\"Well,\" Wu Buyi shrugged. \"As I said: She's our lord's daughter. If you mess with her, your head will fly. But if you are good to her, you get rewarded for your loyalty. THE LEAF, well, is one of them.\"\n\"…\"\nTang San wanted to reject the offer. However, Kishin urged him again.\n'Do everything necessary to get your hands on it. Even if you need to kill him, you must!'\n'M-Master?!'\n'It's that important!'\n'…'\nSometimes, Tang San doubted his master because he was too ruthless. Without a choice, Tang San agreed.\n\"Senior, I agree. Please allow me to work here. Also, could I know your name?\"\nWu Buyi burst into laughter and stroked his beard.\n\"I am Wu Buyi, an aspiring Florida Man!\"\n\"F-Florida…Man?\"\n.\n.\nLeo hovered over his new shopping complex. He gazed at the waterpark, which he had installed last night.\n\"Heh, what an unnecessary facility. Anyway, time to invest in other stores.\"\nHe checked the list of facilities that he had recently built on the shopping complex's fifth floor. Leo kept 10 alchemy workshops, blacksmiths, and gunsmiths as the basic facilities. The rest was upgraded into factories, such as metallurgical factories, alchemy factories, and firearm factories.\nAfter adding new system buildings, Leo got 10 factories of each type. The other slots were allocated to a different field. Five car manufacturing factories, five aerospace manufacturer factories, and ten spaceship factories took up more space on the fifth floor.\nThere were 450 slots available on the fifth floor, but Leo kept them empty for now. After all, he needed rooms to build Qi generators, and he planned to build them on this floor.\nAt the moment, most of the factories didn't have enough power supply. Leo deeply sighed and checked the number of fate crystals he had.\n350 Earth Fate Crystals\n111 Sky Fate Crystals\n41 Heavenly Fate Crystals\n2 Entity Fate Crystals\nLeo tilted his head as he didn't remember when he acquired all of them. He could only recall that he killed so many entities when he confronted Sieg.\n\"I guess some of the crystals entered my soul back then. Welp, thanks for the loot.\"\n350 earth fate crystals turned into 50 true earth fate crystals. Using them as a foundation for his shopping complex, he opened his system and purchased 50 Qi generators.\nRUMBLE\n50 generators occupied 50 slots on the fifth floor. At the same time, they filled the building with thick yin-yang essence. Leo visited one of the generator's rooms to see the interior.\nUpon entering, he wasn't disappointed. Inside the room was a barren brown planet in another dimension. The same pylon tower stood tall, producing holy water nonstop. The purified water leaked into the ground. Then, black grasses sprouted from the barren land. Within a few minutes, the brown planet was painted black because of the surging immortal grasses. Some of them even bloomed flowers.\nLooking at the field of immortal grasses reminded him of his early days here. He reminisced about the past.\n\"It all started because of these grasses. This takes me back.\"",

But when he returned, he told the manager of the fifth floor about the resources, ordering her to send someone to collect some grasses.\nUnfortunately, the gacha system no longer existed. Leo's company was short on staff members again. He needed to designate this task to the local employees.\nBut there was a problem. As the employees from the Life Sword Sect were responsible for harvesting crops from the farms and transporting items from Orlando to warehouses. As the farms kept printing fruits and vegetables, a thousand disciples barely kept up.\nThe Tang Clan also had a lot of people, but most of them were sent to maintain order in the slum area. Without them, the vagrants and commoners-turned-cultivators might start rioting or bullying the commoners and merchants.\nBut then, Leo remembered that Meowmeow had scored so many wives that they overpopulated the mystic realm platform. There were also the guys from Esen's subordinates that he could use.\nLeo started drafting his plan. He visited every generator and inspected the environment of each star.\nFortunately, all stars looked the same. The generators turned 50 barren wastelands into 50 realms full of immortal grasses and immortal flowers.\nLeo called Meowmeow right away and assigned him a task. He sent the guy a sound transmission.\n\"Meowmeow, are your girls free?\" Asked Leo.\nMeowmeow replied, but his voice cracked. He was surprised.\n\"A-Are you asking me to share my wives, master?!\"\n\"What the hell?! Of course not! I'm not a sicko like you. Who wants to hump those stone pussies anyway?! My foreskin would have been scratched and peeled from the scrubbing!\"\nMeowmeow was relieved, \"If that's so. Well, that's a relief. What do you want them to do, master?\"\n\"I'm merging the mystic realm platform with my shopping complex soon. Tell everybody to enter the main building and meet me on the fifth floor.\"\n\"Okay, boss!\"\n.\nFive minutes later, Meowmeow and his 1,003 wives arrived. Some of the elves who refused to join the harem also followed them to join the meeting.\nA total of 3,000 elves, including Meowmeow's wives showed up in total!\nLeo was surprised to see so many people. He looked at the perverted golem.\n\"I told you to only bring your wives here. Why are you taking the outsiders with you?\"\nMeowmeow snickered, \"They kind of follow us here. You know, master. These girls just want a job. As a gentleman, I can't deny their requests.\"\n\"I bet you put some weird conditions to the requests: For example, they must become your wives if I assign them a job and pay them wages.\"\nMeowmeow sweated profusely even though he was a rock golem. He averted his eyes and looked away.\n\"I-I don't know what you're talking about, master.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo gave the perverted angel a meaningful look. He couldn't get used to this guy's antics.\n\"Fine. I want you to form 50 teams. Your girls shall work as supervisors while the other volunteers here will be your subordinates. Your main task is to protect the Qi generators and ensure the safety of the workers. As for your subordinates, they only have two jobs – Harvest immortal grasses and flowers. Then, transport them to the underground warehouse of this shopping complex. Any question?\"\n\"Qi generator, master?\"\nMeowmeow raised his eyebrows and closed one eye to read Leo's memory. Instantly, he understood the new mechanism of Leo's new system.\n\"Alright. A team of 20, a total of 50 teams will be allocated to the new stars. The volunteering elves will follow us to harvest the immortal grasses and flowers, got it!\"\nMeowmeow turned around and relayed Leo's order. The high elves from Simba's planet cheered and followed the stone elves to the new workplaces.\n.\nThe parade of the elves was noisy. Even Wu Buyi and Tang San in the workshops could hear them from inside the observation room.\nCurious, Tang San exited the workshop. Then, he found a thousand beautiful elves passing by. Several of them looked like stone golems, but their gorgeous face and their sexy naked figure caught him off guard.\nThis was something that always annoyed Leo. The wives of Meowmeow never wore clothes. However, for Tang San, the stimulation was too much.\nTang San bent forward and pulled his crotch back to hide his boner, yet his eyes were glued to the sexy stone elves.\nOne of the girls noticed Tang San's reaction. She giggled and massaged her chest in front of the young man.\n\"!!!\"\nTang San's face reddened. He fell on his butt and accidentally showed his pitched tent.\nThe elves turned around and saw him. The stone elves laughed while the high elves clicked their tongues in disgust. Then, they walked away.\nKishin Douji, on the other hand, was amused. He contemplated out loud, but only Tang San could hear him.\n'How amusing. Who would have thought that the prideful elves of Eleanor have fallen this low?'\nTang San was surprised, \"Master, do you know them?\"\n'More than that. Have I told you that I was once a consort of some queen?'\nTang San remembered, \"Yes, you told me that you were a prince of the universe and the king of your race or something.\"\n'Yeah, the queen that I used to date was the leader of those people. Her name was Eleanor, and she was an entity… Well, a karmic sovereign by now. I haven't chatted with her since my sworn brother joined her harem. I wonder if she's still out there trying to steal her daughter's body.'\n\"…\"\nTang San had no comment as he wasn't familiar with a matriarchal country's system. In addition, the idea of a queen having many husbands disgusted him.\nHis respect toward Kishin slightly dropped due to this information. Still, he believed that his master was still the strongest entity out there.\nKishin changed the topic. \"Anyway, associating with Eleanor's minions is not recommended. That wench is not trustworthy. Even though I'm her consort, she sent assassins after me to steal my fate crystals and seize my territory. I wish she died.\"\n\"…She sounds like a bad person.\"\n'A very wicked woman, if I say it from my experience. Remember, don't join forces or befriend any elf. They're bad news.'\n\"…Got it, master.\"\nBecause of the conversation, Tang San's boner was killed. He managed to stand up straight and gazed at the naked stone elves without getting aroused.\nWhile observing the elves, the corner of his eyes spotted the movements of two men. One of them was a stone golem like the others, but he was an angel. As for the other one, he was a refined and handsome middle-aged man who had a similar facial outline as the angel.\n\"Hmm?\"\nBecause of Tang San's vision, Kishin Douji also noticed the duo. He found Leo and Meowmeow.\n'Those men…'\nKishin Douji was astonished as he couldn't figure out Leo's cultivation base. Moreover, he gave off the same air as Sieg, who almost killed him.\nAfraid of revealing his weaknesses, Kishin remained silent, not telling his disciples about Leo and Meowmeow.\nAs for Tang San, he was relieved to see more people here. As he wished to make friends with the locals, he approached the two to introduce himself.\n\"Sir, senior! Greetings, senior! I'm Tang San, a member of the Tang Clan. I've just moved in today, and this is the first time I've visited this place. Pleased to meet you!\"\nMeowmeow and Leo turned around and gazed at the young man.\nMeanwhile, Wu Buyi was worried that Tang San might run into a problem. He exited the workshop and discovered the commotion.\n\"Oh, wow! Sexy! Nice fapping materials, hehehe!\"\nWu Buyi scratched his balls in his pants. Then, he pulled his hand to his nose and sniffed it like how a culture monkey would.\nWhile sniffing the foreskin of his balls, he looked around and found Tang San, Leo, and Meowmeow together.\n\"Oh, shit!\"\n.\n.\nLeo stared at the young man and knitted his eyebrows. He listened through Tang San's introduction and hesitatingly nodded.\n\"Okay?\"\nMeowmeow noticed Leo's dark expression. He coughed and warned Tang San.\n\"Hey, boy. You're not supposed to be rude in front of the lord. Fortunately, our lord is benevolent and kind. Otherwise, he would have beheaded you for this insolence! Got it?\"\nTang San sweated profusely. He wondered what he did wrong.\n\"I-I'm sorry. I won't do it again.\"\nMeowmeow teased him enough. He patted Tang San's shoulders and laughed, \"Just kidding. Anyway, that attitude is very good. You introduce yourself to the adults, not waiting for the adults to ask for your name. That's how you climb up the ladders in life, boy!\"\n\"…Haha.\"\nLeo deeply sighed as his subordinate talked too much. He silently uttered.\n\"Identify.\"\nDING\n.\nName: Tang San\nAlias: None\nRace: Yan Human\nAge: 19\nCultivation Base: Quasi-Immortal\nThoughts: Interested, Happy\nSystem Note: This man was born under the bad stars: He was born with a unique constitution that rejected yin and yang essence in favor of the monster Qi. His parents engraved the fate crystal into Tang San's soul when he was a baby to seal his monster Qi. But by doing so, Tang San was fated to become a cripple for life.\nFor 18 years, Tang San was bullied because of his disabilities. He tried his best to cultivate and train, but his dantian and body kept rejecting Qi. After his parents passed away, his fiancé annulled their engagement in favor of marrying another prominent young master from a bigger family. Afterward, the young master sent his men to kill Tang San. He fought back, but he was beaten half-dead. Then, the assailants threw him into a frozen river.\nAs someone with a heavenly fate crystal, he was saved by destiny and great luck. While being in the bottom of the river, he stumbled upon a rusty ring. Miraculously, the ring was the secret hiding place of the Overlord of the Oni Tribe, Kishin Douji.\nKishin Douji saved Tang San's life and corrected his meridians. He also imparted the right cultivation method to him, allowing Tang San to refine yin and yang Qi into monster Qi.\nUnder Kishin Douji's guidance, Tang San's cultivation base soared. He surpassed his peers and overshadowed his fiancé and his rivals.\nA year after the fateful comeback, Tang San migrated south and rejoined with the main clan. Then, he found you and your domain.\n.\nLeo appreciated the background information of this young man even though he didn't ask for it.\n'Oh, boy. Why does his story sound like one of those cliché wuxia stories so much? Is he a protagonist or something? Wait, come to think of it, Gao Yan is similar to this guy except he wasn't as cliché… Welp, whatever. It's not like he's a threat to me or something.'\nLeo shrugged and was about to chat with Tang San. However, Meowmeow interrupted him with a sound transmission.\n'Master, every villain in those stories had the same thought as you. They were like 'He can't possibly do anything!' for a dozen chapters. Then, boom! The main character gets a power-up arc and returns to beat the hell out of those villains. Please don't treat this lightly.'\nLeo rolled his eyes, 'Can he even reach the transcendent realm? He only has a heavenly fate crystal in his soul. It's not like his cultivation ceiling is superior to mine. I have the TRUE ENTITY FATE CRYSTAL, you know. The quality of luck and fate is different!'\n'Just… don't look down on main characters, master. Sometimes, it's better to be overthinking or pessimistic. You can't be disappointed if you already expect the worst-case scenario.'\n\"…\"\nLeo shook his head as he disagreed with Meowmeow. He gazed at Tang San, who had been waiting for Leo's response.\n\"Tang San, is it?\"\nTang San brightly smiled, \"Yes, senior! I'm Tang San.\"\nLeo glanced at the rusty ring necklace of Tang San. His mouth curved up into a grin.\n\"I'm Florida Man, the lord of this domain. Welcome to Florida!\"\n\"T-Thank you, senior.\"\nTang San heard this term many times before, but he still couldn't figure out what the dao of Florida was.\nSuddenly, Leo uttered something that shocked Tang San.\n\"Also, can you relay my greetings to your master in that ring? Kishin Douji, is this his name?\"\n\"W-What?!\"",

He looked at the rusty ring necklace on his neck.\n'What should I answer, master? I think they know.'\nKishin Douji let out a long sigh. His soul exited the ring and manifested in the real world.\nA 3-meter-tall semi-transparent body of a red Oni stood before Leo. He crossed his arms and stared at everybody.\nLeo also crossed his arms and stared at the mysterious expert. Again, he appraised the soul.\n'Identify.'\nDING\n.\nName: Kishin Douji\nAlias: Demon God\nRace: Blood Oni\nAge: 935,970\nCultivation Base: 7-River Karmic Sovereign\nThoughts: Suspicious, Hostile\nSystem Note: This demon god was the longest reigning ancestor of the Blood Oni Race and the former strongest entity in the universe. His reign lasted until the transcended being \"Sieg\" unveiled the secrets of the Void Tree and the hidden applications of the Void Tree's fruits, aka the fate crystals. After the fate crystals spread in the universe, new karmic sovereigns and transcended beings emerged. They quickly overthrew his kingdom and his people were hunted down.\nKishin Douji realized that he couldn't survive alone in the new era. Thus, he surrendered his kingdom to the rising civilization – The Divine Elf Kingdom. He ended up becoming Eleanor Sydin's consort even though she was weaker than him. Because of Eleanor's mighty army and her protection, his Blood Oni Clan survived the hunt.\nIn exchange for his clan's survival, Kishin later bestowed his seed to Eleanor, who gave birth to the first princess – Esen Sydin IV.\nAfter giving birth to the first successor, Eleanor abandoned Kishin Douji in favor of the new consort, Mao Miaomiao. At first, Kishin befriended Mao Miaomiao and ended up becoming sworn brothers. But later on, their relationship gradually deteriorated and small conflicts between the Oni Clan and Divine Elf Clan were more frequent. The tension turned into a cold war between the two races.\nWhile preparing for a full-scale war, his clan was ambushed by Sieg. His physical body was destroyed, forcing his soul to flee from his home world. He eventually found the Yan Empire's planet and hid his soul inside an abandoned spatial ring. Then, he found Tang San and ended up using him.\n.\nLeo slightly shook his head in astonishment. Getting information from both sides revealed a lot of hidden backstories. However, it was a pity that the system didn't show other information regarding Eleanor's kingdom and Mao Miaomiao's intervention.\nSarcastically, Leo greeted Kishin Douji. \"Hello, there, father-in-law.\"\nKishin Douji narrowed his eyes, \"I don't remember having a son-in-law.\"\n\"You do. I married your daughter.\"\n\"I don't have a daughter.\"\n\"You do. Eleanor gave birth to your daughter, didn't she?\"\n\"Her children are not mine.\"\n\"But she carries your blood. To be honest, I'm surprised as well. I didn't expect you to be her actual father.\"\n\"…\"\nKishin Douji didn't understand why Leo called him 'Father-In-Law'. He treated it as a joke and changed the topic.\n\"I see that you're a transcended being. What do you want from this helpless Oni?\"\nLeo smirked, \"I just don't like lurkers, so I call you out. If you want to live here in my domain, you need to make your presence known.\"\n\"Understandable,\" Kishin Douji agreed with this idea, but he hadn't trusted Leo yet. \"What else do you need?\"\n\"It's the other way around. What are you planning to do with that boy? Are you trying to raise his cultivation base to match yours? Then, will you take over his body like a cliché villain would?\"\nTang San widened his eyes in shock and took a step back by reflex. On the other hand, Kishin Douji was enraged.\n\"Preposterous! A karmic sovereign like me can regenerate my fleshly body anytime! I don't need to steal a fleshly body like Eleanor or Mao Miaomiao!\"\nLeo snickered. He lowered his arms and fetched a blank spatial ring in his pocket. Then, he passed it to Kishin Douji.\n\"That old ring you are using is about to break apart. Use this one instead. Also, if possible, regenerate your fleshly body and stay outside. That way, I won't suspect you for doing something shady to that boy over there.\"\nKishin Douji snorted, \"If I had enough energy, I would have done so ages ago! I need to fully recuperate first. Otherwise, a transcendent being stronger than you will detect my presence and come for my life. If that man appears, even you will be in trouble!\"\nBeing reminded of another transcended being, Leo recalled Sieg and his fate crystal obsession. Fortunately, his sugar mom 'Priscilla' already helped him greatly. Leo believed that Sieg might have already been dead.\n\"Sorry to bring it to you, but I think THAT GUY you mentioned is already dead.\"\n\"WHAT!?\" Kishin Douji was flabbergasted, \"IMPOSSIBLE! HE IS THE LORD OF FATE STADIUM! HE CONTROLS ALL SYSTEMS USERS!\"\n\"I think he ran into another transcended being by the name 'Priscilla'. I ran into him a while back, and she saved me. Since he has been quiet, I think he's dead.\"\n\"…\"\nKishin Douji knew of this 'Priscilla' person. After all, she was one of many enemies who wanted him dead in the past.\nWhen Kishin Douji was the sole overlord of the universe, Priscilla was just a roaming monster that wasn't worth his attention. But when Priscilla managed to collect seven entity fate crystals, she gathered all her kin and established the Phoenix Clan. Afterward, her clan stood toe-to-toe with Sieg's Fate Stadium Army.\nRealizing how big Leo's backer was, Kishin Douji ceased his ill thoughts. He grudgingly lowered his head.\n\"Then, please allow me to stay here and recuperate. When I'm fully recovered, I'll leave this place.\"\nLeo brightly smiled and opened his palm. His ugly smile resurfaced.\n\"Of course, you can stay here, but you have to pay for the Nom-Nom Tax.\"\n\"…Nom-Nom Tax?\" Kishin Douji was confused.\n\"Ah, please excuse the jargon. I mean you must give something equivalent in exchange for the trouble. I won't ask much. I just need 50% of your total life force… or lifespan.\"\n\"…What?\"\nLeo snapped his fingers and summoned the good-old lifespan status menu for Kishin Douji to see.\n.\nName: Kishin Douji\nAge: 935,970\nLifespan: 2,110,290,312 Years\n.\nUpon seeing the lifespan of Kishin Douji, Leo was impressed. As for Tang San, he gawked at the unbelievable status screen in front of his master.\n\"Wow, two billion years to live?! That's a lot of time to cultivate!\" Tang San counted his fingers, imagining himself with that amount of time. He wondered what he would do in the next one billion years.\nAs for Kishin Douji, he didn't think much of his lifespan. After all, he was also a system user, and he could easily accumulate them back in a few years.\n\"Fine. A billion years of my lifespan for your protection, right?\"\n\"Indeed. You're quick to understand.\"\n\"I'll pay. But make sure that nobody comes after me. If someone were to come here and pursue me, it's your job to fend off the invaders. I won't be doing anything or contributing anything to your cause.\"\n\"Fine by me.\"\nKishin Douji grumbled and regenerated his fleshly body. His semi-transparent body turned red while his face looked more savage. However, as he manifested his body from nothingness, there was nothing to hide his naked body.\nThe appearance of a giant red Oni with a huge asset surprised the elves, who hadn't entered their new workplace yet.\n\"Red Oni?!\"\n\"Why is an Oni savage here?!\"\n\"Dammit. I thought those losers were extinct. It appears that one of them survived.\"\n\"Yeah, that's terrible. I wish Lady Eleanor or that perverted eyeball Sieg killed them all. They're unnecessary.\"\nThe comments of the elves annoyed Kishin, but he got used to it. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out his blood. The droplet of blood expanded and transformed into gold samurai armor, covering his skin from head to toe.\nThe gold samurai crossed his arms and stared at Leo again.\n\"How do I pay?\"\nLeo shrugged and fiddled with his system. A few seconds later, the system screen in front of Kishin Douji prompted him with a message.\nDING\n<Will you pay 50% of your lifespan in exchange for Florida Man's protection?>\nKishin snorted, \"Yes!\"\nDING\nCHA-CHING\nHis lifespan was halved. Meanwhile, Leo received a different message.\n<You have collected a total of 1,055,145,156 years of lifespan.>\n<Your total lifespan has exceeded 2,147,483,647 years. The excess will be stored in the system bank.>\n<Your current bank balance is 1,913,040,276 years.>\nLeo grinned, proud of his achievement so far. At this rate, he might be able to purchase and fully upgrade a colony to expand his domain's resident limit.\nAfter paying Leo, Kishin Douji turned around and glanced at his disciple. As Tang San was no longer useful to him, he decisively made a declaration.\n\"Tang San. From now on, you're no longer my disciple. You can do whatever you want from now on.\"\n\"W-Wait, what?!\" Tang San was shocked. \"But why, master?! What did I do wrong? Why are you expelling me?\"\n\"I don't need to hide anymore, so I don't need you as my eyes and ears.\"\n\"But I haven't mastered your cultivation method yet!\"\n\"That's none of my business.\"\nRuthlessly, Kishin Douji cast Tang San aside and walked away. He left the shopping complex through the main gate and shocked the local people outside.\n.\nTang San was speechless. He gazed at his departing ex-mentor in confusion.\nEmotions overwhelmed him. He thought that Kishin Douji was a sincere and helpful master. But in reality, he was being used.\n\"In the end, there's nobody for me to trust but myself.\" Tang San lamented.\nMeowmeow who had been silent during the whole interaction patted Tang San's shoulder.\n\"You're right. You can't trust anybody but yourself. Also, if I may borrow my master's words, there's a saying: There's no free meal in this world. So yeah, he helped you for a reason. Without a benefit, why should he help you in the first place?\"\n\"…\"\nTang San slowly nodded. He looked back at the golem in wary.\n\"So, will you use me as well?\"\nMeowmeow giggled, \"You're right, but you're also wrong.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeo coughed and interrupted their conversation before things escalated for the worse. He elaborated.\n\"In this place, we make it clear what our relationship is. I'm a vendor, and you're a customer. You want something from me, and I'm willing to exchange it for some of your lifespan. Whatever you wish, I'll procure it for you as long as you have enough lifespan to pay.\"\nlightsnοvεl \"Eh?\"\n\"Let me explain how my domain works…\"\nLeo laughed as he slowly explained what his business scheme was.",

He was interested in Leo's shopping mall.\n\"Can I roam this place freely? Really?!\"\nTang San had visited a few sects before, and their culture was different. For example, the Northern Star Sect, where his ex-fiancé and her new husband joined, never allowed outsiders to roam their territory to protect their Qi and cultivation resources in the sect. On the other hand, Leo operated a public shopping mall, which allowed visitors to stay and absorb the Qi in the environment.\n\"Yeah, you can.\"\n\"Can I absorb the Qi of this place, too?\"\n\"Yes, you can.\"\n\"So, if I don't have enough essence cores to pay for the goodies, I can pay it with my lifespan?\"\n\"Yes, you can.\"\n\"And I can work here to earn essence cores?\"\n\"Yes, you can.\"\n\"Do I get free food from the shops here as well?\"\n\"NOPE! You gotta pay. Don't trick me, kid.\"\n\"Ehehe. It's worth trying. Anyway, I would like to work for you. What job do I do?\"\nLeo pondered. He needed miscellaneous workers who could coordinate with the other employees in the store, but Tang San was too new here.\nAs Tang San wasn't suited for the task, he thought of other vacant positions in his store. Then, he remembered that there were plenty of entry-level jobs that Tang San could do.\n\"Can you swim, boy?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nLeo was relieved. He pointed at escalators, which led to the waterpark on the upper floor.\n\"There's a waterpark on the upper floor. I need a janitor for that place. You will assist my golems in managing the waterslides, machines, and sales booths.\"\n\"A janitor?\" Tang San was surprised. In other sects, most cultivators employed commoners to work in such positions. \"Me? A janitor?\"\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\"B-But, sir. I'm a cultivator.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"Can't you just hire some weak disciples or trainees?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and glanced at the entrance of the mall. Tang San also noticed his eyes and followed his gaze.\nOn the first floor, not many people managed to get in. Aside from the elders of the Life Sword Sect, Esen's subordinates and Taxi's gang showed up to inspect the new changes.\nSeeing less than a hundred people in the large shopping mall, Tang San remembered something.\n\"Ah, crap! The environment and the yin-yang essence in the air!\" Tang San exclaimed.\n\"Right. I purposely increased the air conditioner's Qi output. I need to weed out those freeloaders in the shopping mall and give them a push. Otherwise, they will be too lazy and take things for granted.\"\nTang San didn't know about the previous conditions of Leo's shopping mall. He tilted his head, \"What happened in the past, sir?\"\n\"I allowed commoners and rogue cultivators to enter this place and encouraged them to open their stores on the second and third floor. Do you know what happened? They used this place as a cultivation hub or some sort. They loitered around here, leeching on my shopping mall's Qi instead of buying my stuff and going home.\"\nTang San nodded, \"Ah, understandable. Weak cultivators are poor. I can understand why they did that.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Leo changed the topic. \"There might not be many customers from around here, but some experts from other worlds might show up regularly. Some of them might be deities, sages, or entities. An immortal or a quasi-immortal like you is nothing in their eyes. Therefore, you aren't qualified for a better role yet.\"\n\"W-What? Other worlds?! You mean, the people from a higher world?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\nTang San was excited, \"Master… I mean, my former master told me that he was from a higher realm. Could you teach me what kind of places they are?\"\nLeo was tired of talking to this boy. He chased Tang San away, \"Go to the upper floor and learn your job first. I'll lecture you when I'm free. I'm busy right now.\"\n\"…Oh.\"\nTang San was dejected. He lowered his shoulders and dragged his feet toward the escalators to the waterpark's floor.\n.\nAfter Tang San had left, Leo returned his attention to Meowmeow and whispered.\n\"Keep your eyes on the guy. I think he's a main character or something.\"\n\"I can tell.\" Meowmeow nodded and vanished. He became invisible and secretly followed Tang San.\nThe troublemakers were gone, but there was another annoying subordinate who had been waiting for Leo.\n\"What's up, my lord!\"\nWu Buyi waved his hands. He had been patiently waiting for Leo to finish.\nThe alchemist wasn't the only one who came here to see Leo. Hua Jiashan and his people also arrived. When Leo looked at them, they saluted.\n\"Lord Florida Man…\"\n\"Oh, boy.\" Leo sighed. This might take a while to explain.\n.\n.\nIn the end, Leo held a meeting with the top executives of his domain.\nTang Xuan, Tang Tian, Hua Jiasha, Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, Han Hao, Han Meng, Tiger Swordsman, Wu Buyi, Taxi, Ricardo, Marc, Ivy, Beatrice, Gao Yan, and Jin Yong attended the gathering.\nSeveral hours after the explanation, everybody understood why Leo increased the density of the shopping mall's Qi. They were also stunned when they learned about the Qi generators and the new sources of immortal grass.\n\"I guess we're going to get busy from here on out.\" Tang Xuan visualized the busy workshops and factories, which would chug out countless longevity pills for sale.\nTang Tian believed he found the flaws in Leo's business scheme. He pointed out and warned Leo.\n\"Isn't this a method to cheat lifespan? We consume longevity pills to infinitely increase our lifespan. Then, we can exchange them for Lord Florida Man's artifacts and books.\"\nLeo was aware of that. He tried to explain.\n\"Do you know what the maximum lifespan a person can have?\"\n\"How many, my lord?\"\n\"Two billion years.\"\n\"Two… WHAT?!\"\nEverybody counted their fingers. Wu Buyi even brought out toothpicks to count as he wondered how many zeros were there.\nTwo billion years was a long time to live. As the oldest among them was merely a thousand years old, they couldn't imagine what they would do in such a long time.\nCultivating in seclusion?\nEnjoying the worldly matters?\nGetting married and having many kids?\nThey daydreamed for a while. But everybody was quickly disillusioned by the abrupt questions in their mind.\nWhat would happen if they suddenly forgot about the time during their seclusion and came out a million years later? Would their families and friends would be around at that time? Would anybody remember them at all?\nWhat if the Yan Empire Planet was destroyed?\nWhat would they live if Leo's domain was gone?\nWould they be able to survive alone in the universe?\nThe thoughts frightened them. Many faces turned pale.\nLeo snickered as he had gone through that phase before. He reminded them.\n\"Cultivation takes years. As for myself, I've lived over 50,000 years. I've seen a glorious civilization being reduced to ruins. I've seen a tiny cute rat mutated into a gigantic monstrosity. I've witnessed the sky changing color from white to red, to green, to rainbow, and to orange within a minute. I saw a humongous meteorite colliding with the ocean and creating an apocalyptic flame that devoured the world. I've dove into the deepest ocean floor and met the mutated creatures of myths. Well, life is about the exploration of the unknown. You shouldn't fear the immortality.\"\nEverybody came back to their senses. They felt a lot better.\nLeo reminded them, \"Living a short and meaningful life is good and all, but you guys have the privilege that no mortal can have. You should enjoy it. Don't be afraid of living a long life even though it's such a pain sometimes.\"\nThe elders laughed as they understood it.\nTang Xuan's mood got a lot better. He came up with an idea.\n\"My lord. Since you're limiting access to your shopping complex, commoners and weak cultivators can no longer patronize your store. Without your help, their cultivation progress may likely stagnate due to the lack of cultivation resources. I would like to suggest that you should distribute the stores to the minor areas to expand your influence.\"\nLeo tilted his head, \"In short, you want me to open a branch for the commoners?\"\n\"Yes. That's exactly what I'm trying to suggest.\"\nLeo glanced at the others, \"What about you guys? Do you want me to open new branches of my store in other places?\"\nWu Buyi rubbed his hands, \"Yes, of course! Your wares are too great to be kept exclusive in this place. There are still many islands and continents in this world that we haven't explored or visited. Just like you said, our life is long. We should explore everything and make it worth it!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo frowned. He had flown around this planet several times, and he had already explored the map of this world. Aside from the Yan Continent, there were only three minor islands with civilizations.\nMoreover, the islanders were mostly commoners. Even the local cultivators had a lower standard strength than the mainland.\n\"They are a bunch of commoners and weak cultivators, though.\"\n\"That's our point, my lord.\" Tang Xuan stressed, \"We should increase the number of our customers and the strength of our world. By raising the commoners, you get more potential subordinates that you can employ in the future. Aren't you lacking helpers, my lord?\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, Tang Xuan hit his black heart. He couldn't help but agree.\n\"Alright. But who will be in charge of the new branch.\"\nSuddenly, everybody raised their hands. Their eyes brightened as if they were kids who had found their favorite toys.\n\"Me!\"\n\"Pick me!\"\n\"Mine!\"\n\"Me!\"\nLeo was speechless. He looked around and noticed that Gao Yan and Jin Yong also raised their hands.\n\"Even you?\" Leo wryly smiled.\n\"Ehehe. We… just want to travel.\" Gao Yan bashfully laughed.\n\"…\"\nLeo had a headache. He couldn't decide as nobody seemed trustworthy enough for the job. After all, they all had an ulterior motive.\nWhile Leo was in deep thought, Cat suddenly exited the alchemy workshop and walked toward Leo. She tugged his clothes.\n\"Papa, where nom-nom meow?\"\n\"…\"\nLeo looked down and found Cat, who looked like a middle-grade schooler in the modern world. Because of her tanned skin and long ears, she looked like a cute dark elf.\nRecognizing Cat, Leo patted her.\n\"Thanks for calling me 'Papa', Cat. But this daddy is busy.\"\n\"But my nom-nom?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeo suddenly had an idea. He looked around and came up with an idea.\n\"If you take the role as the branch manager, you must take Cat along with you.\"\n\"EH?!\"\nThe crowd was shocked. They looked at Cat in one direction.\nCat was also quick to learn. She mischievously grinned and urged Leo.\n\"Papa. I want someone kind and generous. I want nom-nom!\"\n\"Oh hoh?\"\nLeo smirked. He had a clear idea who he could appoint as the new branch manager.",

No beggars, hoodlums, or thieves roamed this place. Instead, wealthy merchants and cultivators could be seen everywhere.\nMost of the buildings near the main roads ran a business. Street markets, stalls, brothels, pill pavilions, and miscellaneous service centers offered a variety of merchandise and services. 70% of the local goods were second-hand items that his customers had bought from his store. Still, the rest were items that the merchants procured from elsewhere.\nLeo looked around and was amazed by the sheer volume of the second-hand goods. There were even knock-off stores that sold similar food as his FFC shop, but they used regular chickens.\n\"Wow. They're quite developed.\" Leo couldn't help but praise them.\nHua Jiashan bitterly smiled as he recognized some of the faces in the slum. The townsmen who lived near his former sect all migrated here, and they settled down here.\n\"If we count the population of Magpie City, there should be more than 20,000 people here.\" Hua Jiashan estimated.\nTang Xuan disagreed. As his clan managed this area, he knew the exact number. \"120,000 people, actually. 30,000 are commoners. The rest are cultivators.\"\n\"That many?!\" Leo was stunned.\nTang Xuan bitterly laughed. \"You never visited us, so you weren't aware of the recent influx of immigrants. Also, there have been rumors about the changing climate recently. People from the north testified that the winter this year comes early.\"\nLeo deeply frowned, \"Wasn't the previous winter 4-5 months ago?\"\n\"Yes. That's why people are panicking. They seek a warmer place because they thought that Yin monsters are emerging.\"\n\"How odd. I don't sense any strong monsters in the north though. I even flew to space several times during the past months, and I don't see any unusual creature.\"\n\"That's why we're treating this matter as unfounded rumors, but we have already dispatched an investigation team to investigate the climate last week. We hope to get an answer soon.\"\nLeo nodded. He looked ahead while they were strolling on the main road.\n\"Let's change the topic. Since we chatted about the new branch yesterday, we need a suitable location for the local people.\"\n\"Yes. Let's secure the land in the middle of the town. I think the Shang Merchant Group owns it. We should be able to purchase his land and get the ideal location.\"\nLeo flinched. He looked at Tang Xuan.\n\"I'm the freaking owner of this domain. Why the hell do I have to buy land from someone else?!\"\nTang Xuan broke a sweat. He forgot about it.\n\"Please excuse my blunder. For a moment there, my old habit resurfaces. I thought I was still working for the Yan Emperor.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo waved his hand and disregarded the mistake. He deeply sighed.\n\"Welp. Since they claim my land as their own, I might as well avoid unnecessary conflicts.\"\n\"But I'm sure those commoners will return your land if you ask though.\"\n\"Meh. Then, I would have to clear the old buildings and redesign the paved stone roads here. They worked so hard to terraform a forest into a city. I should respect that.\"\nLeo complained as he was too lazy to deal with the local people. However, to the local residents, his decision was an act of kindness. Some of the eavesdropping townsmen shed a tear of gratitude.\nTang Xuan also secretly cleaned his eyes with his clothes. He brightly smiled.\n\"As you wish, we will not touch the local people's properties and their hard work. But where should we establish the branch office, my lord?\"\nLeo deeply sighed and levitated to the sky.\nSeeing that Leo took flight, all the elders followed him. They also looked around to see if there were any unclaimed land.\nUnfortunately, all usable lands were occupied. Even the Magpie City's walls were torn down so that the slum could merge with the former city.\nTang Xuan checked the southern area, but he quickly abandoned the thoughts. Half of Leo's domain territory was his farmland, where his automatons cultivated unique vegetables and fruits. As they were the only source of alchemy ingredients and food, they were irreplaceable. Thus, replacing some of the farmland for a new office wasn't ideal.\nHua Jiashan flew further west to see the extent of the slum district, and he was surprised. Beyond the Magpie City to the west, Hua Jiashan saw a thousand groups of carpenters and merchants building roads and wooden structures to expand the city. He rushed back to report Leo.\n\"My lord. The western area of Magpie City should be suitable. The commoners are building a new town there. If we erect a new branch over there, we can accelerate their growth. Moreover, the citizens won't be congested near the main store where our immortals and deities reside. With this move, we can segregate the mortal zone from the immortal zone.\" Hua Jiashan suggested.\nTang Xuan agreed. \"Indeed. If we look closer to the main roads, we can see dense traffic of carriages and wagons near the main store. But to the west area, the roads are almost empty. If we establish a branch there, the traffic will shift toward the new branch and relieve the traffic over here.\"\nLeo was curious. He followed Hua Jiashan to the western outskirts of Magpie City. The group also tagged along with him.\nUpon arrival, Leo saw what Hua Jiashan had seen, but he inspected further west. Beyond the land that Hua Jiashan had scouted was a tall mountain range. West of the mountains, the west coast of the continent and the sea blocked the town's expansion.\n\"Ah, a weird combination of mountains and sea,\" Leo smirked. He rubbed his chin and visited the mountain.\nThe mountain range emitted no Qi. Upon landing, Leo immediately spat on it and hoped to see some changes.\nUnfortunately, nothing happened.\nLeo tilted his head as he figured that the spit might not be enough. He shamelessly unzipped his pants and started spraying holy water.\n\"…\"\nTang Xuan and the other followers froze. Their expressions darkened. On the other hand, Cat widened her eyes and complained.\n\"PAPA! WHAT A WASTE OF NOM-NOM MEOW! YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THAT PRECIOUS NOM-NOM FERTILIZER TO ME, MEOW!\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, except for an individual, Cat's complaints stunned the crowd. Her words reminded them that she was originally a dryad, not a regular cultivator.\nWu Buyi was the only one laughing at Cat's remark. He teased her.\n\"Indeed, an adult's piss contains a lot of nutrition for a plant girl like you. If you suddenly open a toilet service and allow men to piss on you, I bet you will be so rich! BAHAHAHAHA!!\"\n\"…\"\nThe crowd glared at Wu Buyi for making such a sick joke. The girls were disgusted, but a certain follower of Esen secretly giggled.\nThe woman mustered her courage and embraced the shame. She approached Wu Buyi and chatted with him for the first time while Ivy and Marc dropped their jaws.\nBeatrice floated next to Wu Buyi and gave him a faint smile.\n\"Sir Alchemist, your logic sounds interesting. I've been a death knight for over a thousand years, but I never encountered someone as shameless as you.\"\nWu Buyi puffed his chest, \"Thanks for the compliment, lady!\"\n\"Say, I would like to learn more about your unique wisdom. Would you like to join me for dinner so we can discuss daos?\"\nAt that moment, all men especially Marc almost screamed from shock and disbelief.\nBeatrice invited Wu Buyi for dinner?!\nWas Hell frozen?! – The men thought.\nDid it snow in summer?! – The women thought.\nWas Thailand free of ladyboys?! – Wu Buyi thought.\nDid Florida ban guns?! – Leo thought.\nAlthough speechless, Wu Buyi regained his composure and changed his voice.\n\"I would love to, but I'm a busy man. I need to refine my alchemy skills by studying in the workshop. I'm afraid I don't have time for the conversation.\"\n\"What a shame.\" Beatrice sighed, \"I reserved the hotel's buffet restaurant. I guess I might have to invite someone else-\"\n\"Not necessary. I'll go. Hotel's buffet, right?\" Wu Buyi changed his mind.\nThe hotel that they referred to was the hotel where Leo and Esen got officially married. The building was still at the same place and was operated by Dongfang Mei and Xu Nuan.\nThe hotel rooms were mostly vacant due to the high fees. However, several cultivators from the slum sometimes spent their hard-earned essence stones or lifespan to book a room, treating this place as a haven for cultivation and relaxation.\nWu Buyi also loved the hotel's facilities and their food. Although the sources of food came from the same places, the hotel offered a buffet service, which Wu Buyi enjoyed the most.\n\"Well, FFC was good for breakfast, but the hotel's buffet service is too good to ignore. If you insist, I would like to accept your invitation, my lady!\"\nBeatrice giggled, \"Sure. Let's continue our chat tonight, okay?\"\n\"Of course!\"\nEveryone stared at the two as if they were looking at emerging Godzilla giving birth to a dinosaur. Nobody could describe a word of their feeling.\nMarc turned around and hugged Ivy. He sniffed and cried as he couldn't bear seeing his biological sister going after another man.\nIvy grinned and hugged Marc back. She then excused herself and brought the heartbroken boy to the hotel. While she was about to leave, she winked at Beatrice, who also secretly gave her a thumbs up.\nNo one among the crowd could foresee what Ivy would do to Marc, but they would learn about their new relationship in the future.\n\"AHEM!\"\nLeo had enough of the soap opera drama. He coughed and regained everybody's attention.\n\"I'm going to build the branch near the mountain. Also, I'll be building extra houses and other structures nearby. Be prepared for the changes!\"",

The plain rocky mountain range turned black like the northern black mountain. The mineral spread like how spilled ink painted a sheet of white paper black.\nHowever, the spread never stopped as the transformation process entered the next stage. The area where Leo had sprayed his urine glittered in rainbow color, evolving into the spiritual core of the entire mountain.\nThe core had a unique shape of a 2-inch thick and one square foot block. The surface of the square core was coarse and sharp. The needles of the core's skin were so tiny that regular humans couldn't see them with naked eyes.\nLeo gazed at the mountain and waited for the transformation to finish. He also appraised the square core.\n.\nSpiritual Heart of Planet Eater\nThis spiritual heart has been created by the transcended being 'Florida Man'. It contains a portion of his bodily liquid and his daos, which transforms a clump of dirt into a sentient being.\nThis newborn spiritual heart has yet to gain intelligence even though it has just awakened its sentient. It also lacks a soul as its creator hasn't bestowed it a soul yet. Until it acquires a soul and links its karma with a karma river, it cannot function as a sentient being.\nAlthough it lacks a soul and intelligence, the spiritual heart automatically absorbs yin and yang Qi in the area and uses them to transform the natural material around it into soul stones. However, should any non-material lifeform touch it, the spiritual heart can mistake the being as a source of Qi and attempt to consume the being as nutrition.\nThis precious resource is the key ingredient for Omnipresent Drive, which is the common standard engine for space colonies and dreadnaught-class battleships. If left alone, it will slowly consume everything on the planet and terraform everything into a soul stone star, which will eventually evolve into a galactic being 'Planet Eater'.\nActions Recommendations\n1. This spiritual heart seems dangerous at a glance, but it is a rare resource that you can exploit. By sending inorganic life forms to mine it, you can extract a lot of soul stones from the converted minerals. However, it is recommended to return some materials to the spiritual heart so that it has something to convert. Otherwise, its survival instinct will drive it crazy and attack everybody on the planet for food.\n2. This spiritual heart can be used in alchemy. The recipe is as follows;\n[Seed of the Void Tree]\nOne spiritual heart\nOne million soul stones\nOne dantian crystal of a transcended being\nOne true entity fate crystal\n.\nLeo wryly smiled and shook his head. Sometimes, he was confused about how he managed to create something so weird out of the blue.\n\"I often pee everywhere, but I never turned anything into this… blasphemous rock! How the hell does my body work?!\"\nBecause of Leo's comment, the others were curious about what Leo had just created.\n\"What's wrong, my lord?\" Asked Han Hao.\n\"Ah, I just gave birth to a planet eater. I don't know how, but I think I might have to remove this thing after it's done transforming the entire mountain range into soul stones.\"\n\"S-Soul stones? W-What's that?\" As Han Hao and others had never seen soul stones before, they wondered what they were.\n\"Well, imagine this. You have essence stones and spirit stones in your world, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Soul stones are like the higher tier of those stones. By combining a thousand essence stones together, you get one soul stone. It contains a lot more Qi than what you have. Got it?\"\nHan Hao and everybody were moved as they couldn't believe that Leo just created more cultivation resources for them. If they could grovel in the sky, they would have done so.\nWhile everybody was overjoyed by the changes, Kishin Douji had another reaction. The Oni Overlord noticed the aura and flew by to take a look. But when he noticed the spiritual heart, his expression turned dark.\n\"What are you doing, Florida Man!? Why are you creating a planet eater here?! Are you trying to wage war with THAT overlord?!\"\n\"That overlord? Who?\"\nKishin Douji yelled, \"The transcendent Overlord Planet Devourer! Those planet eaters are not something that you should take lightly! When I was governing the universe, they were the most troublesome race! Do you know that if you leave one of them alone for a year, they will devour a galaxy and evolve into a karmic sovereign?!\"\nLeo was surprised, but something didn't make sense there.\n\"If they could quickly evolve into karmic sovereigns, how the heck did you subdue them?\"\nKishin Douji snorted, \"During my reign, fate crystals weren't a thing. Those planet eaters move by instincts. I mixed some karma river of this universe with a random gas star and sent it their way. When they ate the poisoned star, the karma river digested them from the inside and melted them into gas!\"\n\"Oh, so we can just easily kill them with this method, then.\"\nKishin Douji facepalmed, \"Didn't you hear what I said? This method worked before fate crystals became a thing. Overlord Planet Devourer got his hands on an entity fate crystal, and he got a system. His system power, if I remember correctly, is the Arkachic Record System. He can read the past, present, and future whenever he wants. His prediction rate is close to 100%.\"\nlightsnοvεl \"…Whoa.\"\n\"Let me tell you a story, you idiot. Overlord Sieg of Fate Stadium and Overlord Priscilla of Rainbow Phoenixes once teamed up to eradicate the planet eaters under Overlord Planet Devourer. That bastard predicted the event and counterattacked. Do you know what happened? Priscilla and Sieg lost half of their soldiers and were forced to retreat!\"\n\"…\"\n\"That's not all. That fight took place 50,000 years ago. By now, they should have amassed at least a dozen transcendent beings among their ranks.\"\n\"…Then, why haven't they invaded the elves and the others yet if they are so strong?\"\nKishin Douji flinched. He hesitated if he should reveal a piece of sensitive information. But after a few seconds of contemplation, Kishin confessed.\n\"The Void Tree.\"\n\"The Void Tree?\"\nThis was the first time that Leo had heard about the Void Tree from someone else. He reread the alchemy recipe.\n[Seed of Void Tree]\nThis piqued his interest. Leo probed for more information.\n\"What is the Void Tree?\"\nKishin Douji snorted, \"You know nothing, don't you? Fine, I'll teach you baboons a lesson. In the past before fate crystals exist, there was no such thing as 'Void Tree'. Only world trees exist in the universe, and the highest cultivation base ceiling was once the karmic sovereign realm.\"\nThe Oni Lord narrated a story.\n.\n.\nBefore Eleanor, Sieg, or Priscilla could become an overlord, Kishin Douji was the sole ruler of the universe. His force maintained order and peace in various worlds, so no individual could bully another weaker race.\nBut one day, a void tree suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The mushroom-like transparent tree instantly devoured several karma rivers of the universe and grew its size.\nWhen Kishin Douji first saw it, it was already bigger than the Milky Way Galaxy, and it kept growing. At first, he thought it was another form of the uprising planet eaters, so he mobilized his force to subdue it.\nThe campaign failed before Kishin Douji's army could even touch the tree. When his troops got close, it revealed its aura of a transcended being, repelling everybody away. Then, Kishin Douji heard its voice.\n\"People of the lower dimension, hear me. I am the owner of the Void Tree, the Void Principality. I am from the higher dimension, and I am searching for candidates to join my universe.\"\nThe voice was so loud that everybody in the universe could hear it. Kishin Douji Army was the closest to the tree and got hit by the loud sound.\nHis people were critically injured. Everybody retreated to their headquarters while Kishin Douji remained behind to listen to the tree.\nThe Void Tree then produced countless fruits, which were known as fate crystals. It scattered the crystals to every corner of the universe.\n\"For fairness, I have scattered fate crystals in your universe. In the next 100,000 years, those who possess a leaf of this tree shall be qualified to enter my universe!\"\nThat was the end of the message. Afterward, powerful experts emerged one after another. Kishin Douji and his army were besieged by all his enemies and rebels, forcing him to abdicate his throne and surrender to Eleanor.\n.\n.\nAfter hearing the full story of the Void Tree, Leo and the elders were amazed.\n\"Wow, really? A higher dimension?\" The humans and the Molgs were astonished.\nKishin Douji stared into Leo's eyes and then glanced at Cat. He wanted to say something, but he changed his mind. Instead, he continued with his story.\n\"At the moment, Overlord Devourer's forces surround the Void Tree and monopolize the area. From what I heard from Eleanor's minions, those guys attempted to eat the tree, but the tree fought back. Well, they're stupid enough to pick a fight with the hands that helped them.\"\n\"In short, they have a better prey.\" Leo summarized.\n\"Yes. That's why we shouldn't create another planet eater and get their attention! Just hurry and remove that seedling!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo closed his eyes and was about to remove the seed. But then, he remembered the time when he listened to Hua Jiashan during the mushroom incident.\nHe hated being manipulated. In addition, Kishin Douji seemed like he was hiding something.\nMimicking a certain LOTR meme, Leo's face looked similar to Maxim Baldry's in the movie.\n\"No…\"\n\"YOU!!\"\nLeo spat on the spiritual heart, accelerating its growth.\n\"Unfortunately, sir. My name is Florida Man. I am CHAOS! WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY!\"\n\"YOU MANIAC!!\"\nRUMBLE\nThe heart rapidly expanded its reach. Instantly, the entire mountain became soul stones, and the soil turned dark.\nAlthough Leo sounded crazy, he immediately pulled the heart off the ground before the expansion could reach the town. He stored the heart in his inventory and brightly grinned.\n\"Just kidding. Done!\"\n\"…\"",

      "content": "Chapter 315 Florida Man Discovers Backyard Guest: Killer Whale Taking a Vacation from the Ocean!\n?Chapter 315 – Florida Man Discovers Backyard Guest: Killer Whale Taking a Vacation from the Ocean!\nIn the deepest void, known as the Abyssal Star Sector, the former territory of Kishin Douji was located there. However, his solar system was replaced by a galactic entity – The Void Tree.\nThe Void Tree was a giant semi-transparent purple tree floating in the middle of the void. It had already grown five times larger than what Kishin Douji had witnessed before.\nThe tree trunk was straight and smooth like a refined cylinder, but the top of the tree split into branches, which sprouted countless rainbow triangle leaves. Each was as large as Earth's total flat surface area.\nThose were void leaves that Kishin Douji had mentioned. They were the tickets to the higher realm that the Void Principality had advertised.\nOn the branches of Void Tree, a million sparkling crystals of various sizes glittered, drawing anyone who had the opportunity to see them closer. However, nobody got the chance to admire them.\nSurrounding the Void Tree were a thousand whales, which swam in the void. They had a hundred eyeballs. Each was two billion times bigger than the Solar System's Sun. In addition, their savage mouths were so wide that they could swallow any star whole, except for the Void Tree.\nThe space whales were known as the Planet Eaters. They were the mutated neutron stars, which absorbed enough Qi and waste from thoughtless cultivators and entities in the universe. They gained sentient and copied the emotions of every lifeform they ate.\nAmong the planet eaters, one was larger than the rest. It was as large as a billion-star galaxy. Unlike the others, its entire body was made of countless fleshy masses, animal limbs, eyeballs of various sizes, and crimson tentacles. This anomalous being nested on top of the Void Tree, claiming it as its home.\nThe giant planet eater was none other than Overlord Planet Devourer, one of the three transcended beings in the universe other than Leo and Priscilla.\nSuddenly, Planet Devourer opened one of its million eyes and woke up from slumber. The eyeball shifted left and right as if it were searching for something.\n\"Was it my imagination?\" Planet Devourer uttered.\nHe sensed the shift in the current timeline. His predicted future was off by 0.1%, causing some of the future images in his mind to glitch.\n\"Who was it that interfered with my future? My chance of ascension should be 100%, not 99.9%. Priscilla and Sieg are supposed to fight each other to the death. Eleanor should have killed Ellen and stolen her body. After she consumes Esen, she would have ascended as the fourth transcended being… Ah, right. That information was outdated. How long have I been sleeping?\"\nThat prediction was over 50,000 years ago. He had been sleeping for a long time after he drove off Priscilla and Sieg's coalition forces.\nPlanet Devourer suffered from a similar symptom as any human cultivator. He was too absorbed in cultivation that he forgot about time. To him, repeating his Qi circulation was so addictive that he never wished to end it.\nStill, that 0.1% change made him hesitate. Even if it was a one-in-a-thousand chance, the probability of him failing to ascend was too high.\nUnless he could guarantee his ascension, he couldn't sleep peacefully.\nParanoid, Planet Devourer closed his eyes and activated his ultimate system ability – The Akashic Record System.\nDING\n<Please input your command.>\n\"Recalculate my chance of ascending to the higher realm!>\nDING\n<You have a 99.8% chance of entering the higher realm!>\nThe probability dropped again. This alarmed the overlord.\n\"Which factor or variable contributes to my failure of ascension?\"\nDING\n<Individuals who possess at least one true entity fate crystal have emerged.>\nThe million eyes of the grotesque whale snapped open. It bellowed in anger.\n<The following individuals are qualified as variables…>\n<1. Overlord P. *Error* Data Redacted Due to True Fate Crystal.>\n<2. Overlord E. *Error* Data Redacted Due to True Fate Crystal.>\n<3. Overlord L. *Error* Data Redacted Due to True Fate Crystal.>\n<4. Overlord S. *Error* Data Redacted Due to True Fate Crystal.>\nUpon seeing the list, Planet Devourer narrowed his eyes. He spread his sense throughout the universe and read everybody's karma. The past events of the universe flashed in his mind as if he saw through countless memories of fallen souls.\nThen, he saw the series of events involving Eleanor, who contributed to the changes the most. Then, the face of a male divine elf appeared.\nHe was none other than Aslan Ariel, who ensured the safety of his two children. However, the faces of the children blurred as if a higher power interfered with his calculation and memory reading.\nAlthough Planet Devourer couldn't see their faces, he could still read someone else's memory to learn of their identities. He started following the movements of Aslan and Eleanor, whom he could read.\nThe names of two individuals came up – Leonardo Ariel and Simba Ariel.\n\"Heh. Akashic Record, is Overlord L. and Overlord S., by chance, Overlord Leonardo Ariel and Overlord Simba Ariel?\" Planet Devourer asked the system.\n<There is no evidence of those individuals being the same person.>\n\"Of course! True Entity Fate Crystals probably conceal their identity. Even you can't confirm it. But how about this? What are the chances that those people I listed are the same person?\"\n<The probability is 75%>\nThe percentage was not low, but it was not that high either. Despite the uncertainty, Planet Devourer was certain that they might be connected.\nAs he couldn't rely on the true entity fate crystal's system to reveal all information regarding other competitors, he could only rely on his ability. He continued calculating karma to find the truth.\nPlanet Devourer also changed his approach. Instead of following people around Simba and Leo, he spied on Priscilla and Sieg.\nAgain, as both transcendent beings possessed true entity fate crystals, there wasn't much to see. However, he witnessed the collapse of Fate Stadium and the brief moment when Sieg was killed by Priscilla.\n\"Aha! As I've predicted, they indeed killed each other in the end. But that's weird. One of them was supposed to be half-dead, but Priscilla are still in good condition. What did…\"\nPlanet Devourer rewinded the video-like event memory to see what went wrong.\nThen, a man with a blurred face came into the picture. He briefly made contact with Sieg, and they fought. At first, Sieg almost caught the person, but the man was too slippery. After a couple exchanges, Sieg fell into the man's trap and suffered a critical injury. Then, Priscilla ambushed Sieg and stole his fate crystals.\n\"Ah, so this was why the calculation went wrong. Priscilla survives the ordeal, and she is healthy enough to pose a minor threat to me. Well, I just need to get rid of her, and my chance should be 100% again!\"\nPlanet Devourer burst into laughter. He simulated the future without Priscilla in his mind. While he was at it, he asked the system to help him calculate.\n\"What if I hunt down [Overlord P] and kill her first? What would my chance of ascension be?\"\n<After the variable 'Overlord P' is removed from the calculation, your chance of ascension is 99.9999999%>\n\"Ha! As I thought!\"\nPlanet Devourer was relieved. Still, the probability was not 100%.\n\"So, the other variables are insignificant. Even if the three combine forces, they only have one in a billion chance to defeat me. I can just remove one more and ensure my safety. But then again, I should focus on Priscilla first. She's the strongest variable after all.\"\nPlanet Devourer slowly rose from the top of the void tree. He bellowed and commanded everybody.\n\"ASSEMBLE TROOPS! WE WILL LAUNCH A FULL-SCALE ASSAULT ON THE PHOENIX STAR SECTOR! THOSE BIRDS ARE DESTINED TO BE EXTINCT!\"\nThe planet eaters jolted and gazed at their lord. They all turned around and swam in one direction in unison.\nAfter sending his subordinates to attack Priscilla's territory, Planet Devourer smirked and closed his eyes. He used another ability of the Akashic Record System.\n\"Play me the future events when I and Priscilla fight. I want to see the results!\"\nDING\nA thousand video clips of their fight played in Planet Devourer's mind.\nOut of a thousand different fights, Planet Devourer came out as a victor 999 times. However, there was one future that he lost. The video was also glitchy and incomprehensible.\nPlanet Devourer opened his eyes and frowned. This wasn't the first time that glitched prediction appeared. Whenever it showed up, it implied that other variables intercepted that future.\n\"So, she got some help from other variables? That's annoying. But she is destined to die by my hands. Even if she manages to win, she can't possibly kill me! I have void leaves inside me! I can't possibly be killed by another transcendent being! HAHAHAHAHA!!\"\nPlanet Devourer kicked the void tree and followed his subordinates, swimming the void toward his destination.\nBut suddenly, a faint signal from a faraway star pricked Planet Devourer's skin. One of his eyes shifted and gazed in the direction by reflex.\nThe eyeball squinted and transmitted the sense to the overlord's soul. Then, Planet Devourer stopped on his track and turned around in confusion.\n\"Huh? A newborn planet eater?\"\nFor a minute, Planet Devourer hesitated. As his kin could never reproduce, new blood was more precious than fate crystals. However, he already ordered his troops to move. It would be illogical to personally travel across the universe and bring back a newborn baby at the moment.\n\"Tsk. I'll just send one of the soldiers to fetch it, then. Hey, number 47. Come here!\"\nHOOOOM\nOne of the eyeball whales turned around and stopped in front of Planet Devourer. The karmic sovereign monster beamed his boss with a heinous smile, showing ten thousand piercing sharp fangs full of cavities and grimes.\n\"See over there?\" Planet Devourer pointed in the general direction of what he had sensed earlier.\nThe whale nodded and continued smiling.\n\"There's a newborn kin over there. Go fetch the new blood and come back to join the troops. Make sure to bring back some herb stars for the baby to eat. Remember, the more population on the stars, the better. Babies need memories and emotions of the living to grow.\"\nThe whale nodded again. He wagged his giant tail and swam through the void at light speed, vanishing into the distance.\nAfter sending his servant off, Planet Devourer turned around and followed his troops.\n\"Hahahaha! It's over, Priscilla. Your fate crystals can't help you anymore! Once I'm done with your population, I'll mutate you into a seedbed for our kin. Then, we can populate this universe!\"\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, at the surface of a floating platform in the void, a giant naked woman sat in front of a divine elf, who was seated on a couch.\nEllen, the current queen of Divine Elf and the president of the DEZNUTS council had a private meeting with her new ally – Overlord Priscilla.\nNext to Ellen, two entities sat on the same couch. They were Overlord Lucky and Overlord Xiaomao, who also formed a truce with the Divine Elf after the collapse of the Fate Stadium.\nPriscilla gazed at the three. She smiled at Ellen.\n\"How was the true entity fate crystal? Is it useful?\"\nEllen's expression grimaced. She understood the weight of the treasure.\nAlthough unwilling, Ellen adhered to the promise, \"As promised, the Divine Elf will cooperate with the Phoenix Race. We will join forces to fight Planet Eaters and secure the Void Tree together.\"\n\"Good. Now, about you two…\"\nPriscilla gazed at Overlord Xiaomao, who was an elderly fisherman.\n\"Overlord Xiaomao, would you like one of the true entity fate crystals as well? I can guarantee its usefulness.\"",

Ohio Man Claims He's Just Making a Protein Shake after Workout.\n?Chapter 316 – Hungry Killer Whale Mistakes Ohio Man as Takeout Special. Ohio Man Claims He's Just Making a Protein Shake after Workout.\nFlorida Domain\nAfter converting the entire mountain range into a soul stone mine, Leo stopped messing around. He elevated a square kilometer of land and opened his online shopping system.\nAll system buildings were available for purchase. Leo handpicked the basic infrastructure-related items first.\nA water supply system and electric generators were implemented first as they were necessary for the local population. Instantly, waterworks buildings occupied the land.\nTwo electric pylons stood at the edge of the land. Gigantic water curing tanks emerged. At the same time, it created a large water tunnel system underneath until it reached the nearest water source, aka the sea.\nIn front of the drainage tubes, a small array prevented small fish, sea creatures, and microorganisms from entering the factory. They got stuck in a transparent barrier and were pushed away by the current.\nThe pylon towers drained Qi in the environment to generate electricity, which the water curing factory required. The pumps absorbed seawater into the facility, where the desalination took place. Electric Qi from the pylon towers hasten the chemical reactions, extracting salt and substances from the seawater.\nWithin five seconds after the factory's creation, raw water was poured into the first storage tank. Then, the water underwent another curing process, making it safe for consumption.\nLeo observed the automated facility and distributed status points to a few attributes. The facilities and equipment were upgraded, and the tank capacity was enhanced. 20 mannequins rose up from the ground and began managing the facilities and water tanks.\nAfter setting up the basic infrastructure for the mortal town, Leo elevated more terrain and paved concrete roads, outlining the future city plan of this district. The roads extended to the expanding slum area and connected with their small streets.\nLeo didn't stop there. He explored the logistical items in his shopping system and found an underground tunnel structure.\n\"Aha!\"\nHe giggled and waved his hands, strengthening the ground underneath the slum district. Then, he inserted a new system structure under the town.\nRUMBLE\nAn underground tunnel road manifested. The excess dirt, stones, and minerals transformed into reinforced pillars and walls, stabilizing the expressway.\nLeo finalized the creation. He linked the entrance of the expressway to the main road of his shopping mall domain. The two roads automatically adjusted and connected together.\n\"Whoops. Underground drainages. I forgot.\"\nAs if Leo was possessed by Lloyd Frontera 'The Great Engineer', he meticulously adjusted the structures and ensured the safety and stability of the passageway. However, his expression wasn't as ugly as the original.\nAn hour passed. Leo wiped his face with a wet towel and admired the empty road.\n\"Alright. The logistic highway is completed. Now, I just invest in the general store, a warehouse, and other business ventures.\"\nLeo rubbed his hands. His fingers moved like professional gamers in LOL tournaments, pressing a hundred buttons and purchasing a thousand items.\nRUMBLE\nA humble one-story shopping mall was erected in the middle of the empty land, 200 meters away from the main road. The front empty area turned into an open parking lot.\nBehind the mall, a large warehouse appeared and linked with the shopping mall. As usual, mannequins emerged from the warehouse and assumed the role of the warehouse workers.\nThe store also got its employees. 20 automatons and five supervisor golems appeared to manage the store.\nRUMBLE The inaugural upload of this chapter took place via /n/ov/el/b/in.\n20 high-rise condominiums manifested around the block, surrounding the shopping mall. Each came with a parking lot building, allowing the residents to own land vehicles. Every building also received basic electricity and water supply from the factory, west of the second shopping mall.\nBesides the skyscrapers, Leo purchased pre-made empty townhouses, just in case the new residents didn't like living in a tall building. Those houses were close to the main roads, which could be renovated into small stores in the future.\nFor the finishing touch, Leo planted small signboards and manually wrote the same sentences.\n[FOR SALE! CONTACT FLORIDA MAN FOR DETAILS!]\nLeo patted his hands and muttered in satisfaction.\n\"Done!\"\nThe crowd gazed at the new structures in astonishment. Tang Xuan and Tang Tian gawked at the condominiums and drooled.\nBoth men had visited Leo's eastern hotel before. They knew how modern and comfortable the beds were, and they were envious of the new residents.\n\"S-Senior Florida Man,\" Tang Tian rubbed his hands. \"Although we have already reached the celestial rank, can some of us live here?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and pointed at the shopping complex's building, where another condominium stood on top of the mall.\n\"You geezers can't live here. If you want a condo room to live in, you can only buy a room and live there. Of course, each room contains a WHOLE ANOTHER WOLRD inside. Therefore, buying the entire room can be pricey. But if you don't mind living in a smaller quarter, I can allocate a place for you to establish a manor or a mansion inside that condo-verse.\"\n\"…Condo-verse?\"\n\"You'll understand when you see those places.\" Leo sighed and changed the subject, \"Cat! Come here!\"\nCat jolted as she didn't expect Leo to call her over. She rushed to her father.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nLeo patted Cat's head, \"No nom-nom at the moment. But it is time for you to learn how to earn some cash on your own. From now on, you will be the guardian of the second shopping mall over here.\"\nCat didn't actually understand her role. She tilted her head.\n\"Then, can I get some nom-nom?\"\nLeo explained, \"You will receive food from the logistic officers every morning, afternoon, evening, and midnight. However, you will have to work to get those free food.\"\n\"EEEEEEHHHH?!\"\nLike any child, Cat didn't understand the adult concept and why she should work. If she wanted food, she could easily hunt some stray cockatrices, thunder caimans, or mad cows at the cow level.\n\"What's the point of working for Nom-Nom, meow?\"\nLeo deeply sighed, \"If you work here, you will be worshiped as the local lord. The townsmen will naturally bring offerings for you in exchange for your protection. All you need to do is sit on top of the shopping mall and prevent mishaps from happening. For example, if an idiot tries to rob the store, you have the duty to catch and eat the thieves. Got it?\"\n\"OH! So thieves can be NOM-NOMed?\"\n\"Correct!\"\n\"I love this job! Let me work and Nom-Nom everybody, meow!\"\n\"Hey. You can't just eat anybody. Let them steal something first, then you can eat. Don't eat if they don't steal anything, okay? Also, some of those mortals might buy something from the shopping mall. Those guys aren't thieves. You need to know how to differentiate them.\"\n\"How, meow?\"\n\"Simple! If they walk out of the store while holding plastic bags full of items from the store, they are not thieves. But if they secretly store our items in their storage rings and leave without paying, you catch that moron and eat them. Leave the rings behind, alright?\"\n\"EASY, MEOW!\"\nThe bystanders sweated profusely while they listened to the conversation. Their blood pressure spiked as they grew concerned over Cat's education and her future antics. At this rate, this little dryad would evolve into a bloodthirsty lunatic like her parent.\nLeo clapped his hands and flew back to the Soul Stone Mountain. He then assigned his followers another task.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time for me to announce the highlight of this trip. As you can see, we have a WHOLE mountain range full of soul stones. I think you know what I'm thinking, right?\"\nEverybody nodded and gulped.\nLeo clarified their new tasks, \"For starters, let's start mining this mountain! Grab a pickaxe, a shovel, a dynamite, or… your fist! Let's start hammering this mountain and break it into smaller rocks! Whatever you mined, you can keep half! Make sure to bring back half of what you mined to me when we're done here!\"\nThe crowd cheered. Everybody scattered throughout the mountain range.\nLeo crossed his arms and watched how his followers displayed their secret techniques, attacking the Soul Stone mountain range and breaking them into smaller pieces. He wasn't worried that he wouldn't get all the cultivation resources from here.\nIn fact, he wished for his followers to get stronger ASAP. With these soul stones, they would have enough cultivation resources to boost their inner Qi to a higher level.\nLeo thought of the deity stage. According to the universal standard, this realm was the most important. Only the deities with the strongest foundation and largest dantian capacity had the chance to advance to the sage rank.\nThe sage stage was where karma strings and mandates came into play. Their power was enough to erase a solar system or a million deities with a thought.\nLeo regretted that he didn't learn this power when he first arrived in this world. His life would have been a lot easier if he had known the basic power of the sage realm.\nAs Leo fell into a deep thought, he recalled that he had encountered Sieg once. Therefore, his system already recorded the transcendent being, and he could summon his clone to fight in the simulation mode.\n\"Right. I should start training too. I need to learn how to use my power as a transcendent.\"\nLeo closed his eyes and meditated in mid-air. He sank his consciousness to his dantian universe.\n.\n.\nRUMBLE\nPlanet Eater Number 47, or PEN47, was a karmic sovereign. Although he ate enough stars to gain sentient, his intelligence was still the same as a teenager, minus the sexual drive.\nThe monster only had one hobby – Eating! His diet consisted of gas stars and habitable planets. As for his favorite food, it was fate crystals!\nAfter receiving a direct order from its overlord, PEN47 leisurely swam the universe at light speed, planning to snack on random stars on the way. As a result, his traveling speed was slower than usual.\nAfter flying for an hour, its stomach growled. Because the void tree was out of its reach, it could no longer steal the tree's Qi to sustain its hunger.\nStarved and famished, PEN47 picked up the speed. Instantly, it traveled across a galaxy and arrived at Leo's galaxy.\nColorful stars became visible. PEN47 salivated, unable to contain its hunger anymore.\nHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!\nIt roared and dashed toward the nearest helium star. By opening its mouth wide, it swallowed the entire gas star whole!\nThe gas exploded upon making contact with its digestive fluid and flame inside. The monster burped in satisfaction, but it hadn't had enough.\nIt wanted more.\nThe monster looked around to find another star to eat. This time, it wanted a solid star or a planet with many plants.\nAs it looked around, the corner of its eyes spotted a glowing dragon at a distance. Upon paying closer attention, it didn't look natural as the entire body of the dragon was made of minerals and man-made plate armor.\nPEN47 smirked. It thought that it found the first challenger.\nHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!\nWithout hesitation, PEN47 charged at the golden dragon.",

The Geckos Are Florida Men in Gecko Clothing.\n﻿﻿Chapter 317 – Ohio Man Raises Giant Geckos to Surprise His Brother. The Geckos Are Florida Men in Gecko Cosplay.\nIn the dragon dreadnaught mothership's captain cabin, a half-naked man had been meditating after the night activity while his wife, Ester, fell asleep in bed.\nSimba's body glittered in gold. His side muscles and back were covered in gold dragon scales while white glowing lines formed a tribal insignia on his chest.\nThe symbol resembled the head of a dragon in Western legends. Although it was just a white outline, the tattoo looked alive. Moreover, it emitted the unique aura of gold Qi, which was a variant of the virgin yang Qi.\nThe gold Qi was not as pure as Leo's virgin yang, and it was incompatible with virgin yin. In exchange for the disadvantage, gold Qi's nature became oppressive and domineering instead of the usual characteristics – Soft, holy, yet powerful.\nSimba slowly opened his eyes and gazed at his palms. He clenched them, creating a disturbance in the air. Golden light radiated from his skin and palms.\nDING\n<Congratulations! You safely advanced to the transcendent realm!>\n<You are currently a level-one transcendent being. To grow stronger, you must cultivate luck and gather life force from materials, minerals, and living beings. Every time you obtain or digest a droplet of luck essence, your level will increase by one.>\n<It is recommended that you accumulate life force until your lifespan reaches the system ceiling. Then, spend all of them to automatically acquire the luck essence. If you manage to spend at least two billion years of lifespan, you can easily reach the pinnacle of the transcendent realm, which is level 10.>\n<To advance to the higher realm, you must acquire a karmic fate crystal to unseal the limiter, posed by the creator of this universe. You can also substitute a karmic fate crystal with the essence of the void tree.>\n<Currently, only one Void Tree exists in the universe, and it is protected by another VERIFIED PLAYER.>\nSimba thoroughly read the messages twice. Five minutes later, he closed the message screen and glanced at his aura.\n\"So, this is the power of a transcendent…\"\nBy just looking around, Simba could see countless karma threads in this universe. He could also see through walls and the dreadnaught battleship.\nSimba's pupils flickered like a camera lens. He could see everything in the current galaxy as if he observed it from above. Moreover, he could see and hear everybody from the Yan Empire Planet.\nIt was a weird feeling. He felt like he was a god who observed every living being at once. His brain was overloaded with information, causing a slight discomfort.\nThen, he witnessed a scene in a hotel building in Leo's domain. There was a teenage boy and a naked pretty lady on a bed, touching each other.\n\"S-Sister Ivy! I-I'm feeling weird down there.\"\n\"Don't worry, Marc. It's a natural reaction. Just lie down.\"\nInstantly, Simba looked away as if he had accidentally witnessed a scene on the planet. As he was not into peeping, he was disgusted by the scene.\nAs Simba looked away, his focus shifted to the outer space. He sensed the presence of a million stars.\nEvery place contained different substances and minerals. However, most of them had the same foundation as the stars in his dantian universe. Even the cores of every star were identical.\nWitnessing the truth of the universe, Simba was certain. He finally figured out the secret of this void.\n\"Heh. I guess we're living in the Matrix after all. This ain't new.\"\nSimba let out a long sigh, spreading gold Qi into the ventilation system. His strands of gold Qi spread everywhere and caught microorganisms on the way. Dormant bacteria, dead cells, and space bugs were entangled by the golden strings and glowed in golden light.\n10 seconds passed. The mutated microorganism creatures evolved and grew larger. The tiniest beings transformed into gold geckos, which started crawling toward Simba by instinct.\nSimba also sensed them. He whispered.\n\"Gather in the cafeteria.\"\nThe geckos paused and turned around in unison. Although they didn't know where or what the destination was, they followed the golden light without hesitation. Without a minute, a thousand geckos swarmed the empty cafeteria hall.\nThe thread of gold Qi then entered their bodies. Transparent souls from Simba's dantian universe exited from his body and entered the creatures, possessing them.\nThe small animals evolved once again. A thousand souls regenerated their fleshly bodies and emerged.\nThe new creatures were humanoid dragonewts. Their dragon faces and skin still retained their ancestor's nature, but their two legs were strong enough to support their vertical physique. After standing on their three-joint legs, they moved their arms and warmed up their elbows.\nOne of the gold dragonewt opened and closed its four-fingered claws. He inspected the thick fingers and hardened scales for a moment.\nNext to the gold dragonewt, a black dragonewt waved its dragon tail up and down. The sharp spikes on its back extended and shortened as his spinal cord was capable of hiding and extending a hundred pieces of bones at once.\nFLAP\nAll dragonewts gradually warmed up their bodies and flapped their wings. Because of their large movements, chairs and tables tumbled and were pushed to the walls.\nThis group of dragonewts wasn't the only one on the ship. Another batch of geckos swarmed another large area and evolved into dragonewts as well. More souls from Simba's dantian universe came out and populated the dreadnaught battleship.\nAfter getting the senses of their bodies back, the dragonewts exited the cafeterias and the spawning zone. Gold dragons rushed to the bridge, the engine rooms, and the weaponry operating rooms. Black dragons gathered at the hangar area and equipped themselves with the guns and arms in the armory.\nThe gold and the black dragons weren't the only population there. Every 100 new dragonewts was one white dragonewt. The white dragon-men also entered the hangar, but they boarded battleships and vessels on the mothership. They entered the bridge area and immediately sat on the captain's seat, assuming the leader role of each warship.\nRed dragonewts also appeared after the first spawning batch. They followed the white dragonewts to their new ships and served as crewmates. Several pink ones also emerged, but they remained in the cafeterias, infirmaries, and residential areas as support units.\nAlthough everybody seemed to be systematic, a few defects appeared as well. One of them was a rainbow dragonewt, who ignored everybody and strolled into the dreadnaught mothership's main deck. He calmly fetched a red coat and put it on. He smacked his left chest with his right fist as if he was saluting something. But the next words out of his mouth disappointed Simba.\n\"SASAGEYO! SASAGEYO!\"\nThat guy actually sang a popular song in the past.\nSimba saw everything. He was speechless.\n'How did that idiot come to life? And why the hell is he the strongest man inside my universe!?'\nThe rainbow dragonewt's name was Cheese. Ironically, his behavior resembled Leo as if they shared the same brain. He was also a karmic sovereign, whose strength almost caught up to Simba.\nThat was not all. Simba didn't know how but this guy inherited a fragment of his entity fate crystal, which contributed to his abnormal growth and defective intelligence.\nCurious about the guy, Simba exited his chamber and visited the rainbow dragonewt on the deck.\nThe rainbow dragonewt noticed his master's presence. He turned around and saluted.\n\"Creator!\"\nSimba nodded at Cheese. He gazed at the void.\n\"How is the air in the higher dimension?\"\n\"Terrible, creator! I can only sense death here. I don't think this place's creator is as good as you.\"\n\"Right.\" Simba agreed. He didn't sense any presence of the universe's owner. On the contrary, it seemed abandoned. \"The total karma rivers around here is only… three at most? I can't sense other rivers.\"\n\"In short, the owner of this universe is a major realm weaker than you, right?\"\n\"Probably.\"\n\"Then, you can become the strongest creator in this realm, right?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Huh? Why?\" Cheese was surprised.\n\"My elder brother is a lot stronger than me. There are also others that are stronger than him. We're not the top dogs here.\"\n\"…Wow.\"\nInstead of being disappointed, Cheese was excited. He turned around and gazed into the distance, where he had sensed a weird Qi fluctuation earlier.\n\"So, how can we get stronger here, creator?\"\nSimba detected something from a distance. He followed Cheese's gaze and found an incoming space creature.\nIt was a massive whale, whose size was bigger than the Earth's entire Solar System. Moreover, it was swimming toward their dreadnaught mothership at full speed.\nNot allowing the whale to get closer, Simba transformed into a gold dragonewt. However, his face didn't transform into a dragon head. His scales grew and molded into a horned helmet.\nCheese was astonished by the transformation. As his idol showed him something good, he followed Simba and rushed toward the whale as well.\n.\n.\n\"…\"\nAfter meditating for a few minutes, Leo raised his eyebrows and looked at the sky. His skin itched for an unknown reason.\nWhile Leo was absentminded, Hua Jiashan returned from the Soul Stone mountain range, which already vanished from the area.\n\"Lord Florida Man! Please check the gains and allocate my earnings. I've collected a lot!\"\nLeo didn't pay attention to Hua Jiashan. He muttered and glanced at Kishin Douji.\n\"Do you feel it?\"\nKishin Douji was puzzled for a moment. He looked up and scanned through the void to make sure. Instantly, he picked up the obnoxious aura of his nemesis.\n\"Planet Eater! Planet Eater is really coming here! This is your fault, Florida Man!\" Kishin panicked.\n\"Yeah, nah. It's just a fish!\"\n\"That fish alone is no longer the Planet Eater that I fought in the past! I can tell that it's stronger than your run-of-the-mill karmic sovereign! Do you sense it? It should have over 20 karma rivers inside its dantian. This doesn't include the void tree's leaves that boost its durability and destructive force! If it gets serious, this entire solar system will be erased instantly!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He tilted his neck from side to side and stretched his arms.\n\"I'll show you something nice.\"\nWHOOSH\nLeo vanished. He teleported toward the incoming foe.\n.\n.\nlightsnοvεl WHOOSH\nWHOOSH\n\"Hoh?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nCoincidentally, Simba and Leo teleported and appeared next to each other. They were 100,000km away from the whale.\n\"What are you doing here, bro?\" Asked Leo.\nSimba smirked, \"Probably the same reason as you.\"\n\"Oh, whale hunting?\"\n\"Yeah, whale hunting.\"\n\"It's illegal, though. Do you have a certification?\"\n\"Pfft. At this day and age?\"",

Is that your second phase?\" Leo teased Simba for his gold dragon transformation.\n\"This ain't soul games. I'm not some boss monster.\"\n\"But it's true. We ARE boss monsters in games if we talk about our current situation. We are inside the Metrix, so we are pretty much digital numbers.\"\n\"Don't remind me something depressing. I've just reached the transcendent stage. I need to stabilize my mental power.\"\n\"Heh. If mental power translates to power, I would have degraded to a muscle-tempering stage mortal. Why so serious?\"\nSimba had a headache. In the past, Leo wasn't this mental; He was a bright and smart boy who earned his respect and admiration. On the contrary, the present Leo was a loose cannon.\nCheese finally caught up with his creator. When he arrived, he found Leo floating next to Simba.\nAt first, Cheese was on guard. But when he noticed the pattern of Leo's rainbow aura, he sensed an unexplainable connection between him and Leo.\n\"Sir, you.\" Cheese greeted Leo.\n\"Hmm?\" Leo turned around.\n\"You… You're a good man!\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nLeo wryly smiled. He glanced at the karma string of Cheese, which connected to Simba. Realizing his origins, Leo pointed at the guy and asked his brother.\n\"Care for the introduction? Is he yours?\"\nSimba deeply sighed and crossed his arms. He looked at Cheese and was about to introduce him to Leo.\nHOOOOOOOOOOM!\nUnfortunately, PEN47 was already 1,000 kilometers away. It would take no more than a split second to reach them.\nSimba turned around and got into a combat stance. He gathered gold Qi around his arms, preparing to strike or parry the planet eater's incoming attack. Cheese also spread his wings and manifested a karma river into the real world, creating a stream of endless force.\n\"Eh, you guys are overreacting.\"\nLeo picked his nose. He extracted a small piece of booger and flickered it toward the whale.\nHowever, the booger was made from Leo's skin and a drop of his blood. As soon as Leo triggered it, the small piece of flesh transformed into the core of a magnetar, aka an exotic type of neutron star.\nThe magnetar's core traveled toward the whale at 1,000 times the speed of light!\nPEN47 sensed it and mocked Leo in his mind.\n'A magnetar? I have eaten a dozen black holes and dark matter before. This little magnet core can't do anything to me!'\nWithout hesitation, PEN47 swallowed it.\nBut as soon as it entered his stomach, its magnetic force erupted. The core's gravity increased and matched that of a black hole. Then, it pushed the inner stomach of PEN47 and dragged him along with its power and speed.\nSuddenly getting dragged backward, PEN47 widened his eyes. He bellowed.\n\"DAMN PUNY STAR CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO ME!\"\nHis stomach tightened and squeezed the newly evolved magnetar. Unfortunately, that was his mistake.\nLeo, who had been controlling the magnetar, scratched the tip of his fingers and opened his mouth. He bit empty air and chewed the void. Although nothing was inside his mouth, something else was being crushed.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow! Get nom-nom taxed, motherhumper!\" Leo laughed.\nThe magnetar in PEN47's stomach sucked the flesh and fluid into its mass like a black hole devouring passing-by asteroids. Moreover, the planet eater's soul was also affected.\n\"H-HOW?! IMPOSSIBLE!\"\nPEN47 shrank by 50% within five seconds while the glowing core inside him expanded and matched his size. Eventually, the star got bigger than the planet eater and made him bloated.\nPOP\nUnable to figure out what hit him, the rainbow star broke out of PEN47's stomach and absorbed every drop of flesh and blood into its surface. Even PEN47's soul was not an exception.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"W-What?\"\nSimba and Cheese were perplexed by the development. They gazed at the rainbow magnetar, which consumed the planet eater from the inside.\nThe star's trajectory and speed gradually changed. It defied the momentum and the laws of physics as it suddenly paused and flew back toward Leo.\n\"DODGE!\" Simba warned Leo and Cheese.\nCheese teleported away without a second thought while Simba reached out to Leo to grab him. However, after exerting his full strength, Simba failed to make Leo budge an inch.\n\"Relax, Simba. It's not like that thing can do anything to me.\" Leo snickered and raised his finger.\nThe gigantic star headed toward Leo and rapidly shrank. It turned into a glowing candy, which got stuck on his fingertip.\nLeo put the rainbow candy in his mouth and chewed it in glee. His teeth crushed the former magnetic star into smaller pieces while his saliva instantly melted them.\nIt tasted like spicy soda.\nDING\n<You have obtained one entity fate crystal.>\n<You have obtained three heavenly fate crystals.>\n<You have obtained 30 sky fate crystals.>\n<You have obtained 318 earth fate crystals.>\n<You have obtained 10 leaves of Void Tree.>\nEating a planet eater's soul had its perks. Leo smirked and admired his gain.\n'With this amount of fate crystals, I should be able to make multiple Qi generators or exchange them for some high-tier battleships or colonies. Also… Void Tree again?'\nLeo pondered what he should do with the tree leaves. He planned to inspect it when he got home.\nMeanwhile, Simba looked at Leo in disbelief. While frowning, he asked his brother, \"What did you do?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Just testing a new skill.\"\n\"A new skill?\"\n\"Yeah, I kinda copied this skill from Eleanor, actually.\"\n\"HAH?!\" Simba removed his helmet and stared at Leo's face in shock, \"YOU LEARN FROM WHO?!\"\n\"Chill, man. Chill…\"\nLeo deeply sighed and explained how he learned this skill.\n.\n.\nSeveral minutes earlier, Leo's consciousness was inside his dantian universe, operating the simulation mode. Taking advantage of the time dilation, he trained his heart out.\nAs Leo realized that his foundation was shaky and unstable, he fought every cultivator in the list at the max difficulty 10,000 times each. Mortals, immortals, deities, sages, and entities, nobody was an exception.\nBut when Leo fought clones whose original strength was at the karmic sovereign level or stronger, he started losing. Because of the max difficulty, their clones had a higher cultivation base, had more skills, and possessed superior artifacts, which made the fights almost impossible to win.\nThe most troublesome foes were his father, Aslan Ariel. In the past, the clones came out as an entity. But after Leo had learned more skills from other weaker cultivators, the clone of his father also received the upgrade bonuses, boosting his strength to the karmic sovereign realm.\nThat was not all. Even Elearnor's clone, who was supposed to be only a karmic sovereign, received the same buffs. The clones emerged as transcendent beings instead of karmic sovereigns.\nAs for Sieg's clones, it was out of Leo's reach. At the max difficulty, Sieg's cultivation base was pumped to a stage that Leo had never reached before – The Singularity Realm.\nWithout a choice, Leo retrained his basics by fighting entities, whose strength was upgraded to the karmic sovereign realm first. He exploited the blood bomb tactic and managed to copy their abilities.\nThen, he came across several unique abilities and daos, which focused on stars in their dantian universes. This dao transformed a dark matter, a black hole, a pulsar star, a magnetar, or a neutron star into a weapon. Depending on each star's nature, Qi type, and personality of the star users, their nature varied.\nLeo got inspiration from this dao. He tried mixing his flesh and blood into a summoned star and used it as a bomb. The result exceeded his imagination as it erased one of his galaxies in the universe by accident.\nAfter regenerating the stars and resurrecting the population, Leo sealed this ability for safety. However, when he thought of Cat, he was enlightened.\nUnfortunately, he didn't have enough time to test this ability. He ended up using it on PEN47 first.\n.\n.\n\"That's the gist of it,\" Leo concluded his explanation after revealing his simulation system abilities.\nThe sparkling eyes of Simba gazed at Leo in admiration. He praised, \"Why couldn't I think of that?! Hold on, doesn't that mean you can freely summon my clones and test my skills?\"\nAgain, Leo shrugged, \"Yes. So?\"\n\"Isn't that cheating? I mean, you can gauge anybody's abilities and copy their skills!\"\n\"Yup! That's why you need multiple entity fate crystals to generate more system abilities!\"\nSimba smacked his forehead. He wished he had known about this 30,000 or 40,000 years ago.\n\"Now, I understand why Fate Stadium Overlord collects so many fate crystals. That's why.\" Simba was enlightened.\n\"Yeah. Come to think of it, how many fate crystals do you have?\"\nSimba counted his fingers and wryly smiled.\n\"One true entity fate, one entity fate, and three heavenly fate…\"\n\"That sucks. Here, use this one.\"\nLeo sank his hand into his chest and pulled out an entity fate crystal from his soul. It was a massive neutron star, emitting a bright silver flame.\nLooking at the weird entity fate crystal, Leo raised his eyebrows, \"Damn, it has already mutated. Never mind, you can have it.\"\n.\nSimba witnessed how Leo nonchalantly shoved his physical hand into the dimension inside his body and pulled out a white sun. His expression turned solemn.\n'I need to be stronger! I can't be content with my current strength!'\nDetermined and motivated to be as strong as Leo, Simba looked at the neutron sun. He also asked about his system.\n\"System, if I consume that, will it grant another system ability?\"\nDING\n<The entity fate crystal in front of you is a mutated one, created by crushing the soul of a karmic sovereign and mixing it together with a regular entity fate crystal. It contains the essences of star cores and the daos of star weaponry.>\n<Back to the question. Yes, it has a 70% chance of granting your wish.>\n\"What about the other 30%?\"\n<There's a 20% chance of getting another wish granted and a 10% chance of getting a random ability.>\n<Please note. No matter what system ability the fate crystal generates, it will be stronger than regular fate crystals. However, its authority will not exceed what a true entity fate crystal has.>\n\"Alright.\"\nSimba flew toward the white sun and bathed in its flame. As it was a gas planet, Simba quickly entered its core and found a small crystal inside.\nUpon touching the crystal, it entered Simba's soul.\nSimba immediately prayed.\n\"I wish I had the same Simulation System that my brother has… I wish I could learn or copy other people's abilities and learn their fight techniques!\"\nDING\nA gold system screen appeared, informing Simba of the result of his wish.\n<Assimilating the entity fate crystal with your soul…>\n<Assimilation completed. A new system has been generated!>\nSimba's consciousness was pulled into his dantian universe. However, instead of being prompted by a clone summoning menu, the system gave him another ability.\n<Please set up an opponent for the simulation mode.>\nThe screen allowed Simba to choose two fighters to fight each other instead of letting him fight a clone.\n'Hmm?!'\nImmediately, Simba noticed the oddity of this system. He could adjust the fighter's cultivation base, gears, and aptitudes. He could even change a mortal into a transcendent being!",

He adjusted their strength variables to the [Full Condition], [Full Potential], and [Max Mastery].\n'Show me what we can potentially do. I want to learn from you.'\nSimba pressed the [Begin] button.\nTwo holograms of the two fighters appeared and initiated the duel. The clone of Simba transformed into a gold dragonewt and charged at Leo.\nThe clone of Leo spread two rainbow phoenix wings behind him and vanished. Simba's clone turned around and threw a punch at the empty void.\nBOOM\nHis fist collided with an invisible dark matter, causing a huge explosion. The hologram of Simba braced the shockwave and threw another punch.\nA golden ray flashed and illuminated the void, revealing the hidden figure of the invisible phoenix.\nThe beam contacted with a dome barrier of the phoenix's domain. Inside the barrier, Leo's revealed his new appearance as a giant phoenix. He flapped his wings and ejected a million rainbow flame feathers.\nThe feathers scattered everywhere in the void and expanded into white suns. The heat and the extreme temperature instantly melted the clone of Simba.\nThe clone of Simba ejected his soul out of his crushed fleshly body. He flew away from the million white suns in the void to recuperate.\nThat was when the clone of Leo dealt the final blow. One of the suns projected a new clone of Leo, who came out with a rainbow flame scythe. He activated a death knight domain and swung it.\nThe soul of Simba's clone was cleaved in half and dissipated into dust!\nDING\n<Simulation has been completed. Result: Leonardo Ariel Wins.>\nSimba dryly laughed. He was impressed by this new system.\n\"It's different from what I've imagined, but this will be useful.\"\nSimba pulled his consciousness back to reality. He gazed at Leo to confirm the usefulness of his new system.\n\"How was it?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Very useful. I can simulate and investigate the abilities of my targets. It was eye-opening.\"\n\"Glad you like it. Now, then. I'll head back to work. I'm a busy man.\"\n\"Take care, Leo.\"\nLeo nodded. He turned around and was about to leave. But then, he remembered that Simba never properly visited his domain.\n\"Say, where are you staying? In that stupid dragon spaceship?\" Leo pointed at the dreadnaught battleship.\n\"Yeah. So?\"\n\"My main system is a kingdom-building one. I can easily get my hands on colonies and good penthouses. Say, if you are bored of ship life, come see me. I'll buy you a house.\"\nSimba was surprised by Leo's sudden offer. The corners of his mouth curved up into a faint smile.\n'Right. He might have changed over the years, but his kind nature is still the same as that time.'\nShowing his brother respect, Simba smirked and lightly slapped Leo's back. Then, he returned to his ship.\nLeo flinched. The impact wasn't heavy, but it almost cracked his spinal cords and his bones. He grumbled and complained.\n\"Dammit, you ingrate! How could you hit me so hard after all I've done to protect you! Fine, no more colony for you! Stay in that stupid yellow snake forever. Humph!\"\nFrustrated, Leo returned to his world. He hoped that the brief fight didn't harm or affect the local people.\n…\nUpon arrival, Leo's followers already finished harvesting the soul stones. They presented their storage rings for Leo to inspect.\nAs promised, Leo took half of their collection. Then, he told the people to publish the new town that he had created.\nThe group dispersed and visited the slum district. Only Cat and Beatrice remained behind.\n\"Time to set up the store. Let's go.\"\n.\n.\nTang Xuan and Tang Tian were quick. They published the news of the newly erected town west of the slum district.\nThe rogue cultivators and the merchants were excited. They sent their representatives to the west to scout the area. Then, they found the modern skyscrapers, freeways, and luxury penthouses along the way.\n\"For sale?\"\n\"I wonder how much…\"\nThe rogue cultivators and merchants gawked at the houses and condominiums in awe. Some of them entered a building and was greeted by the mannequins behind the reception counter.\n\"Hello, sir!\" The mannequins with an office lady attire bowed toward them. Then, she presented the group with a brochure. \"Welcome to the Florida Estate Number 420. We have a total of 666 units for sale. Would you like to see the sample rooms, sir?\"\nOne of an elderly rogue cultivator received a pamphlet brochure and read the content. At first, he couldn't understand the weird scriptures as it was written in English. But after staying inside the building for 10 seconds, the words were automatically translated in his mind.\n\"…Oh, I can read it.\"\nHe laughed and skimmed through the texts. However, when he noticed the price tag, he was shocked.\n\"Wait a second! The cheapest room is… HOW MUCH?!\"\nA receptionist folded her hands in front of her stomach and politely informed him, \"A 300 square feet studio with one bathroom is 20,000 essence stones or 20,000 years of lifespan, sir.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nEverybody was speechless. Most of them barely earned 100 essence stones a month from their side-jobs or family businesses. Procuring 20,000 essence stones out of nowhere was impossible for them.\nStill, a few merchants had a clever idea. They asked the receptionist, \"Miss. Is this place operated by Lord Florida Man?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then, can multiple buyers split the bill? For example, I bring a thousand people here and make everybody pay 20 years of lifespan.\"\n\"Yes. That payment method is possible.\"\n\"NICE!\" The merchant laughed. Then, he asked another question. \"Does every business and houses here belong to Lord Florida Man as well?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Good! Good! I understand everything. Have a nice day!\"\nThe merchants smiled and left in glee. They scrambled toward large townhouses and big buildings near the main road to secure their potential front stores.\nAs condominium rooms and houses were different types of real estate, the price tag also differed according to the scale of land, luxury, utilities, and the locations. When the merchants found the price tag, they almost vomited blood.\n\"T-Two hundred million essence stones for a manor?! Are you kidding me?!\"\n\"A-A 4-story building store next to the road is 15 million...\"\n\"Wow. A single one-story wooden house is on sale for 700,000 essence stones? Why don't you just rob me?! I can build it myself!\"\nMany cultivators and merchants weren't familiar with the high price tags as they weren't as rich as Leo's employees. Still, several cultivators were smart enough to inspect the interior of these new buildings to measure their worth.\nThey weren't disappointed. Every house and building feature cultivation rooms suitable for seclusion training. The interior space was also a hundred times larger than the advertised pamphlets. By purchasing one small house, they would get a secret mansion, suitable to house a hundred servants!\nMany rogue cultivators gulped and stared at the price tags, unwilling to give up the opportunity. They measured the pros and cons.\n\"How do I procure essence stones? How do I earn money!?\"\n\"Dammit. I need a lot of money quick! What should I do?!\"\n\"Should I sell my heirlooms? B-But that can barely fetch a thousand spirit stones at best!\"\nEverybody was at wits end. They inwardly screamed, lamenting their incompetency.\nEverything went according to Leo's scheme. While everybody was in despair, several mannequins walked around and handed them a stack of A4 document papers.\nConfused, the cultivators received them and read the content.\nThe mannequins smiled at them and explained.\n\"All real estates in this district can be purchased by installment. Depending on the length of the contract and the price of the property, the monthly installment can be as cheap as 100 essence stones per month or a million essence stones a month.\"\n\"Installment?\"\nThe local cultivators weren't familiar with this term. They gazed at the mannequin girls, paying attention to their explanation.\n\"For example, this townhouse's price is 700,000 essence stones. If you agree to pay by installment for 100 years, we will charge the interest rate of 1% per year. Then, the total amount you have to pay monthly is only 923 essence stones!\"\n\"OHHHHH!!\"\nThe cultivators were astonished and excited.\n\"That's so affordable! Miss, I have a thousand essence stones on me! Can I buy one right now?!\"\nThe mannequin grinned, \"Yes. As long as you sign the contract right here. Oh, you wish for the 100-year installment, am I right?\"\n\"Yes, please!\"\n\"Good. Please come with me.\"The inaugural upload of this chapter took place via /n/ov/el/b/in.\nThe cultivator followed the mannequin in glee while the others stared at the guy in astonishment and confusion.\nWhile the cultivators were baffled by the development, the smart merchants brought out their abacus and calculated the total sum of the payment. Then, they sweated profusely.\n\"T-This is rip off!\"\n\"T-That guy will pay more than 700,000 essence stones after 100 years! This is a scam!\"\nWhile several merchants shallowly looked at the increase in price after the 1% interest rate, the people of the Tang Clan had been lurking among the crowd. They also calculated and found the number.\nAlthough they were surprised as well, they understood the price of opportunities. One of them rushed toward a large mansion near the main road and yelled.\n\"I WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS BUILDING BY INSTALLMENT!\"\nThe crowd was stunned once again. They looked at the price tag of that mansion.\nIt was whopping 100 million essence stone!\n\"B-Brother, are you sure?\" One of the merchants were so shocked that his lips trembled.\nThe Tang Clan's member widely grinned. He turned around and revealed that he was none other than Tang Tian.\n\"Positive! This price is too cheap!\"",

The Youth Was an Adult Doll.\n?Chapter 320 – Florida Man Claims He Saved a Youth's Life by Injecting Liquid into His Body. The Youth Was an Adult Doll.\nOne finger-sized soul stone could be traded for 1,000 essence stones. After breaking several boulders of soul stones into smaller ones, Tang Tian had over a million soul stones left.\nIn the end, Tang Tian paid 100,000 soul stones to the mannequin and acquired the deed. He immediately put on a Tang Clan Manor's signboard on the front and informed his other clan mates.\nTang Tian wasn't the only one who exploited their newly earned commission to buy a property. Han Meng, Han Hao, and Tiger Swordsman purchased a penthouse worth 30 million essence stones. After securing their big homes, they copied Tang Tian and put on the signboards of their names. Then, they bragged about their new houses to the other colleagues.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei were more modest. They chose a two-bedroom condominium room instead of a big house. Unlike their greedy colleagues, they had a better grasp of Leo's nature.\nAfter purchasing the room, they visited the room and discovered that the usable interior space was wider than the advertised blueprint. Instead of getting only two bedrooms and one bathroom, the couple secured a three-story penthouse with a swimming pool.\nWu Buyi was different. He kept all his soul stones with him as he already had a house.\nBeatrice also kept the soul stones. She returned to Leo's bus and gave everything to Esen instead of using them herself.\n…\nBy the end of the day, a hundred cultivators purchased Leo's houses or condominium rooms. Only Leo's close aides paid in full. As for the rest, they fell for the installment scheme.\nThe mannequins brought the soul stones and essence stones to the bus and reported to Leo, who read the transaction reports.\nLeo was disappointed.\n\"I gave them soul stones to cultivate, but those idiots use them to buy my land. Seriously, how long will they reach the entity realm and be useful for once?\"\nGiving up on the elders, Leo shifted his attention to Wu Buyi and young talents. He wondered if he should start accepting direct disciples to encourage the younger generations.\nAfter a thorough contemplation, Leo decided to give the talented youngsters a push. He called Gao Yan, Tang San, Jin Yong, and Yao Qiqi over the next day morning.\n…\nThe morning of the next day, Leo gathered Gao Yan, Jin Yong, Tang San, and Yao Qiqi at the waterpark of his shopping complex. Esen also tagged along as she had nothing better to do.\nLeo inspected their cultivation base. Gao Yan and Jin Yong were already deities. Yao Qiqi stuck at the true immortal stage while Tang San was the weakest. On the other hand, Esen dual-cultivated with Leo a lot. She already condensed a million-star galaxy in her dantian universe, and she was ready to tackle the sage realm.\nSeeing the promising youths and his wife, Leo announced.\n\"I'll be direct. You guys suck!\"\n\"What?\" Esen was annoyed, \"You called us here to call us 'SUCK'?!\"\nThe others were also taken aback. They lowered their gaze. Only Tang San tilted his head as he admitted that he was the worst here.\n\"No, I'm here to accelerate your growth. You kids take too long to grow!\" Leo clarified.\nGao Yan and Jin Yong wryly smiled. By their standard, their growth rate was already superior to the local standard. As for Yao Qiqi, she pouted.\n\"Senior, are you looking down on us?\" Yao Qiqi protested.\n\"Again, no.\" Leo sighed, \"I'm saying that none of you are using the full potential of our facilities.\"\n\"Eh?\" Everybody was interested.\n\"How many times have you used the Tessaract Time Chamber so far?\"\nGao Yan laughed, \"About seven? Maybe?\"\nJin Yong clicked his tongue, \"Six, senior.\"\nYao Qiqi pouted, \"Only two.\"\nEsen snorted, \"Zero!\"\nTang San dryly laughed, \"What's the time chamber?\"\nLeo facepalmed. He was disappointed in them.\n\"None of you have exploited your privilege as my workers. If I were you, I would have queued in front of the time chamber whenever I have a day off.\"\n\"…\"\nEverybody but Tang San and Esen was embarrassed. They counted their hands and calculated how many times they could have spent their time in that time chamber.\nGao Yan whined, \"I would have done so if the queue wasn't so long, senior! Do you know how long it is to get our queue these days? Only four people can enter at a time!\"\nLeo accepted the reason. However, at the moment, no line existed as commoners and rogue cultivators couldn't enter the shopping complex anymore.\n\"That was the past. But now, the time chamber is empty. It's about time we exclusively enter it and train y'all!\"\nGao Yan and Jin Yong finally figured out why Leo repelled mortals and non-employees away from the shopping complex. They widely grinned and gave Leo a thumbs up.\n\"We thought you excluded the others because of the bad decision. We are so shortsighted!\"\n\"Yeah, you're shortsighted, alright. So, here's the plan. I'm going to tutor you personally… starting from you, Tang San!\"\n\"Me\" Tang San pointed his fingertip at his face, confused.\n\"Come with me. Tomorrow, it's Gao Yan's queue. Next is Jin Yong, Yao Qiqi… and you too, wifey.\"\nEsen frowned, \"Do I have to?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"You can't just sit at home and leech my energy every day. You need to practice how to use that new power, too. The time chamber provides a stage for that.\"\n\"Eh, how troublesome. Can I just stay home until I give birth?\"\n\"…\"\nAt that moment, everybody looked at Esen in shock.\n\"Give birth?\"\nEsen smirked and mocked Leo, \"Congrats, husband. I'm pregnant. You're going to be a father.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo slightly dropped his jaw, flabbergasted. Then, he remembered that Ivy used to tell him before that their wedding day's deeds guaranteed her impregnation.\n\"I guess you can stay home and cultivate. No need to exercise.\" Leo changed his mind.\n\"Correct answer! Now, can I go home? I want to eat something spicy and sour.\"\n\"…Fine.\"\nEsen giggled and left the meeting.\n…\nAfter Esen had left the meeting, the boys smiled at Leo, \"Congratulations, Lord Florida Man! You're going to be a father!\"\nYao Qiqi was also excited, \"Am I going to be an elder sister soon?\"\nLeo was speechless. He deeply sighed and changed the topic.\n\"Enough with my personal life. Now, Tang San. Come with me to the time chamber. I'll guide you myself!\"\n\"O-Okay!\"\n.\n.\n.\nTang San and Leo entered the time chamber together. As for Hua Taixu, Leo kicked him out and asked him to take a vacation.\nUpon getting inside the time chamber, Leo explained the perks of this place and the prepared cultivation resources within the blank room.\nTang San was astonished. He was excited for the new life.\n\"Wow. This is even better than I imagined!\" Tang San praised the facility.\n\"Enough with the praise. For now, I need to know what kind of cultivation method you are using. Then, I can guide you.\"\n\"Yes, master!\"\nTang San sat cross-legged and began cultivating miasma and monster Qi. The yin-yang Qi in the environment was converted into dark miasma because of Tang San, and they entered his body.\nLeo observed the nature of the miasma and discovered that they were similar to impure yin Qi. He frowned and inspected Tang San's internal organs and constitution.\nHis meridians entangled like messy computer wires and a bunch of wired earphones bundling together. Tang San's Qi ignored the meridians and enveloped his entire body like water seeping into a sponge.\nAfter a while, the impure Qi transformed into nutrition for Tang San's muscles and bone marrow. The bundling meridians slowly merged together into one, but they were far from completion.\nAfter a brief inspection, Leo asked the system.\n'Is his current method good for him? If it's not so, what cultivation method should I teach this guy?'\nDING\n<No. The current cultivation method is only compatible with Oni Race. If Tang San continues using it, he will slowly mutate into a monster. Instead, it is recommended to impart him the Abyssal Black Tortoise bloodline to evolve his constitution before he reaches the immortal realm.>\nLeo flinched. 'And how the hell can I get one of those bloodline from?'\n<You can purchase it from the system.>\n\"…\"\nFinally, Leo realized how powerful his shopping system was. He opened the online shopping store and searched by the keyword 'Bloodline'.\nA million items showed up. Each item's description disclosed the backgrounds of each race and creature.\nLeo browsed the list for a while and found the origin of his bloodlines.\n.\nPrismatic Phoenix Bloodline (Transcendent Realm)\nPrice – One Billion Years of Lifespan\nThis vial of blood contains the blood essence of the transcendent being overlord \"Priscilla\". It can be consumed directly to integrate the bloodline into one's constitution. However, there are 95% chance that the host will mutate and die during the mutation process.\nIn case of succeeding, the host can evolve into a Prismatic Phoenix and utilize any type of yin and yang cultivation method, technique, or skill. It also boosts the host's defense and offense abilities equally. In short, this bloodline is considered the most versatile bloodline in the universe.\nHowever, there was a downside. Whatever and whoever the host touches, they may mutate because of the suppressing yin and yang Qi. Most mutated objects and lifeforms usually turn into medicines, spiritual herbs, cultivation resources, or alchemy ingredients.\nThe bloodline is not compatible with the Gold Dragon Bloodline, Abyssal Black Tortoise Bloodline, and Hallowed White Tiger Bloodline. If mixed together, the bloodlines will cause the host to lose sanity.\n.\nLeo nodded. It indeed looked similar to what Leo had in his veins and heart.\nAfter skimming through his bloodline power, he checked the details of the Abyssal Tortoise Bloodline next.\n.\nAbyssal Tortoise Bloodline (Transcendent Realm)\nPrice – One Billion Years of Lifespan\nThis vial of blood contains the blood essence of the deceased transcendent being overlord 'Etteswob'. It cannot be consumed directly due to its poisonous extreme yin nature. Only the top alchemist can concoct this bloodline into medicine, which can be used to cure broken meridian disabilities. However, people with the rare constitution \"Monster Meridians Physique\" can consume this directly to unlock their full potential.\nUpon consumption, there are two results: the obvious one is being unalive. The second result is an ultimate evolution. The host with this bloodline will have a charming feminine physique even though he is a man, yet his defensive abilities will become unrivaled in this universe. In addition, the host can acquire the Dao of Gravity and Magnetic Force naturally. Thus, the best cultivation methods and techniques for the host with this bloodline are gravity and magnetic-related techniques.\nThe bloodline is not compatible with the Gold Dragon Bloodline, Prismatic Phoenix Bloodline, and Hallowed White Tiger Bloodline. If mixed together, the bloodlines will cause the host to lose sanity.\n.\nAfter reading through everything, Leo was confident that this bloodline suited Tang San better. He invested one billion years of lifespan to get the vial of black blood.\nThe black blood vial appeared in Leo's hands. He slightly shook it to check the content.\nAs soon as Leo waved it, the vial broke, and the mass of blood floated in mid-air. As if it was alive, it emitted killing intent toward Leo.\nLeo smirked at the blob of blood, \"Hey, what's the big deal?\"\nThe blood mass didn't listen to Leo. It slowly floated toward Tang San for a moment. Then, it let out a scream of joy.\nTang San slowly opened his eyes as he sensed a weird gaze from an entity. Upon opening his eyes, he found a small mass of black liquid floating in front of his face.\nWithout letting Tang San react, the blood mass infiltrated Tang San's body through his nostrils. It instantly entered his brain and bone marrow.\n\"W-WHAT?!\" Tang San panicked.\nLeo crossed his arms and encouraged him, \"Relax and absorb that bloodline. It will change your physique… in a good way.\"\n\"???\"\n\"Oh, don't mind if you end up looking like a woman. Well, if anybody asks what your gender is, just say that you're non-\nbinary or some shit.\"\n\"Huh?\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 321 – Florida Man Inflicts Max Emotional Damage to Muscle Builder by Forcing Him Through Gender Transformation Operation\nTang San couldn't complain as the evolution struck him. He shut his eyes and meditated, controlling the new blood inside him. His bone marrow quickly regenerated new blood cells into his blood circulation system while the old blood was devoured by the new blood cells. When the new blood took over the entire system, Tang San transformed.\nHis muscles and skeleton shrank. His coarse skin became as smooth as polished jade, and his skin tone was brighter. The six-packs vanished, replaced with a delicate soft, and smooth stomach. His muscular chest also formed a curve.\nTang San's face changed for the better (or worse). His handsome face was beautified by the extreme yin energy.\nA day in the time chamber passed. Tang San opened his eyes and deeply frowned. On the other hand, Leo whistled and purchased a mirror from his system shop. He placed it in front of Tang San.\n\"Stand up and look at yourself. If I may comment, you are quite a charmer now.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nTang San had a tinge of doubt when he looked down and found a pair of sizable mountains on his chest. He immediately touched the area on his crotch and discovered that his precious jewel was still there.\nStill, the combination made him concerned about his future. He stood up and looked in the mirror.\nThere was a pretty long black-haired lady in the mirror. Despite having a gorgeous face and sexy hips, Tang San screamed in shock.\n\"HOW?! WHY?!\"\nTang San touched his face and his arms. Then, he realized that they got softer.\n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!\"\nLeo snorted and appraised Tang San's constitution using the system scan. Then, he asked the system.\n\"System. Can you show him what you show me?\"\nDING\n<Yes. Would you like to enable this permission permanently or temporarily?>\n\"Temporary.\"\n<Affirmative.>\nDING\nTwo system screens appeared in front of Leo and Tang San. Both disclosed information on Tang San's new physique and cultivation potential.\n.\nName: Tang San\nAlias: None\nAge: 19\nRace: Abyssal Black Tortoise / Human\nCultivation Base: Quasi-Immortal\nBloodline: Abyssal Black Tortoise Bloodline\nBiography: Tang San was born with a unique constitution that rejected yin and yang essence in favor of the monster Qi. His parents engraved a fate crystal into Tang San's soul when he was a baby to seal his rampaging monster Qi. But by doing so, Tang San's cultivation future was crippled.\nTang San encountered Overlord Kishin Douji who resuscitated his dantian, allowing him to cultivate monster Qi again even though the overlord's cultivation method was harmful to Tang San in the long run.\nFate guided him to Overlord Florida Man. The overlord removed the entangled meridians and weakened dantian of Tang San by injecting the rare bloodline of the extinct creature 'The Abyssal Black Tortoise' into Tang San's blood veins.\nTang San managed to digest the bloodline safely and emerged as a descendant of the great race. He now can cultivate the lost cultivation method of the Abyssal Black Tortoises, who were famous for their impenetrable defense.\n.\nAfter reading his own biography, Tang San was stunned. He looked behind him and touched his back, expecting to see a tortoise shell. However, he couldn't find one.\nTang San let out a long sigh of relief. He pursed his lips and gazed at his figure in the mirror once again. After turning around and admiring his physique from the sides, he grumbled.\n\"Am I a woman now?\" Asked Tang San in a woman's voice.Leo teased him, \"Depends on your definition. If you follow my advice and become a non-binary, you can call yourself whatever you want. Be it a two-spirited penguin, a lesbian, a futa, or a ladyboy, I have no F to give.\"\n\"B-But other people will see me as a woman now! I'M A MAN! I DON'T WANNA BE A WOMAN!\"\n\"Do you still have that thing down there?\" Leo pointed at Tang San's crotch.\n\"…\"\nTang San looked down. He touched \"IT\" and confirmed that they were functional. He bitterly smiled.\n\"I still have them, senior.\"\nAgain, Leo shrugged, \"Then, what do you want to call yourself? A man or a woman?\"\n\"…I still want to remain as a man. Yes. I have it, so I'm still a man!\"\n\"That's the answer! Your gender is whatever you want. Don't think too much about it.\"\n\"But about my future spouse and… my future wife? I wish to have a wife in the future, senior. How am I supposed to tell them that I'm a man if I have this physique?!\"\n\"Just show them the D? Tell them that your boobs are bigger than theirs?\"\n\"…\"\nTang San was speechless for a minute. When he imagined the scenario, he burst into laughter. But a moment later, he was depressed.\nLeo patted Tang San's back. He consoled the guy.\n\"Jokes aside. Your constitution is unofficially nicknamed \"FUTA\" in my world. It's nothing special.\"\n\"F-Futa?\"\n\"Yes. Their appearance looked perfectly like other women's except for their genitals. Some even had both.\"\n\"B-BOTH?!\"\n\"Yup! Don't think too much about it. You'll be surprised to see how some women actually prefer their mates feminine. They are actually more sickening freaks than the normal ones in our society, but we don't talk about it. Think of it in a positive way. You can enjoy fancy pretty dresses now. Nobody will scoff at you if you start wearing dresses tomorrow. Oh, you can still wear man's clothes if you want to, and no one will bat an eye. That's your privilege.\"\n\"…\"\nTang San didn't know what to think. He gazed at the mirror again and admired his new face and appearance. He spins in front of the mirror as if he was dancing.\nAlthough Tang San thought he didn't like it, the corners of his mouth slightly curved up because of the unexplainable excitement of his new gender.\n\"So, I'm a FUTA!\"\n\"PFFT!\"\nLeo covered his mouth as he almost lost it. He crouched while his shoulders trembled, hiding his laughter.\n\"I'M BEAUTIFUL, AND I'M A FUTA!!\"\n\"…\"\nWatching the young man experience five stages of grief entertained Leo. He secretly pinched his thighs to stop himself from laughing, showing respect to Tang San.\nWhile Tang San celebrated his new identity, Leo consulted his system.\n\"Do you have a cultivation method book or manual for him in the store?\"\nDING\nThe system navigated Leo's system screen to the shopping menu and showed him the item.\n.\n- Abyssal Black Tortoise Cultivation Method (Mortal)\n- Abyssal Black Tortoise Cultivation Method (Immortal)\n- Abyssal Black Tortoise Cultivation Method (Deity)\n…\nThe cultivation manuals were separated into many volumes, categorized by the cultivation realm. The names of the manuals were also easy to understand as no other variants existed.\nLeo purchased the three first volumes. Unlike the bloodline, these manuals only cost him 111 years of lifespan.\n\"I should fight with a real abyssal black tortoise in the simulation mode later. Hey, system. If I never meet a black tortoise before, can I summon their clones in the simulation mode?\"\nDING\n<No. The cloned target must be within the same galaxy as you to enable the summon.>\n\"Yeah, I figured.\"\nLeo was disappointed. He wished he could learn more about the abyssal tortoises or copy their abilities.\nFortunately, his system was more useful than the imperfect system in his early days. It prompted him with a hint, which Leo didn't ask for.>\n<The Abyssal Black Tortoises are extinct, but their souls are recycled in the karmic river. You may enlist them with your new recruitment system and enable the simulation mode's summoning permission.>\n\"Huh?!\" Leo was surprised, \"Wait, I can recruit souls from Karma River?!\"\n<Yes. You haven't explored all the new features yet. Please explore every system you have to take advantage of your true entity fate crystal.>\n<Your system hopes you can be the strongest entity in this universe as the system's livelihood depends on your strength and survival. Your system will also remind you periodically in case you suffer from dementia.>\n\"…\"\nSomehow, Leo felt like the system low-key threw a shade at him.\nLeo put the matter at the back of his head and skimmed through the manuals. Although everybody called him an idiot most of the time, he memorized every word after reading every page twice. Then, he passed the manuals to Tang San.\n\"Throw away the previous cultivation methods. Recultivate from the start by using these methods.\"\nTang San confusingly received the manuals, \"R-Recultivate from the beginning, senior? You mean, I have to start over as a muscle tempering stage again?\"\n\"For the foundation, yes.\"\n\"But it took a whole year to reach my current strength!\"\n\"Don't worry. You'll surpass your current strength within… a month, I think.\"\n\"A MONTH?!\"\nThe promise piqued Tang San's interest. He immediately opened the first volume of the manual and read it.\nWhile reading, Tang San circulated his Qi according to the guide. As soon as he did, yin energy in the time chamber gushed toward Tang San like a tidal wave, entering his bodily pores and orifices against his will.\n\"!!!\"\nTang San's body floated in mid-air as the gush of Qi turned into a tornado. His clothes shattered to pieces.\nBlack liquid seeped out from his physique as the extreme yin energy flushed out all the monster Qi impurity out of his body. However, the black liquid soon reentered his body because of the cultivation method.\nThe bad liquid turned into food for the abyssal tortoise's blood again. All blood cells were strengthened as a result, improving Tang San's condition and vitality.\nThe full-body Qi circulation was completed 7 times every one second. Every time a full-body Qi circulation was completed, Tang San could feel that his bones and muscles were strengthened by another level.\nAt first, Tang San's physical strength reverted back to when his cultivation base was at the bottom. But after cultivating the first verse, his cultivation base reached the final level of 1st stage instantly, yet his real strength surpassed any regular 3rd stage cultivator.\nA minute later, Tang San broke through to the second stage. Two minutes later, he reached the third stage.\nAfter an hour, the man regained his former cultivation base!\nLeo stroked his chin, impressed with Tang San's cultivation speed.\n\"I guess one month is an understatement. You did it in an hour.\"\nTang San didn't respond as his mind focused on the Qi circulation. He slowly opened his eyes after two hours of cultivation.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't advance to the next realm yet as he hadn't comprehended the entire first volume. He needed time to reread everything.\nTang San opened his eyes and landed on the ground. He inspected his body. Although his outward appearance never changed, his muscles became compact and sturdier than when he had a bulky physique. His every movement was brim with power and great force.\nTesting his new strength, Tang San punched empty air.\nBOOM\nA loud sound followed his fist. Tang San widened his eyes in astonishment.\nOn the other hand, Leo glanced at something else as they jiggled hard. Leo stroked his chin and compared them with Esen's assets.\nEsen's properties were soft and elastic. On the other hand, Tang San's mountains seemed firm and harder.\n\"Yup. It's a man's boob after all.\"\nTang San looked at Leo, \"Did you say something, senior?\"\n\"Nothing. Just admiring your punch.\"\n\"Oh…\" Tang San looked down and realized that he was naked. Like normal men, he groped his chest and massaged them.\n\"…\"\nTang San and Leo quietly stared at the assets. The former blushed in embarrassment while Leo started to miss his wife.\n\"God dammit. I shouldn't promised y'all to teach you here. Now, I want to cuddle with my wife.\" Leo complained.\n\"…Not my fault, senior.\" Tang San turned around and hid his chest by instinct.\n\"I don't want to look at your junk. Put on some clothes first. Also, mine is bigger than yours. There's no point looking at the tiny dragon.\"\n\"…\"",

He then summoned Tang San to fight.\n.\nName: Tang San\nRace: Abyssal Black Tortoise\nCultivation Base: 65,536-Star Deity\nSkills: Dao of Impenetrable Defense, Dao of Poison, Mandate Domain of Absolute Gravity\nSpecials: Extreme Yin Physique, Abyssal Black Tortoise Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Abyssal Shield\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nLeo was slightly disappointed as the capped potential of Tang San was only at the deity stage. Meanwhile, Esen was an immortal when Leo tested her ability, but her clone's max strength was the entity realm.\nStill, everything went according to Leo's plan. He didn't bring Tang San or plan to bring the other talented youth here for no reason.\n'It doesn't matter. Time to collect my investments.'\nLeo started the simulation by summoning Tang San's clone to fight.\n…\nA day in the time chamber quickly passed. Tang San practiced some external martial arts and his special moves. Finally, he managed to get used to his new physique.\nMeanwhile, Leo reaped some benefits. He crushed Tang San's clones 10,000 times, copying the junior's skills and obtaining his personal weapon.\nLeo reopened his eyes on the second day in the time chamber. As he had nothing to earn from Tang San at his current potential, Leo attempted to stimulate the young man a bit.\n\"Boy! Come here!\"\nTang San rushed to Leo and knelt. He smiled and reported.\n\"I've finally consolidated my foundation and stabilized my cultivation base, senior! Should I tackle the immortal stage today?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm planning to. But first thing's first!\"\nLeo stretched his fingertip and reached out toward Tang San's forehead. It pierced into his head without causing physical harm!\nTang San widened his eyes in shock as Leo suddenly attacked him, yet he didn't resist. A few seconds later, Tang San figured that Leo didn't actually harm him, so he teased the master.\n\"Senior! Why are you 'FINGERING' me?!\"\nLeo broke a sweat, \"PHRASING, you dipshit! That sounds so wrong!\"\n\"But you're FINGERING ME!\"\n\"God dammit! Shut up and stay still!\" Leo grumbled while he searched for a certain object.\nAfter wiggling his fingertip in Tang San's soul for a minute, Leo pulled out a small crystal. It was a lot smaller than regular crystals of the same type.\nDING\n<You have extracted a heavenly fate crystal from Tang San's soul.>\n<Warning! By forcefully extracting a fate crystal from your people's souls, you are harming their cultivation foundation! Please do not mistreat your people as their faith will affect your future cultivation stages.>\nLeo snorted and retorted, \"I know. Man, I'm trying to unlock this brat's potential here. Be quiet for a moment.\"\nAfter getting his hand on Tang San's heavenly fate crystal, he ejected six of his heavenly fate crystals from his soul and merged with Tang San's crystal.\nThe seven crystals shone so bright that they temporarily blinded Tang San. On the other hand, Leo saw through the radiant light and witnessed the seven heavenly fate crystals transforming into one fist-sized crystal ball.DING\n<You have condensed a True Heavenly Fate Crystal!>\nAlthough this was his first time creating a true heavenly fate crystal, Leo's expression remained indifferent. He already had a superior version of this.\n\"Identify!\"\nDING\n.\nTrue Heavenly Fate Crystal\nThis crystal can only be created by merging seven Heavenly Fate Crystals. Any True Heavenly Fate Crystal can be used as a consumable item, a socket item for system facilities, or an imprint on a soul.\nBy crushing this crystal, the owner can erase all system abilities from a nearby system user who has obtained their system abilities from heavenly fate crystals or inferior crystals.\nIf it is equipped in a system facility or system equipment's socket, it will grant a random blessing to the facility or the equipment. In case it is used to imprint a soul, a unique system will be generated and imprinted to the karmic soul. However, it will disappear if the true heavenly fate crystal's owner is killed by another true fate crystal's owner.\nHidden Feature (1): If any mortal under 20 years of age becomes the owner of this 'True Heavenly Fate Crystal', they will be blessed with absolute luck for 100 years or until their cultivation base reaches the ceiling of the current universe.\nHidden Feature (2): This True Heavenly Fate Crystal can generate one of the three following systems for the owner if it is imprinted to its owner's soul;\n- Qi Stealing System (25%)\n- Entity-Grade Armory System (50%)\n- Passive Ability of an existing Entity (25%)\nHidden Feature (3): If this true heavenly fate crystal is the only fate crystal in the owner's soul, the owner's cultivation ceiling will be capped at the Transcendent Level 10. Otherwise, the owner's cultivation base is capped at the Entity Realm or this effect is overridden by a superior true fate crystal.\n.\nLeo scoffed at the fate crystal as it reminded him of many main characters in various stories.\n\"Yup. Sounds like a typical plot armor of a main character, alright.\"\nIf Leo shoved this crystal back into Tang San's soul, he could easily make the guy stronger instantly. However, he had a better idea.\nLeo opened his shopping system and browsed the unique item list.\n.\nSoul Awakening Pro\nMax Cultivation Base: Entity\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 65,536 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: B\nEnable Dantian Universe\nEnable System Hints & Quests\nDantian Universe Capacity: 65,536 Stars\nPrice: Heaven Fate Crystal + 30,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nSoul Enlightenment\nMax Cultivation Base: Karmic Sovereign\nMax Lifespan Capacity: 2,147,483,647 Years\nIncrease Cultivation Aptitude: A\nEnable Dantian Universe & Karma River Hosting\nEnable System Hints & Quests & System Shops\nDantian Universe Capacity: 4,294,967,296 Stars\nPrice: Heaven Fate Crystal + 50,000 Years of Lifespan.\n.\nThe two items in the shop could only be purchased by exchanging fate crystals. However, it did not require the true heavenly fate crystal but a regular one.\nAs kind as he was, Leo wrote down the details of the true heavenly fate crystal's perks and the boons of the items in the shop for Tang San. Then, Leo presented the options to him.\n\"Pay attention, okay?\"\n\"Yes?\" Tang San was curious.\n\"Alright, Mr. Anderson. Here's a blue pill and a red pill. You can only take one. If you take the blue pill, aka the soul enlightenment option, you will obtain an assistant system. Your cultivation aptitude will greatly improve, and your cultivation ceiling will be higher.\"\n\"…Who is this Mr. An-Der-Son? Also, where are the pills?\" Tang San didn't understand the meme.\nRealizing that the meme was ineffective against locals, Leo stopped messing around. Leo explained.\n\"The crystal is the goddamn pill, you dum-dum. Here, you read what I wrote first.\"\n\"O-Okay?\"\nTang San accepted the papers that Leo had just written. He skimmed through the details, but he was still confused.\n\"What's a system? What's a dantian universe?\"\nLeo sighed and took his time to explain without skipping the details.\n…\nHours later, Leo finished the lecture. Meanwhile, Tang San was enlightened.\n\"Wow. So, I can create a planet inside me?\"\n\"Not just one but many.\"\n\"Isn't this good? I love this! Can I choose the blue pill right away?\"\n\"Don't you want to hear the red pill's details first?\"\n\"…Oh. Okay, let's hear it.\"\nLeo slightly shook his head and showed Tang San what he had copied from the system screen.\nTang San took the paper and read through it. But again, as an inexperienced mortal, he didn't understand the significance of its usage. He asked Leo once more.\n\"What's the point of this? This seems bad.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes and pointed out the difference, \"Didn't you read it properly? If you choose this path, your cultivation ceiling will be higher than the blue pill options.\"\n\"Then, this red pill is better?\"\n\"Not really. You won't get the assist system to help you. You will also need to find a way to grow a dantian universe by yourself. In short, the blue pill is an easy mode that guarantees your success. The red pill is a challenger mode with more rewards.\"\nTang San widely grinned. He made his decision without batting an eye, \"Then, I'll pick the path with more rewards, please!\"\nLeo shook his head, \"You're greedy, I see.\"\n\"Greedy is always good. My master… I mean, Senior Kishin taught me that a person must be delusional first to become motivated. I'm a delusional aspiring cultivator who wishes to become the strongest man in the universe! Can't I take a little challenge?\"\nLeo inwardly laughed at Tang San's mindset as he approved it. After all, he wasn't wrong.\n\"Well, I don't know how that guy came up with this philosophy, but he's right. Every successful person must be delusional first before they start their journey! Without a grand goal, there is no inspiration and motivation! Take the goddamn blue pill, you sick protagonist!\"\n\"…What's protagonist?\"\n\"…Forget it.\"\nLeo shoved the true heavenly fate crystal into Tang San's soul and burnt the papers. After returning the upgraded version of the fate crystal back, he let the guy digest the new information and his new power.\nTang San stood still while his eyes dimmed. His consciousness had already taken a trip to his sea of consciousness. From that day onward, he would see things that no one but Leo and other true fate crystal owners could see.\nAfter confirming that Tang San received the true fate crystal properly, Leo left him alone. He returned to his meditation session, returning to his good old dantian universe.\n…\nUpon getting back, Leo checked the strength of Tang San's clones again.\nThis time, the detail drastically changed.\n.\nName: Tang San\nRace: Transcendent Divine Tortoise\nCultivation Base: Transcendent Level 10\nSkills: Transcend Dao of Invincibility, Transcend Dao of Poison, Absolute Law of Implosion\nSpecials: Divine Yin Physique, Abyssal Black Tortoise Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Mirror of Divinity Negation\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nLeo wryly smiled as the guy exceeded his expectations. He was expecting a karmic sovereign, but this protagonist-like dude had the potential to catch up with Leo's strength.\n\"I take this as a challenge, then. Fine. I'll do my best to steal your skills and daos, boy!\"\nAlthough his chance of winning was slim, Leo tried it anyway. After all, nobody could teach him better martial arts techniques or combat tactics than real opponents.\nLeo's journey to grow stronger and understand his full potential continued.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 323 – Hallucinated Florida Man Feeds Youth a Vial of Alligator Blood to Make Him Mutant Ninja Version of John Wick\nA year quickly passed.\nUnder Leo's guidance, Tang San managed to ascend to the deity realm. However, he only managed to condense 11 stars in his dantian universe.\nOn the other hand, Leo spent the year fighting Tang San's clones in simulation mode, enhancing his foundation as a transcendent being. Although he couldn't defeat the clones even once, his combat sense drastically improved.\nBoth men came out from the time chamber. When they got out, Gao Yan, Jin Yong, and Yao Qiqi rushed to meet them.\nUpon seeing Tang San's new look, the group was taken aback, especially Jin Yong. The guy blushed as Tang San's pretty face and valiant demeanor were his type.\nTang San forgot that he had the appearance of a woman. He crossed his arms and smiled, \"It has been a year, guys.\"\nGao Yan snickered as he knew how Tang San felt as the time chamber experience was addictive. He also wished that he could stay inside that room for a month to train.\n\"You look FINE!\" Jin Yong whistled.\n\"Welcome back,\" Gao Yan ignored Tang San's appearance as he also got the antler horns after Leo helped him.\nYao Qiqi glanced at Tang San's chest and pouted. She wished she could grow up soon.\nLeo looked at the trio. Although he had promised that he would take one of them to the time chamber next, he decided to postpone the schedule due to personal reasons.\n\"Come back tomorrow. I'm taking a day off.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nThe group was dejected, but they dragged Tang San with them. The gang planned to ask the ladyboy about his progress.\n…\nLeo returned to his bus. Upon coming back, he went straight to Esen.\nEsen was on the upper deck of the bus, relaxing on the beach. As Ivy, Beatrice, and Marc weren't there with her, she lay on the beach naked, enjoying the sunbath.\nSensing her husband's presence, Esen raised her head and looked at Leo.\n\"Oh, you're back.\"\nLeo gazed at his wife's body and her stomach. Although she claimed that she was pregnant, it was still somewhat flat.\nAfter ogling his wife's body, Leo's nostrils flared. He removed his clothes and got on top of her.\n\"I miss you.\"\nEsen raised her eyebrows, \"You only went out for a day. What's wrong?\"\n\"You have no idea what kind of torture I've been through.\"\nBecause of Tang San's new sexy body, Leo had been suppressing his desire for a year. He kissed his wife and did his thing.\nEsen was surprised, but she embraced him nonetheless. After all, they had dual-cultivated a dozen times before, and there was nothing to be embarrassed about anymore.\n…\nThe morning of the next day, Leo ended the session, satisfied. His wife was also pleased with all the love and care.\n\"Let's do this again tomorrow.\" Leo proposed.\nEsen giggled, \"I might die at this rate. You're a monster!\"\n\"That's one year's worth of saving. Anyway, get some rest.\"\nAfter taking a bath, Leo returned to the time chamber to train another youngster.\n.\n.\nIn front of the time chamber, Tang San, Gao Yan, Jin Yong, and Yao Qiqi waited for Leo. They wondered what Leo would teach them next.Leo arrived and fulfilled his promise. He pointed at Gao Yan.\n\"You're up next, Gao Yan. Come with me!\"\nJin Yong raised his hand as he was curious. \"Lord Florida Man. The time chamber supports five people at a time. Can we enter the room together with you?\"\n\"No.\"\nEverybody was surprised and curious, \"Why, sir?\"\n\"Do you want me to disclose your cultivation secrets to your colleagues? Do you know that every cultivation method, dao, or technique isn't compatible with everybody? If you accidentally learn someone else's technique by accident, your dantian might become unstable because of the foreign incomplete daos. Do you want to experience those complications?\"\n\"…No, sir.\"\n\"Then, stay out of it. One person at a time!\"\nJin Yong and Yao Qiqi sighed and gave up entering the time chamber along with Gao Yan. Meanwhile, Tang San was grateful for the privacy.\nAs the youngsters had nothing else to do, they left the area and visited the bookstore to play.\nLeo dragged Gao Yan to the time chamber and began his scheme.\n…\nInside the time chamber, Leo repeated what he did to Tang San. First, he evaluated Gao Yan's status and biography.\n.\nName: Gao Yan\nAlias: None\nAge: 17\nRace: Yan Human\nCultivation Base: 202-Star Deity\nBloodline: Thunder Elemental Bloodline\nBiography: Gao Yan was born a commoner, and raised by a family of farmers. After his parents died, he joined the Life Sword Sect as an outer disciple to survive. He learned the ways of the swords and fell in love with the sword dao. However, he lacked funds and cultivation resources to grow as a cultivator, so he always visited the local landmark site 'Sword Saint Boulder' to learn sword techniques.\nAt the age of 16, he encountered a rogue overlord \"Florida Man\" who bestowed him an opportunity and precious cultivation resources. Because of the overlord's support, Gao Yan's potential was unlocked, and he rapidly grew as a cultivator. Within less than a year, he ascended as the youngest deity.\n.\nThere was nothing special about him except for his passion for the sword dao and his antler horns, aka the source of his thunder elemental bloodline. Leo wondered if he could stimulate his growth a bit.\n\"System, what's the best action to boost his strength and unlock his true potential?\"\n<As usual – Purchase an entity's bloodline and give it to him. In this case, you should bestow him another elemental bloodline to add versatility.>\n\"How about a better bloodline to upgrade his thunder one?\"\n<Specializing only one element can be a demerit in the higher realm. If Gao Yan cultivates multiple elements, such as Fire & Thunder, Wind & Thunder, or Light and Thunder, he can take advantage of the element synergy and develop his sword dao more efficiently. Moreover, he will have fewer weaknesses in the future.>\nLeo was enlightened. He then explored the shopping system and explored the elemental bloodline section.\n- (Deceased) Overlord Salagator Bloodline\n- (Deceased) Overlord Garuda Bloodline\n- Overlord Shuri Bloodline\nThe names varied. Leo deeply frowned as it was different from what he had imagined.\nLeo pressed on the first dead overlord's name to see his details. Unfortunately, it was not something impressive as he was a dead entity, who specialized in fire element essence and flame dao. He was also a flame alligator, which was already extinct from the universe.\nAs he couldn't decide, Leo asked Gao Yan.\n\"Boy, if you have a chance to learn one special element, which one do you like the most? Fire, wind, or light?\"\nGao Yan didn't understand the question, but he had a vague answer in his mind.\n\"I'm already good at electric and lightning. My Qi also generates heat well, but I'm not well-versed in fire manipulation. If I can choose, I would like to learn some fire techniques to go with my lightning attribute, please.\"\n\"Okay!\"\nLeo picked the Salagator choice and got a vial of crimson blood. He gave it to Gao Yan.\n\"Here is what you want. This is the bloodline of an extinct race, Salagator! If you consume this, you might… transform again.\"\n\"…\"\nBefore Gao Yan changed his mind, Leo immediately brought out eight heavenly fate crystals and combined seven. The seven crystals merged into one, becoming another true heavenly fate crystal.\nAfter getting the second true heavenly fate crystal, Leo appraised it.\nDING\n.\nTrue Heavenly Fate Crystal\nThis crystal can only be created by merging seven Heavenly Fate Crystals. Any True Heavenly Fate Crystal can be used as a consumable item, a socket item for system facilities, or an imprint on a soul.\nBy crushing this crystal, the owner can erase all system abilities from a nearby system user who has obtained their system abilities from heavenly fate crystals or inferior crystals.\nIf it is equipped in a system facility or system equipment's socket, it will grant a random blessing to the facility or the equipment. In case it is used to imprint a soul, a unique system will be generated and imprinted to the karmic soul. However, it will disappear if the true heavenly fate crystal's owner is killed by another true fate crystal's owner.\nHidden Feature (1): If any sword practitioner under 20 years of age becomes the owner of this 'True Heavenly Fate Crystal', they will unlock the 'Sword God System'. Every time the fate crystal's owner kills an enemy with a sword, they acquire points, which can be exchanged to unlock new sword skills.\nHidden Feature (2): This True Heavenly Fate Crystal can boost one of the following attributes for the owner if it is imprinted on its owner's soul.\n- Physical Strength (25%)\n- Dexterity and Agility (25%)\n- Sword Qi (50%)\nHidden Feature (3): If this true heavenly fate crystal is the only fate crystal in the owner's soul, the owner's cultivation ceiling will be capped at the Transcendent Level 10. Otherwise, the owner's cultivation base is capped at the Entity Realm or this effect is overridden by a superior true fate crystal.\n.\nThe content was different from Tang San's true heavenly fate crystal. Still, Leo was surprised by its usefulness.\n\"I guess it's tailored for you, Gao Yan.\"\n\"What is that, senior?\" Gao Yan was interested.\n\"Alright, come here. I'll explain.\"\nRepeated what he had offered Tang San, Leo let Gao Yan choose between the two options – The easy mode and the hard mode.\nSimilar to Tang San, Gao Yan made the decision instantly, \"I wish to take the long and arduous challenge, senior. I don't like the shortcut path. It sounds boring.\"\n\"If you say so.\"\nLeo shoved the true heavenly fate crystal into Gao Yan's body and imprinted it on his soul. Afterward, he let Gao Yan digest the new information and his \"Sword God System\".\nA system screen appeared in front of Gao Yan, informing the emergence of his sword system. He stared at it in astonishment for a while.\nWhile Gao Yan didn't pay attention to him, Leo shoved the vial of blood into Gao Yan's mouth and poured its contents down his throat. After ensuring that Gao Yan consumed the blood properly, he let the youth manage the blood.\n\"S-Senior?\"\n\"Work hard for me, boy. Also, don't end up like Tang San. I don't want to suffer a whole year watching some bouncing boobas.\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 324 – Florida Man Quit Playing with Firearms, Claims His Birthday Gun is More Useful in Bed Combat. His Neighbors Riot.\nEvery minute in the time chamber, the time in Leo's dantian universe passed by a day. Every day, Leo in the dantian universe grew older by almost 4 years. Two years in the time chamber forced Leo to train for 2,880 years.\nAfter the long and arduous training, Leo finally defeated Tang San for the first 1,000 times, earning him one of his skills.\n\"Finally.\" Leo celebrated. He was tired of the repeated defeat.\nThe clone of Tang San dissipated into nothingness while a void sword, made from a void leaf, was still stuck in Tang San's artificial soul. It vanished together along with the item.\nThe void leaf that disappeared restored its shape and Qi, returning to Leo's system inventory. Meanwhile, the system congratulated him.\n<Congratulations! You have defeated Tang San's clone at the highest difficulty 1,000 times!>\n<You have earned a special reward. Please choose one of Tang San's skills to learn.>\n<Please note. The system skills only include basic memory and knowledge that the clones possess. It doesn't reward you the skill mastery.>\n<Please note. If you defeat Tang San's clone at the highest difficulty 5,000 times, you can acquire all the clone's bloodlines and special physique perks.>\n<Please note. If you defeat Tang San's clone at the highest difficulty 10,000 times, you can acquire the clone's special weapon. The item will be directly transferred to your inventory.>\n\"I know,\" Leo grinned. He swiped the new system screen and picked his reward.\nDING\n<You have learned a new skill \"Transcend Dao of Invincibility\".>\n<Warning, you don't have the bloodline of Abyssal Black Tortoise. The dao is incomplete.>\n\"Tsk.\" Leo scoffed at the system message. Again, he was already aware of the shortcomings and the requirements. \"I know.\"\nWHOOSH\nThe system screen flashed and injected new memory into Leo's mind. It only lasted one second, but Leo felt like had dreamed for 10,000 years.\nOpening his eyes, Leo looked left and right like someone who was confused from a long dream. He mumbled, \"Who am I… Oh, yeah. I'm Leo, the Florida Man. What did I dream again?\"\nLeo's memory slowly returned. When he came to his senses, he concealed his aura and looked at the clock above the entrance gate of the time chamber.\nIt was the last day of Gao Yan's training schedule. They had to get out in two hours.\nLeo averted his eyes from the clock and searched for Gao Yan. It wasn't hard to find the young man.\nGao Yan spread his yellow flame wings and levitated in the sky. His antler horns radiated in the same color, containing an absurd volume of lightning element essence. His long black hair fluttered by the wind, but his gold pupils glowed. Even his trimmed beard had a gold aura. He no longer looked like a teenager but an adult in his mid-20s with that messy hair and beard.\nFurthermore, Gao Yan was no longer a regular deity who carried a few stars inside him. Instead, he hid a whopping 65,536 stars in his dantian universe. This didn't include his system's special skills and buffs.\nIn short, Gao Yan only needed one more push to advance to the sage realm. On this threshold, he would be able to create more stars inside his dantian and learn about karma.\n\"Gao Yan, prepare to leave. It's our last day here.\"\nHearing Leo's command, Gao Yan stopped cultivating. He concealed his wings and landed. After putting on his clothes, Gao Yan returned to Leo's side and reported his progress.\n\"Master, I've reached the bottleneck of the deity realm. I think I need another week or two to ascend.\"\n\"Do you still have the manuals I gave you?\"\nGao Yan flinched and searched through his clothes and spatial rings. Upon locating the entrusted manuals, Gao Yan let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"I still have them, master.\"\n\"Here is your homework. After you go back, do not bother ascending until you completely prepare another room for the third element. This time, I'll let you absorb a yang-based element to reinforce your foundation. Think of the element you want to learn while you're at it. Come back to me when you're ready.\"\n\"The third element, master? I thought two were enough.\"\n\"Fool. The flame and thunder combination is redundant in this universe. You need to master at least seven elements before you tackle the sage realm. Only then, your foundation will be strong enough to support your growth.\"\n\"This disciple understands.\"\nTheir interaction changed over the year. Gao Yan no longer called Leo by \"My Lord\", or \"Senior\" anymore. Instead, he acknowledged Leo as his mentor.Both men removed the dirt and grime on their bodies and left the time chamber on time. As usual, when they came out from the facility, the main character gang was there to welcome them.\nTang San, Jin Yong, and Yao Qiqi grinned from ear to ear. They sized up Tang San for a moment. When they noticed the new demeanor and the improved cultivation base, the group was astonished.\nTang San praised Gao Yan, \"Senior brother, I thought I caught up with your strength, but the gap is expanding again. I have to work harder!\"\nJin Yong smacked his lips, \"Lucky you, damn brat! I'm up next. Once I come out, my strength will surely surpass you!\"\nYao Qiqi was indifferent. She only paid attention to Gao Yan's face.\n\"Senior brother, how was it? Did Lord Florida Man try to feminize you like senior brother Tang San?\"\nGao Yan laughed, \"Silly girl. Master Florida Man unlocks our potential. We change because of our new bloodline and our different physique.\"\n\"So, if I enter there with Lord Florida Man, will he awaken my potential, too?\" Asked Yao Qiqi.\n\"Of course!\"\n\"Yay!\"\nYao Qiqi was excited. She wondered what kind of hidden potential she had.\nUnfortunately for her, when she turned around to look for Leo, the guy already disappeared.\nYao Qiqi pouted, \"Where is the Lord? He was here earlier!\"\nGao Yan and Tang San looked at each other and shook their heads as they didn't pay attention. On the other hand, Jin Yong saw Leo teleport away.\n\"He probably goes back to rest? Maybe?\" Jin Yong guessed.\n\"Aw…\"\n\"Last time, he postponed the schedule to take a one-day break. He probably needs to recuperate after a year of training too.\" Tang San also guessed.\nSince Leo wasn't around, the group dispersed. Although the four wanted to enter the time chamber while it was available, they were afraid of Leo, who might get angry at them.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo was on the bus. He visited Esen once more.\nEsen had been chilling on the bed, chatting with Ivy and Marc. They had been talking about their new relationship, and they wished to get married.\nLeo entered his bedroom and found the three. He was slightly disappointed.\n\"Oh, you're back. Good timing. I need your permission to hold a wedding ceremony for my subordinates.\" Esen pointed at Marc and Ivy, introducing the new couple.\nLeo glanced at the pair of lovebirds and raised his eyebrows. \"Are you a pedo, Ivy?\"\nIvy's expression turned dark while Esen laughed. The former complained.\n\"Of course not, Your Majesty. I am an upright woman! I don't date minors!\"\n\"But your husband is a… boy?\" Leo sized up Marc, who looked like a middle-schooler.\n\"He's over 10,000 years old, Your Majesty. We're all adults.\"\n\"But his physique…\"\n\"Physique and appearance have nothing to do with our love, Your Majesty!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo looked back and forth between Marc and Ivy. The dullahan kept looking down, avoiding eye contact as usual. As for Ivy, she embraced her husband from behind, encouraging him.\n\"A lich and a dullahan… what a pair.\" Leo sighed, \"Fine. Wedding or whatever, you handle it for me, wifey.\"\nEsen smirked, \"Sure. Do you mind if I splurge some essence stones and some food in the warehouse?\"\n\"How much do you need?\"\n\"Not much. A million essence stones should be fine.\"\n\"Oh, that's cheap.\"\nLeo had no issue forking a million essence stones from his pockets. As for Ivy and Marc, they almost vomited blood as those were a lot of money.\nGetting Leo's approval, Esen's mood was lifted. She then noticed the shifty eyes of Leo and his awkward expression.\nRealizing what Leo needed, Esen laughed and waved her hands, ordering her subordinates to leave.\n\"Leave us alone. I'll talk to you later. Also, you must tell me how you ended up together! I thought Marc would have married Beatrice for sure. But girl, you really SLAY!\"\nIvy giggled and bowed to her boss. She dragged Marc away from Leo's room and left them alone.\nLeo didn't waste his time. He threw away his clothes and got ready to jump his wife once more.\nEsen couldn't stop laughing at Leo, \"What happened to you? You look thirstier than Cat without nom-nom taxes.\"\nLeo pressed Esen down and grumbled.\n\"You have no idea how lonely it is to live by myself for 1,440 years.\"\n\"But you were away for only a day.\"\n\"A day to you. A thousand years for me.\"\n\"How sweet.\"\nOnce more, Leo recharged his mental battery with the love of his wife.\n…\nThe circle continued. The next day, Leo dragged Jin Yong into the time chamber and spent a day in reality there. When they came out, Jin Yong's cultivation base reached the same level as Gao Yan's.\nLeo took a day off once more. He went home to hug his wife. A day later, he returned fresh and brought Yao Qiqi into the time chamber.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, far, far away from Leo's planet, the war between Divine Elf Alliance and Overlord Planet Devourer reached the climax stage.\nWarships and dreadnaughts of Ellen Army finally took down the last of Planet Devourer's subordinates, but they also suffered a heavy casualty. 90% of the Divine Elf Kingdom's forces perished, and five million stars of her territory were forever lost. DEZNUTS council was dissolved as all senators and ministers fled from the scene.\nMeanwhile, Priscilla's phoenix forces remained intact. They surrounded Overlord Devourer and managed to restrain him. However, after a week of combat, everybody was exhausted.\nOverlord Devourer sneered at Priscilla, who hid behind her troops. He taunted her.\n\"Foolish phoenix! Your struggle is meaningless! No matter what you do, you cannot kill me! I've foreseen your plan!\"\nPriscilla in her rainbow phoenix appearance glared at the gigantic entity and bellowed.\n\"I don't believe you can outlast my power!\"\nPriscilla spread her wings and unleashed her rainbow flame, which engulfed the entire flesh monster. Some of his eyes were burnt to crisps.\nThe burnt eyes turned into dust, but new ones regenerated. Moreover, every newly regenerated body part was twice bigger than the destroyed parts. As a result, Overlord Planet Devourer's body slowly got bigger, which put a strain on the pheonix's sealing array.\nThe overlord sneered at Priscilla's futile attempt, \"Keep burning me, little phoenix! Once I'm done with your minions, I'll capture you and experiment with your body! I don't believe that we, the planet eaters, can't reproduce with the other races!\"\n\"You sick pervert!\" Priscilla and the phoenixes were disgusted. They increased their power output and accelerated the burning process.\n…\nWatching the fight from a distance was Overlord Xiaomao who clenched his new fishing rod in anger. Next to him, Ellen also observed the fight.\nEllen glanced at her ally and noticed his nervous expression. She encouraged him.\n\"She will be fine. There's no way that monster can endure her flame array for a week straight.\"\nOverlord Xiaomao, the fisherman, disagreed.\n\"I've calculated karma. We will lose this fight without fail.\"\n\"You… you're too pessimistic! If you give up right away, everybody here will die, including the Cathulhu Race that you have been protecting!\"\n\"…\"\nOverlord Xiaomao gulped. He glanced at his new weapon and thought of his catopus friends. Letting out a long sigh, Overlord Xiaomao made his resolve. He injected half of his lifespan into the fishing rod.\n\"I should have consumed the fate crystal like you did, but…\"\nThe fisherman rejected the fate crystal as he disliked systems. However, he still used it as a weapon.\nThe fishing rod was made from the entity fate crystal!\n\"No matter how strong you are, your soul can still be killed!\"\nOverlord Xiaomao cast the fishing hook toward Overlord Planet Devourer. It instantly hooked the monster's soul!\nPriscilla and Planet Devourer flinched and looked at Overlord Xiaomao in unison.\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!!\" Overlord Planet Devourer cackled, \"You've finally lost it, Xiaomao! This is where you die!\"\nOverlord Xiaomao narrowed his eyes, \"Not if I defy FATE AND KARMA!\"\nHe pulled his fishing rod, causing the hook to latch onto Overlord Planet Devourer. However, the monster flesh also caught the fishing line and pulled Overlord Xiaomao closer.\n\"You're the one being fished, Xiaomao!\"\n\"As if!\"\nThe fisherman and the whale monster initiated their first exchange.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 325 – Florida Man Mistakes Stranger Who is Being Robbed as His Father, Pulls a Gun, and Shoots Them Both\nFLASHBACK\nWhen Priscilla gathered Ellen, Xiaomao, and Lucky, she demonstrated how useful a true entity fate crystal was. Then, she gave one to Ellen.\nEllen was impressed by its ability and pledged allegiance to Priscilla. She also surrendered the territory of Divine Elf and DEZNUTS to the Phoenix race to survive.\n\"How about you, Overlord Xiaomao?\"\nPriscilla extended her offer to Overlord Xiaomao who ruled over the Cathulhu Race and their galaxy.\nXiaomao glanced at Ellen in reluctance. The old fisherman deeply sighed as he had no choice.\n\"Alright, but I will not absorb the true entity fate crystal into my soul. I'll transform it into a weapon instead.\"\nA true entity fate crystal was usually designed to be used as a consumable item. However, Overlord Xiaomao's wisdom transcended his cultivation base, and he was aware of the other usages.\n\"Why?\" Priscilla didn't understand Xiaomao.\nXiaomao bitterly laughed. He waved his arm and revealed his lifespan status screen to everybody.\nShockingly, he had two billion years to live like Leo. However, the number was deep red.\nEllen, Priscilla, and Lucky narrowed their eyes as they knew why the number had that color. They then turned to Xiaomao with an astonished look on their faces.\n\"Nu'Earthe…How many karmic souls did you tamper to get so many curses?!\" Overlord Lucky was stunned.\nEllen paused for a while, figuring out why Overlord Xiaomao denied the fate crystal. She finally understood him.\n\"No matter what you do, you cannot ascend. The karma rivers of this universe curse you.\"\nXiaomao nodded, \"Yes. That's why it's better to make a transcendent killing weapon instead of unlocking new talents. Also, if I can choose its owner, I can even pass it down to my successor… or my next reincarnation.\"\nPriscilla shook her head, \"Yeah, your current life is a lost cost. You have a time to serve. I hope your next reincarnation won't be a harsh one.\"\n\"You don't need to worry about me. If we all die here, there won't even be my next reincarnation. Let's focus on our plan first.\"\n\"Right.\" Priscilla agreed. She passed the last true entity fate crystal in her hands to Xiaomao.\nThe fisherman overlord brought out his fishing rod and merged it with the crystal. It radiated silver light for a few seconds and reverted to a normal-looking fishing rod.\nXiaomao gazed at his soul-bound weapon and bitterly smiled. He then put it away.\n\"You're not going to tell us what it can do?\" Overlord Lucky glared at his rival.\n\"Let's say… it can instantly yoink anyone's soul out of their fleshy body regardless of their cultivation base. Its effect is exactly what I design.\"\nPriscilla gave Xiaomao a meaningful look as she knew that the artifact had more abilities, yet she respected his privacy. The phoenix secretly sent the fisherman a sound transmission.\n'Tell me the other effects after the meeting. I need to plan out our ambush strategy.'\nXiaomao maintained his gaze on Lucky while he responded.\n'Understood. Sorry for the inconvenience. Lucky and I have a long history together. He destroyed my home planet, and I destroyed his. For the past 30,000 years, we tried to kill each other's underlings, and I went overboard… Well, you saw my curse. You can guess what I did.'\n'I see. Did he have that curse, too?'\n'No. Cathulhus aren't so weak that Lucky and his werewolf race can capture them. I'm the only one who abuses the karma rivers here.'\n'Indeed, you went overboard. It doesn't matter. I'll personally ensure you a safe reincarnation after this mess.'\n'Thank you.'\nThey stopped communicating and paid attention to Lucky, who was eager to get his true entity fate crystal.\nBut the next move of Priscilla surprised everybody once again. She handed a true heavenly fate crystal to Lucky instead.\n\"This is yours.\"\nLucky stared at the inferior fate crystal. Then, he bellowed in anger.\"He's got the entity fate crystal, but why I'm getting the heavenly one!\"\nPriscilla snorted, \"You're weaker than him, obviously. Will you take it or not. If you don't want to take it, bring your people away and go hide in the corner of the universe!\"\n\"YOU…\"\nLucky was enraged and was envious of Overlord Xiaomao. He glanced at the fisherman and narrowed his eyes for a long time.\n\"Fine.\" Lucky surprised everybody, \"I'll accept the offer and join your forces, but I want another true heavenly fate crystal. I know you have more!\"\n\"Alright.\" Priscilla tossed another crystal at Overlord Lucky without hesitation.\nThe wolf received it and consumed both. He closed his eyes and digested the two systems.\nDING\nDING\nTwo system screens appeared in front of Lucky, and everybody around him could see them. Xiaomao glanced at them and let out a sigh.\nOne was a typical leveling system with upgradable classes, attribute points, and weird conditional system skills. As for the other system, it was named \"Dantian Eater\".\nXiaomao had a bad feeling about this while Ellen and Priscilla's expressions were indifferent. After all, Overlord Lucky was a weak entity like Xiaomao, who couldn't pose a threat to them after the war.\nOverlord Lucky sneered at Xiaomao, \"Just you wait, Nu'Earthe. After the war, we'll settle this!\"\nXiaomao shook his head, \"Focus on our plan first.\"\n\"Ha! Fine!\"\nAfterward, the group discussed the scheme and strategies to trap Overlord Planet Devourer and his karmic sovereign planet eaters.\n.\n.\nPRESENT\nOverlord Xiaomao gnashed his teeth and pulled the fishing rod with all his strength. A tip of Planet Devourer's soul slipped out of his body, but it quickly submerged into the abominable mass of flesh.\nFighting back, the flesh monster injected black Qi into the fishing line, which traveled toward Xiaomao.\nXiaomao saw the black Qi coming after him, but he could do nothing. He tightened his grip and braced for the attack.\nThe black Qi seeped into Xiaomao's arms and infiltrated his dantian universe. It instantly destroyed a million stars inside him.\nXiaomao was patient. He paced his breath and muttered.\n\"Sin of Gluttony… Devour them all.\"\nRUMBLE\nThe stars in his dantian universe transformed into catfish, giant Cathulhus, and cute cat-octopi. They rushed toward the black Qi and devoured them.\nThe tiny creatures gnawed and swallowed the Qi of the transcendent being. Many exploded because of the backlashes, but no one showed fear. Instead, they ate the black Qi faster.\nSome of the creatures bloated after they were full. A few seconds later, they split into two and two into four like one-cell microorganisms. The separated creatures then transformed into stars, replenishing the lost cultivation base.\nThat was not the end of Xiaomao's ability. He uttered another word.\n\"Sin of Sloth… Go to sleep.\"\nThe flow of Qi decelerated and slowly stopped circulating inside him. Moreover, Xiaomao inserted his Qi into his fishing rod and sent them toward the monster whale.\n\"Sin of Wrath… KILL!\"\nXiaomao's white Qi turned red and traveled through the sea of black Qi like a bright ray of light in the dark. Instantly, it pierced into Overlord Planet Devourer's body.\nThe transcendent monster sensed a sharp pain in his body. It stung like an insect bite.\n\"Heh! I told you – Your effort is futile! A mere entity can't possibly harm me, a transcendent being!\"\nXiaomao deeply exhaled while he sweated profusely. The corners of his mouth curved up into a smile.\nA few kilometers behind Xiaomao, Lucky and Ellen were on standby. Both overlords glanced at the fisherman and smacked their lips.\n\"That whale is an idiot.\" Lucky was annoyed as he knew about Xiaomao's secret abilities and his power.\n\"As expected of Overlord Xiaomao. He's not nicknamed as the strongest entity in the universe for nothing. Who would have thought of converting the curse of seven sins into his power?\" Ellen was impressed.\n\"If any idiot copies him, they will die a painful death.\"\n\"You sure know a lot about him, traitorous wolf.\"\n\"Same goes for you, traitorous princess.\"\nThey continued to observe the fight, allowing Xiaomao, Planet Devourer, and Priscilla to get tired first. While waiting, Lucky opened his system menu and allocated his status points, preparing for the next phase of combat.\nMeanwhile, Ellen meditated and recuperated from her injuries. While she was at it, she scanned through the universe, searching for her surviving subordinates.\n'Hmm?'\nAfter scanning for a while, Ellen unexpectedly detected the presence of a mercenary, which had gone missing. He was several galaxies away from their location, but his aura was easy to detect.\nThe person's aura was bright, oppressive, and domineering like a dragon.\nThat was not all. Ellen detected the life signature of a transcendent being close by. Moreover, it had the same scent as Priscilla.\nShe had met that man before at the Fate Stadium. She recognized him well.\n'Ah, Ohio Man? You're alive, I see. And that person… Florida Man?'\nEllen was baffled. When they met, she thought he was just one of many lurking karmic sovereigns. The fact that Leo was a transcendent being surprised her.\n'Did he just break through? Or was it his true cultivation base all along? How did I miss this?'\nCurious, she probed further by sending a fragment of her consciousness toward Leo to snoop on him.\nBut as the old saying – If you look into the darkness, the darkness looks back at you. Suddenly, the person that Ellen was peeking at looked up and stared at her.\n\"!!!\"\nPanicked, Ellen pulled her consciousness back and panted. For a moment, she thought that her soul was pulled out of her fleshly body.\n'That was dangerous. Did he see me? I don't even detect his Qi usage!'\n.\n.\nYan Empire Planet\nLeo gazed at the ceiling of his shopping complex and squinted his eyebrows. Pondering for a moment, he scratched his eyes and peeled a layer of his eye-boogers, which he smeared on an earth fate crystal.\nThe fate crystal glittered in response. A minute later, it turned green.\nDING\n<You have successfully upgraded an earth fate crystal into a sky fate crystal!>\n<Please be careful. There is a 50% chance that the upgrade can fail. If you fail to upgrade a fate crystal, it will be destroyed!>\n\"I know.\"\nLeo picked his nose and extracted a piece of booger. Again, he swiped it on the sky fate crystal in his hand. For a good measure, he spat on it.\nThe newly upgraded sky fate crystal changed color once again. It turned blue this time.\nDING\n<You have successfully upgraded a sky fate crystal into a heavenly fate crystal!>\n<Please be careful. There is a 75% chance that the upgrade can fail. If you fail to upgrade a fate crystal, it will be destroyed!>\n\"I also know that.\"\nLeo put the heavenly fate crystal away as he no longer had the ingredients to upgrade another one for the day. He brought out a leaf of void tree and put it in his mouth. Then, he ate it raw.\nDING\n<You have consumed a leaf of Void Tree.>\n<For 24 hours, you will be blessed with great luck.>\nLeo glanced at the clock and remembered the time. It was 1.19 PM.\n\"1.19 PM? Noted.\"\nLeo tilted his head left and right before he cut his left palm with his nail. As soon as he cut it, a branch of a transparent tree came out and sprouted a purple leaf.\nHe plucked the branch and rubbed his wound, which was healed instantly. Leo then stored the small branch and the leaf away.\nDING\n<You have obtained a weak branch of Void Tree.>\n<You have obtained a leaf of Void Tree.>\nLeo snickered and shook his head. He liked the new ability.\n\"I should have searched for this thing earlier. This is such a HAX. Who would have thought that I could upgrade fate crystals twice a day by eating a stupid leaf? And what the hell, my body can reproduce that same leaf, too! I eat, I create, and I upgrade! What a cheat… Oh, wait. Should I start farming fate crystals? Can I plant these branches and let them grow more leaves? Hmm.\"\nLeo stroked his chin and looked at the ceiling again. When he gazed beyond the ceiling, he saw the bright stars in the universe.\nLooking at the stars reminded Leo of a snooper earlier. He stopped pondering about his future business plan and gazed further into the void.\n'Who the hell snooped me earlier? Was it another enemy?'\nThinking of the previous giant whale, Leo thought of the loot that he got from it. He salivated, wondering what he might get if he could kill more monsters of the same type.\n'Will there be more whales like that for the butcher? Let's see here.'\nLeo focused his eyes and spread his sense far and wide, scanning the universe. A 3D hologram map appeared in Leo's mind like a radar, mapping the universe.\nWithin 10 seconds, the whole map of the universe was completed. He also detected the movements of space entities, spaceships, and objects.\nSeeing everything in his mind was exhilarating. He felt like a kid learning about stars and spaces for the first time.\nUnfortunately, his excitement died when he found a grand battle between super experts at the center of the universe. A flesh-like whale monster, bigger than the one Leo had met, was trapped by a group of phoenixes.\nLeo also found Priscilla, Ellen, and Lucky. What surprised him the most was the presence of Overlord Xiaomao, who had the same look as one of his golems – Aslan.\n'That man.'\nThe face of his obnoxious father overlapped with the overlord. At first, Leo disregarded the overlord as someone with the same face. However, when he saw the troubled expression of Xiaomao, Leo's expression changed.\nIt reminded him that his father had gone missing again. That scheming golem went off somewhere, and Leo hadn't seen him in the past week. He wondered if Aslan was in the battle.\n\"Dammit!\"\nWithout hesitation, he teleported, traveling through material objects and the void toward the battle scene.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Aslan was inside the cow level. As the cows overpopulated this realm, he worked hard to cull them, preventing the monsters from invading Leo's realm.\nSuddenly, he sneezed. Aslan paused and wiped his nose.\n\"Odd. I'm a freaking statue. How did I sneeze?\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 326 – Florida Man Rescues Endangered Killer Whale from Hunters, Shockingly Discovers His Mother Among Them, Prompts Pursuit to Murder the Escaped Whale.\nCRACK\nThe sealing array surrounding Planet Devourer weakened. The flesh whale gradually consumed the flame of Priscilla and her minions' energy while he gathered strength to break the seal.\nPriscilla's expression changed. She bellowed.\n\"HOLY FLAME!\"\nThat was her ultimate system ability. By enveloping a target with her flame, it would erode the soul of the target from within regardless of cultivation base and strength difference. However, this power would also consume one to two billion years of her lifespan peruse.\n\"HAHAHAHA! YOU FINALLY USE ALL YOUR CARDS! NOW, MY TURN!\" Planet Devourer cackled. \"SYSTEM DESTRUCTION!\"\nPriscilla wasn't the only one with a system skill. Planet Devourer also had a trump card waiting for this occasion. He ejected seven entity fate crystals that he had been hiding in his flesh and merged them into a true entity fate crystal. Then, he crushed it.\nCLANK!\nAs Planet Devourer had foreseen, by destroying the new entity fate crystal, he could cancel a system user's abilities and remove her power entirely! Moreover, everybody in the area would be affected.\nBOOM\nA shockwave blasted everybody around Planet Devourer. Lucky, Ellen, Priscilla, and the phoenixes were blown away. Only Xiaomao managed to resist the shockwave as he was tied to Planet Devourer with his fishing rod.\nAt the same time, Priscilla's ability reached Planet Devourer and struck his soul. Feeling the pain of soul flame, he screeched and thrashed around in pain.\nDING\nDING\nDING\nSystem messages appeared in front of everybody, informing them that their systems were being forcefully uninstalled!\nEllen, Lucky, Priscilla, and the phoenixes who owned system skills vomited blood as their souls and bodies were cut from the inside. The backlash degraded their cultivation base by a major realm!\nXiaomao, on the other hand, didn't receive a system message or a backlash as he didn't have any fate crystal in his soul. He only felt a strong gale pushing him backward.\nThe fisherman overlord looked around and realized the dire situation. He clicked his tongue.\n\"This is why you shouldn't implant fate crystals into your soul! No cultivator should rely on that shortcut!\"\nAs everybody was critically injured, Xiaomao was the only capable fighter of their forces. He gathered his strength and increased his power output, stabbing Planet Devourer with his silver Qi.\n\"HAHAHAHAHA! YOU'RE BY YOURSELF NOW, CATHULHU OVERLORD!\"\nPlanet Devourer cackled while he endured the remaining eroding flame in his soul. Half of him was burnt to a crisp, and he couldn't regenerate his flesh. However, his cultivation base never regressed because of several artifacts inside his stomach.\nSuddenly, Planet Devourer spat 100,000 purple leaves from his mouth and burst into laughter.\n\"IT'S OVER! TASTE THE DESPAIR!\"\nAll 100,000 void leaves dissipated into purple dust, which were assimilated with Planet Devourer's body. Instantly, his body and soul were completely healed. His dantian and energy were also restored.\nLike a video game player who witnessed the final boss use a healing spell on himself, Xiaomao almost cursed gods and the items that Planet Devourer had just used.\n\"N…No way.\" Priscilla was still dazed by the previous attack. When she noticed how Planet Devourer restored his health and Qi to his prime, she lost the will to fight.\nLucky's face turned dark. He immediately turned his tail and flew away from the battlefield. As for Ellen, she still couldn't believe that her cultivation regressed to the entity realm.\n\"NOOOOOO!!\" Ellen cried. She worked so hard to reach the karmic sovereign realm, but she lost all her progress. Moreover, her soul and dantian were in a mess that she wouldn't be able to recover her strength within 10,000 years.\nThe rest of the phoenixes were in disarray. Half of them fled in panic while the remaining half staggered in confusion.\nPlanet Devourer took his leisure time to break the weakened seal. He also slowly pulled Xiaomao's fishing line, which latched to his soul.\n\"That was fun, Priscilla. Too bad, our playtime is over. From now on, you shall become the seedbed for my reproduction experiment! As for your race and kin, I'll let them live for now since they might produce another fine woman like you! Hehehehe!\"\n\"…\"\nNobody uttered a word. Priscilla didn't even listen to Planet Devourer as she was still traumatized and shocked.Overlord Xiaomao glanced at Priscilla and Ellen. Upon noticing their expressions, he let out a long sigh. Then, he mustered his courage.\n\"Even if our chance of winning is one in a billion, I will not give up!\"\nThe fisherman deeply inhaled and injected all his Qi and life force into his fishing rod. The fishing line glittered and multiplied into a trillion wire-like strings.\nThe strings detached from the finishing rods and began moving like snakes. They rushed toward Planet Devourer.\nA billion threads pierced into the whale's body like hungry parasites. The rest of them turned into ropes, coiling and tying the massive body of the monster. Then, they tightened and threatened to cut Planet Devourer into pierces.\nPlanet Devourer ignored the attacks and shifted his eyes toward Overlord Xiaomao. He gave the old man a meaningful look.\n\"One in a billion, you say? You know what? Let me calculate that chance for you. I think one in a billion is an overstatement. Your chance should be even lower than that. Maybe… no chance at all? HAHAHAHAHA!\"\nPlanet Devourer closed his eyes and activated his system to predict the result of this fight one hour in the future. A thousand timelines of possible future turned into memory, which entered his mind.\n\"…Huh?\"\nSomething strange occurred in the memory.\nFor some reason, they were all black. All predicted events were either blank or black as if the scenes were abruptly cut off.\n\"This is odd.\"\nThis was Planet Devourer's first time experiencing this. He stopped playing around and looked deeper, wondering what went wrong.\nAgain, all predictions showed as black scenes.\nPlanet Devourer opened his eyes as he sensed something amiss. He started asking his system.\n\"SYSTEM! FORECAST THE RESULT OF THIS WAR! WHO WILL BE THE VICTOR?!\"\nDING\n<There is a 100% chance that Priscilla and her alliance will win this war.>\n\"WHAT?!\" The answer shocked Planet Devourer. \"BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! I'VE ALREADY CRIPPLED THEM ALL! WHO IS GOING TO DEFEAT ME?!\"\nDING\n<The major contributor to this war is Florida Man.>\n\"???\"\nPlanet Devourer paused for a few seconds. He wasn't familiar with the name. At the back of his head, he knew that he heard this name before, but he couldn't remember it.\n\"Who?\"\n<Leonardo 'Florida Man' Ariel, the son of Aslan Ariel.>\n\"!!!\"\nFinally, Planet Devourer remembered the name. After all, he had been stalking Aslan and Eleanor's events for a long time.\nAs this was the first time his system predicted his defeat, Planet Devourer panicked. He closed his eyes and calculated his future again. This time, he shortened the scan and calculated the next 10 minutes.\nDING\nNew scenes entered his mind. A middle-aged man with a transparent scythe would appear in the next few seconds. They would fight, but all fights resulted in Planet Devourer's death.\nUnable to believe in the predicted future, Planet Devourer opened his eyes and bellowed.\n\"FLORIDA MAN! I'LL BE SURE TO HUNT YOU DOWN!\"\nThe giant whale rapidly shrank, escaping from Xiaomoa's restraints. After fleeing himself from the fishing lines, he vanished, fleeing toward the Void Tree.\n…\nWHOOSH\nLeo arrived at the battlefield in space. He paused and looked around, checking the conditions of Priscilla and Xiaomao.\nUpon seeing Overlord Xiaomao's face, Leo was disappointed.\n\"Oh, you're not my father. Sorry, I mistook you for the wrong person.\"\nXiaomao tilted his head in confusion. Although he was relieved that Planet Devourer suddenly retreated, he didn't let his guard down against Leo.\n\"Are you Overlord Florida Man of the Yan Empire Planet?\"\nLeo pursed his lips, \"That nickname is cringe. Just call me Florida Man for short. No more prefixes or suffixes, please.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\n\"But before that…\" Leo noticed the weird state of Priscilla, Ellen, and the phoenixes. He swept his gaze and searched for the perpetrator, \"Where is that abomination that you fought earlier?\"\n\"He… runs away.\"\n\"I see. Which direction?\"\nXiaomao turned right and pointed in the general direction of the void tree. \"Probably there. There's the Void Tree five galaxies away, but I doubt those planet eaters leave any star behind. You will have to fly through the dark.\"\n\"No problem.\"\nLeo thanked Xiaomao and gazed in that direction. His eyes gleamed in green light while he scanned the entire universe with his senses.\nPONG\nLike a sonar wave, a silent and faint shockwave expanded and covered the entire space. The map of the universe appeared in Leo's mind, updating the information.\nThen, Leo saw the Void Tree for the first time. He also found the mysterious flesh monster that attacked Xiaomao and Priscilla earlier.\nWhile Leo mumbled to himself, Priscilla came back to her senses. When she saw Leo, she was surprised.\n\"You… why are you here?\"\nHearing Priscilla's question, Leo smirked and messed with her, \"Saving my foster mother's tits, what else?\"\n\"…\"\nInstead of being angry, Priscilla reverted to her human form. She pulled Leo into her valley.\nBecause of the size difference, Leo was buried in the flesh mountains.\n\"Thank you! Your mother thought she would become that monster's meat slave for eternity. I'm glad my son is here to save me!\"\nLeo was annoyed, but her didn't reject the soft mountains. He slowly climbed out of the giant cleavage and coughed.\n\"Dearest mother, I'm married. We might be mother and son, but we're not actually related by blood.\"\n\"Bullshit. You have my blood essence. You are of my blood!\"\n\"Then… you probably need to respect HIM as one of my fathers.\" Leo pointed at Xiaomao.\n\"Him?\" Priscilla was confused for a moment. But then, she realized something absurd.\nLeo had Xiaomao's bloodline in him as well. Although it was faint, Leo's dantian and blood carried a tinge of Xiaomao's unique dao – The Seven Sins Dao.\nPriscilla was speechless. She glanced at Xiaomao in disgust.\n\"I can't believe I have to share my son with you, Overlord Xiaomao.\"\n\"Share what?\" Xiaomao was clueless about this matter. He felt like Priscilla misunderstood him.\n\"Anyway,\" Leo stopped them from the internal fight. \"I'm busy. I'm going to chase that abomination of a fish for a second.\"\n\"W-Wait! That's dangerous!\" Priscilla flustered, worrying for Leo's safety.\nLeo didn't listen to Priscilla. He vanished, flying through space as if he could teleport across the universe.\n.\n.\n\"I'm alive!\"\nPlanet Devourer arrived at a perch of the Void Tree. He gnawed a branch, a million void leaves, and a thousand fate crystals at once.\nAfter swallowing everything, Planet Devourer looked behind him. Upon seeing how Leo wasted his time talking with Priscilla and Xiaomao, he was relieved.\n\"Heh, idiot. You should have struck me when you had a chance! Now, what is the future? How do I defeat Florida Man!? Tell me, system!\"\nDING\n<Calculating…>\n<You have the advantage of fate crystal quantity. You should start combining fate crystals to produce at least one true entity fate crystal to help you fight against Florida Man.>\nPlanet Devourer was relieved. He started calculating his victory chance next.\nUnfortunately, the result terrified Planet Devourer.\nDING\n<You have a 0% chance of victory against Florida Man!>\n\"WHAT?! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!!\"\nPlanet Devourer couldn't believe it. A few days earlier, the possibility of him killing everybody in the universe was 99%. However, the new prediction didn't make sense.\nNot giving up, Planet Devourer used the system to see into the future. He peeked into a million timelines in the next five minutes.\nUnfortunately, he no longer had the time to do so.\nWHOOSH\nWhile Planet Devourer wasted his time calculating the future, Leo already arrived. He floated in front of the Void Tree, staring at the monster whale.\nLeo grumbled and rotated his arms, warming up.\n\"Let's get this over with, you dork. I don't know you, but you probably know me. You sent your goon after my brother and me for some reason, and you bullied my foster mom. Therefore, I have a legitimate reason to shove oversized durian-smelled dynamites up your rectum and have them blown from the inside. Now, can you do me a favor and die quietly so that I can move on with my life?\"\n\"…You.\" Planet Devourer had never seen a cocky and obnoxious human like Leo before. He was offended. \"How dare you use that tone to me?! Who do you think you are?!\"\n\"Who am I?\" Leo coughed and deepened his voice. \"I AM FLORIDA MAN!\"\nLeo ejected 10 void leaves from his soul and transformed them into a purple scythe.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 327 – A Million Cat Found in Florida Man's House, Claims He Gave Birth to All of Them.\n\"I REFUSE TO BELIEVE MY FATE! YOU WILL DIE HERE! FLORIDA MAN!!\"\nPlanet Devourer screamed while countless eyeballs of his body split open, transforming into mouths. They bit and tore every void leaf and fate crystal on the tree. Absorbing the tree barks, branches, and leaves inside him, Planet Devourer's strength soared. His size doubled, matching the size of the gigantic tree.\nDespite being eaten, the void tree restored its leaves, branches, and fate crystal fruits. Moreover, it learned from the crisis and reproduced more branches and leaves, struggling to survive.\nThe tree grew larger as a result. It also emanated purple poisonous miasma to protect itself.\nPlanet Devourer absorbed the miasma and laughed. He taunted Leo.\n\"I now have the strength of a hundred level 10 transcendence! You are no match to me-\"\nSWUA\nWhile Planet Devourer was busy blabbering nonsense, Leo silently swung the scythe, cutting the void. A crack appeared in the dimension where Planet Devourer was.\nThe whale monster was split in half. Planet Devourer was flabbergasted as he couldn't see the attack.\nAlthough he was surprised, some of his eyes peeked into the dimension crack. Then, they found a weird universe with no stars.\nStunned and panicked, Planet Devourer slipped into the crack and entered the strange void.\nLeo snorted at the coward whale and waved his scythe. Upon the gesture, the crack was sealed, severing half of Planet Devourer's body.\nUnfortunately, the whale was too fast. His soul and his dantian already entered the dimension crack. As for the remnant body parts, they were his discarded flesh.\nThe mass of flesh without an owner slowly bloated and glowed. They condensed monster Qi and initiated an ability that Leo also had.\nThe flesh and blood of Planet Devourer self-detonated!\n\"…\"\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nA thousand consecutive explosions generated the deadliest shockwave blast, destroying everything within a million light-years of distance.\nWhen the explosions subsided and the dust settled, the void tree remained unharmed.\nWHOOSH\nLeo's invisible body emerged on top of the void tree after he had slipped through the gaps of shockwaves. Calmly, he unplugged a void leaf and sniffed it.\nIt smelled like the first batch of 10 leaves that he ate. They tasted like beer mixed with Red Bull.\n\"Seriously, this is good stuff. I wish I had known about this tree earlier. Oh, well.\"\nLeo patted the tree and attempted to store it in his system inventory. However, the system warned him.\nDING\n<You cannot store KEY ITEMS.>\n\"…This is new.\"\nLeo was slightly disappointed. Still, he used his scythe as a harvester, cleaving a dozen tree branches and collecting ten thousand void tree leaves at once. This time, he successfully stored them in his inventory slots.\nBefore chasing after the whale, Leo stretched his thumb and pinky finger, making a phone call gesture. He then licked the tip of his thumb and sent a sound transmission to Simba back home.\nWithout waiting for the dial tone, Leo started sending messages.\n\"Hey, yo, Simba! You still have that giant battleship with you, right? If I remember correctly, that thing has something called 'Omnipresent Drive' or something. If that thing is OMNIPRESENT, can you teleport the whole thing here at my coordinate? I need your help to bring something home.\"\nA few seconds later, a gigantic dreadnaught mothership appeared and hovered over the void tree. A thousand battleships flew out of the gold dragon ship and surrounded it.\nSimba and Cheese also flew out of the mothership and landed on top of the void tree. They inspected the purple entity and questioned Leo.\"Leo, what the hell is going on here?\"\nSimba used his system ability to locate Leo's location and piloted the dreadnaught mothership here. He thought that Leo was in trouble.\n\"Nothing much. I need you guys to drag this whole thing to our galaxy.\"\nSimba wryly smiled, \"Impossible. Do you know that this thing is bigger than our FREAKING GALAXY?!\"\n\"If you can't, just take as many leaves and… crystals as you can.\"\nLeo pointed at the fruits of the tree, which looked similar to the fate crystals that they had.\nSimba frowned and looked down. He dove into the sea of leaves and landed on a giant perch.\nAt the tip of the perch, a massive fruit was hidden there. Simba got closer and discovered that it was larger than the Solar System's Sun.\n\"…Holy.\"\nSimba knew what it was. That was an entity fate crystal, but its quality surpassed every fate crystal that he had seen. Without hesitation, he collected it and carried it with him.\nSimba got back to the top of the tree while lifting a white sun with one arm. He showed his loot to Leo.\n\"Leo, look at this. Are you sure that you want us to bring THIS to our solar system?!\"\n\"Yep! Oh, isn't that an entity fate crystal? You should collect them and put them in a safe place. I think I can upgrade it later.\"\n\"…WHAT?!\"\nLeo clapped his hands as his ADHD resurfaced. He stopped focusing on the tree and recalled what he had been doing.\n\"Sorry, I'm busy. I need to chase and kill a stupid monster first. I'll be right back, okay?\"\n\"Huh? Wait! You haven't explained your plan!\"\nIt was too late. After collecting the samples, Leo waved his scythe again, cutting open dimensions. Then, he entered the starless void, pursuing the coward whale.\nSimba looked at the disappearing figure of his brother. He rubbed his brows, having a headache. He remembered why his brother left a deep impression on him.\n\"Right. I forgot. Leo was always… a troublemaker.\"\n.\n.\nIn the starless dimension, Planet Devourer flew randomly, searching for an object or star to use as a landmark. However, the dark void was so empty that it troubled him.\nWithout a landmark, Planet Devourer was lost.\n\"Where the hell am I?! Akashic Record, tell me! Where are we?!\"\nDING\n<You are at the coordinate -327FBRY5381230, -114664GSH2339123, -2024JNW4640796.>\n<This location is an uncharted universe where expanding galaxies and stars have never reached. If you travel 20NE-50PLUS for 937 light years using your full speed, you will find the belt of the universe.>\nAlthough 937 light-years sounded short of Planet Devourer's standard, the system referred to his max speed, which transcended the speed of light. His thousand eyes narrowed in disbelief.\n\"In short, I'll be starving for 900 years.\"\nDING\n<System calculates that it is pointless to worry about being starved.>\n<Warning! Danger approach! You will die in two minutes!>\n\"!!!\"\nPlanet Devourer realized that he was not in the clear yet. He looked around, searching for Leo. He also realized that he was stupid.\nIf Leo could cut open dimensions and send him to the corner of the universe, he could also travel across the universe using the same technique!\nSWUA\nWithout a warning, a dimensional crack appeared. Again, it appeared on top of Planet Devourer, beheading him in one slash.\nLeo slipped through the crack of the void and landed on top of Planet Devourer's head.\n\"FLORDIA MAN!!\"\nPlanet Devourer was still alive. His discarded body transformed into a billion space piranhas, rushing toward Leo.\nLeo glanced at the piranhas and lightly snorted. Small rocks were ejected from his system inventory and were fired toward the small creatures like bullets.\nThe inventory screen acted as a machine gun, shooting down everything in sight. Because of the inhuman rate of fire, the billion piranhas shattered into floated in the void, turning into messing space sashimi.\nPlanet Devourer didn't give up. He bellowed and regenerated his entire mass instantly. Then, his body grew countless tentacles, which freely shape-shifted into animal limbs, weapons, and lewd objects. Everything chased after Leo.\nLeo didn't move or react to the tentacles this time. He suddenly vomited a black marble and spat at Planet Devourer. The black rock softly landed on Planet Devourer's head, which sank into his flesh.\nAlthough confused, Planet Devourer absorbed the marble into his flesh and attempted to dissolve it with his digestive fluid. Instantly, the marble melted into particles and entered Planet Devourer's blood circulation system.\nWHOOSH\nWHOOSH\nThe tentacles successfully wrapped around Leo and caught him. Leo also stored his scythe back in his inventory and let out a long sigh.\n\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru.\" Leo warned the whale.\nPlanet Devourer cackled in response, \"You fool! I don't know what you're talking about, but this is the end! Nobody survives my precious tentacles! You know what? You're quite strong for a human! I'll transform your gender with my fluid, and I'll experiment on you instead! You will conceive my children!\"\n\"…Err. How about no?\"\n\"TOO LATE! YOU'RE MINE!\"\nOne of Planet Devourer's tentacles transformed into a snake, which opened its mouth and was about to spray pink liquid on him. As it opened its mouth, it flinched.\nPurple blood spread within Planet Devourer's body. At first, they consumed Planet Devourer's black blood as fertilizer. But when those purple blood cells matured, they evolved into purple seeds.\nPlanet Devourer's expression changed. He looked at his body in confusion.\n\"What is happening to me?!\"\nDING\n<You are infected with Mutated Void Phoenix Parasites.>\n<You will die in 100 milliseconds.>\n<It was nice knowing you.>\n\"WHAT?!\"\nPlanet Devourer couldn't comprehend anything. He forgot about his body condition and stared at the system screen in shock.\n\"YOU USELESS PIECE OF GARBAGE! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME HOW TO DEAL WITH MY ENEMIES!\"\nDING\n<You will die in 80 milliseconds.>\n<…70.>\n<…60.>\nBy the time that Planet Devourer heard the countdown, the blood seeds inside him already sprouted rainbow flame leaves, which consumed Planet Devourer's Qi as fertilizer. A million leaves and sprouts shot up into small plants on top of the flesh monster.\n<…50.>\nPlanet Devourer came back to his senses in the last few seconds. He remembered that he possessed so many entity fate crystals that he could use as a system bomb. He quickly merged a batch of seven entity fate crystals together.\n<…40.>\nA true entity fate crystal was condensed. Planet Devourer smirked and brought it out.\nSuddenly, Leo phased through the restraints as if he were a ghost. He teleported and snatched the true entity fate crystal from Planet Devourer's hands in front of his massive face.\n\"Ah, I can't let you do that.\" Leo giggled.\n<…30.>\n\"BASTARD!\" Planet Devourer was enraged. He ejected all fate crystals from his soul at once and merged everything. A dozen batches of true entity fate crystals appeared.\n<…20.>\n\"I don't believe that you can negate them all! DIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!\"\nPlanet Devourer caught every true entity fate crystals with his tentacles and crushed them.\n\"Eh, I can't let you do that.\" Leo let out another long sigh and snapped his fingers.\nCLICK-CLICK-CLICK\nA time domain was erected, freezing everything around him, including Planet Devourer and a dozen true entity fate crystals.\nLeo waved his hands and pulled all entity fate crystals toward him. He calmly collected everything in his system inventory.\n<…10.>\nDespite being frozen in time, Planet Devourer's system continued counting down as Leo's blood inside the monster didn't stop growing.\n\"NOOOOOO!!!\"\nIt was too late for the whale king. By the time he managed to break Leo's domain and move, Leo's virus already matured.\nBOOM\nBOOM\nBOOM\nA million rainbow trees emerged from Planet Devourer's body while their roots latched into his soul, eating away his life force. The flame trees melted all goo, limbs, and eyes of the whale monster until no flesh remained behind.\nOne of the trees sank its roots into Planet Devourer's soul and stole every star in his dantian universe. It then evolved into a galactic-sized rainbow flame tree, floating in the void.\n<…0.>\n<Skill Issues.>\nThe last system message mocked Planet Devourer even though his consciousness already turned black as he had predicted.\nDING\nThe true entity fate crystal was ejected from Planet Devourer's dried soul and floated in the void.\nLeo smiled and reached out to catch it.\nUnfortunately, the fate crystal disintegrated into dust before Leo could touch it.\n\"Oh.\"\nLeo was disappointed. He thought he would have scored 14 true entity fate crystals from this trip.\n\"Shame. Anyway, I got so many goodies. What should I be doing with these… Cat's siblings?\"\nHe gazed at the million rainbow trees, which turned the void into a space forest. One of them that absorbed the monster's dantian universe was also too big for Leo to bring it back home.\nThe trees didn't float there idly. As Leo granted them souls, they started gaining sentient. Their leader gradually transformed into a prismatic Alraune and shrank her size to match Leo's.\nThe new child greeted her creator with a bright smile.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\n\"…\"\nThe million trees quickly copied their leader. They gained sentient and transformed into flower women as well. After gaining a feminine body, they surrounded Leo.\n\"Meow?\"\n\"Nom-Nom?\"\n\"Meow Meow?\"\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nEverybody used Cat's former language.\nListening to these children, Leo got a migraine. He wondered if this was a curse.\n\"Why the hell do y'all speak a cat's language? I never taught you those!\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 328 – Florida Man Turns Ohio Youth into Flower Fertilizer Because His Daughter MILKED Youth's Fluid.\nLeo ended up guiding all Alraunes to the void tree. He cut open a dimension crack and used it to teleport everybody to the Void Tree.\nWhen Leo arrived, Simba and his dragonewts already started extracting void leaves and fate crystals. However, their performance was questionable.\nThe void tree constantly regenerated and multiplied its body parts, troubling the extraction team. The more they cut, the more leaves and fate crystals appeared.\nThe dragonewts grumbled while they chopped the tree branches and transported them back to their cargo ship. No one bothered stealing a leaf or a fate crystal.\nEverybody tried consuming a fate crystal or two. However, the fate crystals rejected them and left their souls.\nSimba had a headache. He also tried storing the fate crystals in his soul, but his soul rejected raw fate crystals from the tree. Without a choice, he wasted his precious inventory system slots, storing the leaves and fate crystals to bring them home.\nLeo arrived and checked Simba's progress. When he noticed how Simba used his system inventory instead, he got curious.\n\"Simba. Why don't you take in some fate crystals? If you consume some, you can gain a new system power.\"\nSimba sighed, \"Don't you think I tried?\"\n\"You did?\" Leo was surprised.\n\"How about you try it yourself and see what's going on?\"\n\"…\"\nCurious, Leo plucked a moon-sized entity fate crystal from the void tree and tried to absorb it. Instantly, it was ejected from his body, and a system message told him the reason.\nDING\n<The Void Tree doesn't acknowledge you as its owner. You cannot consume its fruit.>\n\"Uh, what?\"\nLeo was confused. He remembered that Planet Devourer ate so many fate crystals, and it was fine.\nConfused, Leo complained, \"Hey, damn tree. That stupid monster ate your branches and fruits, but it was fine. But when I tried to eat one, you rejected me. What the hell, dude?\"\nSimba nodded as he also received a similar message. Then, he gazed at the crowd of Alraunes who tagged along with Leo.\n\"Care to introduce those plant girls?\"\n\"Oh, them?\" Leo looked behind him and wryly smiled, \"What should I say? It's a long story.\"\nLeo was embarrassed. During the fight, he used one of Cat's personal techniques, which was effective against giant monsters. He still remembered her clone's status.\n.\nName: Cat\nRace: Prismatic Dryad\nCultivation Base: 666-River Karmic Sovereign\nSkills: Dao of Gluttony, Dao of Corruption, Dao of Void, Dao of Mother Tree, Dao of Mutation\nSpecials: Prismatic Dryad Bloodline, Florida Man Bloodline\nFavorite Weaponry: Void Splitting Whips\nPotential Percentage: 1,000%\n.\nAlthough Cat's final form wasn't as strong as Simba or other top experts, she had an interesting skillset. Leo already defeated her and learned all of her skills, which proved to be useful in the previous fight.\nDuring the last fight, Leo mixed his blood essence with impurity in his body, utilizing the dao of the mother tree and producing an egg of Void Tree's parasites. Then, he infected Planet Devourer with it.\nThe result spoke for itself. The egg was consumed, causing the parasite babies to enter Planet Devourer's blood veins. The parasites absorbed the host's blood and Qi. In the end, they grew and matured as Void Trees, which later transformed into Alraunes.\nAfter explaining to Simba how he created them, the former gave Leo a weird look.\"Do you, by chance, have a tree fetish? Come to think of it, Leo. When you were young, you sometimes climbed a tree naked and rubbed your butt on a thick perch. One day at night, I saw you hugging a tree while your pants were down. Did you-\"\n\"NOPE! SUCH EVENTS NEVER HAPPENED! NOPE!\"\nSimba tilted his head, \"Are you sure?\"\n\"NOPE! I NEVER FERTILIZED A TREE WITH MY MILK, EVER!\"\n\"…I didn't say that. I only imply-\"\n\"AND I NEVER STUCK IT INSIDE A TREE, EVER! DUDE, IT WAS COARSE, DRY, AND HARD AS HELL. IT EVEN SCRATCHES MY FORESKIN! WHY SHOULD I HUMB A TREE'S PUSSY WHEN IT'S SO HARD!!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo sweated profusely while Simba deeply frowned. The latter gave up digging deeper.\n\"Never mind. Pretend that I never asked.\"\nSimba changed the subject while he inspected the Alraunes. He noticed that one of them was bigger and stronger than the others. When he paid closer attention, he realized that the Alraune sprouted rainbow leaves. However, her leaves and vines had the same scent as the Void Tree.\n\"Are they Void Trees, Leo?\"\nLeo came back to his senses. He looked at his creations and sighed.\n\"Not really. They're prismatic trees; A variant of Void Tree.\"\nBoth Leo and Simba gazed at the girls, wondering what they should do with them. They didn't need to think too long as they began to show what they could do.\nOne of the Alraunes flew toward the void tree and plucked a small fate crystal. She sniffed it for a while before she opened her mouth and crushed it with her teeth. She chewed it in glee and burped when she was done.\nThe Void Tree replenished the immature fate crystal fruit. Instead of restoring one, it created two.\nThe same Alraune salivated and wrapped her arms around the branch. Her body suddenly merged with the Void Tree, transforming into a parasite. The leaves and the growing fruits withered as the Alraunes stole its energy.\n\"!!!\"\nLeo and Simba witnessed everything. They widened their eyes in astonishment.\nThe other Alraunes learned from their kin. They swarmed the Void Tree and vanished into the tree trunk.\nRUMBLE\nThe Void Tree wiggled as if it struggled to repel the symbiosis beings. Its purple color dimmed while its leaves fell off from the branches. All fate crystals on the tree were ejected from the tree and dimmed.\nSimba realized something. He caught one of the fate crystals and reattempted to consume it.\nDING\nIt worked this time, which confused Leo and Simba.\n\"It works!\"\n\"Hah?\"\nLeo scratched his head. He collected the fallen leaves and fate crystals before the hungry Alraunes could eat them all.\nRUMBLE\nThe Void Tree withered and shrank while a million rainbow flowers bloomed. On top of the flowers, the Alraunes came out and waved their hands at Leo and Simba.\nThe changes didn't end there. The biggest Alraune emerged from the top of the tree and replaced its roots with hers. Afterward, the entire void tree mutated into Prismatic Void Tree, which became a new home for Leo's creations.\n\"Meow!\"\n\"Meow-Meow!\"\nThey meowed and sang a weird cat's song together while the withered tree was replaced by a bigger and brighter tree trunk, created by their blood and Qi.\nIn the end, all one million Alraunes merged their roots as one and became one entity.\nPLOP\nPLOP\nNew tree leaves budded. Instead of producing semi-\ntransparent purple leaves, all leaves were diamond-like sparkling gemstones. Each radiated rainbow aura, similar to Leo's.\nLeo tilted his head and inspected the new Void Tree.\n\"What the hell did I just give birth to?\"\nSimba shrugged, \"You banged a tree. The tree gave birth to your daughters.\"\n\"…\"\nAll dragonewts stopped working and observed the new void tree. They didn't dare to get closer because of the strange rainbow aura from the tree leaves.\nCheese was different. He tested the tree, plucking one of its gem leaves.\nAs soon as Chase pulled the leaf, the rainbow diamond leaf shapeshifted into a rainbow slime, biting Cheese's hand.\n\"OW-OW-OW-OW! GET OFF ME!\"\nCheese threw the sime away. The rainbow slime got off Cheese's hand and returned to the tree, assuming the appearance of a diamond leaf.\nThe dragonewts flinched and backed away from the tree, afraid of the new leaves and the Alraunes.\nSimba and Leo glanced at Cheese for a moment before they used their system perks in unison.\n\"Appraisal!\" Said Simba.\n\"Identify!\" Leo uttered.\nDING\n.\nPrismatic Void Tree\nThis variant of Void Tree was born from Florida Man's blood essence and impurity. He created void tree seeds with the Dao of Mother Tree when he fought a transcendence-realm Overlord Planet Devourer. The Void Tree's seeds absorbed the overlord's blood and Qi, which mutated into a million prismatic void saplings. All saplings later merged as one, transforming into a completed Prismatic Void Tree.\nThis tree constantly produces Prismatic Leaves, which can be used to open a dimensional gate to the higher universe. However, after the usage, the used leaf will disappear.\nWhen the tree bears fruits, all fruits will evolve into fate crystals. Depending on the size and Qi, they can become fate crystals of any quality. However, the fruits of this tree may reject the consumer if it contains a sentient being inside.\nThe Prismatic Void Tree can be considered a calamitous being as it grows by absorbing all Qi in the universe. The only way to stop it from consuming the entire universe as food is to offer a million young men with great vitality as a sacrifice once every 1,000 years. The parasitic Alraunes in the tree need yang Qi and a man's seed to sustain. Therefore, if the sacrificed men can constantly produce seeds for the Alraune parasites, the prismatic void tree will stay dormant.\n.\nLeo and Simba smacked their foreheads as they got themselves another headache. The former regretted creating these plant girls.\n\"What have I done?\"\nSimba groaned, \"This is why Father always calls you a troublemaker.\"\n\"I didn't mean to create them!\"\n\"Then, why the hell did you use that dao when you fought Planet Devourer whoever that was!?\"\n\"But that's the only way to defeat a giant monster with the transcendent realm cultivation base!\"\n\"…\"\nAgain, both men sighed. They gazed at the void tree's Alraunes, who drooled and stared at the male draongewts nearby. One of them even opened her arms to seduce the young dragonkin.\n\"Meow Meow <3\"\nThe dragonewt flinched and backed away. Seeing that her prey didn't fall for the honey trap, the Alraune cried.\n\"…\"\nThe male dragonewt regretted making a girl cry. He fell for it and flew closer to the Alraune to console her. Unfortunately, she stopped shedding crocodile tears and pulled the male dragonewt into a hug. The massive flower petals underneath her closed while she pulled him into the tree trunk.\nThe male dragonewt resisted, but it was too late. He got sucked into the void tree and was trapped with the Alraune earlier. The surface of the closed petals trembled because the couple initiated their activity.\n\"…\"\nLeo and Simba witnessed everything from the beginning to the end. The latter pointed at the perverted Alraune and looked at his brother.\n\"Can you help my subordinate?\"\n\"Do I have to? He is probably enjoying it right now.\"\n\"That plant girl won't kill him, right?\"\n\"Look. Your subordinate is a freaking entity. What is my daughter? A freaking mortal monster! I should be the one asking your subordinate to show her mercy.\"\n\"Are you sure? Those girls don't look like mortals to me.\"\nLeo pointed at the flower again. Its petals slowly opened, revealing the back and the wings of the male dragonewt. However, the boy refused to leave for some reason and pushed himself back into the void tree.\n\"See?\" Leo smirked, \"You should be the one disciplining your men.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Anyway, we get ourselves the first sacrificial lamb. Can I borrow some of your dragonewts to seed my daughters?\"\n\"…You sick fuck.\"\n\"Thanks!\"\n\"That's not a compliment.\" Simba rolled his eyes.",

As for the newly grown fruits of the Prismatic Void Tree, both Leo and Simba left them alone.\nThe group brought the loot and visited Priscilla. When they arrived with the battleship fleet, Priscilla, Ellen, and Xiaomao welcomed their return.\nXiaomao smiled and saluted, \"Congratulations on your victory, Overlord Florida Man. I believe you are now the strongest overlord in this universe.\"\nPriscilla was still under the weather, but she was happy.\n\"Great job, little boy! You're the king of the universe now.\"\nEllen hesitated to say anything. But as a lowly entity whose cultivation base degraded from the karmic sovereign realm, she was no longer in the position of power. Thus, she accepted her fate and bowed.\n\"As a representative of divine elves, I hope you can show mercy to our people. We also would like to surrender to you if you allow us.\"\nSimba exited the dreadnaught battleship and came out. Coincidentally, he saw Ellen surrendering to Leo.\nEllen also noticed Simba. Upon detecting his current cultivation base, she flinched. However, she didn't comment on his new appearance and why he was by Leo's side.\nLeo dismissed the formality, \"Relax. I'm here to clear up the mess. To be honest, I'm a peace-loving man. I hate bloodshed, and I hate wars. If we can co-exist in this universe, I'll be happy to cooperate with y'all.\"\nXiaomao widely grinned while Priscilla laughed. As for Ellen, she sighed, abandoning her ambition.\n\"So, what's next, my son?\" Asked Priscilla, \"You now have the entire universe for yourself. What's your next plan?\"\nLeo shrugged. \"Nothing. I'll just sit at home and try to cultivate a karmic fate crystal, I guess.\"\n\"Karmic Fate Crystal? Do they even exist?\" Priscilla, Ellen, and Xiaomao were interested.\n\"I don't know. That's why I have to try.\"\n\"I see. That's an interesting project.\" Priscilla smirked and turned around, looking at her surviving soldiers and subordinates. \"Good luck with that. I'm gonna go checking on my men and resurrect some dead birds.\"\n\"Wait!\" Leo waved his hand and stopped Priscilla from leaving.\n\"Hmm? What is it?\" Priscilla turned around.\nLeo looked at Simba who nodded and ejected seven star-sized entity fate crystals from his system inventory. Leo ordered them to merge in front of the crowd.\nSeven stars collided, but they later transformed into a liquid, becoming one. When the evolution was completed, the fate crystal shrank until it became a small moon.\nPriscilla widened her eyes in astonishment. She stuttered, \"W-What did you do?\"\nLeo grinned, \"I just created a true entity fate crystal for fun.\"\n\"…For fun?\"\nXiaomao, Ellen, and Priscilla almost vomited blood. They struggled and fought for countless years before they could earn one fate crystal, but Leo easily procured a true entity fate crystal on the spot.\nLife is not fair!\nLeo directed the fate crystal toward Priscilla. He smiled and explained.\n\"You gave me fate crystals and helped me before. I'm here to return the favor.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo referred to the incident when Sieg and Leo fought. Fortunately, Priscilla appeared and murdered Sieg. Then, she gave his fate crystals to Leo.\nThat deed alone earned Leo a huge respect. He didn't forget what Priscilla had done.\nMeanwhile, Priscilla's eyes were moist. She was so moved that she couldn't restrain her emotions.\n\"You're such a good little boy!\"\nPriscilla in her giant human form grabbed Leo and pushed him against her chest. Once again, Leo was buried in the holy valley.\n\"Seriously, if we weren't related by blood, I would have married you!\" Priscilla laughed.\n\"No, thank you. I'm married.\" Leo dully stared at Priscilla's face.\"Aw, you're a party pooper. Of course, that was a joke.\"\n\"Please let it really be a joke.\"\nLeo slipped through the valley and freed himself from the giant's hug. He looked at Xiaomao, changing the subject.\n\"Overlord Xiaomao…\"\n\"Yes, Overlord Florida Man?\"\nLeo grinned, \"Do you need a fate crystal too?\"\nXiaomao laughed, \"No. I've never really relied on the fate crystals. I used to have one, but it is already destroyed because of my curses.\"\n\"Curses?\" Leo's interest was piqued, \"What curses?\"\n\"Nothing much, actually. I just drank a lot of Karma River's water and ate so many soul embryos when I was young. Because of my deeds, the unborn souls resent me for eating them. They converted my life force into poison to torment me.\"\n\"…Sounds like trouble.\"\n\"Not really. My lifespan simply decreases a thousand times the usual rate. For example, if I had 1,000 years to live, the actual remaining lifespan would be actually one year. Also, it takes a thousand times longer to gather Qi.\"\nLeo felt bad for the fisherman overlord. Although they weren't friends or family, Leo wished to do something to help the man. After all, Aslan took his appearance, so his bloodline might be running in his veins like Priscilla's.\n\"What can I do to help you? How can I remove the curses?\"\nXiaomao was surprised that Leo offered a helping hand. He was glad, but he didn't need it.\n\"It's fine. Nobody but myself can remove the curses. All I need to do is to enter a circle of reincarnation once.\"\n\"Cycle of reincarnation?\"\n\"In short, I need to be reborn. However, I can't choose where or which body I will reincarnate into. I won't retain my memory either. In short, it's a complete start over.\"\nLeo was inwardly horrified, thinking of the new reincarnation. The thoughts of abandoning all his strength, achievements, and memory were terrifying.\n\"…That sounds very scary.\"\n\"Right?\" Xiaomao giggled and sighed. He glanced at the fishing rod in his hand, \"That's why I don't need fate crystals. If I had one, I would rather turn them into something inheritable. I want my successors to live a better life than mine.\"\n\"…You're a good man, Overlord Xiaomao.\"\n\"Hahahaha! I'm just a cat dad who wishes for atonement.\"\nSpeaking of Cat Dad, Leo thought of Cat back in his world. He started to miss her. He also wondered how she would react if she saw the Prismatic Void Tree and her siblings.\n\"If you have time, come visit me. I have many toys in my store. Since you raise cats, I think you will like them.\"\nLeo wrote the coordinates of his world and passed the note to Xiaomao who received it in glee.\nXiaomao saluted, \"I'll be sure to visit you in the future. For now, please excuse these old bones. I miss my cute Cathulhus and Catopuses.\"\nLeo nodded, \"Godspeed, sir.\"\nXiaomao laughed and flew back home, bringing his deadliest fishing rod with him.\nAfter Xiaomao was gone, Leo shifted his attention to the elf queen whose face resembled Eleanor and Esen.\n\"You there.\"\nEllen jolted, \"Yes?\"\n\"What was your name again?\"\n\"It's Ellen, sir.\"\n\"…Ellen. Tsk. I can just identify you. System!\"\nDING\n.\nName: Ellen Sydine\nAlias: None\nRace: Half Abyssal Black Tortoise / Divine Elf\nAge: 9,977\nCultivation Base: 12-Galaxy Entity\nThoughts: Fear, Exhausted\nSystem Note: Ellen Sydine was the seventh princess of Divine Elf Kingdom, one of many daughters of Eleanor Sydine. She inherited her father's bloodline, but Eleanor suppressed it to hide her father's identity. After the Abyssal Black Tortoise race was extinct, Eleanor gradually unsealed her bloodline, allowing her to improve her cultivation aptitude.\nAfter gaining the opportunity, her cultivation progress surpassed all her siblings. She attained the karmic sovereign realm and an entity fate crystal with her own strength.\nUnfortunately, her life wasn't paved with rose petals. Her mother schemed to cheat the Karma River Curses by forcefully reincarnating into her body, which would steal her identity and cultivation base. Ellen predicted it and sought shelter at Fate Stadium. Later on, Ellen returned to her kingdom and claimed the throne after Queen Eleanor's death.\nEllen rose up as the queen of the Divine Elf Kingdom. She then spread her influence to the Cathulhus by forming an alliance with Overlord Xiaomao. However, because of their growing army, they were dragged into the grand war between two transcendences – Overlord Planet Devourer and Overlord Priscilla.\nThe war consumed 90% of Ellen's forces and destroyed many galaxies. Moreover, Overlord Planet Devourer destroyed her fate crystals and degraded her cultivation base during combat.\nThe war abruptly ended when Overlord Florida Man rescued Priscilla and killed Planet Devourer. She then surrendered to him.\n.\nAfter reading the biography, Leo sympathized with Ellen. She grew up in a bad environment and had a bad mother. She didn't even know who her father was.\n\"Ellen. Since you're surrendering to me, I'm going to give you an order. It's an ultimatum, actually.\"\n\"Y-Yes, senior?\" Ellen trembled, wondering what Leo would do to her. She prepared to surrender her body and live a miserable life.\n\"Go back and restore your kingdom or whatever your country is.\"\n\"…Eh?\"\n\"Second order, you must not attempt to verbally, physically, or mentally harm Esen and her children. Your elder sister is my wife, you know. I can't let you hurt my family.\"\nSimba overheard the conversation and coughed. He winked and nudged Leo, hinting at him.\nLeo caught the gesture and elaborated.\n\"I forgot. This includes Ester and her child, too. She's my brother's wife after all.\"\nEllen wryly smiled and glanced at Simba. She knew Ester and Simba, but this was her first time learning that Leo and Simba were brothers.\n\"You have been hiding your brother, Ohio Man,\" Ellen bitterly laughed.\nSimba shrugged, \"I didn't. I actually searched for him. Hell, I even mistook him as an enemy and fought him when we first met.\"\n\"Hahaha. Is that so?\" Ellen sighed as she was envious of Simba. She turned to Leo. \"You have my words, Overlord Florida Man. I will never harm your family.\"\nLeo nodded in approval, \"Good. You're my sister-in-law, so I don't want to fight you either. Anyway, you should go back to your home world and help the survivors. They must be in trouble right now because of the war. Oh, I forgot again. Man, my memories are so bad. Simba, another fate crystal!\"\nSimba frowned as he didn't want to give Ellen a fate crystal. But since Leo asked for it, he had no choice. Again, he ejected seven entity fate crystals.\nLeo noticed Simba's dark expression and caught the hint. Instead of merging them into one true entity fate crystal, he picked one and passed it to Ellen.\n\"I don't sense any fate crystal from you. Just take this and go recuperating. You need rest.\"\nEllen slowly nodded and gave Leo a meaningful look. After absorbing the fate crystal, she turned around and vanished, returning to her home planet.\nOnly Priscilla, Leo, and Simba were around. They looked at each other.\nLeo waved his hand to end this meeting. He also returned the remaining six entity fate crystals to Simba and let him manage them.\n\"Let's go home. You, too, mOthER.\"\n\"Aye!\" Priscilla giggled and flew away.\nLeo turned around and flew to the dreadnaught battleship. Simba followed him.\nWhile following his brother, Simba wondered about their future.\n\"Say, Leo. My system tells me that if we hold on to void leaves, an emissary from the higher universe will descend and pick us up. Do you know about this?\"\nLeo's eyes shifted as he tried to recall some memories. He remembered something related to cliché novels.\"\n\"I forgot. What was it again?\" Leo pretended to be forgetful to hear the information from his brother.\nSimba deeply inhaled and told Leo what he had learned. \"The thing is, we aren't done yet. Above the sky, there are clouds. Above the clouds, there are stars. Well, above this whole shit, there's a freaking upper dimension or some sort. We're in the Matrix, Leo.\"\n\"Ah…\"\nLeo closed his eyes and thought of the movies. He bitterly laughed.\n\"I wish we weren't inside a tube in the upper dimension.\"\n\"We're probably inside someone's dantian universe… like how we created a dantian universe and populated it.\"\nLeo thought about it as well, but his hunch told him otherwise.\n\"It's probably different this time. My guts is telling me that it won't be that simple.\"\n\"…\"\nThe brothers looked back at the Prismatic Void Tree at a distance. They looked forward to the days when Void Principality would descend and show them the higher universe.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 330 – Florida Man Tries to End His Life, Expresses Desire to Be Reborn as His Grandson\nThe dragon dreadnaught taxi sent Leo home. Before they parted, Simba transferred all void leaves and fate crystals to Leo. When Simba was asked, he answered that he had no intention to play with crystals anymore He remained on his ship with his wife and his men as he had other things to do.\nLeo returned home and reunited with his wife as usual. Because of the recent activities and the confirmation of his status in the universe, Leo stopped worrying about random ambushers. He wished that he could enjoy living a slow life for the rest of eternity.\n…\nAfter Leo had returned, Kishin Douji secretly scanned the universe with his Qi sense and system ability. It was not difficult for him to detect the changes in the trend and Karma Rivers of this universe.\nThe influx of new souls entered the rivers of reincarnation because of the war. Divine elves, high elves, inferior elves, planet eaters, and phoenixes lost their origins and were forced to forget their past lives.\nKishin Douji was surprised and overjoyed.\n\"Finally, divine elves are no more. Whoever, the current queen of the divine elf is, she is no longer in power! I can reclaim my throne again!\"\nAmbition, pride, and greed blinded Kishin Douji. He calculated his plans and future in his mind.\nObliteration? Enslavement? Tortures? He imagined various scenarios that he could do to the divine elf race and their allies. However, as an experienced overlord, he quickly threw away the ambitious thoughts and considered the worst-case scenarios.\n'No, I can't reclaim my throne. I know that either Priscilla or Planet Devourer reduced Ellen's forces to that state. If one of them is still alive, they can still destroy me. I have to continue hiding until I get more information.'\nDetermined to lurk in the shadow, Kishin Douji left Leo's territory and headed toward the north pole of the planet.\nThe weather and the temperature were as Kishin Douji had expected – Absolute freezing point. Extreme yin Qi was abundant, and the ice continent looked healthy. Only immortals and yin-specialist cultivators could live there.\nAs someone from the Oni Race, yin Qi, monster Qi, and miasma were his food. He laughed and erected an ice palace, building his new home. However, he hadn't realized yet that the entire planet was within Leo's domain.\n.\n.\nMonths went by. The development of the new town achieved its goal.\nLocal cultivators had no choice but to bow their heads and serve Leo as their lord. Some of them abandoned the dream of being a rogue cultivator because of a certain addiction.\nEverybody was addicted to the convenience of a luxurious lifestyle, big houses, and private cultivation rooms in their residences. Everybody who bought a house, a flat, or a mansion could never return to their former lifestyle anymore.\nThis addition came with a disadvantage. As many cultivators couldn't afford to pay for the residents, they succumbed to the installment scheme, and they were forced to pay the loan to Leo every month. The monthly installment payment became an issue for the rogue cultivators and merchants. One after another, they failed to pay the bills.\nWithout a choice, they surrendered their future and bodies to Leo.\nLeo's black company thrived because of the monetary circulation program. The employees helped Leo grow his territory and farmlands. He paid the employees. The employees purchased his items from both shopping malls and paid the loan. Leo got his money back to pay the employees the next month.\nLife was good. His territory could self-sustain, and he got more time to play with Esen.\n...\nOne day, Aslan visited Leo and Esen. He reintroduced himself to Esen and revealed who he really was.\nEsen was flabbergasted to learn that Leo also had divine elf blood in him. She pouted and complained to Leo.\n\"I thought you were a chimera monster in human flesh. It turns out you're a perverted elf!\"\nLeo laughed and hugged her, \"Aren't you happy that your husband is a descendent of a divine elf, prismatic phoenix, and a bunch of god-know-monsters-my-father-put-inside-me.\"\nAslan bitterly laughed. \"Not all of them are random monsters, you know. I added so many bloodlines in your body – Overlord Xiaomao's, Cathulhus, Void Tree's Saps, Fenrir-\"\n\"Hold up a second,\" Leo stopped Aslan when he heard the detail. \"What did you put in me again?\"\n\"Oh, do you want me to repeat it? Sure. Divine elf's bloodline, Overlord Xiaomao bloodline, Cathulhu bloodline, Fenrir Werewolf bloodline, Prismatic-\"\n\"No, not those. There's something else other than the bloodline.\"\n\"You mean the Void Tree's saps?\"\n\"…Yeah, that. Also, WHAT. THE. FUCK!?\"\nLeo stared at his father in shock. He couldn't believe that his father actually injected tree sap into his blood circulation. He wondered how he survived the experiment.\n\"HAHAHAHA!\" Aslan was unable to suppress his laughter. He wiped his tears. \"How else do you think that I made that body superior to the stolen one? What Mao Miaomiao had was an incomplete physique with four bloodlines. Without the Void Tree's sap and an entity fate crystal as a catalyst, he couldn't even use 10% of the body's strength.\"Leo deeply frowned. He regretted that he mutated the Void Tree before he could extract some saps for future alchemy experiments.\nThinking of the Void Tree, Leo recalled that he had so many Void Tree's leaves. However, because of the recent rapid development and influx of new employees, all alchemy workshops were jam-packed with alchemists-in-training, who would be assigned to new alchemy workshops and factories in the future.\n\"I should create a private workshop for myself one day.\" Leo took a mental note.\nEsen also reminded Leo, \"You also need to get us a better resident. I'm tired of living on a bus. Also, I have many subordinates. We need a lot of space and courtyards.\"\n\"…I see.\"\n\"A reminder, I should be giving birth in a couple of months. Make sure the new resident has enough room for an infant and the nanny.\"\nBeing a breadwinner for his family was not always smooth and easy. Sometimes, a wife's simple and reasonable demands could give the husband a headache.\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\nLooking at their interaction, Aslan widely grinned. He clapped his hands and informed them of a piece of bad news.\n\"Leo, Esen. I'm going to enter the reincarnation circle tomorrow.\"\n\"WHAT?!\" Leo and Esen widened their eyes and screamed in unison. \"WHY?! WHAT HAPPENED?!\"\nAslan scratched his cheek. He confessed, \"I've been leeching Leo's life force for too long, and it's bad for my soul. It's about time for me to reincarnate and cleanse my soul. Otherwise, I might be cursed by the universe's karma river.\"\nLeo didn't understand the laws of this universe. \"But you're an entity. Entities and karmic sovereigns don't need to reincarnate, right? You've become independent from the Karma Rivers!\"\nAslan revealed a mischievous smile. He concealed another secret that he couldn't tell Leo and Esen.\n\"…Not really. When we're tired of our current life, we can always reduce ourselves to any local karma river and reset our lives. Well, unlike the others, we get to retain our previous life's memory and quickly recover our former cultivation base.\"\n\"Oh, it's like a \"NEW GAME+\" thingy?\"\n\"Correct. Also, if I have any fate crystals in my soul, I can bring them along with me. If I have an inventory system, all items in the inventory go along with me too! Isn't that exciting?\"\nLeo paused for a long time. He gave his father a meaningful look.\n\"You sound like you want to quit your job and ditch me.\"\n\"EXACTLY!\"\n\"SCRAM, YOU DAMN LAZY BASTARD! YOU AIN'T GONNA GET YOUR VACATION ANY TIME SOON!\"\nLeo kicked Aslan out of the bus and shut the door. Aslan laughed and left obediently.\nAfter his father had left, Leo sat on a couch and rested his forearm on his forehead. With a heavy sigh, Leo complained.\n\"He's a damn troll. I bet he just wants to mess with me again.\"\nEsen sat next to Leo and giggled, \"You two sure are close. I envy you.\"\nLeo hugged Esen. As the topic was related to her family, Leo wondered what Esen's father was doing. He thought of Kishin Douji.\n\"Should I call your father to visit you once in a while?\"\nEsen pouted and shook her head, \"I don't consider that Oni as my father. He denied my existence, and he didn't even help me when I was in jail.\"\n\"…Right.\"\nLeo abandoned the thought. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the cuddling.\nNone of them realized that Aslan was serious. The next day, the fisherman golem turned into a regular stone statue and stopped moving forever.\n.\n.\nThe parting of Aslan became a huge news of Leo's domain. As the golem was a member of Leo's Four Heavenly Guardians, it shook the local's morale.\nAslan's statue was moved to the rooftop of the parking lot per Leo's request. As for the son, he knelt in front of the fisherman statue, biting his lower lips in anger and frustration.\nLeo was saddened by the development. He regretted that he never treated Aslan nicely.\n\"I'm so stupid.\" Leo lamented. \"Yeah, the old scholars said 'You only realize the importance of someone when they are gone'. They are absolutely correct. Why didn't I realize this?\"\nEsen stood behind Leo, watching over the depressed husband. Unable to come up with a consolation, Esen felt helpless in this situation.\nBehind the wife, Leo's disciples, Ivy, Beatrice, Marc, Wu Buyi, and others stood in silence. They learned about Aslan's true identity later, and they were shocked as well. No one dared to utter a word.\nFor 48 days, Leo knelt in front of Aslan's statue in silence, thanking his father for saving his life and begging his father for forgiveness for his past mistakes.\nOn the 49th day, Ivy mustered her courage to speak to Leo as a new event forced her to. She knelt next to Leo and woke him from the trance.\n\"My lord! Her Majesty… It's urgent!\"\n\"!!!\" Hearing about Esen, Leo panicked. \"What happened to her?!\"\nIvy was glad that Leo had come back to his senses. Without saying anything, she guided him to the eastern hotel, where Dongfang Mei, Xu Nuan, and the girls had built a hospital nearby. They entered the building and stopped in front of a room with two large glass doors.\nLeo didn't remember building this hospital, but he didn't question anybody. He looked at Ivy, \"What happened here? Where is my wife?\"\nIvy wryly smiled and pointed at the signboard in front of the room.\n[Obstetrics and Gynecology]\nAgain, Leo deeply frowned. These words were modern medical terms, and they shouldn't have existed here.\nIvy read Leo's expressions and thoughts like a book. She explained, \"Some of Molg girls purchased medical books from the bookstore and decided to put some of the medical knowledge to practice. Well, they built this place to treat commoners and mortals. As for this ward, it specializes in childbirth and women's disease.\"\n\"Ah… I see.\"\nLeo finally figured out how this place resembled modern hospitals. It seemed that the random books in the bookstore featured modern medical technologies and knowledge.\n\"Wait a minute! Childbirth, you say?!\"\nIvy giggled, \"Yes. Her Majesty is in the room. The doctors are helping her at the moment.\"\n\"Dumbass! Do you think a freaking sage needs help for a simple childbirth?! Something is wrong here!\"\nIvy wryly smiled and gestured Leo to enter the room, \"Please.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo entered the room and found four female Molgs surrounding his pregnant wife. They shared their Qi with Esen and monitored her condition.\nWhen everybody saw Leo, they panicked.\n\"Y-Your Majesty!\"\nLeo silently walked toward Esen who rested on a hospital bed and sweated profusely. Despite the pain, she smiled at him.\n\"Dear, my water broke.\"\n\"Don't say anything. I'm here.\" Leo held Esen's hand and looked at the doctors.\nThe Molgs nodded and proceeded with their treatment. Leo also provided his Qi to nourish his wife.\nStrangely, the delivery process was slow. The child who was supposed to come out easily required a lot of the mother's effort.\nLeo scanned Esen's stomach and noticed that the child was bigger than a regular infant. He detected a pair of wings on its back, which hindered the delivery. In addition, the infant already had a cultivation base, and he was born an immortal.\nGiving his wife a helping hand, Leo created spiritual threads, which couldn't be touched by physical objects and life forms. A thousand strings entered Esen's stomach and wrapped around the infant.\nCarefully, Leo used the spiritual strings around the infant so that the wings wouldn't get in the way. Then, he guided the child to come out.\nWith Leo's help, the boy came out safe. Esen was also relieved.\nThe nurses behind the doctors rushed over and supported the baby. They tended the umbilical cord and raised the infant upside down.\n\"It's a boy!\" The nurse cheered and gently tapped the boy's butt.\nInstead of crying like a newborn baby, the boy widened his eyes and looked around. When he saw Leo and Esen, the boy obnoxiously grinned. Strangely, he was capable of sending a sound transmission message.\nBoth husband and wife heard a familiar voice in their mind.\n\"What's up, bitch.\"\nThat was Aslan's voice!\n\"…\"\nLeo and Esen's expression turned dark. The former silently snatched the baby from the nurse and walked toward the window. Esen shook her head and deeply sighed.\n\"Don't kill our son.\"\nLeo clicked his tongue, \"Let me have a father-and-son talk.\"\n\"Sure. Remember, don't kill him.\"\n\"I know.\"\nLeo grinned and looked at his supposed-to-be son. Aslan looked back at his \"Father\" and coughed out water from his lungs.\n\"Oh, you're choking, son. Here, let me help.\"\nLeo laughed and flew out of the window. He twirled the boy and yeeted him to the sky.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 331 – Florida Man Announces Retirement from Drug-Dealing Career to Police\nDespite the anger, Leo retrieved Aslan before the baby could fly into space. He brought the boy back to his mother and gave his former father a meaningful look.\nThe nurse wrapped Aslan with warm towels and returned him to his mother. Esen carried her child and giggled at them.\n\"You're quite naughty, father-in-law. We thought you were dead. Was this your plan all along?\"\nAslan yawned and shivered because of the previous skydiving. He closed his eyes in exhaustion and transmitted his sound to their mind instead of talking.\n\"Can I have a year or two of recuperating? I'll explain everything to you after that.\"\nLeo scoffed, \"How about no?\"\nAslan slightly opened his eyes in annoyance. Ignoring his son, he shut them and fell asleep.\nRealizing how fragile Aslan was, Leo smacked his lips while Esen was unable to contain her laughter. Their family's relationship was so absurd that it was hilarious to her.\n\"I can't believe your father wants to be your son, Leo.\"\nLeo smacked his forehead and complained, \"This motherhumper…\"\n\"You're not wrong. He DID hump your mother, though.\"\n\"…\"\n.\n.\nIn the end, Leo accepted the fact that Aslan wanted to be his son. He came to terms with it.\nLeo sat in his bus, gazing at his newborn son in his wife's arms. As he looked down at the tiny bundle, he couldn't help but bitterly smile.\nAslan Jr. was his son's new name. Naming his son after his own father seemed like the right thing to do. Not only did it honor his father's memory, but it also made it easier for everyone to differentiate between the two generations of Aslans.\nExcited to share the news with others, Leo made the announcement to the elders and the local cultivators of the town. They were touched by Leo's gesture, unaware of the true reason behind the name choice. To them, it was a beautiful tribute from a devoted son to his late father. Leo's actions were hailed as an example, and he became revered for his filial piety.\nAs time passed, the tale of Leo's devotion to his father's memory spread throughout the town. The story took on a life of its own, morphing into a legend of a disguised father who selflessly served his son as a trusted companion. People were awed at their relationship, and his reputation as a good son only grew stronger.\nDespite the rumors and the fantastical fairy tale that circulated around him, Leo paid them little mind. His focus was on his growing family and their future. With the arrival of his son, Leo decided to invest in a space colony.\nThe colony was moderately small as it matched the Earth's size. Leo adjusted its flight course and followed the solar system. With the radiation from the sun and abundant soul stones as the source of energy, Leo didn't need to worry about the colony for a long time.\nAs this place required a new food source, Leo got busy. He purchased and built new farms, fish ponds, and ranches. After upgrading everything, he got new mannequin dolls to work for him. However, they weren't enough to take care of the cheating farms, which produced crops every hour.\nHe needed more helpers. Thus, he called for Esen's subordinates.\nIvy, Marc, a hundred Molgs, and undead soldiers that Esen had once created followed them to the new colony.\nThe undead soldiers were the population of Esen's dantian universe. She brought them out as she knew that Leo always lacked manpower whenever he expanded the territory.\nLeo was also inspired by her. He employed lizardmen from his dantian universe to work for him in exchange for cultivation resources and cultivation methods.\nThe lizards readily agreed and worshiped Leo as their lord. The group also improved the fish pond as their primary diet was fish.\nEsen was happy with the arrangement. Exploiting her authority, she forced Leo to build her a castle or a mansion for her and her son.\nLeo couldn't reject Esen. He ended up purchasing a modern mansion and upgraded it to the maximum level, turning the resident into another small world inside. He also built another alchemy workshop, a blacksmith workshop, and a time chamber in the mansion for Esen's personal usage.\nAfter a month of hard work, the new colony was fully functional and self-sufficient. Leo delegated the management to Esen and returned to the headquarters.\nUpon arrival, Leo noticed that Beatrice remained in the store. When Leo asked Beatrice for the reason, she disclosed a shocking piece of news.\nBeatrice and Wu Buyi were secretly dating, and they planned to marry in a few months!\nLeo was baffled. He couldn't believe that the obnoxious nerd managed to charm the prettiest death knight. Nonetheless, he congratulated them.\nAfter the series of investments, Leo rechecked his lifespan balance.\n[Your current lifespan: 1,331,816,131 Years.]It dipped by a lot, and Leo already spent all the backup credits. Still, he had several millions of essence stones and soul stones in his inventory, so he could easily bounce back.\nMost projects were already completed. It was about time for Leo to invest in the void leaf experiment and fate crystal upgrading. He opened his system inventory and scanned the available fate crystals.\n- 1,800,000 Earth Fate Crystals\n- 640,000 Sky Fate Crystals\n- 47,000 Heavenly Fate Crystals\n- 260 Entity Fate Crystals\nLeo almost choked as he never paid attention to the number. When he realized how rich he was, he thought of Planet Devourer, who monopolized the Void Tree for a long time. He wondered how many fate crystals the guy had eaten and digested.\n\"This is going to take a long time.\" Leo laughed and wondered how long it would take to upgrade them all.\n.\n.\nA year quickly passed by. Aslan grew up healthy, and his cultivation base improved. He became the first one-year-old boy who ascended to the deity stage.\nIn addition, Aslan's physique improved enough and allowed him to make a proper conversation. Thus, Leo, Esen, and Aslan gathered to have a heart-to-heart talk in the colony's mansion.\nLeo stared at his ex-father and asked the most important question.\n\"What else are you hiding from me, father?\"\nAslan brightly smiled and revealed his grand plan, \"I'm planning to visit the higher realm.\"\n\"Oh, THAT higher universe?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLeo thought of the Void Tree and the Void Principality. He was curious about the upper realm as well, but he didn't feel like migrating or having another adventure.\nHe was content with this lifestyle. He had enough.\n\"You're actually older than me, father. Don't you have enough in this life?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Look, you little shit. I got stuck inside you for 50-freaking-thousand years. I was so bored watching your life, and I wanted mine.\"\nLeo understood the point, but he had other concerns.\n\"You raised me, protected me, and tempered with my bloodline. Then, you reincarnate as my son and reap the fruits that you sowed. Now, you want to go for an adventure outside the Matrix. Do you think you're ready right now?\"\nAslan shrugged. He was aware of his shortcomings as his physique was still too young and too weak.\n\"I know. It's not like the gate to the higher universe will open any time soon. We just need to prepare for that day.\"\nLeo deeply sighed, \"Let me tell you this. I ain't going.\"\n\"Huh?!\" Aslan was taken aback, \"But you can get stronger. There are higher cultivation stages beyond the transcendence realm, you know?\"\n\"I know. Singularity Realm, right?\"\nLeo snorted and walked toward the balcony. He opened his system inventory and pulled out a hand-sized crystal.\n[True Karmic Fate Crystal]\nAslan widened his eyes as the system, created by his true entity Fate Crystal, informed him of its details. He couldn't believe his eyes.\n\"Wait a minute. I thought it never existed in this universe! How did you get that?! And what the hell? It's the TRUE version?!\"\nLeo snorted and pulled out a dozen crystals of the same appearance and quality. He juggled them while he stared at Aslan.\n\"Who do you think I am? Do you think I'm stupid enough to ignore the possibility of upgrading these crystals with my flesh and blood?\"\n\"…Holy shit.\"\n\"Yeah, this body was made by you.\" Leo laughed, \"Aren't you proud of your creation?\"\n\"…Yeah, I'm proud of you.\"\nLeo flickered a true karmic fate crystal to Aslan and stored the rest in his inventory. Aslan received it and glanced at Esen.\n\"Leo, have you given one to Esen?\"\nAslan was concerned that Leo might be monopolizing the fate crystals and felt bad for Esen, whose cultivation base stagnated at the karmic sovereign realm.\nEsen giggled and confessed, \"Don't worry about me, father. I already have seven inside me.\"\n\"WHAT?! SEVEN?!\" Aslan was shocked.\nEsen opened her system menus and read what they could do.\n\"I have a Seven Virtue System. Whenever I do a good deed, I gain lifespan and improve my cultivation strength. The second system is the Good Wife System. If I please Leo in bed or do chores, I gain currency to exchange for some unusual artifacts from the higher universe. The next is-\"\n\"WAIT A MINUTE!\" Aslan shouted, \"HIGHER UNIVERSE, YOU SAID?! YOU CAN ACCESS THEIR ITEMS?\"\nLeo and Esen looked at each other and laughed.\n\"I guess I have to reintroduce you to the current stage of our general store.\"\n\"???\"\nLeo and Esen brought Aslan out of the Colony and entered his headquarters planet – Aka the Florida Planet.\nThe local residents changed the planet's name to \"FLORIDA\" to fit the local daos. When Leo and his family arrived, they found a thousand flying vehicles in the sky, traveling across the snowy world.\nAslan hadn't seen Florida Planet for a year. When he saw the thick snow and white clouds, he deeply frowned. He complained.\n\"I sense thick yin Qi in this world. Did you mutate it into a monster realm or something?\"\nLeo shrugged, \"Nope.\"\n\"Then, why am I sensing monster Qi and miasma from the north?\"\n\"That's probably Kishin Douji's work, I guess. He somehow creates a monster army there and prepares for some idiotic crap.\" Leo gazed at the north while his cheeks twitched, \"I'm planning to settle things with that idiot soon. You don't have to worry about it.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Oh, have you consumed the true karmic fate crystal yet? You should eat it before Cat sees you. She will snatch it off your hands in a jiffy.\"\n\"…Right.\"\nBeing wary of Cat's gluttonous behavior, Aslan pushed the fate crystal into his chest and merged it with his soul. He closed his eyes, waiting for the crystal to generate a new system for him.\nDING\n<You have assimilated with True Karmic Fate Crystal.>\n<Installing a new OS…>\n<Installation completed. Opening the Bloodline Collector System!>\nAslan's mouth was agape when he saw the name of his new system. He read through the new perks and smiled.\n\"I guess I'm a protagonist now.\"\nLeo scoffed, \"Yeah, you probably are.\"\n\"Say, Leo. What about your system? You have a bunch of true karmic fate crystals with you. Do you get anything good?\"\nLeo paused and pondered for a moment. He looked around and mischievously grinned.\nEsen noticed her husband's expression. She shook her head, \"Don't destroy your headquarters.\"\n\"I know. Hehehe.\" Leo giggled and snapped his fingers.\nSuddenly, a tremor shook the Florida Planet. The local population looked up as they sensed their lord's power. However, Leo and Esen already vanished.\nAslan came back to his senses and looked around. Unfortunately, he couldn't find his parents.\n\"Huh?\"\nA few minutes later, Leo and Esen returned and caught Aslan before he was exhausted flying alone. They smirked at the boy, showing their glossy skin and healthy faces.\nAslan sniffed and caught a sultry scent. He glared at them.\n\"What was that, Leo?!\"\nLeo and Esen giggled, but they didn't say anything. Both parents spoke in unison.\n\"That's a secret.\"\n\"???\"\nNobody but Esen and Leo knew that both of them stopped the time of the entire universe for several years. The evidence of their lewd deeds was still fresh, and Esen was still sore from the marathon activities.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 332 – Florida Parents Entrust One-Year-Old Child to Neighbor Nannies With Criminal Background. Next Day, Child Knows How to Assemble and Dissemble Guns.\nLeo carried Aslan and visited the general store branch, run by Cat. Upon arrival, the family found Cat, who dozed off on the rooftop.\nThe dryad's cultivation base already caught up with Esen's, but her appearance was still that of a middle-school dark elf. Her head and clothes were covered in snow while icicles froze her hair.\nEsen rushed to Cat and poured yang Qi around Cat. After thawing the lazy dryad, Esen shook the girl.\n\"Cat, wake up. Your mom and dad are here.\"\nCat didn't respond. She slightly opened her eyes and returned to sleep.\nEsen looked at Leo, asking for help, \"Can you wake her up? She's going to turn into a snowman if she keeps sleeping here.\"\nLeo shrugged and passed Aslan to Esen. He leaned forward and whispered to Cat.\n\"Nom-Nom time.\"\nCat's eyes snapped open. She shook the snow on her body and panted like a dog. \"Where nom-nom, meow?\"\nLeo laughed and pulled out a truck-sized angler fish from his system inventory. He tossed it to Cat, who opened her mouth and sucked the entire creature into her throat.\nA small dryad devouring a bigger creature in one gulp was nothing new here. Despite the weirdness of the situation, nobody around them bat an eye. Cars, flying ships, and cultivators continued their daily lives as if they had seen this a thousand times.\nAfter feeding Cat, Leo patted her head and removed a few pieces of dirt in her hair.\n\"Are you bored, Cat?\"\nCat shook her head, \"Nope! Every day is the nom-nom day, meow. Our customers are generous. They gave me many nom-nom, meow!\"\n\"Good. Oh, right. I need to introduce you to your new sibling.\" Leo smiled at Aslan, who broke a sweat.\nCat followed Leo's gaze and noticed Aslan. She sniffed and drooled.\n\"Is sibling edible?\"\nLeo and Esen widely grinned while Aslan sweated profusely. He regretted choosing Leo as his parent.\n\"Depends. If this little shit suddenly leaves by himself at night to woo a woman in the future, you are free to eat him.\"\nAslan cried, \"You can't do this to me! I'm your father! Do you know how much I dedicate my life to protect you?!\"\nLeo laughed, \"Don't worry, pops. I'm doing this for your own good. As long as Cat sees you as a potential food, nobody can harm you. She will guard you like a precious strawberry cake seasoned with top-quality weed.\"\n\"That's the point! She will see me as FOOD!\"\n\"Oh, you just have to be stronger than her when you plan to move out, Dad. For the moment, she will only sniff and lick you. Right, Cat?\"\nCat repeatedly nodded. She promised, \"I'll do my best to lick him every day, meow. But if he doesn't comply to you, I'll gobble him!\"\nLeo and Esen giggled while Aslan gave up. The latter prayed to Void Principality to hurry and come down to bring him away.\nAfter teasing Aslan enough, Leo brought his son to visit other places.\nThe slum area no longer existed as Leo's system buildings replaced them. Highways, infrastructures, and public facilities took a portion of the western land while residential buildings and commercial buildings mixed together like Japanese metropolitan cities. Because of the congested city plan, traffic on the roads was also busy, especially in the areas near Cat's store.\nDuring the past year, the branch had been upgraded to another shopping complex, where only immortals could enter. Thus, all customers had a bit of lifespan and cash to spend.\nThe parking lot near Cat's store was always full of vehicles. Most of them were flying scooters as they were cheap, but some shoppers came with trucks, sedans, or small flying ships. Endless visitors entered the store and came out with packages of food, cultivation resources, furniture, or weapons.\nInside the store was similar to Leo's headquarters. All store slots were occupied and provided various services to the visitors. 90% of the stores were Leo's system facilities while the rest belonged to new sects and schools, which local cultivators found.\nOne of the local stores belonged to the lava badgers, who evolved and transformed into humans. They weaved their fur into fluffy dolls and fur coats, which were local cultivators' favorite as they provided warmth and mild yang Qi.\nAslan wasn't interested in the stores at first. But when Leo brought him to the headquarters, Aslan was startled by the new layouts of stores and items.\nFormerly, only the first, the fourth, and the fifth floors were full. As for the present, every store slot was full, and every store provided different services and items. The workshops and factories were also gone, replaced by bookstores and tutoring centers. Moreover, the headquarters set the customer qualification to the deity realm or higher.\nAslan asked Leo to let him roam the shopping complex, and Leo allowed him to. The former rushed to the nearest gift shop on the second floor. Then, he picked up an item, which emitted a strange light.\nInstantly, Aslan verified the item's details with his system..\nPrismatic Ring of Heavenly Fate (One Use)\nThis ring is made by Jin Yong, the adept alchemist. Because of his imperfect skill, the ring's effects are limited and can only be used once, but the effect is guaranteed.\nGuarantee a life-changing fortuitous encounter to the wearer within 30 days. The type of encounter is random. After the encounter, the ring will lose its power.\n.\nAslan turned around and questioned Leo.\n\"Leo, isn't this a freaking heavenly fate crystal?!\"\nLeo cackled, \"Nope! It's a lesser version of that. Did you see what it's made of?\"\n\"…What about it?\"\n\"Prismatic Void Leaf!\"\n\"…And what the hell is that?!\"\nLeo shook his head and brought out a rainbow leaf, which he had extracted from the Prismatic Void Tree. He tossed it toward Aslan and let him appraise it.\n.\nPrismatic Void Leaf\nExtracted from the Prismatic Void Tree. Void leaves are commonly acknowledged as a currency in the higher dimension \"Great Void Universe\". This Prismatic Void Leaf can be exchanged into 1,000 regular void leaves.\nBecause of its poisonous nature, it cannot be consumed. Whoever under the transcendence realm consumes it will suffer from excruciating pain and randomly mutates into a monster. Only someone with a dryad bloodline, an Alraune bloodline, or Leo's bloodline could eat them. However, if it is refined by a master alchemist, it can become a lesser entity fate crystal.\nIn case someone consumes the prismatic void leaf and survives, a completed entity fate crystal will be born in the person's soul. In addition, Prismatic Dryads and Prismatic Alraunes of the Great Void Universe regularly consume them as snacks because of their exquisite taste.\n.\nThe detail disclosed some secrets in the higher dimension. Aslan drools, dying to learn more about the Great Void Universe.\nLeo put the leaf away and lightly bonked Aslan's head. He warned the son, \"Do not take the higher dimension lightly. The minimal cultivation base over there is transcendence realm level 10. The average is Singularity Level 30, and the top is level 100.\"\nAslan repeatedly nodded. He looked into Leo's eyes in curiosity.\n\"What about your current cultivation base? How strong are you now?\"\nLeo grinned, \"Level 100.\"\n\"…Bull freaking shit.\"\n\"Suits yourself. I won't force you to believe me.\"\nAslan doubted that Leo could increase his cultivation base to the ceiling of the higher dimension while he remained in this universe. Testing Leo's information, he asked about his newly acquired system.\n\"System, can you verify my father's cultivation base?\"\nDING\n<Leonardo \"Florida Man\" Ariel's cultivation base is Time Emperor Level 100.>\n\"W-What?!\"\nAslan found it hard to believe. He asked another question.\n\"What the hell is Time Emperor?! How strong is it compared to the Singularity Realm?!\"\n<Time Tier is a major realm higher than the Singularity Tier. Singularity can bend and manipulate an entire universe at will, but Time Lords can manipulate, create, erase, or fix any timeline of the universe.>\n<Unlike the other realms, Time Lord Realm is classified by five minor classes – Time Page, Time Priest, Time Sage, Time King, and Time Emperor.>\n\"…\"\nAslan quietly turned to Leo, gazing at him in astonishment.\n\"How?\"\nLeo snorted and crossed his arms. \"I'm that good.\"\n\"That's impossible! I know that you fucker is an autistic dementia dipshit! There's no way that you can surpass the Great Void Realm without visiting it!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes. He didn't bother explaining himself and dragged Aslan to another store.\nWhen Leo arrived in front of the time chamber, he dropped Aslan in front of it. Then, he clapped his hands, summoning the guardian of this place.\nAn elderly swordsman and a youthful swordsman came out. The first one was Hua Taixu's clone while the other one was the original, aka the real sword saint. Both bolstered the strength of the entity realm.\nSeeing the two sword saints, Aslan had a bad feeling about this. He pointed at the young saint.\n\"Leo, since when…\"\nLeo shrugged, \"I've been busy. He just visited the store one day and decided to join us. Am I right, Taixu?\"\nThe original sword saint stroked his long waving hair and showed his face. He was a handsome cat-eared man with a straight long nose. Because he carried the Cathulhu bloodline, there were small tentacles under his chin.\nHe was the real Hua Taixu, who reincarnated as a half-Cathulhu and half-human. He also disliked it when anybody asked who his parents were and how they conceived him.\nHua Taixu, the original, glanced at Aslan and smirked.\n\"Is he yours, my lord?\"\n\"Yeah, he's my son.\"\n\"How nice. Only one year old, and he's a deity. Your bloodline is really something, my lord.\"\nLeo teased Hua Taixu, \"Do you regret not being reincarnated as my child?\"\nHua Taixu burst into laughter, \"I like my tentacle beard and back arms. I have to decline.\"\n\"Ah, too bad. Anyway, about today's business.\" Leo picked up Aslan and tossed him to Hua Taixu, the clone.\nThe clone gazed at the boy. He widely smirked, \"Him, train?\"\n\"Yeah. Train him in there for a year and bring him back to me. Teach him a prismatic phoenix cultivation method and your sword daos. He's gonna need them in a few hundred years.\"\n\"ME, STRONK! ME, TRAIN, HIM! HE, SUPER STRONK!\"\nThe clone laughed and dragged Aslan to the time chamber. Hua Taixu also turned around and was about to follow his clone. However, Leo stopped the cat man and gave him a spatial ring.\n\"I've stored some milk, cultivation resources, diapers, and a child's bed in there. Make sure he drinks the phoenix milk every three hours.\"\n\"Am I the nanny now?\"\n\"Yup!\"\nHua Taixu rubbed his brows. He complained, \"I need a raise after this.\"\n\"Sure. Bring me the result, and I'll raise your wage by 20%.\"\n\"DEAL!\"\nHua Taixu cackled and followed his clone. They entered the time chamber and locked the door.\nAfter sending his child to a pair of lunatics, Leo shifted his attention to Esen. The wife smiled and stretched as if she had just gotten rid of a thorn by her side.\n\"So, we have a day of relaxation? What should we do for the day?\"\nLeo hugged her from behind and pointed to the fifth floor, where a cinema was located.\n\"How about a few movies? I bought some films from the other timelines, and I think it's interesting. It's about a gamer being forced to join god's trials based on horror games that he played.\"\n\"A thriller movie? Not a fantasy?\"\n\"Fantasy is boring these days. The plots are too cliché and predictable. Let's watch something different.\"\n\"Sure!\"\nThe husband and wife ditched their son and went out for a movie date.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 333 – Florida Man Shoots Child Predator Who Attempted to Groom His Man-Eating Bonzi Plant\nWhile Leo and Esen enjoyed their movie date, Kishin Douji sneaked into the town and visited Cat. He hovered over her.\n\"Child,\" Kishin ejected the corpse of a giant ice tiger that he hunted, giving it to Cat. \"There's your nom-nom tax.\"\nCat innocently smiled and received the corpse. However, she collected it in her ring and nodded at Kishin.\nKishin waited there, hoping for something back. Unfortunately, Cat didn't give him a void leaf. He was annoyed.\n\"Child.\"\nCat looked up and pouted, \"Yeah?\"\n\"Can I have a piece of leaf?\"\nCat tilted her head and pursed her lips. \"I don't have enough fertilizer and enough life force to make another one, meow. If you can wait for the next summer, I can make you one.\"\n\"…Summer? I can't wait that long.\"\nSummer was impossible in Florida World as it had transformed into an ice planet. Most mortals already took shelter in Leo's system buildings while immortals harvested Qi to fight the cold. Meanwhile, deities lurked in the shopping malls, refusing the restore the world's temperature.\nIf Kishin Douji let nature correct itself, he might have to wait 10,000 years or more. As the promised date approached, he couldn't afford to wait anymore.\nCat was annoyed. She pointed at Leo's headquarters and chased Kishin away.\n\"If you want a void leaf, you should go buy it from the HQ, meow. If it's really urgent, you should ask my dad to make you one, meow.\"\nHearing that Leo could create void leaves, Kishin Douji was stunned. He started to doubt the man's origin.\n\"Tell me, who is Florida Man exactly?! How does he relate to the Void Tree or the higher universe?!\"\nCat shrugged, \"No idea, meow.\"\n\"Tsk. Useless kid.\"\nKishin Douji turned around and flew east, heading to Leo's HQ. However, when he reached halfway, he stopped and turned around, gazing at Cat's pretty face and cute physique.\nObserving Cat's underdeveloped physique for a minute, Kishin Douji grinned and scratched his crotch. He muttered.\n\"She will grow up fine, perfect for a seedbed. Once I can ascend, I'll take her as a concubine!\"\nLaughing to himself, he headed to Leo's HQ.\nUnbeknownst to him, someone could hear and see everything in this universe.\n.\n.\nThe Oni entered through the front door. He was greeted by the sci-fi airtight room.\nA dozen deities entered the room with him while another group of customers holding bags of fresh food exited the shopping complex. Kishin Douji glanced at the surrounding cultivators and deeply frowned.\nIt had been a year since he last visited this place. When he was here, only a few thousand immortals existed. Seeing so many deities, he wondered where they came from.\nStrangely, the deities didn't bother greeting or paying respect to each other like they used to. They simply smiled and nodded at each other as if their existence was insignificant here.\nSeeing their interaction, Kishin Douji had so many questions. He was curious why they acted this way. Back in his galaxy, most deities and immortals always bragged and tried to spread their fame. 90% of them were troublemakers and overbearing as they treated their peers as rivals or stepping stones. But here, none of them showed a sign of aggression.\nTheir culture and behavior disappointed Kishin Douji. He doubted they had enough combat experience.\n'Foolish cultivators. When shit hits the fan, they will quickly die because they are inexperienced in life-and-death combat! Soon, once a veteran shows up, these superficial people will piss their pants.'\nIgnoring the humble customers, Kishin entered the shopping complex. The next thing he found was a reception desk, Qiang Qiang, and Meowmeow. Strangely, the four-armed statue was connected to the angel in a lewd way, but nobody around them bat an eye.\nKishin Douji frowned and stared at the statues. Although they didn't move, he sensed their subtle movements – They were fornicating in the middle of the public.\n\"How vulgar.\"\nKishin Douji shook his head and released his killing intent, glaring at Meowmeow.Meowmeow glanced at the Oni Overlord. He secretly sent a sound transmission to him.\n\"Mind your business, Oni.\"\nKishin Douji clicked his tongue, \"Stop what you're doing, or I'll cut off your junk.\"\n\"Do you realize who you are provoking, bitch?\"\nMeowmeow patted Qiang Qiang's head and pulled her into his dantian universe. He turned around and armed himself with flame armor and two katanas. Kishin Douji also drew a white katana and prepared for a fight.\nRUMBLE\nKishin Douji was a karmic sovereign and so did Meowmeow. Their aura collided, creating sparks and pushing nearby shoppers away.\nCLICK\nSuddenly, both top dogs flinched as they sensed an inconsistency in the air. They noticed a weird flow of Qi nearby, which always appeared when someone used the time law. However, unlike the time domains that they knew, they failed to notice the 4th dimension's time flow.\nThe next moment, Kishin Douji lowered his head. There was a hole in his chest, and his dantian universe was missing. His soul was also damaged beyond repair.\n\"H-How…?\"\nKishin Douji collapsed while his soul was ejected from his body. Behind him, a small Cathulhu golem looked around in confusion.\n\"Munya? I remember that I was in Orlando World. Why am I here, munya?\"\nMeowmeow raised his brows, confused.\n\"Did you kill that Oni, Mu-Nyang?\"\nMu-Nyang, the Cathulhu Golem shrugged, \"That wasn't me, munya! I am framed!\"\n\"Then who…?\"\nBoth golems looked at each other in confusion. As they couldn't find the culprit, they looked up and sent their voice transmission to their master – Leo.\nBefore they could report the anomaly, Leo's voice entered their mind.\n\"That was me.\"\n\"…Wow.\" Meowmeow was impressed. \"I didn't even notice your move, master! What dao domain did you use? Time Domain?\"\n\"Yeah, just a simple time domain. Oh, before I forgot – Mu-\nNyang, I've brought you out here for a reason.\"\nMu-Nyang was startled. He straightened his posture, \"Is there something you want me to do, munya?\"\n\"Nothing much. Just consume that idiot's soul. Put him in your dantian universe and refine his manner for me, can you?\"\nMu-Nyang and Meowmeow were surprised. Aside from Mao Miaomiao who committed grave crimes, no one else was tortured with this method. He wondered what Kishin Douji had done.\n\"Should I torture him, munya?\" Asked Mu-Nyang.\n\"If I remember correctly, my father put Mao Miaomiao inside your dantian universe, right? Pit him against that fool and make them fight each other for the rest of eternity.\"\n\"But what did he ever do to you, munya? This is kinda cruel.\"\nLeo's sigh could be heard. He dismissed them with one sentence.\n\"I only did what a parent should do to a child predator.\"\n\"???\"\nLeo cut the communication, leaving Meowmeow and Mu-\nNyang confused. Nevertheless, Mu-Nyang scooped the damaged soul of Kishin Douji and put him into the karma river in his dantian universe. After his next reincarnation, he would forget about his past life. His future fate would be forced to fight with Mao Miaomiao for endless years until they gave up struggling.\n…\nAnother year passed. The Florida Planet officially entered its Ice Age. No mortal or creature in this world survived. Even the immortals struggled to deter the overwhelming yin Qi from the north.\nLeo immediately erected a colony barrier to protect the residents from extreme yin Qi. While staying in the colony with Esen, he scanned the world and noticed the anomaly.\nIt was the atmosphere in the sky. Moreover, it reeked of his bodily fluid.\n\"Oh, boy.\"\nLeo scratched his head after he realized his mistake.\n\"I guess I'll be busy again. I wish someone could replace me soon.\"\nWithout moving away from the colony, Leo wiggled his fingers and adjusted the atmosphere density, increasing the temperature.\n.\n.\nWhile Leo was busy managing his world, Priscilla marched with her phoenix population. A fleet of phoenixes migrated from their original galaxy and visited the Cathulhu Galaxy, where Overlord Xiaomao resided.\nPriscilla landed on a green planet. He found the elder fisherman, who minded his business near a lake.\nShe informed the fisherman, \"Won't you visit Florida Man? Your lifespan is running low.\"\nXiaomao nodded as he was aware of his impending death. He sighed.\n\"Not yet. I have to remain here for a while. Those pesky werewolves are cooking something again.\"\n\"You mean, Lucky and Milo? Are those idiots trying to attack you again?\"\n\"Probably. They have been eyeing my fishing rod for a while. The last time they visited, they offered five billion essence stones for my fishing rod. I rejected them, of course.\"\nPriscilla glanced at Xiaomao's fishing rod. As it was the only artifact that was made from true entity fate crystal, it was so powerful that it could potentially kill a transcendent being. She too wished she could have one.\n\"Do you need a bodyguard?\"\n\"No need. I can instantly kill both Milo and Lucky if they act up.\"\n\"But your people might suffer.\"\n\"…\"\nXiaomao looked up and deeply sighed. He was also worried about the cats.\n\"You said to me long before. You're migrating to join your son, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThat was the reason behind Priscilla's movements. She and her phoenixes planned to join forces with Leo since he was in control of the Prismatic Void Tree. Moreover, he was the strongest person in this universe.\n\"Can you bring half of my population there with you?\"\nPriscilla gave Xiaomao a meaningful look. But when she saw the gloomy face of the old man, she understood his feelings.\n\"I'll tell my son to help you. Be patient and don't die.\"\n\"…Thank you.\"\nPriscilla left the planet and visited nearby Cathulhu planets. As entrusted by Xiaomao, she enlisted the local Catopuses and Cathulhus to join her migration.\nXiaomao gazed at the sky. He let out a long sigh and muttered.\n\"I guess I won't live long enough to see what the higher universe looks like.\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 334 – Florida Man Self-Proclaims as God's Incarnation, Complains that Heaven is a Black Company, and Files a Lawsuit against God.\nAs Priscilla visited every galaxy during her trip, warlords, minor overlords, and cultivators of various races heard about Leo and his Florida Dao. As Leo was the strongest person in his galaxy, everybody called it \"Florida Galaxy\" to honor him.\nCountless minor races were interested in Leo. They dispatched emissaries from their worlds to follow Priscilla to Florida Galaxy. Moreover, they contacted their trade partners and vessels, spreading the news of this discovery.\nSoon, the words reached the ears of Lucky, who deserted from Ellen Faction. He and Milo reconciled and schemed to steal Overlord Xiaomao's fishing rod artifact. When the news reached them, Lucky and Milo reconsidered their plan.\nThe two werewolves had a private meeting in the middle of the void.\nLucky had a bright idea. He suggested to Milo, \"You should send scouts to check the Void Tree. If he defeated Planet Devourer as the rumor said, his troops should be there protecting the tree. But if the rumor is false, planet eaters should be lingering there.\"\nMilo agreed to the suggestion, but he disliked working alone. He also wanted Lucky to do something.\n\"While I'm leading my troops to check the tree, you should contribute something too. How about you initiate small skirmishes between our younglings and the Cathulhu's children. We can try playing a long game and nib the bud while we're recuperating our forces.\"\nLucky frowned as he disagreed. After the war, less than 3 million fenrir werewolves survived. On the other hand, Cathulhu never participated in any major battle, and their number reached over 200 trillion. This didn't include the unevolved children, aka the Catopus.\nThey were outnumbered!\n\"We don't have enough men to start another war. Without that Overlord Xiaomao's artifact, we can't touch the Cathulhu.\"\nMilo smirked as he had a sick idea, \"How about we round up the deserters, pirates, bounty hunters, and remnants of Mao Miaomiao's troops. Oh, I heard Kishin Douji is missing. If we run into Oni colonies, we can enslave them. The women can be our seedbeds to increase our number. As for the men, we make them our war slaves. How about that?\"\nLucky was taken aback. Although he might be greedy, he disliked treating other races the same way Eleanor had treated them. Thus, he shut down the suggestion.\n\"No. You know what? Forget it. We will focus on recuperating our forces and establish an amicable relationship with Florida Man.\"\n\"Are you submitting to that NU'EARTHE?!\" Milo yelled at Lucky.\n\"It is what it is. I used to call Eleanor a bitch, but we eventually surrendered to her. What's the difference between now and then?\"\n\"…You disgust me, Milo. You sound like a bitch.\"\n\"…Heh. Maybe I was born with the wrong gender.\"\n\"Tsk! You know what? Screw this. I'm gonna go and check the void tree myself. If that Nu'Earthe is really that great, I'll snatch that geezer's fishing rod myself and rule the universe without you!\"\n\"Good luck with that.\"\n\"…You coward.\"\nDisgusted by Lucky's change of attitude, Milo turned around and left.\nAfter Milo was gone, Lucky deeply sighed. Without a fate crystal, he couldn't view the status of his lifespan or use a system ability. He felt helpless and weak.\nStill, Lucky was envious of Overlord Xiaomao. He also blamed Priscilla that she didn't give him a proper true entity fate crystal.\nHis mind was conflicted. Half of him urged him to quit dreaming and be content with what he had. The evil side of him sought riches, power, and authority. Moreover, his hatred toward the human race and its variants never faded from his heart.\nOverwhelmed by conflicted emotions, Lucky had a headache. He returned to his people and commanded them not to seek trouble. He hoped that they could find peace in this chaotic universe.\n.\n.\nIn the depths of Karma River, souls floated aimlessly and rested in tranquility. The river washed away their previous life memory and cleansed their souls. Those who stayed the longest were washed clean and were chosen to start a new life in a random place.\nAlthough Karma River erased dead people's memories, the souls of cultivators, monsters, and strong overlords sometimes resisted the river's effects. Karmic sovereigns were immune to this effect and could freely reincarnate anywhere they wanted to as long as a fragment of their soul existed.\nDuring the last war between Planet Devourer and Priscilla Alliance, most of the elves were killed by planet eaters. When the planet eaters died, the consumed souls were freed and returned to the karma river.\nAmong the dead people, cultivators from the Yan Empire who had been abducted by Milo got caught in the crossfire. They entered the circle of reincarnation as well.\nAmid systematic circulation, several soul fragments of planet eaters merged with the soul embryos of human souls. The planet eater consumed the human's soul and took over his place.\nOne of them belonged to the soul of a mortal. He was once a young master of the Ouyang Clan. Another one was once an expert from the Situ Clan. Several others copied the memories of dead angels, elves, werewolves, goblins, orcs, and other races.\nThe planet eaters consumed the human souls and stole their memories. When they regained their souls, they quickly escaped from the karma rivers. As soon as they escaped, they recreated their new fleshly bodies.\nSome relied on the new memories to regenerate the fleshly body of that race. Meanwhile, a few lucky ones restored their former bodies. One after another, new planet eaters were reborn!The reincarnated planet eaters were not as smart as Planet Devourer. They began wandering in the universe, following their instinct. All of them moved in packs.\nOne of the packs traveled toward the direction of the Cathulhu Galaxy.\n.\n.\nAfter the long movie, Leo yawned and left the cinema. Esen also rubbed her eyes as she wasn't used to watching a movie.\nShe complained, \"It would have been more fun if I could read the protagonist's karma and predict his future. He sure was unlucky. I was surprised when the main character died in the first 3 minutes.\"\nLeo shrugged, \"That's the entertaining part of movies. You can't interfere with their fate, and you can only observe them.\"\n\"It's annoying.\"\n\"I know. But didn't you shriek when an Arachne jump-scared the protagonist and snapped his neck?\"\n\"I-I didn't expect that development! I thought there was only one entity in that house!\"\nEsen pouted, but she grinned. The movie was fun.\nAs the couple was about to continue their date elsewhere, Leo suddenly sensed a strange flow of karma in the universe. He closed his left eye to spy on the universe trend.\nSounds of billion souls being swallowed and eaten by planet eaters entered his mind. Their desperation, anger, and other negative emotions reached him.\nLeo staggered backward one step. His left eye bled and shed a bloody tear. But from the onlooker's perspective, it looked like Leo was crying because his blood and tears had the same color.\nEsen noticed that Leo suddenly stopped. She turned around and saw the trail of transparent blood on Leo's face.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nLeo deeply inhaled and patted Esen's head.\n\"There's a group of runaway prisoners. I think I might need to reinforce this universe's karma rivers a bit. There has been an overpopulation issue recently.\"\nBeing a supreme emperor of this universe wasn't an easy job. Sometimes, the will of the Karma Rivers or the universe begged him for help. Many times, they showed the tragic events and let Leo feel the victims' emotions to motivate him.\nThis was the downside of carrying the same bloodline as the void tree. As the source of all Qi, luck, and fate, everything in the universe was linked to his entity.\nIn short, being a god was annoying.\n\"Your cultivation base already surpasses the limit of the universe. Does the universe still force you to help it?\"\nEsen was aware of Leo's duty as the Time Emperor. He often stopped time and disappeared somewhere without telling her. When he returned, his expressions and actions looked like someone who had been gone for several years.\n\"… I saw our timeline's future. It's not pleasant. I'm gonna need to alter it a bit.\"\n\"I see. How long will you be gone?\"\n\"Not long. Probably five or six minutes in your time.\"\nEsen bitterly smiled, \"But from your perspective, it's going to be five or six thousand years, isn't it.\"\n\"Yeah. Restoring and expanding karma rivers take time.\"\nEsen stroked Leo's face and kissed him. Both closed their eyes and savored their touches.\nWhen their lips parted, Esen wished him well.\n\"I'll be waiting.\"\nLeo smiled, \"I'll be right back.\"\nCLICK!\nEsen could only hear a tick of a clock. Leo who was with her a second ago vanished into smoke.\nThe wife deeply exhaled. She turned around and pondered in her mind.\n'I guess I'll need a new sexy lingerie. He was always desperate for a hug when he returned.'\nTo support her husband's mental health, Esen visited the clothing stores to pick some cosplay clothes and lingerie.\n.\n.\nWhile the time in the universe was frozen, Leo teleported and appeared in the middle of the universe.\nThe Prismatic Void Tree was still healthy. However, about a few lightyears away, a pack of planet eaters were approaching. Fortunately, the absolute time emperor domain stopped their movements.\nLeo grumbled and glared at the planet eaters.\n\"I guess Priscilla wasn't thorough with her job. How could she leave these mongrels around?\"\nJust by looking, Leo could see several billion souls inside each of them. These planet eaters had just swallowed a few planets, and they were about to come after the prismatic void tree.\nNot allowing the planet eaters to eat his daughters, Leo waved his hand.\nInstantly, the planet eaters' souls were erased from the universe. They would not be reincarnated again.\nAfter removing the planet eaters, Leo closed his eyes and peeked into future timelines. Then, he saw the destruction of Cathulhu. Moreover, he detected countless newborn planet eaters and potential neutron stars, which were about to evolve into planet eaters too.\n\"Tsk. This is going to be a hassle.\"\nLeo jotted down his task.\n\"Expand Karma Rivers, increase Karma Rivers, optimize the reincarnation process, kill all mother-humping planet eaters, destroy those mutating magnetars, and… fuck, reorganize the entire universe and galaxy's path! Five galaxies are going to collide because of that stupid mutt! Who was it? Milo? That fucking moron is still alive?!\"\nLeo scratched his head until it got messy. He sometimes wished he should have just destroyed the entire universe and ended this responsibility.\nIn the end, Leo returned to work. He located wandering planet eaters and erased them manually. It would take him a few thousand years to finish all tasks.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 335 – Florida Billionaire Announces His Retirement and Passes His Forklift Certificate to His Daughter. She Eats It.\nNot a split second passed, but a lone Florida Man was by himself, working behind the scenes to make the universe a better place. He removed newborn planet eaters and erased their souls, preventing them from coming back to life again.\nErasing someone was easy, but making sure that no neutron star would mutate into planet eaters was a challenging task. Leo finished removing planet eaters without dropping a sweat, but vaccinating a star core was energy-consuming – It required Leo a minute of his time to correct a star core's growth and expanding direction.\nAt the corner of the universe, a rural galaxy averagely consisted of 200 billion stars. Further into the center of the universe, galaxies, and star clusters were older, and their numbers were greater. Every galaxy had at least a trillion stars in their domain.\nThis didn't include private universes belonging to entities and karmic sovereigns. If they brought out their stars, the number would be higher.\nLeo swallowed his pain and vaccinated the stars around the Prismatic Void Tree first.\n2,000 years in Leo's time passed. Leo finished cleaning the billionth star, and he was mentally exhausted. He started to question why he was doing this when he could simply kill all planet eaters instantly.\nHe quickly changed his mind later when he returned to the Prismatic Void Tree and gazed at the expressions of the Alraunes. They might be naughty, lewd, and gluttonous. However, their smile reminded Leo of Cat and Esen back home. His heart palpitated, reminding him what he was working for.\nLeo brightly smiled and clapped his hands. Motivated and determined, Leo resumed the cleansing process.\nAlthough Leo promised Esen that he would only experience a few thousand years in this time-frozen universe, he ended up working in isolation for 10,000 years. Whenever he doubted his sanity or missed his wife, he simply returned to them to admire their faces. Then, he went back to work.\nIn the 20,000th year, Leo shifted his attention to the karma river to change the mood.\nFortunately, as Leo had multiple karma rivers inside him, he had experience of governing and tampering with the rivers before. He simply exchanged this universe's karma rivers with his and converted all souls to be linked with him. From that day on, whoever was reincarnated would have their fate linked to Leo. No matter what they did, they couldn't become stronger than him.\nIt was a tyrannical move, but this method was faster than manually fixing the chaotic rivers. After all, correcting a karma river in one's dantian universe was a lot easier.\nHis action caused the universe to start mutating new souls to have a tinge of Leo's bloodline and legacy. Most of them would inherit a lizardman or an alligator's instinct. As for the minority, they would carry on a prismatic phoenix bloodline, an angel bloodline, a fenrir werewolf bloodline, a cathulhu bloodline, or a void tree bloodline.\nAfter leaving his seeds and legacy, Leo stopped working. He peeked into the future to make sure that his work would eliminate undesirable futures.\nIt worked. All dreadful and tragic timelines vanished, replaced with hopeful and joyful futures. Though conflict would never end, evildoers would eventually perish while Leo's friends and family would thrive. Main characters, heroes, and saviors would rise amid the chaos.\nEven though he hadn't vaccinated all stars in the universe yet, he let fate work its way. Satisfied with his work, Leo resumed the flow of time and returned home.\nWhile returning home, Leo looked back to the past timelines and noticed some inconsistencies. For example, Meowmeow knew about his future and that he would marry Esen. Also, there were strange prophesies about the four guardians' fates.\nKilling his time while cruising home, Leo scanned his past to find the source of the weird prophesies. He wondered which time lord tampered with his fate.\nIt wasn't hard for Leo to find the culprit. Upon noticing the mysterious entity, Leo gazed at the Prismatic Void Tree and uttered his name.\n\"Dammit Void Principality. You knew about my emergence all along.\"\nThere was no answer from the mysterious entity. Leo smirked and shook his head.\n\"If you don't come down, I'll go up and find you.\"\nAgain, the entity didn't respond to Leo.\nLeo changed his plan. He resumed the time flow to relieve the burden. Then, he grew a prismatic leaf from his fingertip.\nDING\n<Confirming the dimensional teleportation. Would you like to enter the Great Void Universe?>\nBefore Leo could utter a word, an archaic voice entered his mind. It was from the mysterious entity.\n\"I'll be visiting your domain and answering your questions in 100,000 years. Wait for me there.\"\nLeo spat, \"What if I go up myself?\"\n\"You will destroy my universe. The Great Void Universe might be above you, but that doesn't mean that all residents here are cultivators like you. Some of us are mortals.\"\n\"Hoh?\" Leo heard something interesting. He refuted, \"But I already visited your universe several times before. Haven't you noticed my arrival?\"\n\"You didn't. You probably went up somewhere other than my universe. Also, last year, I sensed that two of the great voids collapsed because someone tampered with their timelines. Was it you?\"\nLeo paused and averted his eyes. He flop-sweated.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nVoid Principality deeply sighed. He warned Leo, \"I know that your strength already surpasses us, the Singularities. I will invite others to visit your 'Stores' later. For now, spare us, please.\"Leo finally laughed. He was also relieved, \"That's more like it. I thought for a second that you were looking for trouble.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Tell me when you will be arriving. I'll hold a banquet to welcome you.\"\n\"…Many thanks.\"\nThe two lords continued exchanging pleasantries and chatted for a long time.\n.\n.\nThe death of planet eaters' souls didn't end the looming chaos. As only their souls were erased, their fleshly bodies remained. As a result, lucky passing-by wanderers harvested their bloodline and brought the whale's meat back home. As a consequence, planet eaters would be born from the residents of the universe, not from the stars.\nOverlord Lucky was a part of the fortunate ones. He found a corpse that Leo had left behind and gave them to his subordinates.\nUpon consumption, the werewolves realized that they gained new innate power. They reported this matter to Overlord Lucky and spread the news to Milo's men.\nThis caused an internal strife between Milo and Lucky. Milo who coveted Overlord Xiaomao's fishing rod began poaching Lucky's subordinates and initiated his crusade against the Cathulhu.\n9 years after Leo had adjusted the Karma Rivers, the grand war between Milo's crusade army and the Cathulhu broke out.\nBecause of Milo, Lucky had no choice but to join the war. Armies of ragtag remnants of dead overlords gathered and invaded Overlord Xiaomao's territory.\nThe peace-loving big-head cats didn't expect the sudden invasion. Several habitable planets were destroyed and a billion innocent cats were murdered. This enraged Overlord Xiaomao.\nDespite being almost out of lifespan, Xiaomao joined the war and asked Priscilla and Ellen for assistance.\n…\nFlorida Planet\nIt was already midnight. All small stores in the main town were closed, but \"Cat Mall\" aka the first shopping mall branch that Cat managed was still open. The general manager of this place was none other than Cat.\nThe dryad in question was 10 years old this year. Despite being young, her humanoid physique looked the same as an adult. Her tanned skin, elf ears, and gorgeous face earned her the \"Goddess of Florida\" nickname. Men worshiped her as she was the most beautiful lady in this world, surpassing Beatrice and Esen.\nCountless young adults wished to pursue her, but no one dared to do so because of Cat's current social status as Leo's adopted daughter. In addition, there were also other factors.\nFirst, Priscilla arrived 9 years ago and submitted to Leo. They merged their forces and created formed a new country in this universe, which centered on the Florida Planet. They renamed their entire galaxy as Florida Galaxy. After they integrated their armies, Priscilla revealed herself as Leo's foster mother, increasing the fame of his family. As a result, Cat's status improved.\nSecondly, Simba and Ester retrieved their son back and served Leo as an external army, guarding the entire galaxy against external threats. As they knew about Cat and Leo's weird bloodline, they left behind some of their dragonewt legions to protect Leo's headquarters. An all-female dragoon unit served Cat as her bodyguards, and no one was weaker than a karmic sovereign.\nAnd lastly, Cat was no longer a deadweight. After receiving gifts and food from Leo, her cultivation caught up with the past him – the Transcendence Realm Level 10. Aside from Simba, Aslan, and Leo, nobody could defeat her in a 1v1 fight.\nCat was tired from the long day of work. She opened her system menu and deposited half of this month's total income to the \"Family Pool\", which Leo had created to share between his family members in case of emergency.\nDING\n<You have transferred 60 million years of lifespan.>\nCat stretched and yawned, ignoring a lone A4 paper that Leo had written. \"STOP POCKETING MAD COW BEEF\" was the message. She had been embezzling the shopping mall's income because of her glutton, and Leo kept reprimanding her.\n\"Time to hunt some cows, meow.\"\nCat left her office on the fifth floor and visited the store next door. Upon entering an office-like store, she was teleported to a mystic realm platform.\nIt was a plane in the middle of the void, but a hundred red portals were also active, allowing the visitors to play in the monster realms.\nCat ejected a prismatic void leaf from her storage ring and walked toward one of the portals. She paid the fee to the employee, who was a stone elf.\n\"Your Highness, please refrain from killing all mad cows in there. We've received complaints from our customers that they can barely hunt because you hogged all the monsters to yourself.\"\n\"Ehhh?\" Cat pouted. \"But I need to nom-nom, meow.\"\n\"P-Please, Your Highness.\"\n\"Meh, fine. I won't eat cows today. I'll go eat some angler fish in the Mariana Trench Realm.\"\nThe elf let out a sigh of relief. She nodded and guided Cat to the new portal.\nWhile the elf guided Cat to the new place, the princess suddenly flinched. She rushed out to the exit and teleported back to the shopping mall in urgent.\nUpon return, she sensed a spaceship fleet traveling across the universe toward Leo's galaxy. She got out of the shopping mall and flew to see them.\nWhen Cat reached the fleet, she found a few dragon warships under Simba Army escorting the group. She sent a voice transmission to ask the soldiers.\n\"What happened here, meow?\"\nA few seconds later, the captain of the escort ship replied.\n\"Your Highness, we're escorting war refugees. They're Cathulhus under Overlord Xiaomao. A-Also, Overlord Xiaomao is here with them.\"\n\"Xiaomao, who?\"",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 336 – Fisherman Calls Police After Florida Woman Catfishes Him and Steals His Fish\nThe war between Fenrir Werewolves and Cathulhus did not proceed as planned. Although Overlord Xiaomao and many Cathulhus were stronger than the invading forces, they got blindsided by small task forces from various races.\nThe angel race, who were born from Dr. Mao Miaomiao's dantian universe, was the greatest threat. They consumed their dead comrades and evolved into giant eyeballs, similar to Sieg. They coordinated with the werewolves and destroyed civilian planets. Then, the wicked angel turned dead Cathulhu civilians into giant sea creatures, such as tunas, angler fish, jellyfish, and sharks to terrorize Cathulhu's territory.\nEllen sent her forces to help the Cathulhu. She managed to wipe out half of the angel's forces while Overlord Xiaomao defeated the other half by himself. However, dealing with the roaming mutated Cathulhus was another story.\nGiant sea creatures dispersed and roamed the universe after the major battle. Some peacefully integrated into the habitant's culture while the rest became wild space animals. They quickly bred with other races and gave birth to other space monsters.\nIn the end, the Cathulhu sensed that their home galaxy was no longer safe. As they heard about Leo's fame, some of them decided to migrate to Florida Galaxy.\nAs the leader of all Cathulhus, Overlord Xiaomao led the first immigrant fleet to visit Leo for the first time.\n…\nBecause of Cat's presence, the escort fleet halted their advance. The immigration fleet also stopped. Xiaomao noticed the presence of a transcendent being. He left the ship to greet the expert.\nBut when the overlord came out and saw Cat's otherworldly beauty, his heart stuttered. Even though Xiaomao had lived and experienced the world for countless years, his body reacted to Cat's natural charm and beauty.\nOverlord Xiaomao smacked his chest and regained his composure. He cupped his fist and saluted.\n\"Greetings, young lady. I'm Overlord Xiaomao from the Cathulhu Galaxy. We're here to migrate to Lord Florda Man's territory. I hope that you can show us mercy.\"\nCat tilted her head in confusion. As she didn't understand politics, she simply asked the overlord what she always taxed the others.\n\"Nom-Nom Meow?\"\nShe might be 10 years old, but she still demanded nom-nom tax from strangers.\nXiaomao was unfazed by the sudden tongue language. As the Cathulhu also had a unique accent, the overlord was used to it. Her language was also easy to comprehend.\n\"What kind of food would you like? Animal meat, fish, humanoid beings, vegetables, fruits, or blood?\"\nCat was overjoyed as this stranger was understanding, \"Anything is Nom-Nom'able to me, meow!\"\n\"I see,\" Xiaomao laughed and gave her the corpse of a mutated planet eater, which was in the form of a star-sized piranha.\nCat squealed and rushed to eat it. Her jaw detached as she expanded the size of her mouth. In one bite, the entire creature disappeared into her small stomach.\nAlthough Xiaomao was familiar with Cathulhus, this was his first time witnessing an absurd glutton. He wondered what Cat's stomach was made of.\n\"You have a great appetite, I see.\" Xiaomao praised her.\n\"Thank you, meow! You're a good man, meow!\"\nXiaomao straightened his back and asked her, \"May I know who you are, miss?\"\nCat puffed her chest. \"I am Cat! My daoist name is Florida Girl!\"\n\"F-Florida Dao?\" Xiaomao was taken aback. He heard about this dao, but he still didn't understand what it was.\nWhile they were chatting, a representative gold dragonewt of the escort troops flew toward the overlord. When he noticed Cat's presence, he quickly reminded the overlord who she was.\n\"Senior, this person is the first princess of Florida Galaxy, \"Kat, the Florida Fairy\". She is known to be the off-limited goddess. All men who once courted her suffered unforeseen demise. Please keep your distance and mind your boundary.\"\nXiaomao broke a sweat and whispered back. \"I understand. But isn't she pitiful? She will never get married at this rate.\"\nThe dragonewt officer dryly laughed. \"Sir, she's only 10 years old.\"\n\"…\"\n\"I hope you're not interested in her. If you do, our lord might kill you.\"\n\"…\"\nOverlord Xiaomao almost slapped his face for the sinful thought. He marked the day as the blemish of his life.\nAfter chatting with Cat and the officer for a while, Cat allowed everybody to enter the galaxy. She also used her authority to book the East Hotel to accommodate the delegates.\n…A day later, Dongfang Mei who was still the general manager of the hotel arranged a schedule for the new visitors to meet Leo. In the afternoon, Leo visited the hotel's grand hall to greet the new guests.\nXiaomao and Leo met again. The latter welcomed the elder.\n\"I've been expecting you. How was the trip?\"\nXiaomao bitterly laughed, \"Terrible, sir. Our people have been murdered. We migrate as many Catopuses as we can, and they are lacking food. I hope that you can provide us an assistance. Oh, I heard you always exchange your merchandise for life force. I don't have much, but I'm willing to pay for them.\"\nLeo raised his eyebrows and sighed, \"Don't worry. I don't need any. I'll give them enough food that they will be fatter than J*bba, the H*t.\"\n\"J*bba?\"\n\"Never mind. Anyway…\"\nLeo scanned Xiaomao's lifespan status. It did not look good – He only had less than 10 years to live.\n\"You've been living a hard life, friend,\" Leo felt bad for him. He wished he could extend the man's lifespan, but his fate was already predetermined.\nXiaomao faintly smiled as he didn't feel like it was. Instead, his life was already fulfilling, except he never got married.\n\"It's alright. I'll manage.\"\n\"…I see.\"\nThe two continued to discuss the immigration matter and settled an arrangement for the Cathulhu.\nThe negotiation was smooth as Leo already foresaw this event. He agreed to accommodate the cats and provide them with jobs and opportunities.\nXiaomao was grateful for Leo's help. He offered to give Leo his fishing rod, but Leo declined.\nLeo was impressed by Xiaomao's positive attitude and honor. Instead of taking his items or lifespan, he decided to assist him and give him a better future. By waving his finger, Leo ejected a prismatic void pill, which was the latest masterpiece of his domain. He gave it to Xiaomao.\n\"What is this?\" Asked Xiaomao.\n\"Prismatic Void Pill.\"\nThe bead pill glittered in rainbow light similar to Leo's aura in the past. It also contained various effects, but only Leo knew what it could do.\nLeo urged Xiaomao, \"Eat this pill before you return. You will be able to recover the strength and suppress the karma river's curse for a few years. After the pill's effects expire, you should be able to live for another 100 years or so.\"\nXiaomao was surprised. He laughed, \"A hundred years is too long for me. I will eventually reincarnate anyway. I don't see the point of living miserably for longer.\"\n\"Hmm. But I think you might want to reconsider it, though.\"\n\"Why is that?\"\n\"One day, your subordinates might bring you a piece of good news and bad news. They will leave behind a legacy and ask you for help.\"\n\"A legacy?\"\nXiaomao pondered what legacy would be so important that required his help. All Cathulhus that he had interacted with in the past were mostly playful and idiotic. Only his disciple, Miao Damao, was more reliable.\nLeo wished he could reveal what tragic event Overlord Xiaomao needed to face. For the sake of the final result, he chose not to disclose Xiaomao's future ordeal.\n\"That's all I can say. Come back when you are ready to reincarnate. I will prepare the parting gifts for your next life's journey.\"\nXiaomao gave Leo a meaningful look. He deeply bowed, \"I'll never forget your kindness, Lord Florida Man.\"\n\"…It's my duty.\" Leo snickered.\n…\nAfter Overlord Xiaomao left, Leo summoned Mu-Nyang over.\nMu-Nyang rarely stayed in the Florida Domain as he mostly worked in Orlando. When Leo summoned him, he was overjoyed.\n\"What's up, munya?\"\nLeo gazed at Mu-Nyang and patted the walking statue. Feeling guilty for ignoring the guy, he asked the giant cat boy.\n\"Is there anything you want, Mu-Nyang? What is your dream?\"\nMu-Nyang pursed his lips as the question came out of nowhere. He pondered about it and thought of Aslan.\n\"If I reincarnate, will I be able to remember you, munya?\"\nLeo shook his head, \"You're a newborn soul that is attached to me. Once I let you go, you will forget about me and what we have done together.\"\n\"…That's sad, munya. I don't want to reincarnate anymore. I want to be with you, munya!\"\nLeo was happy, but there was a timeline that required Mu-\nNyang's cooperation. In that potential future, Mu-Nyang would live a good life, have a loving wife, and have many good friends. As Leo was the creator of Mu-Nyang, he wanted the child to live free as an adult.\n\"Even birds leave their nests one day. It's about time you have to spread your wings, Mu-Nyang.\"\nMu-Nyang was taken aback. He protested, \"Do I really have to reincarnate, munya?! I don't want to go, munya! I love it here!\"\n\"But what about your life? You can't live as a soulless golem forever. If I leave this universe for too long, you will turn into stone permanently.\"\n\"…Ugh,\" Mu-Nyang sulked. He was unwilling to leave. \"Can't I be your subordinate forever, munya?\"\nLeo was at his wit's end. He was about to abandon this project, but he suddenly had an inspiration. Leo shared what he saw with Mu-Nyang.\nMu-Nyang fell into a trance. Although 10 seconds had passed, he experienced 10,000 years in his mind.\n\"M-Master?\" Mu-Nyang stuttered in disbelief.\n\"Do you want that future to happen to the poor man?\"\n\"O-Of course not! That would be too tragic, munya!\"\n\"Then, can you help him for me?\"\n\"…But I won't be able to remember you, munya.\"\n\"You won't be alone. I'll send Lucky and Meowmeow to be with you. I'll also visit you occasionally and create new memories together with you. Even though you might not remember me, I'll always remember you.\"\nMu-Nyang shed a tear. He sniffed and cried like a baby.\nLeo hugged him and stayed with him for a whole year, playing with him 24/7.\nA year later, Leo gathered Lucky, Meowmeow, and Mu-Nyang. He freed Lucky and Meowmeow's souls, sending them to Mu-\nNyang's dantian universe. Then, Leo personally implanted a true karmic fate crystal into Mu-Nyang's soul fragment and sent him off to the karma river.\n.\n.\nIn the end, Xiaomao left Florida Galaxy alone and left the Cathulhu immigrants behind. He returned to his galaxy to protect the other fighters and his disciples.\nA few years later, Xiaomao understood why Leo mentioned \"Legacy\".\nOne day, his disciple \"Miao Damao\" brought his wife over for a visit. However, they were critically injured, and his wife had a baby. After a brief investigation, Miao Damao revealed that they were being hunted by Overlord Lucky and his men.\nThis enraged Xiaomao. He taunted Lucky and baited him into a fight.\nLucky fell for Xiaomao's scheme and attacked the fisherman. However, Overlord Xiaomao killed Lucky in one move.\nAfter the brief fight, Miao Damao and his wife passed away. Xiaomao tried to resuscitate them, but he only managed to save the baby.\nThe baby of Miao Damao was none other than Mu-Nyang, whom Xiaomao unknowingly blessed with the same name. From that day on, Mu-Nyang became Xiaomao's adopted child.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 337 – Florida Man, Armed to the Teeth, Raids Animal Shelter to Pet a Rescued Cat.\nAfter Mu-Nyang had been reincarnated, Leo secretly protected Overlord Xiaomao and Mu-Nyang from wandering creatures and Milo's troops.\nThe overlord discovered a new meaning of life and raised Mu-Nyang as his son. Meanwhile, Mu-Nyang got to enjoy a fresh new life without realizing that his dantian universe contained two of his former comrades and a couple prisoners there.\nUnfortunately, Xiaomao's lifespan was limited. Eight years after Overlord Xiaomao had visited Leo, he returned to bid farewell to everybody.\n…\nFlorida Planet\nLeo welcomed Xiaomao and allowed him to rest at the hotel for free. However, Xiaomao declined and simply wished for a chat.\nThe fisherman overlord wearily cupped his fist and bowed for the last time before he entered the circle of reincarnation.\n\"Lord Florida Man. I've come to bid farewell.\"\nLeo nodded. He glanced at Xiaomao's status and saw the latter's lifespan – It showed as 2,000 years, but he actually had two years to live.\n\"Do you need any help?\" Asked Leo.\n\"Haha. Then, please protect my child Mu-Nyang. He's too innocent for our universe. I wish he could grow up and live a happy life, away from the politics and harsh environment.\"\n\"That's natural.\"\nXiaomao bitterly smiled and let out a long sigh. He bowed again, \"Then, I'll be leaving. I can't leave the child for too long. He might wander off and accidentally stumble upon a roaming space creature or a vile werewolf.\"\n\"Hold on,\" Leo called Xiaomao to stop. He ejected a moon-sized entity fate crystal and gave it to Xiaomao, \"Bring this home with you. Cut a piece of it and give the smaller piece to your child. As for the rest, put it in your soul before you enter the karma river.\"\nXiaomao hated fate crystals. He was reluctant to accept.\nHowever, Leo read Xiaomao's thoughts and advised him, \"It's not for you. It's for the child. If the child has a piece of it while you have the larger piece, you two will eventually reunite because the fate crystal naturally seeks each other, especially its fragments.\"\n\"Is there such a benefit? I thought it only granted the owner a useless system.\"\n\"Useless or not, it's not up to me or you to judge. You must experience it and judge it yourself.\"\n\"…\"\nAlthough unwilling, Xiaomao accepted the parting gift. He gave Leo a meaningful look. At first, Xiaomao wished to quietly leave and forget everything behind him. However, he suddenly remembered the face of the most beautiful person he had encountered in the past.\n\"Lord Florida Man, if I may ask, I wish to ask you something rude.\"\nLeo grinned. \"Ask away.\"\n\"Is your daughter married?\"\nLeo paused, and his eyebrows twitched, \"Why do you ask?\"\n\"Hahaha! Nothing much. As a dying old man, I just wish to complete my bucket list. I was wondering if I still had a chance in the next life.\"\nAs a father, Leo was protective over his children, especially his daughters. When an old man suddenly asked him if his daughters were married, a father like Leo could easily go berserk.\nStill, Leo doubted Xiaomao had an ulterior motive. He invited Cat to the hotel so that they could meet.\n30 minutes later, Cat arrived.\nThis year, Cat already reached the adulthood of 18 years old. Her appearance remained the same as eight years ago, except for her hip and chest size. In addition, she started putting on makeup whenever she was outside.\n\"Any nom-nom, dad?\" Cat ran toward Leo and hugged his arm.\nLeo sighed, \"I'll feed you later. Anyway, can you chat with this gentleman for a few minutes?\"\n\"Oh?\"\nCat turned to Xiaomao who awkwardly laughed.\n\"H-Hello, miss.\"\n\"Who are you again, meow?\" Cat didn't remember Xiaomao.\"Haha. It's okay. I just want to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.\"\n\"…Okay?\"\n\"Are you seeing someone right now?\"\nLeo had goosebumps. Witnessing a dying old man courting his daughter was not a pleasant experience. If Leo never peeked into Xiaomao's future and discovered his important roles, he would have exploded the dude long ago.\nCat tilted her head as she was inexperienced in this matter. She then pointed at Leo.\n\"Yes. I'm seeing my dad right now, meow.\"\n\"W-What?!\" Both Xiaomao and Leo were stunned.\nCat laughed and hugged Leo's waist. She then teased her father like she used to.\n\"I'm my father's girl! He's mine, meow!\"\n\"…\"\nXiaomao dropped his jaw while Leo repeatedly shook his head, denying the silly allegation. Seeing the man's reaction, Xiaomao chuckled.\n\"I understand, Lord Florida Man. You don't have to explain.\"\n\"…Seriously, this is a misunderstanding!\"\n\"It's okay. This happened all the time. She was your creation, so it's natural for her to be attached to her creator. It's very understandable.\"\n\"…I said, this is a misunderstanding!\"\nXiaomao burst into laughter. He saluted to both of them.\n\"I'm satisfied. Well, if fate allows it, let's chat again. I hope that I can be your customer in the next life.\"\nLeo sighed and returned the salute, \"I'll be waiting.\"\nThe fisherman left and returned to his home world.\n…\nAfter Xiaomao had left, Leo summoned his trusted disciples.\nGao Yan, Yao Qiqi, Jin Yong, and Tang San were all full-fledged adults. Everybody's cultivation base already reached the karmic sovereign realm.\nGao Yan and Jin Yong retained their youthful appearance. On the other hand, Tang San grew up and discarded the feminine physique. He became a beautiful man who attracted both genders. As for Yao Qiqi, she transformed into a charming MILF goddess.\nThe four knelt before Leo and Cat. Yao Qiqi smiled at her best friend while Cat winked back.\nGao Yan, the leader of the group, reported their arrival.\n\"Guardian Squad reporting in, master. What's your order?\"\nLeo opened his menu and showed them the coordinates of Xiaomao's home world. He tossed a platinum plate, which had a carving image of an AK47 on it.\n\"Contact my brother Ohio Man and give him the token. Ask him for a fleet. Then, take the troops to guard that planet. If Milo and their scrooges show up, kill them all.\"\nThe group smiled as they finally had a reason to head out and play in the void. The team took the token and vanished.\nCat stared at Leo and pouted. She wanted to go out and play too.\n\"Dad, I want to play, too. I also haven't had my nom-nom yet.\"\nLeo deeply sighed and patted her head, \"Go fetch your brother. Give him enough time to pack some food first. Then, I'll allow you to go out.\"\n\"YAY!\"\nCat dashed out of the hotel to fetch Aslan, who always secluded himself in the time chamber.\nAslan had been doing well. The guy ended up marrying Sierra and returned Simba's son to the parents. Moreover, he already had five kids.\nLeo watched how Cat ran like a little kid. He stroked his chin, wondering if he should ask Esen for another child.\n'Should I reincarnate mother? It's been a while. I doubt she can still remember me since she's not even a cultivator.'\n.\n.\nTwo years after Xiaomao's last visit, the overlord quietly passed away, leaving his child by himself.\nLeo and some of his people attended Xiaomao's funeral. They also met Mu-Nyang, who didn't even pay attention to them.\nThe poor white cat never stopped crying. Other Cathulhus tried to console him, but Mu-Nyang rejected everybody. In the end, the poor cat continued living in Xiaomao's small shack as it was the only place he treasured.\nLeo secretly opened a new store on the same planet, but he set up the general store far away from Mu-Nyang's home. As for Gao Yan and others, they kept their distance from Mu-Nyang and protected him in secret.\nOne day, Esen visited Leo. As she was aware of Leo's weird arrangement and his foresight abilities, she came here to ask him what he was scheming.\nAs soon as Esen arrived, Leo answered her before she could utter a word.\n\"It's for the merge.\"\n\"Merge?\" Esen was confused, \"Merge for what?\"\nLeo looked at the sky and explained, \"In less than 100,000 years, Void Principality and his people will migrate to the lower world. The arrangement for the ascension is a hoax.\"\n\"Huh?\" Esen didn't understand, \"Explain in detail, Leo.\"\n\"Haiz. Okay.\" Leo paused for a long time and started narrating what he saw. \"In the higher dimension, there are multiple universes, and they often crash. Void Principality's universe will collide with another universe in 150,000 years, and that guy foresees it. Because he is desperate, he dispatches Void Trees to the lower universes like us to find a suitable universe to migrate into. And he has chosen us.\"\n\"Oh.\" Esen nodded and clapped her hands. \"In short, you'll get new customers, right?\"\n\"Yeah. But before we can welcome new guests, we need to clean house and train our residents first. Overlord Xiaomao, Mu-\nNyang, Meowmeow, and Lucky will play a big role.\"\nLeo told a story to Esen. The story's protagonist was Meowmeow who was sent to Mu-Nyang's dantian universe. He would possess a clone of Mao Miaomiao, aka the prisoner that Aslan had trapped there. Meowmeow would assume the identity of Mao Miaomiao in the far future.\nEsen giggled and listened to her husband. She was curious about what kind of adventure Mu-Nyang and Meowmeow would experience.\n\"Say, Leo. Can I snoop into Mu-Nyang's universe and see the drama?\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"I'll compile them into a movie for you later. Don't interfere with their fate.\"\n\"Aw, stinky. But say… what's going to happen when the higher dimension's people come down?\"\nLeo's expression changed. He shifted his attention toward the Prismatic Void Tree and grumbled.\n\"Same old, same old. Annoying politics, conspiracy, and arrogant egotistic mortals.\"\n\"…Can't we kill them all?\"\n\"Another thing – Overpopulating Karma Rivers.\"\n\"…Yikes.\"\n\"Yeah, yikes. It's gonna be a mess to manage. That's why I need multiple trustworthy people in this universe to bring some of the souls into their dantian universe. We can't keep them all.\"\nThe troubling future was far ahead, but Leo was already prepared for the worst.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Mu-Nyang remained in his house. As he inherited Xiaomao's fishing rod, he became a big target that Milo and his allies wanted dead.\nThe news about Mu-Nyang possessing an ultimate artifact spread across the universe. New deities, sages, and entities of the younger generation heard about it and coveted the artifact. Soon, they traveled toward the old Cathulhu Galaxy in search of Mu-Nyang's whereabouts.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 338 – Florida Man Accused of Cheating His Wife with Her Sisters and Mother, Claims He Only 'Touched' Them.\nMu-Nyang's Star, Cathulhu Galaxy\nA lone cabin was situated in the middle of a plain sandwiched by a lake and a thick forest. Inside the resident hid a Cathulhu child by the name Mu-Nyang.\nInside the cabin was a bed, a workbench, and a wooden board full of photos. The Cathulhu child, who transformed into a white cat, sat on the workbench and admired the pictures of his foster father Xiaomao.\nMissing his dead father, he shed a tear. Although he knew that Xiaomao's soul was inside his dantian universe, he couldn't bear the pain of losing him.\n\"Master, when will you come out? I'm lonely…\"\nWhile Mu-Nyang was drowning in sorrow, someone knocked on the front door.\nMu-Nyang wiped his tears and transformed his tail into a long tentacle. Twisting the doorknob, he opened the door to welcome his frequent guest.\nIn front of the cabin was a handsome middle-aged man, whose face looked similar to Mao Miaomiao, a vile soul who called himself Devil. Mu-Nyang had seen him many times in the past year.\n\"Senior Leonardo, munya?\" Mu-Nyang recognized him. He faked his smile and asked, \"Are you here to evict me again, munya?\"\nLeo who had been monitoring Mu-Nyang bitterly smiled. He offered the cat even though he knew that it would be rejected.\n\"Would you come to live with me? I'll prepare a better resident for you and your master. Living here alone is not safe.\"\nMu-Nyang didn't remember Leo in this life. He scoffed, \"Please leave, munya! Also, I won't sell this house, ever, munya!\"\n\"I see. Then, I'll leave today's supply here. Make sure to eat a lot since you're still growing, okay?\"\n\"You're not my father, munya! Don't tell me what to eat!\"\n\"Okay, okay.\" Leo laughed and left in silence. He glanced at the supply crate that he brought for Mu-Nyang.\nInside the crate were 1,000 Floridian Dantian pills, catnip powder, dried fish, and cultivation manuals. Next to the crate was a small package of Prismatic Void Pill.\n.\nLow-Grade Prismatic Void Pill\nThis pill has been concocted by the Time Emperor Florida Man. It has a similar effect as an entity fate crystal – Whoever consumes this pill will always be protected by the Prismatic Void Tree's blessing, which guarantees a fortuitous encounter or lucky streaks.\nThis pill is popular in the Florida Galaxy. The locals melt these pills on a spoon to inhale its unique smoke. This consumption method is banned in the Florida Galaxy, but many cultivators are addicted to it due to its hallucination side effect.\nPill Effects\n- Increase Luck\n- Increase Lifespan by 1,000 Years\n- Expand Dantian Size\n- Cleanse Physique and Bone Marrow\n- Relieve Stress and Sore Muscles\n- May Induce Hallucination if Consumed Incorrectly.\nThe pill effects are hidden from all systems users except for Singularities and Time Lords.\n…\nAfter leaving Mu-Nyang alone, Leo scanned the cat's dantian universe to check how Meowmeow and Lucky were doing.\nLucky's soul seemed to have undergone a mutation and his gender changed. He became a SHE, but her new soul was still queuing in Mu-Nyang's karma river. It would take a while for her to come back to life.\nAs for Meowmeow, his soul and Mao Miaomiao's soul got stuck together. As Dr. Mao Miaomiao forgot about his past and deeds, he lived according to the predetermined fate and got into conflict with Kishin Douji.\nEverything went according to his plan. Within a thousand years, they would come out as entities. Leo looked forward to their next reunion.\n.\n.The next day, Simba carried a leather bag with him and visited the Cathulhu World. He ignored Mu-Nyang's cabin and went to the capital city of this planet.\nThe capital city was another branch of Leo's domain. A giant dome covered 600,000 square kilometers, which was occupied by the massive town. White skyscrapers, medium-sized buildings, sky roads, and plants were visible from outside.\nCathulhus in this city all wore a collar, which automatically transformed their bodies into a regular cat. In the city, adult cats walked on two feet. They wore modern clothes wandered around, and minded their businesses.\nIn the middle of the national park, Leo and Esen sat side-by-side while a cat curled into a ball and slept on Esen's lap. Esen giggled while stroking the Siamese cat while Leo scratched its chin.\nSimba entered the city through the checkpoint and visited Leo in the park. He stood in front of them and put the leather bag on the ground.\nLeo glanced at the bag and frowned. He forgot what he had ordered Simba to do since the life of this planet was peaceful.\n\"What's that?\" Asked Leo.\nSimba sighed and reported, \"Our troops have found the rebel's hideout. We attacked them and managed to capture the ringleader. Some are still scattering in this universe though, but they are fated to die within 10 years according to the karma.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nLeo rolled his eyes upward while he tried to recall his previous order. It sounded important. However, to him, it seemed so insignificant. Fortunately, his wife was nearby.\nEsen reminded him, \"You asked Simba to exterminate the remaining werewolves in this universe, did you not?\"\n\"Oh, right.\" Leo finally remembered. \"I forgot that werewolves are still around. Well, are they all dead yet?\"\nSimba deeply sighed, \"Except for Milo, most of the werewolves are dead. By the way, you're a time lord. Can't you calculate the future yourself?\"\n\"Meh, peeking at other timelines costs a lot of energy. If I get too close, I lose some of my lifespans, and our timeline will deviate from the right track. If possible, I'd rather avoid using this power.\"\nSimba nodded in approval, \"Agreed. Still, I'm curious. How did you cultivate your time domain that far? Also, from my experience and insight, the Singularity Realm seems to be the highest cultivation ceiling of our universe. How did you break through the bottleneck?\"\nLeo shrugged and revealed the universe's secret.\n\"You're right. Singularity Realm used to be the highest cultivation realm of all timelines. It's just that I broke the record.\"\n\"…How?\"\n\"How do you think a cultivator was born? By the guidance of someone else? By bloodline? Nope! None of that. It's from the tenacity, stubbornness, and delusion of mortals who were lucky enough to discover a method to become immortal. Like them, I went ape-shit in the power of time and space because I want to snu-snu…\"\nLeo suddenly realized that Esen was next to him. He coughed and corrected his words before his wife could notice his ulterior motive.\n\"Ahem! I experimented with the power of time to expand my domain coverage. I researched so hard that I comprehended the dao of time and understood what the fourth dimension really is. Well, you can guess the rest.\"\nSimba rubbed his chin when Leo muttered the fourth dimension. He recalled a famous scientist on Earth who mentioned this before.\n\"So, what is it like? I'm still living in the 3rd dimension. I can only move up, down, left, and right.\"\n\"Nah, you're pretty much in the 3.5D mode. You can blink and appear anywhere in the universe. You can phase through objects. In fact, I have a theory that Earth's scientists misunderstood the dimension orders…\"\nBoth men exchanged philosophies and discussed dao for hours. Esen sat there and listened to the men while smiling. Still, she was the only one who paid attention to the leather bag.\nWhen Leo and Simba stopped speaking, Esen pointed at the bag and asked.\n\"What's in that bag?\"\n\"Ah,\" Simba dryly laughed. \"A souvenir.\"\n\"Souvenir?\" Esen carefully carried the Siamese cat and put it on Leo's lap. Then, she reached out to pick up the bag.\nUpon opening the bag, she discovered a thousand storage rings in there. She pursed her lips, mimicking Leo's troubled expression.\n\"Rings? At this age?\" She complained.\n\"What's wrong, sister-in-law?\"\nEsen sighed and opened her system menu. She navigated to the inventory system and showed it to Simba.\n\"Next time, use the transfer or trade menu. You can simply send these rings through the system. Don't you have a true karmic fate crystal in you?\"\nSimba was taken aback. He scratched his bald head and laughed, \"I forgot.\"\n\"Seriously. You and Leo share the same brain cells.\"\nLeo and Simba looked at each other and burst into laughter.\n\"Wifey, look. My geniusness knows no bounds. I even turned my delusion into reality! Can't you see that I'm the only time lord in the multiverse?\"\nSimba jeered at Leo, \"Geniusness is not a word, you autistic coomer. You've gotten that far because you wanted to secretly molest clones of other women in your dantian universe!\"\n\"Bullcrap! I never molest any woman other than my wife!\"\nSimba smirked, \"But I read your karma a few years back. It said that you secretly summoned Eleanor, Ellen, and my wife's clone in your dantian universe to fight with them.\"\n\"Yeah, I fought them to learn their skills, so?\"\n\"You set their skill levels to the lowest.\"\n\"…\"\n\"What kind of skills did you learn when your opponents are weaker than you, Leo?\"\n\"…Meh, you know nothing. I studied their bloodline so that I could come up with a new alchemy recipe! And…\"\nLeo stood up and was about to yell at Simba. However, Esen menacingly smiled at Leo and pulled his shirt.\n\"Hubby, care to explain? You did what?\"\nBoth Esen and Simba knew about Leo's dantian universe and its nature as the guy once taught them about it. They, too, were capable of altering the time flow in their dantian universe. However, they couldn't summon clones like Leo.\nLeo sweated profusely. He didn't cheat on Esen, but he indeed summoned her sisters' clones and her mother's clone to extract their blood for samples. But because of the suspicious activity, he didn't know how to explain it.\n\"Wife, I'm honest here. I didn't cheat on you.\"\nEsen smirked, \"Cheating or not, I'll see it for myself. Take me to your dantian universe! I'll investigate your karma in there!\"\n\"…\"\nLeo deeply sighed and let Esen enter his dantian universe. She turned into a streak of light and vanished into his forehead.\nAfter Esen entered his universe, Leo stared at Simba.\n\"You…\"\nSimba burst into laughter and teleported away, leaving the leather bag behind. He was satisfied after pranking Leo.\nIt would take Leo a while before he could reconcile with Esen and prove his innocence.\nIn the future, someone in Mu-Nyang's dantian universe would abuse a similar perk and ravish countless women with his time ability. He would also have a similar system ability to summon clones of others to fight in his dantian universe.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 339 – Florida Man Prophesizes Doomsday, Claims Sexually Aggressive Demoness Would Enslave Men and Cats Would Be Our Saviors.\nLeo enjoyed the long years of peace and tranquility. However, he never forgot to visit Mu-Nyang every week to chat with him.\nIt only took 10 years of weekly visits for the cat to give in. Mu-Nyang finally invited Leo to enter his little house, but he still declined his offer.\nLeo stood in front of Xiaomao's workbench and gazed at their family photos. Seeing a fragment of their happy memory, Leo pitied them.\n'I should have been there with them. I guess he has found his new master now.'\nAdmiring the photos enough, Leo turned around and found Mu-Nyang sitting on a worn-out bed.\n\"Mu-Nyang, do you want me to improve your living conditions? I won't invite you to my domain anymore.\"\nMu-Nyang scoffed at Leo, \"If you want my master's fishing rod, I won't give it to you no matter what, munya!\"\n\"You misunderstood me. Oh, well.\"\nLeo blinked his eyes twice, and the bed was replaced with a brand new spring bed with fluffy blankets and a cartoonish bed sheet. Another cat bed also appeared and landed next to the human bed.\nMu-Nyang widened his eyes in shock. Still, wary of Leo, he stored Xiaomao's fishing rod in his system inventory and warned the guest.\n\"No matter how many treasures you give me, I won't give it to you, munya!\"\nLeo rolled his eyes, \"Seriously, you dumb cat. Had I coveted your fishing rod, I would have killed you long ago. Look here.\"\nAs the cat was too stubborn to understand his goodwill, Leo demonstrated something of an equivalent value – A true entity fate crystal.\nThe crystal was only a bead size, but its aura was the same as the fishing rod. Moreover, as Leo was the one who refined it, colorful light beamed from the crystal.\nMu-Nyang closed his eyes as the fate crystal was too bright. He complained, \"What are you doing, munya!? Is this your true color?! I'll fight you to the death, munya!\"\n\"…Hah.\"\nMu-Nyang turned around and extended his tail, transforming it into eight white tentacles.\nLeo deeply sighed and flickered his finger. Instantly, Mu-Nyang could no longer move. Not allowing the cat to defend himself, Leo poked the animal's head with his fingertip.\n\"OW!\"\nMu-Nyang could finally move again. Aside from the throbbing pain on his forehead, he was unharmed.\nLeo didn't stop there. He shoved the entity fate crystal into Mu-Nyang's forehead. He also warned him.\n\"It's about time we do things my way. I'm going to show you why I'm doing this, okay?\"\nThe entity Fate Crystal entered Mu-Nyang's dantian universe. Leo also deployed a fragment of his consciousness and sent it into the universe to control the fate crystal.\nInstead of letting Mu-Nyang digest the crystal, he destroyed it, turning the true entity fate crystals into multiple heavenly fate crystals. He scattered it throughout Mu-Nyang's universe to hasten the population growth and standard strength.\nAfter pulling his consciousness out of Mu-Nyang's dantian universe, Leo resumed the time flow. He grinned and patted the cat.\n\"It's going to be hectic in your dantian universe. Do your best to cultivate and grow stronger, okay?\"\n\"????\"\nMu-Nyang swatted Leo's hand away and adjusted his fur. He pouted and waved his paw in disgust.\n\"Go home, munya. Shoo! Shoo!\"\n\"Heh, you ingrate cat. Once your old memory returns, be prepared for some punishment.\"\n\"P-Punish? What punishment, munya?! You're evil, munya. Get outta here!\"\n\"Hahahahaha.\"\nLeo burst into laughter and left Mu-Nyang alone. He returned to his domain branch and managed his territories.\n.\n.1,000 years quickly went by.\nAlthough Simba's troops had been patrolling the Cathulhu and Florida Galaxy, roaming space beasts kept multiplying. It troubled Simba to the point that he requested Leo's aid to cull the space beast population.\nLeo heeded Simba's warning and massacred 70% of the space beasts with just a snap of his fingers. Their carcasses were collected and distributed to all of Leo's ally solar systems as they were the finest source of food. Some of the fish meat was distributed to Mu-Nyang as well.\nCat, who had matured into a singularity, was transferred to Mu-Nyang's planet to take the post of the galaxy's deputy overlord. As soon as she arrived, she visited Mu-Nyang in her father's place as she was curious about what her father's former minion had become.\nWhen Cat arrived at Mu-Nyang's front door, the cathulhu was astonished by her otherworldly beauty. For the first time, he fell in love.\n\"Umm, who are you, munya?\" Asked Mu-Nyang.\nCat stared at Mu-Nyang for a long time and scoffed.\n\"Chonky cat.\"\n\"W-WHAT, MUNYA?!\" Mu-Nyang's first love ended instantly. He was enraged, \"HOW DARE YOU, MUNYA!\"\nCat smirked and brought out a red pointer laser. She flipped the switch and waved it around Mu-Nyang's house.\nThe cathulhu's cat instinct kicked in. The white cat ran around the house, chasing after the red dot.\nSeveral minutes later, Mu-Nyang regained his composure and yelled at Cat.\n\"THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL, MUNYA! WHY ARE YOU BULLYING ME?!\"\nCat grinned and stuck out her tongue, \"Because you hogged my father for 1,000 years, you idiot. Stay here and rot, chonky cat!\"\n\"I'M NOT CHONKEY! YOU'RE CHONKY! YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IS CHONKY, MUNYA!\"\nCat laughed and left Mu-Nyang, who seethed and panted due to the unexpected insult.\n.\n.\nAfter Cat became the deputy overlord of the Cathulhu Galaxy, Leo stopped visiting Mu-Nyang. He visited Priscilla's star system and got busy with the new expansion.\nCat was brutal with her work. She conscripted 50% of adult cathulhus to join the CSDF, aka the Cathulhu Self-Defense Force in exchange for extra cultivation resources from Florida Galaxy.\nAt first, the locals cooperated as they had nothing to lose. Most male cathulhus spent their days sleeping, so the new overlord assigning them work was the right thing to do. Little did they know that they allowed a tyrant to control them.\nAfter drafting troops, Cat extracted natural resources from the galaxy and transferred them to Leo's system factories and workshops. Forests were cut down. Beautiful natural minerals were dug out while greeneries withered.\nThe locals protested and demanded Cat to return their forests and natural resources. Riots and protesters roamed the capital city's streets.\nCat didn't do anything fancy to respond. She simply removed catnip from all local convenience stores and the Cathulhu Galaxy's shopping complex. Within a week, all cats suffered from withdrawal syndrome and stopped rioting.\nThe tyrant pushed forward. She demanded that all Cathulhus had two choices – Migrate to Florida Galaxy or remain here in the colony, waiting for supplies from the headquarters.\n90% of the capital's population yielded as they couldn't live without Leo's special catnip. As for the remaining 10%, they either served in the local military or were too old to move.\nAs most cathulhus of the planet moved out, Mu-Nyang was left behind. Cat left him with a functional colony city to serve as a temporary depot for Leo's supplies, but her action devastated the world.\nThe rich green world turned into a wasteland. Lakes and seas dried up while local animals were extinct.\nMu-Nyang hated Leo and Cat. He swore that he would avenge their tyranny and rescue his people one day. However, he changed his mind when a new disaster struck.\nOne day, out of nowhere, a dimension rift appeared outside of the solar system and spat out a human-sized black hole.\nThe abyssal star sucked so many stars, planets, and asteroids into Cathulhu Galaxy and destroyed them. Among the victims, Mu-Nyang's planet was also within the star's gravity range. His world's orbital path shifted and floated away from the sun.\nFortunately, Simba's fleet was nearby. They suppressed the black hole and disabled its gravity forces before Simba compressed the entire black hole into a cube. He transported it back to Leo as if he knew what Leo needed it for.\nMu-Nyang's world was saved. Simba's troops also corrected Mu-Nyang planet's orbital course and rescued the remaining elderly cathulhus in the remaining cities. Fortunately, most cathulhus in the galaxy had already migrated to Florida Galaxy, so the casualty was minimal.\nThe event awakened Mu-Nyang. He wondered if Leo and Cat knew about the disaster.\n.\n.\nMeanwhile, Leo sat at a desk and typed something on a floating computer console. He read what he had listed 1,000 years ago.\nYear: 540FC\nIssues: Shortage of Food throughout the universe due to insufficient food resources and logistic issues.\nStatus: Solved\nNote: Populating space beasts and fish solves the issues. Every race can proactively hunt them for food while those beasts only eat plasma from the sun. It's a free real estate for everybody.\nYear: 645FC\nIssues: Goblin Overpopulation. Overlord Shuri grows her goblin population too fast and she will drive the divine elves to almost extinction if I don't intervene.\nStatus: Delayed.\nNote: I already murdered Overlord Shuri and trapped goblins in a new universe crystal. It's a shame that Meowmeow will eventually seduce that goblin overlord and repopulate her goblin race before the reverse exodus calamity. I guess we have to wait and see.\nYear: 999FC\nIssues: Cathulhu Galaxy and Angel Galaxy will collide and cause a quadrillion casualty.\nStatus: Solved.\nNote: Priscilla absorbed the entire galaxy into her dantian universe. I already replaced the lost stars by throwing some random stars from dead space beast's dantian universes here. This universe is still vast. Should I populate more stars and prepare for the reverse exodus?\nYear: 1540FC <<< VERY IMPORTANT *CURRENT ISSUE*\nIssues: A singularity slips through my foresight radar and is playing with fire. That moron slips into a black hole in my universe to test my strength. The Cathulhu Galaxy will be destroyed.\nStatus: Pending.\nNote: Cat already helped me migrate most of the Cathulhus near the blast area to Florida Galaxy. I haven't dealt with those annoying pests from the higher dimension yet, but I'm about to do so. To Esen or whoever read this log, keep updating this record for me. I'll be back in a year or two.\nYear: 2709FC\nIssues: Succubi Emergence. Dr. Mao Miaomiao seems to leave behind his seeds, but those angels will mutate into succubi. Men from every race will fall prey to their charm.\nStatus: Pending\nNote: Taxi and his gang will have a ball when the time comes.\nYear: 2777FC\nIssues: A female orc by the name of Sasha is expelled from the higher dimension here due to internal politics, and cocky singularities from there want her dead. She and I will meet during the conflict which accidentally causes a misunderstanding.\nStatus: Pending.\nNote: This shouldn't even be an issue, but Esen will kill me. Esen, if you read this, stop being so yandere. I know what I'm doing, and I never cheat and will never cheat on you. Do you know that I saw five future timelines that you beheaded me and stuffed my head in a bag like you were a main character from a certain nice boat series? Stop that thought. GET SOME HELP!\n.\n.\nThere were more records and notes of future events. However, Leo stopped editing the note and closed the console.\n\"Hah. Time to visit the higher dimension again. The time dilation is a pain. I hope I can come back within a year.\"\nLeo stretched and warmed up. A few minutes later, he vanished, teleporting to another universe.",

      "content": "﻿﻿Chapter 340 – Epilogue\n75,340FC\nWhoosh\nLeo returned to Mu-Nyang's planet. He stood on the wasteland, where a lonely cabin stood out like a sore thumb.\nDING\n<Warning. Your lifespan has exceeded the limit of this universe. The excess life force will be stored in the time dimension.>\n<Your current lifespan: 340 Undecillion.>\n<Current stored lifespan: 763 Undecillion.>\nLeo swiped his hand across the floating screens and closed them as he no longer regarded his life force as important. After all, his business thrived in multiple universes. This didn't include the destroyed universes which provoked him first.\nWith such an abundant system currency, Leo came here to ensure Mu-Nyang's safety and smooth cultivation life.\nAs soon as Leo arrived, he noticed that Cat's life signature was still in the cabin. He gently touched the doorknob, and the house's defensive mechanism was activated.\nDING\n<Welcome back, Administrator Leonardo.>\n<Current Yin and Yang energy in the cabin: 35%>\n\"It's that time of the year again, right?\"\nLeo flickered his finger and ejected a singularity stone, which was the highest grade of currency that the higher dimensions commonly used. It contained enough Qi to improve a mortal's cultivation base to the karmic sovereign realm. However, Leo opened the electric battery console outside the house and replaced the old singularity stone with the bead in his hand. Afterward, he consumed the remaining Qi in the used stone and turned it into ash.\n<Your lifespan has increased by 35,111 years.>\nLeo ignored the information and entered the cabin. Entering the humble resident, Leo found Mu-Nyang curling into a ball on the spring bed.\nMu-Nyang was asleep. His consciousness still wandered in his dantian universe as always.\nLooking at Mu-Nyang's smiling face, he gently stroked the cat's fur and grinned.\n\"Xiaomao is coming out soon, I see.\"\nMu-Nyang purred in his sleep and licked his lips. He sleep-talked.\n\"Xiaomao, how did you get so strong, munya?\"\n\"Oh?\" Leo was curious about what the cat was talking about. He peeked into Mu-Nyang's dantian universe to snoop on the local trend.\nIn Mu-Nyang's dantian universe, Xiaomao, Lucky, Meowmeow, and their comrades already vanquished their adversaries and become the final rules of Mu-Nyang's dantian universe. The cat's consciousness was also there, celebrating with the gang.\nFunnily enough, Xiaomao and Lucky (Leo's minion) had become husband and wife. Meowmeow turned Dr. Mao Miaomiao into a woman and made the doctor his wife, making the situation complicated and hilarious to Leo. As for Kishin Douji, it seemed that Dr. Mao Miaomiao already killed the guy.\nMoreover, Xiaomao and Lucky seemed to regain their past life's memory. Leo wondered how they would react when they came out from Mu-Nyang's universe.\n\"I guess I have to prepare for a welcome banquet soon. Also, I should start terraforming this planet. It's too gloomy for a home world.\"\nLeo stood up and turned around, preparing to leave. When he exited the house, two small cathulhus floated there and gazed at Leo in shock.\n\"L-Lord Florida Man, munya?\"\nLeo recognized the two. They were the two Cathulhus that Leo had met at the Fate Stadium. The male one was Miao Damao and the other was Katerina.\n\"Oh, I didn't know you two have returned here first. I assume y'all regain your past memories already?\"\nMiao Damao laughed, \"Yes, munya. We're greatly indebted to you. Without your fate crystals and your karma rivers, we would have forgotten about this universe.\"\n\"How's Mu-Nyang and Xiaomao?\" Leo changed the subject as he was bad at getting praise these days.\nKaterina giggled, \"Our sons should be coming out soon. Probably tomorrow at the latest. One day over here is several years in there after all.\"\n\"Yeah, they probably need to settle a few things after those big fights… But wait a minute. Did you say… SONS?\"Leo forgot about their relationship. He knew that Xiaomao was the mentor of these Cathulhus, and he adopted Mu-Nyang. However, the couple mentioned that Xiaomao was THEIR son.\n\"Oh, I think you didn't know,\" Miao Damao laughed. \"When we reincarnated into Mu-Nyang's universe, we were Xiaomao's parents. Xiaomao then proceeded to adopt Mu-Nyang's avatar as his pet, and the situation got really funny.\"\nThe couple narrated their adventure in Mu-Nyang's universe to Leo, who grinned from ear to ear.\nTheir relationship was indeed hilarious. These cathulhus were reincarnated into Mu-Nyang's universe without their former memory. They lived as humans at the beginning. Mu-Nyang appeared before them and they served the cat as their master. After they gained their past life memory, they remembered that Mu-Nyang was supposed to be their son while Xiaomao was their mentor. However, an incident occurred, which broke their family apart. Xiaomao, Mu-Nyang, and everybody began their adventure from there.\nBut in the end, they reunited. A happy ending route was guaranteed.\nLeo was satisfied with their stories. He promised the couple that he would take everybody as his disciples.\nBoth Miao Damao and Katerina rejoiced. However, they glanced at each other, and their expressions suddenly changed.\n\"What?\" Leo noticed their pale faces. He didn't understand what made them worry.\n\"Umm, the thing is…\" Katerina lowered her head.\nMiao Damao confessed, \"We have several concerns about Mao Miaomiao, munya.\"\nLeo narrowed his eyes. He wondered if that stupid doctor regained his memory like the others.\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\nMiao Damao sensed Leo's killing intent and trembled. He stuttered.\n\"W-W-We believe that he is a loose cannon, munya. That man has been ravishing women left and right. He even fornicated with centipedes!\"\n\"…Dafuq?!\"\n\"H-He's very powerful, munya. He brainwashed Devil, Lilith, Eve, and other top experts there. The Olympus was destroyed because of him. The other fate crystal bearers all fell whenever they fought with him.\"\n\"Hold it a second.\" Leo frowned as he was confused. \"If I remember correctly, Devil's real identity was Doctor Mao Miaomiao, right? And Meowmeow stole that man's name. Which Mao Miaomiao are you talking about here?\"\n\"…It's Meowmeow, munya.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo smacked his forehead. He recalled the pervert golem who turned every elf woman into his sex toy. He wondered if that guy was the embodiment of his hidden desire.\n\"What about Devil? Is he… I mean, is she showing any sign of regaining this universe's memory?\"\nMiao Damao brightly grinned, \"That won't be an issue, munya. Mu-Nyang trapped that guy in there for billions of years. That guy's mind was already broken when Meowmeow stole his identity and gender-swapped him. She is very feminine and submissive, munya.\"\nLeo swiped his sweat and let out a long sigh.\n\"Good grief. For a moment, I almost had a heart attack.\"\nThe couple tilted their heads, puzzled why Leo was nervous about Devil's memory when Leo was already the strongest person in the multiverse.\n\"Alright. I'll help you prepare a welcoming party. I'll rejuvenate this planet now.\"\n\"Really, munya?!\" the two cathulhus were overjoyed.\n\"Let's make a castle and a new home for Xiaomao. Oh, we need to expand Mu-Nyang's house too. I saw him flirting with a black cathulhu in his universe. He might have a new family soon.\"\n\"YAAAAY!!\"\nThe two cathulhus jumped up and down, proud of their son's rizzing skills. They hoped to see their grandchildren soon.\nLeo laughed and left Mu-Nyang's house. He spread his arms and a thousand system screens manifested around him. As if he had a thousand hands, all screens moved according to Leo's wish.\nRUMBLE\nThe brown planet turned green. Grasses budded from the ground while the dark sky condensed white clouds. Natural springs gushed out, forming countless fountains in the middle of the wasteland world.\nHOOOOOM\nSeveral moon-sized anglerfish in the area were attracted to the source of water. Their jaws detached and they swam the void toward the planet, attempting to devour it whole.\nWithout looking at them, Leo clicked his tongue. Instantly, all the ugly fish monsters stopped moving. Their brains and souls were destroyed from the inside.\nMiao Damao and Katerina looked up and noticed the corpses of a dozen anglerfish in space. Their tentacles straightened in astonishment.\n\"P-Planet Eaters, munya?!\"\nLeo laughed, \"More like eatery planets. It's a free buffet. Go and collect those free sashimi for tomorrow's banquet.\"\n\"YAAAAAAAAY!!\"\nBoth cathulhus reverted to their original forms and charged toward the floating dead fish. As for Leo, he calmly spent a billion years of lifespan renovating and repopulating lifeforms in this world.\nHalf a day later, freshwater, sea, and land were filled with life. Trees matured, and small creatures opened their eyes to see the new world. The sky turned blue as the ozone and atmosphere were formed, degrading the sun's death rays into warm light.\nA castle was erected on top of the previously ruined capital city. Leo designated this place as the new headquarters of this world and left behind a true karmic fate crystal underneath the castle, serving as the safeguard of this world in case of emergency.\n…\nA day later, Xiaomao emerged from Mu-Nyang's dantian universe as Leo had predicted. Previously, he was a haggard old man who looked like he could wither and die at any moment. However, his fleshly body was youthful and handsome. His glossy black hair and flawless jade-like skin resembled a Korean idol, and his beach-body muscles were lean and well-shaped.\nXiaomao gazed at the stars and saw the partially desolated land, where Leo had stood there for too long. The soil was contaminated with his weird aura. When Xiaomao sensed a trace of nostalgic karma string, he gazed at the sky and cupped his fist.\n\"Thank you for everything, Lord Florida Man.\"\n…\nXiaomao didn't ascend alone. He also brought his wives along. Surprisingly, this former fisherman overlord managed to score seven wives.\nLeo held a banquet in the castle as promised and invited Xiaomao's family over. As the party was held in a hurry, there were only a few participants.\nXiaomao's wives gathered around Miao Damao and Katerina to get to know each other better. The girls introduced themselves to their in-laws and fought to become Xiaomao's mistress.\nMeanwhile, Xiaomao and Leo drank alone in the empty castle. The former fisherman was so excited that he told Leo about his adventure and the deeds of Pangu.\nAlthough Leo didn't pay attention to the details, he was happy for Xiaomao. He told the fisherman overlord about the hidden karmic fate crystal underneath the castle and gave him another true entity fate crystal as a backup. Afterward, he warned Xiaomao.\n\"Don't get complacent because of your previous success. You might be lucky yesterday, but tomorrow might be different.\"\nXiaomao solemnly nodded and bowed, \"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\"Good.\"\nLeo looked around, but he didn't see Mu-Nyang and his wife there. He asked Xiaomao.\n\"What happened to Mu-Nyang? Why doesn't he come with you?\"\n\"Oh, him?\" Xiaomao giggled, \"There's some unfinished business in his universe. Father… I mean, Mao Miaomiao needs to redeem his negative karma and work for Mu-Nyang for a while. He won't come out anytime soon.\"\n\"…Father? Did you call Mao Miaomiao as your father?\"\n\"Truth be told, I was reincarnated as an orc once. Coincidentally, that orc was Mao Miaomiao and Wei Yuan's son. I died again and reincarnated as a human.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo scratched his head. He didn't expect their relationship to be so complicated.\n\"What is the PREVIOUS Mao Miaomiao doing now? Of course, I'm referring to DEVIL.\"\n\"Oh, her?\" Xiaomao cackled, \"She's a role model seedbed. The NEW Mao Miaomiao always filled her belly whenever he had a chance, and that woman never uttered a word of complaint. Actually, I think she's addicted to it.\"\n\"…\"\nLeo wondered if his petty revenge turned into rewards for Dr. Mao Miaomiao. He hoped that Devil wouldn't become a thorn to him in the future.\nWorrying about the Devil's fate, Leo snooped on the future timelines.\nFirst timeline – Happy wife ending + 29 babies.\nSecond timeline – Happy wife ending + 52 babies.\nThird timeline – Happy wife ending + 74 babies.\nFifth timeline – Happy wife ending + 108 babies.\nTenth timeline – Happy wife ending + 256 babies. 100 of which became Mao Miaomiao's concubines.\nLeo stopped looking ahead and smacked his forehead. He regretted checking hentai scenario endings, and he wanted to wash his eyes with bleach.\n\"Whatever. Keep pumping babies, you sick fuck! And what the hell is wrong with you Meowmeow?! A HUNDRED OF YOUR DAUGHTERS END UP AS YOUR WIVES?! You depraved maniac need to be castrated! Don't let me see you here again!\"\nLeo bellowed while Xiaomao burst into laughter.\nAlthough there were uncertainties and potential threats in the following years, Leo, Xiaomao, and their comrades lived their lives to the fullest.\nMao Miaomiao and Devil left Mu-Nyang's dantian universe in the following years, but they never disrupted the universe's peace. On the contrary, Mao Miaomiao contributed to the restoration of multiple lower universes by collecting new wives and leftover fate crystals.\nAs for Devil, aka Dr. Mao Miaomiao, she forgot about her past crime and spent the rest of her life bearing the imposter's children. She was later nicknamed as Baby Factory.\nMu-Nyang got married as planned. He continued living in the same hut, but Leo secretly expanded its size for the cat.\nXiaomao became the overlord of the new Cathulhu Galaxy. He brought out the population from his universe and restored the Cathulhu's glory days. As for Lucky, she supported Xiaomao as his main mistress and bore him a dozen cute puppies.\nMeanwhile, Aslan also got himself a happy family. He and Sierra were a match in heaven as both needed each other. The man milked her every day while the woman also MILKed the man for vitamins. In the end, Aslan forsook his dream of ascending to the higher universe as he managed to reach the Singularity Realm on his own.\nSimba stood tall as the guardian of the universe. He and Ester had three more children, who later grew up and followed their father's path. Simba's first son also grew up and was promoted to captain of another dragon dreadnaught fleet.\nPriscilla was revered as the Holy Mother because of her vague relationship with Leo. She later migrated her people to the Prismatic Void Tree Galaxy and became the protectors of the Great Tree. Priscilla later received Leo's guidance and reached the Singularity Realm like the others.\nEllen managed to restore her divine elf clan and establish her new kingdom. Unlike her mother, she formed an alliance with Xiaomao and Leo and then established a trade agreement. Because of Leo's endless cultivation resources and food supplies, they reclaimed the powerhouse title with their effort. Ellen was later respected as the Great Queen of Elves.\nGao Yan quit his job when he was 3,000 years old to travel across the universe. During his adventure, he met Ellen and fell in love with her at first sight. He assisted her in overcoming the food shortage issues and defeated a pirate band from a higher dimension. After 100 years of hard work, Ellen succumbed to her feelings and agreed to marry him. Gao Yan ended up becoming the Divine Elf's King.\nJin Yong also quit his job and traveled the universe like Gao Yan. However, he met the remnant of fenrir werewolves and got into trouble with them. He eventually committed genocide, which erased all fenrir werewolves from the universe, except Lucky. He gained fame as Canine Killer, and Cathulhus worshiped him. He eventually met the daughter of Xiaomao and Lucky, who was a humanoid furry dog woman. Surrendering to his karma and his feelings, he pursued the Halfling and managed to win her heart. They got married and received her parents' blessings.\nTang San remained the guardian of Florida Galaxy and left behind the FUTA legacy to the later generations. He was symbolized as the neutral gender icon and was recorded in textbooks. However, in reality, he was still a straight man. He married his colleague and protected the universe together.\nYao Qiqi stayed behind as the guardian of Florida Galaxy as Tang San. She was worshiped as the goddess of Florida whose beauty was only second to Cat's. Many men pursued her, but she rejected them all. After she reached the Singularity Realm, she was bored of the mundane cultivation life and gave up cultivating further. She later married Tang San and gave birth to two sons and two daughters. Her husband was forced to bear the fifth baby though.\nTaxi cultivated hard enough and evolved into a mystic nightmare, equivalent to a singularity-realm cultivator. He solved Leo's problems by capturing mutated succubi and using them as their baby factories. Countless unicorns inherited Taxi's bloodline and migrated to the Divine Elf Kingdom's territory where their race and elves were most compatible.\nRicardo and his nightmare race joined forces with Priscilla and became the guardians of the Prismatic Void Tree. As the nightmares were rich in vitality, they were usually in charge of feeding the Alraunes with their bodily fluid. Ricardo eventually married one of them, and they lived happily after inside the giant void tree. Nobody ever saw them again, but reports from Priscilla's troops claimed that they heard Ricardo's sultry warcry from the tree every day.\nWu Buyi and Beatrice got married. However, after marrying for 5,000 years, Wu Buyi died in bed. Investigations showed that he died from excessive pain from his broken pelvis bones and the lack of water. Beatrice was arrested for murdering her husband by snu-snu, but she was later pardoned after Wu Buyi was reincarnated as Leo's second son. When Wu Buyi grew up, Beatrice married him again.\nIvy and Marc also enjoyed their lover's life and careers. Marc was later promoted as the Florida Galaxy's third guardian. Years later, he managed to save up and purchased a colony from Leo. Ivy, Marc, and the molgs moved there and populated their colony with their descendants. The couple was revered as the Parents of Molg.\nHua Taixu and his clone merged when Leo decided to relocate his headquarters. His sword skills improved by leaps and bounds, which enabled him to use a dimensional sword dao. He became the first karmic sovereign cultivator who was skilled enough to kill singularities. After 50,000 years of hard work, he earned Leo's trust and his secret cultivation method. 10,000 years later, he became another singularity and was promoted as the fourth guardian.\nHua Jiashan and Dongfang Mei stopped cultivating when they reached the karmic sovereign realm. They continued managing Leo's hotels and trained over 100,000 aspiring cultivators in hotel businesses.\nTiger Swordsman attempted to follow the sword saint's path. He traveled the universe and encountered the orc race. He exchanged pointers with the warriors there and earned their respect. In 6500FC, he managed to reach the karmic sovereign realm, but he was tired of walking the sword path. In the end, he married a local orc lady and settled down.\nHan Hao reopened the Life Sword School as one of the local tutoring stores while he secretly cultivated. Like the others, he eventually reached the karmic sovereign realm, earning the local people's respect. The Life Sword School flourished under his lead, and he later opened 10,000 school branches across the universe. His sword style became the golden standard of all swordsmen.\nHan Meng chose not to continue walking the sword path but another career. He stopped cultivating when he reached the entity realm and joined a space racer team as the first driver. With his outdated Truno AC86 Model, he defeated all space racers across the universe and earned the title of Void Devil. He later scored two sexy elves who worked as a race model and became an internet influencer.\nXu Nuan found her hotel career boring. She returned to the farm, where her taming skills suited her best. When Leo started a zoo & animal sanctuary project, Xu Nuan immediately accepted the managing role. Under her lead, rare animals and beasts were rescued and protected from hungry cathulhus. Later on, she awakened the dao of Mother Earth, which slingshot her cultivation base to the karmic sovereign realm without even trying. After regaining her youth, she married Tang Tian.\nTang Tian reopened the Sixth Element Sect within Leo's shopping complex and became the greatest rival of Han Hao. Fortunately, the sect focused on alchemy, medicine, and poison arts. Thus, they never fought each other. Because of Leo's bookstores and support, Tang Tian awakened the dao of medicines, which enabled him to increase his patient's life force through his dao and medicines. Historians recorded him as the first Doctor of the Florida Galaxy.\nTang Xuan remained in the political career. He served Leo as his adviser without asking for remuneration or cultivation resources in return. Yet, Leo helped Tang Xuan cultivate and eventually reached the karmic sovereign standard. While he was serving Leo, Tang Xuan established seven space logistic routes, which enabled Leo to expand his store branches in faraway galaxies. Scholars and cultivators respected and nicknamed his deed as the Seven Paths of Peace Era. He later ascended to the higher dimension to study their universe, but he came home disappointed.\nCat never left Leo and forever remained as his precious daughter. Many men proposed to her, but nobody succeeded. Esen always reprimanded her for not searching for a partner and spread her wings. But in the end, she lost to Cat's innocent charm and allowed her to be with them forever… even if Cat sometimes tried to extract Leo's seed and blood. Cat managed to extract a drop of Leo's blood essence and used it to fertilize her eggs. She gave birth to a healthy dryad girl, which almost broke Leo's family apart. Fortunately, when Esen realized that Leo never did anything to Cat, she forgave everybody.\nEsen rarely showed her face in public, but everybody in Florida Galaxy respected her as the Queen of Florida. She managed to catch up with Leo's strength and entered the time lord realm. Abusing the time dao, she investigated what Leo had been doing in the past for fun and discovered how Cat was born. The event traumatized her and stopped her from using the time power again. She later bore three more children for Leo.\nAs the time emperor, Leo governed the fourth dimension and all higher realms without stepping out of his universe. When the Void Principality migrated his people to his universe, he stood tall and prevented all mishaps from happening. Despite possessing absolute wealth, immortality, authority, and the most beautiful wife, he continued to protect his precious friends, family, employees, and the people of this universe.\nWhenever he was bored, he sometimes messed around and caused mayhem. Newspapers and news stations made funny headlines out of his actions. People laughed at him and made several memes out of the scoops. Eventually, everybody realized what the \"FLORIDA MAN\" nickname was for.\nBut in the end, Leo is content. He has a family and friends that he wishes for.\nWill he be lonely at the top of the universe?\nProbably. Probably not.\nIs the universe boring since he knows all past, present, and future?\nYes. That's why he can never stop acting like an idiot and make his life a bit more interesting.\nWhat is his next goal?\nProtect what he has and savor every bit of happiness and memory.\nWhat kind of life advice would he give to us, mortals?\nIf you are lucky enough to find him somewhere in this universe. He will probably answer with a wide grin before he does something stupid again:\n\"Enjoying life. YOLO IT, BITCH! YEEHAW!\"",
