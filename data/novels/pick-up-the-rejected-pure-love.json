      "content": "Could it be that being an adult means accepting the life given to you?\nMaybe living out each day and monotonously ending your life was what being human was all about?\nEven I, who thought this way, had one thing that excites me.\nEvery Friday, I eagerly awaited the release of a new episode from a web novel, which became my singular respite from fatigue.\n“This too ends today, though...”\nIt was a youthful romance harem story.\nIt was a novel about an 18-year-old, second-year high school student.\nI often thought if I had such a youthful life, I would have relished it.\nMost notably, in this web novel was a woman I had dreamed of.\nHer name was Shin Eun-ha, the pure and kind-hearted childhood friend who had lovingly watched over the protagonist since their childhood.\nI was certain that today’s episode would depict the protagonist, Kang Seo-ha, accepting Eun-ha’s confession.\nThough there were other main heroines besides Shin Eun-ha, it made sense in the storyline for him to choose Eun-ha.\nI was confident that Eun-ha would smile happily and start dating the protagonist.\n[ I’m sorry, Eun-ha. There was a time I held feelings for you, but now... Jung-yeon holds a bigger place in my heart... ]\n“What the hell with this bastard?”\nI shot up from my bed.\nWas this not the same guy who was on cloud nine for an entire day after Eun-ha presented him with chocolate in episode 15?\nAnd what of episode 21, when he commented on her fragrance as she helped him study?\nNot to mention, during episode 40, he gave every indication that he would immediately accept Eun-ha’s confession in a heartbeat.\nNow this? If he had any decency, he should be with Eun-ha, allowing us the delight of their blossoming romance!\nYet, contrary to my desires, our kind heroine gracefully accepted his rejection and said to the male lead,\n[ Thank you for being honest... Go... You must be happy with Jung-yeon, okay? After all, she’s my friend too.\nUnable to contain my frustration, I promptly dove into the comment section.\nIt seemed I wasn’t alone in my sentiments. Numerous Eun-ha supporters were fervently inquiring about the author’s address.\n『Eun-ha’s Devotee: The ending is seriously disappointing. It’s trash. Considering the emotional trajectory and narrative thus far, he absolutely should have ended up with Eun-ha. Come on! Author, perhaps consider making this an alternate universe plot and rewrite it for an Eun-ha ending. How does this even make sense? How can he possibly choose Jung-yeon, who just screeches like a dolphin?\n˪ ForeverJungYeon: Why would he date someone who frustratingly conceals her feelings every single day? Both main heroines are undoubtedly beautiful, but based on personality alone, it’s obvious to not choose Eun-ha. Isn’t it instinctual to be attracted to someone who takes the initiative? If Jung-yeon’s being compared to a dolphin, then Shin Eun-ha is undoubtedly a sloth. It’s what she gets.\n“Ah, these damn dolphin fans...!”\nI went back and forth with these dolphin fans for quite a while.\nBut, as the skirmish in the comments escalated, the moderators and the author decided to disable the comments.\nFeeling a mix of frustration and disappointment, I placed my phone beside my bed and tried to rest.\nUnbelievable.\nI still can’t accept it.\nIf I were the protagonist, Eun-ha’s happiness would have been my top priority.\nI would have lived a life looking only at Eun-ha and living only for her.\nThat foolish protagonist chose the dolphin.\nThe more I think about it, the angrier I get.\n“If it were me, I’d make her the happiest woman in the world.”\nLost in my thoughts and just as I heaved a weary sigh, my phone’s screen began to glow unusually bright, enveloping everything.\nWhat on earth?...\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 2 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "It might be hard to believe, but just a week ago, I found myself inside a web novel I used to enjoy. And now, having completed my military service, I was, again, on the cusp of starting my third year of high school. This has become my reality.\n“This is driving me insane...”\nRight now, I was in Bucheon City, South Korea. Although the web novel never mentioned a specific city, it was Bucheon – which was just next door to where I used to live. But it wasn’t all roses.\n“Lee Han-gyeol! ‘Mom’ told you to get up, right?! Are you planning on being late on the very first day of your third year? Hurry up!”\nI had to endure nagging from a woman I had known for just a week, addressing her as my mother. Yet, having lost my biological mother at a young age and not receiving much love, this experience was oddly comforting.\n“I better get up if I don’t want to get slapped on the back.”\nAfter leaving my bed, I headed straight to the bathroom. My reflection in the mirror still felt unfamiliar. My face was fairly average, but I noticed I was 2 cm shorter. I might not be 180cm tall, but at around 176cm, I probably won’t be called short anywhere.\nAfter coming out of the bathroom, I put on the unfamiliar school uniform.\n“And here I am, wearing a school uniform at the age of twenty-seven...”\nIt was the exact uniform depicted in the novel’s illustrations. Considering Shin Eun-ha and this body were of the same age, I secretly hoped we’d share the same class.\n“Lee Han-gyeol! Are you even up?”\n“I am!”\nIf I delayed any longer, I might really get slapped on the back. Hastily, I changed into the school uniform and made my way to the kitchen.\n“Why are you coming out so late?”\n“Mother, it’s said that the more you sleep, the better it is. Once you start working, you suffer so much that you can’t even sleep properly—ow ow ow!”\n“Why did you suddenly start calling me ‘mother’ since a week ago? Quit the nonsense and just eat your meal.”\n“Yes... but, mother? There’s no food on the table. Wasn’t breakfast ready?”\n“Just sit down. Can’t you drop the honorific word?”\n“Get used to it, Mother. Isn’t it refreshing?”\n“Enough, really...”\nWas this how all moms were? Even so, it felt heartwarming to have someone prepare breakfast for me after such a long time. After eating, I headed to school.\n“Ugh, it’s cold.”\nThe month of March still had a lingering chill in the air. I never imagined that walking to school would feel so unfamiliar. Still, having become a high school student once again, I hoped to relish in the joys of youth.\nUpon entering the classroom, I immediately checked the attendance list placed on the teacher’s desk.\nLet’s see... my number is 18. That sounds a bit unlucky, doesn’t it?\n“Huh?”\nFor a moment, the name written above mine caught my attention.\nNumber 17: Shin Eun-ha.\nLooking again, the student sitting next to me was number 17, and the person occupying that seat was named Shin Eun-ha.\nShin Eun-ha? Could it be the same Shin Eun-ha I know?\n“It can’t be that Shin Eun-ha, can it?”\nJust as I was murmuring to myself, the front door slid open. A female student in a neatly worn uniform, with her skirt at its original length, walked in. The moment I saw the girl who cautiously entered the class, my breath caught in my throat.\nOn her face, delicately and precisely placed features were prominent.\nAnd the girl with eyes like a deer stepped into the classroom.\nWithout realizing it, my heart began to race.\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again, and it was undoubtedly Shin Eun-ha.\nThe girl I had admired for 2 years was now right before me, alive and moving.\n“Uh… Hello?”\n“Wow- Shin Eun-ha.”\n“Uh… Huh? Do you know me?”\nOf course.\nBut I couldn’t just say that.\n“Yeah, I have seen you a few times while passing by in the corridor.”\n“Oh, so that was it. I was worried I might’ve forgotten you or something, haha..”\n“Not at all. We never really interacted. Anyway, please take care of me this year. You’re my seatmate.”\n“Oh..? Ahh... so that’s why you were saying my name?”\n“You heard that?”\nTo be frank, I’m twenty-seven years old. Isn’t that a bit risky?\nActually, no. Since I’m now nineteen, it probably doesn’t matter.\n“It’s okay. I almost got the wrong idea, but your explanation just now cleared it.”\nShe’s truly kind-hearted.\nNo doubt, she was the main heroine of this web novel.\nHowever, she seemed a little sad.\nOnly about two months must have passed since she went through that ordeal.\n“You were in class 1 during the second year, right?”\n“Yes, I was. How did you know?”\n“I think I saw you when I went to class 1 to visit a friend.”\n“Oh... Which class were you in? Oh, wait, what’s your name?”\n“Me? I’m Lee Han-gyeol. I was in class 5 during the second year.”\n“Nice to meet you, Han-gyeol”\nEvery time her voice reached my ears, I found myself smiling.\nHaving a proper conversation with my favorite heroine...\nCould there be a greater happiness than this?\nYet, I still yearned for more.\n“Want some candy?”\n“Candy? What flavor?”\n“Probably the one you like the most?”\n“Hmm… Do you know what my favorite flavor is?”\n“Not at all. Just a wild guess.”\nThat was a lie.\nI knew very well that Shin Eun-ha liked orange-flavored candy.\nAfter buying the web novel’s setting book, I had practically memorized every detail about her.\nBack in my original world, I always carried orange-flavored candies in my pocket to quit smoking.\nHowever, even after quitting smoking, I couldn’t break my habit of carrying orange-flavored candy, so I continued it here.\n“Hmm… Wouldn’t it be difficult to guess?”\n“If I guess it right, grant me one request.”\n“Oh? Should I? But I could lie, you know?”\n“Hahaha- I can clearly see you’re not that type of person.”\nThere was no way Shin Eun-ha would lie.\nIt was rather cheap of me to leverage her inability to refuse, but in order to become closer to her in a short time, I shouldn’t hold back.\n“Okay. Let’s see if you can guess.”\n“Is it this?”\nI cautiously took out the orange-flavored candy from the pocket of my school uniform.\n“Wow..! How did you know? I don’t eat any other flavor except for orange.”\n“I’m a bit of a psychic.”\n“It’s amazing that you guessed it in one go…!”\n“So, you’ll grant my request?”\n“Yeah, sure. What is it?”\n“Let’s have lunch together.”\n****\nWhen lunchtime arrived, Eun-ha and I headed to the cafeteria together. Our casual chats during the breaks had created a hint of familiarity between us. I approached Eun-ha cautiously, ensuring it wasn’t too overwhelming.\n“Do you know what’s on the menu for lunch today?”\n“Tteokbokki, gimbap rolls, and odeng soup.”\n“That’s such a typical high school meal.”\n“Well, Han-gyeol, you’re a high school student, aren’t you?”\nAh, right.\nI am a high school student now.\n“Yeah, that’s true.”\n“Hehe. Why do you look flustered?”\n“I-I’m not flustered.”\n“Really? I’ll take your word for it.”\nWe joined the long queue for food at the cafeteria entrance. While I was pondering what topic to discuss next, Eun-ha initiated the conversation.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re quite sociable, aren’t you?”\n“Me? I’m not the type to be particularly interested in others.”\n“Really? That’s surprising. I was worried about this new semester since I got separated from my friends, But meeting you has been a relief.”\nI knew the friends she was referring to were Kang Seo-ha and Dolphin. For her, they were pretty much the only friends she had. Throughout the first and second years, the three of them had been inseparable. However, Kang Seo-ha and Dolphin became a couple.\nThis inevitably meant Eun-ha had to distance herself from them. It was difficult to join another group when there was already an established group. But considering Eun-ha’s personality and beauty, she could easily blend in anywhere in the class. However, I managed to approach her first.\n“Really? To be honest, I don’t have any close friends. If I had to name one, you’d be the first.”\nIn the memories of this ‘Lee Han-gyeol’, there wasn’t a single person he could call a friend. I remembered him always minding his business, working in silence. Hearing my story, this unfortunate heroine gave me a smile.\n“Hehe - Really? Thanks for saying something so nice.”\n“It’s n-nothing...! Haha..!”\nHer laughter was fatally beautiful.\n“Enjoy your meal.”\n“You too, Eun-ha.”\nAfter getting our meals, Eun-ha and I sat across from each other at the same table.\nWhen I eat, I really just focus on the food. Yet, I found myself stealing glances at Eun-ha as she ate.\nThe way she scooped food into her small mouth was both adorable and endearing. It oddly reminded me of watching a young niece eat, which made the feeling somewhat unsettling... Nevertheless, I tried to synchronize my eating pace with hers.\n“I’ve finished eating. Han-gyeol, did I...uh, eat too slowly?”\n“Not at all? I just finished too. Let’s get up and...!”\nJust as I was about to pick up my tray and stand, I saw Kang Seo-ha and Dolphin approaching from the opposite side.\nDamn it.\nThe atmosphere was so pleasant, I didn’t want anything to spoil Eun-ha’s mood.\n“Look! There’s candy falling outside!”\n“Huh? Candy?”\nI hurriedly diverted Eunha’s gaze elsewhere. But there was no chance of candy falling outside, so her gaze quickly returned. She looked at me with a puzzled expression, so I chuckled awkwardly.\n“Haha... I, I was just kidding!”\n“Oh, really? Haha... Shall we get up?”\nEmbarrassed, I quickly picked up my tray and headed for the exit. As I left the cafeteria, Eun-ha followed me out.\n“What do you usually do during lunchtime, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? Lunchtime? Not much really. I read or study. Sometimes I play basketball.”\n“Oh, really? Do you like reading?”\nEun-ha was a member of the library club and loved reading. But the reason she grew fond of reading was somewhat sad. As a child, with her busy parents, her only friend had been books.\n“Yes. I like both fiction and non-fiction.”\n“Non-fiction? Do you mean like philosophy books?”\n“Mhm. I don’t really discriminate when reading. Want to go to the library together?”\nEun-ha seemed genuinely pleased to find someone who shared her passion for books. For the first time, she gave me a radiant smile.\n“Yes. Let’s go.”\nPlease, don’t smile like that.\nIt felt like my heart might stop.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 2 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "“Hey?! Look there! Candy is falling!”\nI turned my head abruptly when he said that candy was falling outside. But of course, such an event wasn’t actually happening, and the scene outside was just as usual.\n“Haha... I, I was just kidding.”\n“Oh, really? Haha... Shall we get up?”\nThe boy named Han-gyeol was the first to pick up his tray and stood up. I also made my way toward the exit, but for a moment, I saw Seo-ha and Jung-yeon looking for a seat. Swiftly, I turned my head and followed Han-gyeol.\nBy the way... did he try to distract me so I wouldn’t see Seo-ha and Jung-yeon?\nHowever, there was no way Han-gyeol, who virtually met me for the first time today, would know about my feelings for Seo-ha.\nBut it was too out of the blue to be a coincidence, and it didn’t make sense to think he knew. Still, I was relieved that we didn’t cross paths and I left the cafeteria.\n.\n.\n.\nI was a bit surprised when Han-gyeol mentioned that he also liked books, just like me.\nIt was not right to judge people by their appearances, but I had assumed he was more into sports.\nAfter a brief conversation, we headed straight to the library.\nIn the quiet library, Han-gyeol and I silently explored the bookshelves. As I was watching which book Han-gyeol would choose, he promptly took one out.\nIt was a book placed relatively high, but he easily reached it.\n“It’s here too... but then again, it’d be strange if it weren’t.”\n“Which one it is?”\nI asked, hearing Han-gyeol’s soft murmur.\nHe was holding Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s “The Little Prince”.\n“Ah- It’s The Little Prince. I read it when I was a child but haven’t read it since. Just felt like revisiting it. Haha.”\nFor some reason, he seemed a bit flustered... but I couldn’t comprehend the reason behind it.\nStill, his flustered demeanor was amusing to see.\n“Same here. I read it when I was a child but never revisited it.”\n“Maybe we should read it now? It might feel different reading it as an adult.”\n“Huh? But Han-gyeol, you haven’t become a complete adult yet, right?”\n“Ah-! Right, right. I just thought, maybe being a high school senior is somewhat close to being an adult...? I mean, we’ll be adults next year, right?”\nIt felt like there were floating question marks above his head. His demeanor was both intriguing and amusing, making me burst into laughter without realizing it.\n“Pfft! Han-gyeol is quite an interesting guy, isn’t he?”\n“Don’t tease too much. I just misspoke.”\n“Got it. Are you borrowing this book?”\n“Since we’re on the topic, I might as well reread it. What about you, Eun-ha? What kind of books do you usually read? Novels?”\n“I don’t particularly have a preference, but I do feel like reading a novel today.”\nUpon Han-gyeol’s question, I took another look at the bookshelves.\nI loved books, but deciding what to read was always a challenging task. I lifted my head to look at the books placed high on the shelf. Then, I spotted a novel that looked interesting and reached for it.\n“...Huh.”\nAs I struggled to retrieve the book, Han-gyeol swiftly extended his hand from behind me.\nHis shadow cast over me, and it felt like his chest might touch the back of my head, causing me to flinch momentarily.\nHe effortlessly pulled out the book and handed it to me.\nWell, it was quite an unexpected situation, to say the least...\n“Here. Is this what you were trying to get?”\n“Huh? Oh, yes. Han-gyeol, you’re quite tall, aren’t you?”\nCome to think of it, this was the first time I was conversing so effortlessly with a guy, apart from Seo-ha.\nFor some reason, he radiated a comforting aura, perhaps because he appeared so laid-back.\n“Really? I’m not even 180 cm.”\n“Well, you’re still much taller than me. Anyway, I’ll borrow this book.”\nI took the book from Han-gyeol and made my way to the library counter.\nSince I was also a library assistant, I checked out the book myself and came out of the library with Han-gyeol.\n“Let’s head back to the classroom now, shall we?”\n“Sounds good. Is it the 5th period for physical education? We need to change into our gym clothes quickly.”\n“Right. Let’s hurry.”\n“Ah- Han-gyeol. Do you want to head back first? I have to do something more in the library.”\n“Oh, okay? Do you need my help with anything?”\n“No, I’m fine.”\n“Alright then. I’ll go ahead. Don’t be too late~”\nUnexpectedly, Han-gyeol immediately said goodbye and headed straight for the classroom.\nHe seemed to be quite sociable... Does he really not have many male friends?\nI was a bit worried about the new semester since I couldn’t hang out with Seo-ha and Jung-yeon anymore.\nAlthough I was grateful to Han-gyeol for approaching me so friendly, making those worries fade, I still didn’t really know what kind of person Han-gyeol was.\nHe didn’t seem like a bad guy, but the unfamiliar feeling hadn’t disappeared yet.\nPerhaps it was better to maintain a certain distance and observe him for a while?\nHmm... Am I being too calculating?\n****\n“Boys, go play basketball. The other grades are using the field. Girls, you can have some free time.”\nIt was the first day of physical education, and the teacher allowed us some free time. The boys flocked to play basketball, and among them was Han-gyeol.\n“Eun-ha, what are you looking at so intently?”\n“Ah- nothing. It seems the boys are playing basketball.”\n“True. Want to go watch it? It’s boring just sitting here, right?”\nThe girl I was talking to now, Harim, was in my class in the first grade. We didn’t hang out in the same group, but it seemed like she too was separated from her friends, much like me.\nNo, it was a bit different. I couldn’t be with Seo-ha and Jung-yeon anymore…\n“Harim, do you know a guy named Lee Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? I’ve never heard of him. Who is he?”\n“The one holding the basketball over there.”\n“I’m not sure. Which class was he in during the second grade?”\n“I think he said class 5.”\n“Hmm, I don’t know him then. Anyway, since there’s nothing else to do, let’s just watch the basketball game.”\n“Alright.”\nIt wasn’t just Harim and I who were watching the basketball game. Other girls were also watching the boys from outside the basketball court.\nThe boys played passionately, swinging their arms and the ball energetically.\nAmong them, Han-gyeol seemed particularly joyful...\nHuh? Is that his happy face?\nHe blocked the opposing player with a youthful smile on his face.\n“Hey... hey! There’s something odd about this guy’s eyes.”\n“Just pass the ball to me.”\n“This is insane... Did you hear what I just said! There’s something odd about this guy!”\n“Hey, just pass it! Pass!”\nThe opponent gripped the ball and threw it forcefully to the other side.\nYet, Han-gyeol stretched out his arm and caught the basketball perfectly.\nAnd from afar, he threw the ball, and it beautifully went into the hoop.\n“There you go. I was right...”\n“This dude is weird!”\n“Don’t you know about ‘Slam Dunk’*? Man, kids these days lack romance.”\n“You’re one of those kids too! Why this guy always acts like this?”\n“A man who never gives up...”\n“Just stop. You crazy bastard!”\nThough playing basketball, his gestures indicated he was definitely a high school boy. But there was something peculiar about him that made him seem more mature.\nWhat could it be?\n“That’s him, right? The one you mentioned earlier.”\n“Uh? Yes. He just seems like a good guy.”\n“He does look like it. Friendly and plays basketball well. Is he in the basketball club?”\n“Maybe? I’ll have to ask later.”\nI silently observed what kind of person Han-gyeol was.\nHe didn’t use rough language at all, not all the boys were like this.\nHe just played basketball, laughing brightly like any typical boy.\nAlthough I couldn’t find anything odd in Han-gyeol’s actions, he seemed different.\nAs I silently stared at him, suddenly a basketball flew into my vision.\nWhat...?\nIn the blink of an eye, seeing the basketball coming towards me, I tightly shut my eyes.\nBang!\nI heard the sound of the ball colliding with something, but I didn’t feel any pain.\nWhen I slowly opened my eyes, the back of a boy’s large hand was right in front of me.\n“Eun-ha, sorry! Were you scared?”\n“Ah...! No, I’m okay...!”\n“That’s a relief. Hey! Don’t throw it so hard!”\n“Ugh... Sorry, sorry! She didn’t get hurt, right?”\n“She is fine!”\nAfter throwing the ball back to his friend, Han-gyeol went back into the court.\n“Wasn’t he kinda cool just now?”\nHarim, who was beside me, looked at me with a very intrigued expression.\n“Uh..? Wha- suddenly?”\n“What do you mean suddenly? He totally blocked the basketball for you in a cool way.”\n“Did... did he? I didn’t really notice...”\n“But your face is a bit red for someone who didn’t notice. Did you fall for him?”\n“No, it’s not like that...! I was just surprised.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n“Not even a bit fluttered?”\n“No, I wasn’t fluttered..!”\nRegardless of my answer, Harim seemed unsatisfied.\nThe continuous gaze from Harim made me feel pressured, so inevitably... I spoke.\n“Ah, well, anyone would’ve felt a bit fluttered in that situation...”\n“Right? Knew it! Ha- might we have the first couple in our class?”\n“No, it’s not like that...!”\nStill, after that incident, it seemed my guard against Han-gyeol might have dropped a bit...\nBut it was only been a day since we met, so this feeling would likely fade away soon enough!\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Slam Dunk: Slam Dunk is a popular basketball manga/anime.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

It felt like a dream.\nIt seems kids these days still enjoy running around.\nAh, Isn’t this an old man’s way of thinking?\n“Right. Everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot. And you played really well.”\n“Really? It’s a bit embarrassing when you compliment me like that.”\nHearing Eun-ha, who was sitting next to me, say that made me unexpectedly embarrassed.\nI did want to hear compliments like ‘I was cool’, but saying that sort of thing was still a bit awkward between us.\n“No, really! You played great! Are you in the basketball club, Han-gyeol?”\n“No? I think it’s the literary club.”\n“You think?”\nAh, that’s not good.\n“I’m in the literary club. The literary club. Haha.”\n“Oh... That’s unexpected. I heard there aren’t many people in the literary club.”\nThat’s Exactly what I thought.\nWhy did it have to be the literary club?\nIt was the same club I was in back in my original world.\n“I’m planning to join another club this year.”\n“Which one? The basketball club?”\n“Well... It’s too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, so maybe not the basketball club. How about the library club?”\n“Huh? The library club might be a bit boring for Han-gyeol, don’t you think?”\n“There’s also a kind of stability that comes from that sort of boredom…”\n“Haha! What’s that? You just sound like my other brother!”\nWouldn’t ‘being like family’ is a rather good approach?\n“Haha! How old is your other brother?”\n“Huh? He’s five years older than me. He was discharged from the military not too long ago.”\n“I envy him.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“Uh...?! No, I mean, I have to join the military someday, so I’m just envious of him having finished. Haha!”\nDamn it. I had such a tough time in the military.\nI even served an extra military shift for giving a deer some food!\nWell, to be honest, I was a quartermaster, so it was relatively more comfortable than others.\nBut still, spending 1 year and 9 months locked up in the military was frustrating.\n“Do you have any siblings, Han-gyeol? Maybe a sister?”\n“No, I’m an only child.”\n“I see... I heard that only children tend to be pampered and lack consideration. But I guess that’s just a stereotype.”\n“Really? Sometimes there might be some truth to it, right?”\n“Huh? When I look at you, Han-gyeol, I don’t get that impression at all.”\n“Is that a compliment? Makes me feel good.”\n“Yes. It’s a compliment.”\nSeeing Eun-ha’s smiling face, my heart swelled with joy.\nTo think I’d get to witness Eun-ha’s vivid smile with my own eyes.\nThis was the most wonderful moment of my life.\nCan life be this exhilarating?\n“You seem mature, Han-gyeol.”\n“Really? Shouldn’t you be saying I look like a high school student instead? Aren’t you saying I look old?”\n“No, no! I wasn’t referring to your looks. I meant your behavior is mature.”\n“Haha, I know. I was just kidding.”\n“I take back what I just said.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“I was kidding too.”\nThe lighthearted jokes and teases were truly enjoyable.\nHaving school meals after such a long time, experiencing physical education again, and the lively atmosphere of a classroom full of students... felt refreshing.\nWearing the attire called a school uniform and relishing this freedom made me exhilarated, as it had been so long.\nThe high school life I originally experienced was pretty tough.\n“Speaking of maturity, isn’t Eun-ha even more mature?”\n“Huh? What gives you that idea?”\n“Um… because you’re kind?”\n“Hehe, what’s that? Being kind makes you mature?”\n“Yes. Being considerate of others is really tough.”\n“Thanks for the compliment. Shh- the teacher is coming in. Be quiet now.”\nI wished our conversation could have lasted longer.\nWould offering to share some snacks have been a good idea? Or would that be seen as out of place?\nHowever, after lunch and a game of basketball, I was suddenly overwhelmed by fatigue.\nAs I began to drift off, I felt a gentle poke.\n“Uh... what?”\nWhen I raised my head, every eye in the classroom was on me.\nIn a corporate setting, this would have been a moment of utter embarrassment, but thankfully, this was just school.\nNevertheless, the pressure felt familiar.\n“You, the one dozing off on the first day of senior year, stand up.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“I just explained differentiation again. If you can explain what differentiation is, you can sit. So... What is differentiation?”\nIt was something I learned a decade ago, but I couldn’t recall it clearly.\nIf I said it was the opposite of integration, I’d surely get scolded for making a joke, right?\nWhile I was pondering how to explain, Eun-ha discreetly wrote the answer in my textbook.\n- The slope at a specific point.\nI recited Eun-ha’s beautifully written answer as it was.\n“The slope at a specific point.”\n“You’re saved by your partner. Sit down.”\n“Thank you.”\nAs I settled back into my seat, I penned a quick thank you note in the textbook. And then, what ensued was a delightful written exchange.\n-Thanks for the hint.\n-Sorry. I should have just woken you up earlier.\n-I was the one who fell asleep, so don’t be.\n-Right. It’s Han-gyeol’s fault.\nHuh?\nI glanced up to meet Eun-ha’s gaze just as she was writing that.\nHer face, holding back laughter with a smile, looked incredibly beautiful.\n-I’ll reflect on it.\n- Well, that’s good to hear.\n-But Eun-ha, you’re also doodling right now, aren’t you?\nUpon my remark, Eun-ha’s hand stopped. After a brief hesitation, her hand moved again.\n-True lol.\nMy heart warmed at the sight of her shyly written ‘lol’.\nHaving this written conversation with the main heroine I had always admired... was out of the world.\nAs we continued our private chat, unnoticed-\n“Both of you messing around, move to the back.”\nOh no.\n****\nAfter being reprimanded by the math teacher in the faculty room, we made our way back to the classroom.\n“I’m sorry. You got in trouble because of me.”\n“No? Not at all. I had fun too.”\nOh my...! Eun-ha said she enjoyed chatting with me.\nI feel like I could happily die now.\nWell, no, I still don’t want to die.\n“What’s our last class today?”\n“Politics and Law, I guess?”\n“Politics and Law...?”\nWasn’t it “Law and Politics” when I was in school?\nDid they change the name?”\nRealizing the difference, I suddenly felt the generation gap.\nCome to think of it... This generation had mandatory Korean history and absolute evaluations in English, right? I remember crying at home after scoring 87 in English and being placed in the third grade...\nSuch an evaluation system feels scary, doesn’t it?\n“Why such a reaction? I’ve heard it’s difficult, but..”\n“Ah, it’s nothing...”\nI brushed it off, feeling an inexplicable sense of guilt surge within me again.\nI had heard that Korean and Math were mandatory now... That seemed intense.\nI wonder if they still teach ‘Kwandong Byulgok*’ from Mr. Jung Cheol?\nWhat about “Three Kingdoms*“? And “Heosaengjeon*“? Those were the only ones I could think of...\nSpeaking of which, I had also heard that students even have to choose elective subjects in math nowadays, right?\nWhat’s this? I’m totally ignorant when it comes to university entrance exams!\n“Hey, Eun-ha... have you decided on your math elective subject?”\n“Hmm… I’m thinking of taking calculus?”\n“So, calculus and statistics are now separate subjects?”\n“Yes... But why?”\nThis was unbelievable.\nIn my time, both calculus and statistics were fundamental...\nI was sweating bullets.\n“Are you taking calculus too, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? Probably?”\n“In the past, you had to study calculus and statistics together!”\n“Pa...past?”\n“Yes. About 10 years ago maybe?”\n“Hahaha - sounds rough.”\nI’m from that generation...\n“Well, it is what it is, right? We’re all students preparing for entrance exams, hehe.”\nIt was awkward.\nFeeling a bit disheartened, I walked down the corridor.\n“Hey! Eun-ha-!”\nA girl called out Eun-ha’s name in a confident voice. Next to her stood a fairly handsome boy: The protagonists of this novel, Kang Seo-ha, and Yang Jung-yeon.\nI ended up facing the last people I wanted to meet right in the middle of the hallway.\n“Hello, Jung-yeon? Hi Seo-ha.”\nHowever, Eun-ha waved with a bright smile.\nHer consideration was always directed towards others, often sidelining her own emotions.\nEven though she was smiling, I was certain her inner feelings were complicated.\n“Hi, Eun-ha. It’s the first day of the new semester, but we only see you in the last period?”\nThis clueless protagonist greeted Eun-ha cheerfully, oblivious to her feelings.\nIf you’re going to reject, do it right... Idiot, there’s no way you can reject someone and then remain friends.\nA pleasant rejection? There was no such thing.\nA rejection was, after all, an act of pushing someone away.\nBut there was nothing I could do in such a situation.\n“Who’s this?”\nThe dolphin, Eun-ha’s past rival, stared at me intently.\nWhat are you looking at? You’re the one who took Kang Seo-ha away from Eun-ha.\nShe sure has a thick face. I should keep my distance.\nWhat’s she trying to pull?\n“Ah- This is Lee Han-gyeol, he’s in my class. We became quick friends on the first day. Haha...”\nEun-ha’s voice trailed off as she sneakily glanced at Kang Seo-ha.\nThe subtext was clear: ‘What would Seo-ha think, seeing me with another guy, especially after he just rejected me a few months ago?’\nShe was probably fretting over such unnecessary thoughts.\n“Ah- Is that so? If you’re Eun-ha’s friend, we should get along. Hi? I’m Yang Jung-yeon.”\n“Hello. I’m Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“And this is my boyfriend, Kang Seo-ha.”\n“Ah- Hello. I’m Eun-ha’s childhood friend, Kang Seo-ha. Let’s get along.”\n“Yeah. I think I’ve seen you around the hallway a few times. Ah- but we need to head back to our classroom now.”\nI hurriedly came to the point, not wanting to leave Eun-ha in such a place.\n“Ah- sorry. It was nice to meet you both. See you later then?”\n“Yes.”\n“Take care, Jung-yeon, and Seo-ha.”\nWith Eun-ha’s farewell, Kang Seo-ha and Yang Jung-yeon walked in the opposite direction. However, as Eun-ha momentarily watched their retreating figures, her expression looked genuinely pained.\n“Eun-ha, want some candy?”\n“Huh? Didn’t we just have some?”\n“I have a lot in my pocket. Here- have one.”\n“Haha. I swear my teeth are going to rot.”\n“If you brush well, it’ll be fine. Shall we go?”\nAs I took the first step, Eun-ha suddenly grabbed the hem of my clothes.\n“Huh? What’s up?”\nEun-ha stared intently into my eyes for a moment before she spoke.\n“Do you... know something? Is that why you’re being so considerate?”\nThis is bad.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Kwandong Byulgok: It’s a famous Korean poem written by Jeong Cheol.\nThree Kingdoms: It refers to the historical period during which the Korean Peninsula was divided among three rival kingdoms: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.\nHeosaengjeon: It’s a satirical novel written in Chinese by Yeonam Park Ji-won in the late Joseon Dynasty to satirize the reality of Joseon at the time.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Although I tried to be vague about what I was asking and what I meant… Han-gyeol’s behavior seemed off... and we just didn’t talk about it.\nThe way he diverted my attention in the cafeteria... And how he hastily tried to leave when he met Seo-ha and Jung-yeon.\nWhen I pondered why he acted that way, only one conclusion came to mind.\nEverything would make sense if he knew I liked Seo-ha and that I got rejected.\nBut there was no way Han-gyeol could know about my relationship with the two of them.\n“What the heck…?”\nNo matter how much I thought about it, there was no way Seo-ha and Jung-yeon would have talked about it to anyone else or him. And it was not like Han-gyeol and I were close enough for him to have noticed on his own.\nThe more I mulled it over, the more puzzling it became.\n“Hey, Shin Eun-ha. Where did mom go? When is she coming back?”\n“I don’t know. Why don’t you call her?”\n“No. What if she comes back early because I called?”\n“Why are you like this?”\n“Hey, by the way, do you know anyone around you who’s good with computers? Now that I had completed my military service, I want to assemble a computer, and it’s killing me.”\n“I don’t know anyone like that.”\n“At least give it some thought before answering.”\n“Hey, big bro...”\n“What?”\n“Never mind. What would you know anyway?”\n“Hey, you jerk?”\nWhile my brother was biologically male, he knew nothing about women.\nTrusting a sparrow sitting on a tree would be more credible than trusting him.\nBut in that desperate situation, I still asked him.\n“What would you feel if someone you weren’t close to seemed to know a lot about you?”\n“That’s creepy.”\n“No, not like that! What if the person is kind, but they just seem to know a lot about you?”\n“My opinion doesn’t change. If someone I wasn’t close with knows a lot about me? Sounds stalker-ish.”\n“It’s not like that... Never mind. What’s the use of talking to you about this. It was my mistake, forget it.”\nMy brother took a soda out of the refrigerator and drank directly from the bottle without pouring it into a cup.\n“Hey! Use a glass!”\n“I didn’t touch it with my mouth! You startled me; I almost spat it out!”\n“Ugh, seriously, I can’t argue with you.”\n“Well, why did you ask? Someone, you aren’t close with knows a lot about you?”\n“Yes, but he knows things that he shouldn’t possibly know.”\n“A magician?”\n“I’m genuinely concerned. Can you not joke about it?”\n“If he isn’t a magician, it must be a secret crush.”\n“That’s so out of the blue?”\n“It’s common to end up knowing things about someone you like even if you don’t want to, right? Oh, we’re out of food. Should I order chicken?”\n“Do you also feel that way? Wanting to know about someone you like?”\n“Isn’t that generally the case? You’d naturally be curious about what they like, what they’re up to. Aren’t you?”\n“Well... I think I felt something similar...”\n“Haaa, with my deep understanding of women, why don’t I have a girlfriend?”\n“Where is this confidence coming from?”\nStill, it was a stretch to assume that a boy I had never really talked to or been close with would suddenly have feelings for me.\nEven if he did have feelings, there was no guarantee he would know that much about me. It seemed almost impossible.\nBut then again, he did know my favorite candy flavor, so there might be some truth to it.\n“I’m going to order chicken, you in?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Tell Mom we already had dinner.”\n“Will do. You’re paying, right?”\n“It’s a bit much taking money from my sister who is still in high school, right?”\n“I’ll enjoy every bite of it.”\n“Fine, but you order, clean up, and handle the recycling.”\n“Okay.”\nI ordered chicken through an app, and it arrived shortly after.\nI placed the chicken on the table in front of the sofa and turned on the television.\nFlipping through the channels, a basketball game caught my eye.\n“You’re into basketball all of a sudden?”\n“Just... felt a sudden interest.”\n“That guy you were talking about earlier plays basketball, doesn’t he?”\n“Wow, you pick up on the most unnecessary things so quickly...”\n“Is he good-looking? Show me a picture of his face. I’ll know just by looking.”\n“What picture? And it’s not like I’m into him or anything, so mind your own business!”\n“Geez, I even bought you chicken, and you’re this cold...”\nWatching the basketball game reminded me of what happened during today’s PE class.\nThe image of those large hands before my eyes lingered in my mind.\nI need to stay calm. Anybody would be flustered in that situation, not just me.\nI was not so naive as to mistake a fleeting thrill for genuine feelings.\n“Do you like him?”\n“What are you talking about?! It’s not like that!”\n“Then why are you making that face?”\n“What face?”\nWhy does this darned brother of mine keep pestering me?\n“Your eyes had an unnecessary warmth.”\n“Ugh, it’s because of the chicken.”\n“There was also a hint of kindness...”\n“Stop it! You can’t eat anymore!”\n“I paid for it, you brat!”\nAfter having chicken for dinner, I washed up and lay down in bed.\nI plugged my phone into the charger and checked my SNS* in the dimly lit room.\nI casually searched for ‘Lee Han-gyeol’, but countless people with the same name appeared.\nSince it was the beginning of the semester, there were no group or contact numbers exchanges, so I couldn’t find Han-gyeol’s profile.\n“Haaa... I have no idea who this guy is.”\nIs he just super perceptive?\n“Ugh, forget it. Let’s not overthink this.”\nI placed my phone beside me and closed my eyes.\n***\nI turned off the noisy alarm and came out after washing up in the bathroom.\nI didn’t eat breakfast, so I immediately dried my hair and changed into my school uniform.\nMy home was close to school, but I always leave earlier than others.\nExiting my apartment complex, walking between the tall buildings, and passing a cat stretching in front of the fire station, I was soon at school.\nCome to think of it, during my 1st and 2nd years, I was always the first to arrive in the classroom. But yesterday, Han-gyeol was there.\nUpon opening the classroom door and entering, I locked eyes with Han-gyeol, who was already seated.\nMaybe it was because of that question I asked him yesterday. It felt unexpectedly awkward.\n“Ah- hey.”\n“Yeah. Hi.”\nI put my bag down and tried to check my phone, but I couldn’t focus.\nI shouldn’t have asked that question yesterday!\nWe had finally become closer, but now there was this strange distance between us.\nHe must’ve been a little taken aback, right?\nIt was natural to be flustered when asked such an out-of-the-blue question.\nWhile I was pondering this, Han-gyeol spoke to me.\n“Did you eat breakfast?”\nHis sudden question caught me off guard.\nI involuntarily flinched, as if I was caught stealing something.\n“Uh..? No, no, I usually don’t eat breakfast.”\n“Oh, really? I thought you’d surely have eaten since you come in so early.”\n“Did you eat, Han-gyeol?”\n“I always make sure to eat. It’s tough if I don’t.”\n“That’s wise. But if I eat breakfast, I always end up dozing off during the first period.”\nI didn’t expect him to start the conversation.\nWas this also a form of consideration?\nEven when I was the one who made things awkward, after all.\n“Really? Well, I always feel sleepy after lunch.”\n“I think most people do. Haha...”\nThat was the end of our conversation.\nHan-gyeol went back to looking at his phone, and I looked at mine.\nBut if Han-gyeol was showing me consideration, shouldn’t I say something in return?\nHowever, no matter how much I wracked my brain, I couldn’t think of something appropriate to say to a guy in the morning.\nI felt a little embarrassed by my lack of verbal skills.\nAlthough my gaze was directed at my phone, I stole glances at Han-gyeol now and then.\nI wasn’t trying to peek, but I caught a glimpse of his phone screen. Surprisingly, he was on a shopping site.\nHuh?\nDon’t most guys usually look at manhwas or play games?\nI might be prejudiced, but browsing a shopping site felt unusual.\n“Ah-!”\nPerhaps he sensed my gaze, and our eyes met.\n“Ah-! I wasn’t trying to sneak a peek or anything! I was just wondering what you were looking at.”\n“Oh, this? I was thinking of buying a computer since I don’t have one at home.”\n“Don’t people usually go to electronics stores for that?”\n“Well, pre-built ones can be pretty pricey, so I was thinking of assembling one.”\n“Assembling? You mean you’re going to build it yourself?”\n“Yeah, something like that. It’s definitely cheaper that way.”\n“That’s fascinating... My brother mentioned something about assembling a computer too.”\n“Ah- you said he recently got discharged from the military, right? He must be building a personal computer.”\n“Wow... how did you know? I think he did mention something like that.”\nThat was really fascinating...\nBut then, Han-gyeol’s eyes began to sparkle.\n“What’s the estimated cost? What’s his budget? Purpose? Which monitor does he plan to use? There are a lot of decent monitors from small to medium-sized companies these days, but I still prefer the ones from major brands.”\nIt was kind of cute to see his eyes light up talking about something he was passionate about.\n“Maybe I should ask my brother?”\nIt was pretty obvious he would be sleeping till now, but I decided to drop him a message just in case.\n[Bro, what’s the estimated cost for the computer? And the budget?]\nBut the grey dot indicating he was not online disappeared right away.\nWhat’s with him? Why is he awake at this hour?\n[I don’t know. I haven’t decided. Including the monitor, maybe around $1,300? Why?]\n[Just a friend asked.]\n[Does your friend know how to build a computer?]\n[He said he’s going to assemble one for himself.]\nThe movement had I sent the message, then my phone started ringing. Without much thought, I answered, and my brother’s voice on the other end was extremely urgent.\n“Let me talk to him right now!”\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Hey everyone, guess what?

      "content": "“No, it’s better to always go for dual RAM. I’ve heard that stock coolers these days are pretty decent, but air coolers aren’t that expensive, so it might be a good investment. Personally, I tend to spend a little more money when assembling a computer. You might want to upgrade the graphics card later. But this is just my subjective opinion. It would be good to ask others as well. Oh, and I’ve heard that there are some good deals on complete PC sets these days, so check them out!”\nAfter ending the call, I handed the phone back to Eun-ha.\n“I’m sorry. Did my brother make it difficult for you? I’ll give him a good talking to when I get home.”\n“Huh? No! I actually enjoy making PC related estimations.”\nThe awkwardness from yesterday seemed to have disappeared now. Eun-ha, receiving her phone back, had a slight smile on her face.\n“Huh...? My brother sent a gift-card for us to eat together.”\n“Really? He didn’t have to do that.”\nOh- nice. He’s quite considerate.\n“So... when are we going to eat?”\n“Huh? I’m free anytime.”\n“You don’t have any after-school classes?”\n“Huh?”\nCome to think of it... she doesn’t attend any after-school classes? Hopefully, I didn’t miss that.\n“If you’re busy, can you let me know later?”\n“No! I’m free! How about after school today?”\n“Today?”\n“Yes, today.”\nThe fact that I had made a dinner plan with Eun-ha made me so happy that I giggled throughout the class.\nYouth is such a delightful experience.\nIt was quite different from my youth, filled only with studies I didn’t like. Perhaps I was finally living the high school life I always dreamed of.\n-Sigh\nHigh school life at the age of twenty-seven... I should enjoy it while I can.\n“Alright, sit down. I’ll distribute the night self-study application forms. Submit them by tomorrow.”\n“Yes~”\nWhat I received during the morning assembly was a document, an application form for night self-study.\n“Do you do night studies, Eun-ha?”\n“I’m still considering. I’m thinking of doing it, but I don’t like the idea of eating dinner alone.”\nIn the 1st and 2nd grade, Eun-ha always ate with Kang Seo-ha and Dolphin. So, now could she eat with me? Actually, I would like that.\n“Really? If you’re okay with it, want to eat with me?”\n“Huh? Are you doing night studies, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m not sure about night studies, but I can have dinner. If you do night studies, maybe I should too?”\n“Then I’d be grateful... but I only do night studies on Thursdays and Fridays. Are you up for it?”\n“Why not on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday?”\n“I just want to go home early on those days, and since Thursday and Friday are right before the weekend so...”\nWhat a cute way of reasoning. But it does make sense. I used to work late only on the days right before the weekend.\n“Then I should apply for night studies on Thursdays and Fridays.”\n“Oh- You don’t have to do that just because of me.”\n“Huh? No, I need to study too.”\nOh- Did I push it too hard?\nI quickly observed Eun-ha’s expression, but she didn’t seem to have any odd reaction.\n“That’s great.”\nSeeing Eun-ha smile made my heart race.\nI never imagined I would be this happy to apply for night self-study.\nI casually signed in the signature section.\n“Do you have a signature, Han-gyeol?”\n“Uh..?! Oh, it just happened over time?”\n“Incredible...! It looks like from a working professional!”\nHard to believe, but it’s the real truth.\nStill, I should be more careful next time.\n“You are cool.”\nHearing Eun-ha say that I’m cool, I felt my face turning red. Eun-ha’s eyes widened, perhaps surprised by her own comment. After a few seconds of silence, she frantically waved her hand in the air, trying to explain.\n“No- I mean! It’s just that signature! I mean... Most high school students don’t have one like that, so I thought it looked cool!”\nI wonder... Am I getting closer to Eun-ha the right way?\nYet, seeing her flustered like this, I felt like things were okay.\nLittle by little, step by step, if I kept approaching her, would she stay by my side?\n****\nAfter school ended, we headed straight to the chicken center.\nIt was an early evening, but I had a light lunch, so I was good.\n“What would you like to drink?”\n“Hmm? Obviously b...! I’ll have a cola!”\nWhew- I almost said beer for a moment.\nWould I be kicked out if I mentioned beer while in a school uniform?\nThat was close.\nIt could’ve been a real mess.\nThe image I had built up till now would’ve been shattered.\nI need to calm down.\nI’m a high school student.\nI’m a high school student.\n“Pfft! Good thing you didn’t order normal soda, that would’ve been something.”\n“Oh, no, I like normal soda too. But for chicken, it’s always cola... cola!”\n“Right. I prefer cola over normal soda too.”\n“Really? We have a lot in common.”\n“I guess? We haven’t known each other long, but you seem very familiar to me.”\nA feeling of thrill ran down my body at being called ‘familiar,’ which made me a bit embarrassed.\nBut with the way she said it, anyone would’ve felt the same thrill.\nUgh- I was a little worried my feelings might spill out.\n“Sorry for the weird question yesterday.”\n“Hmm? Which one?”\n“The one asking if you knew about the relationship between me, Seo-ha, and Jung-yeon.”\n“Oh-”\nIt wasn’t ‘that’ weird.\n“We hung out together in 1st and 2nd grade. But due to some unavoidable circumstances, we had to distance ourselves. Ah-! We didn’t fight! Seo-ha and Jung-yeon are really kind and precious friends to me.”\nBefore the chicken arrived, Eun-ha briefly brought up the topic.\n“I felt like you were considering my feelings yesterday. It seemed like you diverted my gaze in the cafeteria, and even in the hallway when I ran into them. I wondered if you knew about my situation. But that seemed unlikely. Haha.”\nShe spoke with a smile, but there was an undertone of bitterness. There was also no need to pry for the reason here.\nAll I need to do was understand her feelings and step into her emotional space.\nAlthough, a part of me wished things would speed up. Maybe that was just me being greedy.\nFrom now on, I decided to act more cautiously.\n“I see. I didn’t intend to, but I’m glad if it felt like consideration.”\n“Even if it wasn’t intended, I appreciated it. I should’ve just been upfront from the start.”\n“Come on- it’s hard. How can you share such a story with someone you just met yesterday?”\nI took a big sip of my cola after saying that.\n“The more I see, the more mature you seem, Han-gyeol. It’s hard to believe we’re the same age.”\n“Hmm? In what way did you feel that?”\n“Well... not all the time. But usually, people would be curious about such stories, right? You didn’t seem like that at all.”\n“Is that so? It’s not that I’m indifferent to you, Eun-ha. It just looked like you didn’t want to discuss it.”\n“Wow... Han-gyeol, you’re pretty observant, huh?”\n“I’ve actually mastered the art of reading people.”\n“Haha-! What’s that supposed to mean!”\nWhile Eun-ha and I laughed and chatted, the chicken was placed on the table.\nI served myself some chicken on a plate and quietly focused on the food.\nWe didn’t really talk while eating.\nI just silently ate the chicken and refilled Eun-ha’s cup with cola.\nEvery time I did, Eun-ha, with a mouthful of chicken, would giggle softly.\nShe would nod her head as a way of expressing her gratitude.\nThe way she munches was just too cute.\n“Eun-ha, you really enjoy your food.”\n“Huh? No, it just happened!”\nEun-ha hurriedly covered her mouth.\n“Don’t look... I’m embarrassed.”\n“Haha- Alright. Keep eating.”\nNow I see why people enjoy watching mukbangs.\nAfter we finished the chicken, we paid and left the restaurant.\nThe day was cold, but the sunset was beautiful.\n“Where do you live, Han-gyeol?”\n“Me? I live in Puleunma-eul.”\n“Really? I’m from somangma-eul. Shall we walk together halfway?”\n“I’m full, so let’s walk slow.”\n“Okay.”\nI started walking in step with Eun-ha.\nSlowing my pace a little, I wanted to chat with her a bit more.\nI already knew a lot about Eun-ha, but I wanted to hear it from her voice.\n“What do you usually do on weekends, Eun-ha?”\n“Me? I have tutoring in the mornings on weekends.”\n“So you can’t sleep in even on weekends.”\n“Pshh- As if. Don’t I love to sleep in too?”\n“What time do you wake up on weekends?”\n“Around eight? I usually get up before nine.”\n“How is that considered sleeping in?”\n“Haha! Well, it’s later than usual.”\nShe’s really a diligent one.\nWaking up in the afternoon every weekend made me feel guilty.\n“Han-gyeol, do you go out and hang out with friends on weekends?”\n“Not really? I’m not that active. It’s hard to play basketball or soccer outside of school.”\n“Is that so? Then what do you usually do? Play games?”\nWhat did I do again?\nI didn’t want to admit I just roll around while looking at my phone.\n“I watch movies? I mainly watch movies.”\n“What genre do you like?”\n“Drama? I also like thrillers, but I won’t watch if they’re too brutal.”\n“I love movies too. I was planning to watch the one premiering this week.”\n“Oh, really? You’re going with your family?”\n“Uh? No. I was planning to go alone.”\nWould it be odd to ask her to go watch it together now?\nMaybe it’s better to take it slow for a bit longer.\nI’ll hold off for now. Let’s consider it after we get closer.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol, don’t you need to go that way?”\n“Ah-! Right!”\nAlthough it was quite a distance, time flew faster when I was with Eun-ha.\nPerhaps Einstein’s theory of relativity holds true after all.\nIt was a pity, but it was time to say goodbye for today.\n“I’ll head this way. Be safe. And don’t follow strangers.”\n“Haha! What’s that about? I’m not an eight-year-old kid.”\n“But it seems like you’d follow someone if they offered you something tasty?”\n“If it’s beef, maybe I’d be tempted?”\n“Haha! No, no you can’t. Anyways, see you at school tomorrow?”\n“Yes, take care, Han-gyeol.”\nWith a handshake from Eun-ha, my day came to an end.\nMaybe I should go watch a movie this weekend? Which one should I watch?\nI was curious about the movie that was mentioned in this novel.\n“If I run into Eun-ha, it would really be fate.”\nOn my way home, I found myself smiling for the first time in a while.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "“Eun-ha, did something good happen?”\n“Huh? No, everything’s as usual.”\n“Really? You seem especially cheerful today.”\n“Maybe because it’s the weekend?”\n“Hmm~ I don’t think so. Feels like you’ve had some good news?”\n“I don’t know the answer to this problem! Tell me!”\nThis was my cousin, Hyun-joo, who was also my private tutor.\nShe’s a student at a prestigious university’s math department and tutors me while receiving a teaching fee from my parents.\nThanks to her, my math grades have improved a lot, and she had been helping with both regular and mock exams.\n“Quit beating around the bush~ Did you by chance get a boyfriend?”\n“No way! I’m in my senior year of high school; where would I find the time to date?”\n“What about that boy I saw you with before? Seo-ha, was it? He seemed nice.”\nI had run into my sister while hanging out with Seo-ha a while back.\nHowever, things have changed since then.\n“Haha... It’s not like that. Also, Seo-ha has a girlfriend now.”\n“What?! That’s unexpected. When I saw him, I thought he surely had feelings for you.”\nI held back from telling her the full story, fearing it might complicate things.\nOf course, there was a time when Seo-ha had feelings for me, but he was dating Jung-yeon now.\nI would be lying if I said it didn’t hurt, but I genuinely wish them well.\nYet, looking straight at them was still a little painful.\n“Let’s focus on our lesson.”\n“Ah- Okay. Shall we move on to the next topic?”\n“Yes.”\nBy the time our two-hour tutoring session ended, it was lunchtime.\nI only used honorifics and address her as “teacher” during tutoring. Once the tutoring was over, we reverted back to just being sisters.\n“Sis, are you going to eat before leaving?”\n“Hmm? Should I? By the way, why haven’t I seen even a hint of your brother?”\n“He’s probably asleep.”\n“Then, excluding your brother, should we go out and grab something delicious?”\n“Yes? I’d love that.”\n“Hehe! Let’s go! I’ll treat you to something delicious.”\n“You’re not spending all your tutoring fee on me, are you?”\n“Of course not! I properly save up what I need to.”\n“That’s a relief. Let me change my clothes and come out?”\nI casually wore a cap and a fluffy zip-up hoodie.\nThe weather was still pleasantly cool.\n“What do you want to eat?”\n“Hmm? Anything’s fine.”\n“You know, you should never say that when you have a boyfriend.”\n“Why?”\n“When my sister’s boyfriend hears ‘anything’, we always end up eating pork cutlet or spicy stir-fried pork.”\n“Is that so? Well, I need to stop by a bookstore, so how about we take our time deciding?”\n“Sounds good. I’ll think about it while you browse the books.”\n“Hehe, deal.”\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBrowsing through the bookstore with my sister, I began selecting reference books.\nSince the new semester had started, there were many books to buy.\nAlthough it would be a bit heavy to carry home, it was better to get it over with at once.\nOne book, two books... By the time I selected five, I was done with reference books.\n“Can you carry all these?”\n“If I distribute them between my two hands, I think so.”\n“Then shall we pay and leave?”\n“Ah, let me choose one more novel.”\n“You’re buying even more? You’ll wear out your arms.”\n“It’s better to get everything in one go, right?”\n“Okay then, I’ll skim through some magazines in the meantime?”\n“Sure.”\nI quickly headed to the novel section. read a new novel every fortnight, so it was time for a fresh pick. Just as I was considering my next read-\n“Excuse me, I came to buy reference books. Where can I find them?”\n“Section A, right over there.”\n“Ah, thank you.”\n-A familiar voice reached my ears, so I turned to look.\nThere was a boy asking a store employee about the location of the reference books.\nWearing a cap, having just come out of his house, it was Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol?”\nUpon hearing his name, Han-gyeol looked my way. And with a visibly surprised expression, he responded,\n“Eun-ha?”\nHan-gyeol approached me.\nOh! I didn’t even wash my hair today and came out so casually; I shouldn’t have recognized him.\n“What brings you here?”\n“Came to buy reference books.”\n“Oh- Really? Me too. It’s quite a coincidence. But-”\n“Yes?”\n“Why did you buy so much? Can you even carry it all?”\n“Well, I just thought it’d be easier to buy everything at once, haha...”\nI replied with an awkward laugh.\nJust then, my sister approached, calling out to me.\n“Eun-ha, haven’t you chosen y- Oh? Were you with a friend?”\n“Ah, yes. He’s a classmate.”\n“Hello. Nice to meet you. I’m Lee Han-gyeol.”\nHan-gyeol politely bowed to greet my sister.\n“Hi. I’m Eun-ha’s cousin and also her tutor.”\n“Oh, I heard you tutor Eun-ha on weekends.”\n“Yes? If you know anyone who needs tutoring, can you let Eun-ha know?”\n“Oh, I will. But I don’t have Eun-ha’s contact.”\nRight, we hadn’t exchanged contact numbers yet.\n“Well, we can take this opportunity to exchange them.”\n“That’d be good. Eun-ha, can you give me your number?”\n“Uh… sure.”\nI typed my number into the phone Han-gyeol handed over.\nAfter pressing the call button and hearing my cellphone ring, I pressed the end call button.\nHowever, I felt a bit embarrassed. Maybe it was because we exchanged numbers in front of my sister?\n“Hehe...”\nMy sister had a peculiar smirk on her face.\nIt was the look of someone who had just witnessed something amusing.\nI wished she wouldn’t make such insinuations, but that was wishful thinking.\n“Why, what with the laugh?”\n“It’s nothing. Your name was Han-gyeol, right? Have you had lunch?”\n“No, I haven’t eaten yet.”\n“You should’ve. It’s your prime growth time; you need to eat well. I was planning to have lunch with Eun-ha, would you like to come with us?”\n“Uh, sis...! It might be burdensome for Han-gyeol...!”\n“Why? Oh, but in return for the free meal, you have to help Eun-ha carry her reference books. Want to come?”\nOf course, I would be grateful if Han-gyeol helped me, but...!\nI was feeling a bit self-conscious today.\n“Yes! I’d love to.”\nHan-gyeol readily agreed without much hesitation.\n“Good. We haven’t decided what to eat for lunch. Do you have anything in mind?”\n“I’m not particularly picky.”\n“Hmm- We’re okay with anything as well.”\nUpon hearing my sister’s indifferent reply, Han-gyeol seemed deep in thought.\nThen he responded with a bright smile.\n“How about pork cutl-”\n“Vetoed.”\nMy sister was telling the truth.\nShe rejected Han-gyeol’s suggestion even before he could finish his sentence.\nDo all guys really love pork cutlets that much?\n“Huh?”\n“Not pork cutlets.”\n“Then stir-fried pork-”\n“Not that either.”\n“Huh? You said anything would...”\n“Let’s just have pizza.”\n“Okay.”\nI had to bite my lips hard to suppress a laugh.\nHan-gyeol’s stunned expression was so cute to watch.\n“Let’s... let’s hurry then!”\nI turned my back first and headed to the counter.\nSeriously, Han-gyeol seemed like a really fun and kind guy.\n****\nAt the pizzeria, my sister looked at Han-gyeol and me with a satisfied expression. I was extremely nervous about what she might say, but the conversation was surprisingly ordinary.\n“Do you have a tutor or attend any private lessons? It might be good since you’re in your senior year of high school.”\n“Are you trying to sell something? I’m starting to regret mooching this pizza.”\n“Hey- I’m just asking. But you catch on pretty quick, don’t you?”\n“Isn’t there something odd about how you phrase things?”\nHan-gyeol looked slightly flustered, which was amusing.\nYet, he quietly divided the dishes, which was both surprising and endearing. It felt like his considerateness was innate.\n“It’s okay. I have some time to spare for one more person, and since you’re Eun-ha’s friend, I can give you a discount. How’s that?”\n“You really know how to do business.”\n“Ha! You sound like a working adult. Don’t you get that a lot? How does he seem to you, Eun-ha?”\nSuddenly, all eyes were on me.\n“Well, Han-gyeol seems mature.”\n“See? Even Eun-ha thinks so.”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment. What subject is the tutoring for?”\n“Huh? Math. Are you good at math?”\n“Hmm... I don’t even bother with questions 21 and 30.”\nIt made me wonder how well Han-gyeol was doing in his studies.\n“Do you study well, Han-gyeol? Would it be rude to ask about your grades?”\n“Uh... There’s quite a variation by subject. I think I’m weak in Korean Literature.”\n“Oh really? How about math?”\n“I think it’s alright. I’ll reconsider after I see my mock exam results in March.”\n“Is that so? Ah, the pizza’s here.”\nAs soon as the pizza arrived, Han-gyeol took the plate and served my sister first.\nThen he served me, and lastly, he took a slice for himself.\n“Thanks. You have good manners.”\n“I’m eating on your dime, so it’s only right. Ha.”\n“Ha! You’re so funny. Are you sure you aren’t a working adult? Makes me want to learn how to be an adult.”\n“There’s no way. As you can see, I’m a fresh-faced high school student.”\nUp until this point, the conversation was heartwarming.\nBut the atmosphere shifted with the next question.\n“So, do you have someone you like?”\nI was about to caution my sister.\n“Yes. I do.”\nBut I was utterly shocked by Han-gyeol’s immediate answer to my sister’s question.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Both Eun-ha and her older cousin were visibly taken aback by my firm response.\nGiven my original age of twenty-seven, I clearly had a few more years under my belt compared to Eun-ha’s older cousin. While it might seem an old-fashioned thought, the value of life’s experiences shouldn’t be downplayed.\n“You answered right away? You must really like her.”\n“Yes. I really do. Very much so.”\nEun-ha’s cousin appeared slightly taken aback.\nShe probably expected me to be embarrassed, but I wasn’t going to fall for that.\n“That was quite...unexpected. Your immediate response caught me off guard.”\n“Did it? One should always be honest with adults, right? Haha.”\n“So, what about our Eun-ha?”\n“He-hey! Why would you ask something like that?”\nEun-ha exclaimed, clearly flustered.\nPondering on how to respond, I came up with the wisest answer I could think of. Perhaps, the most apt response.\n“It might be just like what you’re thinking?”\n“Wow~ Dodging the question like a pro, huh? You have pretty good skills for a high school student.”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment. Just mimicking adults, you know. Haha.”\nWait, did that sound weird just now?\nAh, I really don’t understand the slang these young kids use these days.\n“Eun-ha, shouldn’t you avoid sly guys like him?”\n“He-hey! We’re just friends! Nothing more!”\nEun-ha’s cheeks were slightly flushed.\nSeeing her like that made me want to tease her a bit more.\n“Eun-ha, if you deny it too vehemently, even I might get hurt.”\n“No, no! It’s not that Han-gyeol is bad as a guy! It’s just... it’s...!”\n“Just what? I’ll wait, so tell me everything.”\nI stared directly into Eun-ha’s eyes, waiting for her to answer.\nEun-ha, still with a flushed face, whispered.\n“I just said it because I was embarrassed...”\n“Oh, so that means I’m not bad as a ‘guy’?”\n“No! That’s not what I meant! Why would you twist it like that?!”\n“Hehe, teasing Eun-ha is so much fun.”\n“Hey-!”\nEun-ha smacked my arm in frustration.\nBut she hit harder than I expected...\n“You’re quite skilled at teasing, aren’t you?”\n“Huh? Is that a compliment?”\n“Be honest. How many relationships have you been in?”\n“None, actually.”\nIn Lee Han-gyeol’s life, that was true.\n“You seem quite crafty for someone without experience.”\nBefore entering this novel’s world, I had only ever been in one relationship. My first relationship as an adult, and it wasn’t particularly fond in my memories. It was less about love and more of a relationship based on impulse and curiosity, ending in a bitter split. For the first time in my life, I made a girl cry, and it wasn’t a memory I cherished.\n“Eun-ha, do you have a boyfriend? or anyone you like?”\nI already knew the answer, but I wanted to ask. I was curious about how Eun-ha would react to the question.\n“I don’t. As for someone I like... I don’t think there’s anyone.”\nThe word ‘think’ probably meant she hadn’t completely sorted out her feelings for Kang Seo-ha.\nIt made sense; feelings cultivated over a long time wouldn’t fade in just a few months. Knowing this, I decided to be patient and wait.\nMy plan was to slowly and subtly take over her heart, to establish a place for myself without her even realizing it. After all, many times, we humans don’t truly understand our own emotions.\nSubsequently, our chat veered away from the topic of romance, and we lost ourselves in idle chatter over pizza and pasta.\nAs soon as we left the store, I grabbed Eun-ha’s bag with one hand.\nIt was much heavier than I expected.\n“Ah, you don’t have to. I can carry it.”\n“C’mon, you treated me the pizza. I can’t just leave it be. Let’s get going.”\nIt was a bit heavy, but I couldn’t show that now.\nIt was an opportunity to naturally showcase my manly side.\nDid she carry this all the way to the pizzeria without batting an eye?\n“Then, make sure to safely escort my Eun-ha home. See you tomorrow Eun-ah?”\n“Ah, yeah. Take care on your way home.”\n“Make sure to get home safely.”\n“Sure will. It was great seeing you. Let’s meet up again if we get the chance?”\n“Yes, I’ll see you next time.”\nOnce Eun-ha’s cousin left for the subway station, it was just the two of us.\n“I feel like my sister asked some tricky questions today... Sorry about that.”\n“Huh? Not at all. I actually found it fun. We should get going.”\n“Ah, yes. But should we split the load? Isn’t it heavy?”\n“Not at all. It’s super light.”\nIt was actually really heavy.\nHow much did she buy?\n“Well, I’ll leave it to you then, hehe.”\n“But you did buy a lot. How many books in total?”\n“Including the novel, six. Weren’t you going to buy some reference books too? Is it okay to leave empty-handed?”\n“I did think about it, but I was more in the mood to browse. So it’s fine.”\n“Oh, okay. I carefully chose what I bought today. Want me to show you?”\n“I’d appreciate that!”\nIf we used the same reference books, I could ask her questions pretending not to know the answers, right?\n“I’ll take pictures and send them to you when I get home. It’s inconvenient to pull them out now.”\n“Thanks. I saved some effort in choosing reference books thanks to you.”\n“It’s just a recommendation for a friend. What’s the big deal?”\nAs we walked, the word “friend” slightly tugged at my heart.\nHave we completely moved beyond being mere acquaintances?\nMan, I’m glad I decided to step out today.\n“Oh right, did you watch the movie you mentioned for this weekend? You said you’d watch it.”\n“Oh, that? Haven’t seen it yet. Planning to go tomorrow afternoon.”\n“Can you let me know if it’s good? If you like it, I might watch it too.”\nI really want to watch it with her.\nI really, really do.\nBut wouldn’t it be too obvious if I asked?\n“Hmm? Why don’t we just go watch it together?”\nI halted in my steps and stared intently at Eun-ha.\n“Is that okay?”\n“Hm? Why would it be a problem?”\n“I thought you preferred watching movies alone.”\n“Hey, it’s not always like that. I enjoy watching with others too.”\n“Great! So, what time shall we watch tomorrow? When does your tutoring session end?”\n“It ends around lunchtime. Want to catch the movie right after?”\nEverything was progressing so smoothly that it felt almost unsettling. It seemed like we were rapidly closing the distance between us faster than I had anticipated.\n“I’m free all day, so anytime is good. Let’s choose a time that suits you.”\n“Ha! Okay. I’ll book the tickets and let you know the time.”\n“Sounds good. What popcorn flavor do you want?”\n“You think you can guess again? Ready to take a shot?”\n“Caramel.”\nI answered without hesitation. Eun-ha looked up at me, her eyes wide with surprise.\n“Can you really read minds? That shocked me.”\n“I told you, didn’t I? Want another quiz?”\n“No. I was genuinely startled just now. Let’s stop.”\n“It’s easy to read your face. That’s all.”\n“What about now? What’s my expression?”\n“An angry one.”\n“That’s it. We’re done here.”\n“Ha! Why? Want another quiz?”\n“Nope!”\nThere seemed to be nothing I didn’t know about Eun-ha. I mean, from Eun-ha’s perspective, this might be a bit creepy, but I genuinely wanted to know everything about someone I cared about.\nWhat food she liked.\nHer favorite movies.\nThe life she had led.\nBut for now, I would be content with what I knew. I felt gratified being in the same time and space as the person I had only known through words. I was given a chance to live out the youth I had dreamt of. Today’s happiness seemed more significant than any distant future.\n“Well, my house is just up ahead. I can carry the rest.”\n“Okay, It’s heavy, so take it with care.”\n“It’s just up front. Thanks for helping, though. It was heavy, right?”\n“Not really. Take care.”\nI carefully handed over the bag of reference books to Eun-ha. Holding the bag close, Eun-ha smiled brightly and headed home. I watched Eun-ha enter her apartment complex before turning to go home myself.\n.\n.\n.\n“Why did you come back empty-handed after saying you’d buy reference books?”\n“Ah, I met a friend on the way. I’ll go buy them tomorrow.”\n“Goodness! You look so happy. What fun thing did you do today?”\n“Yes, I had a fantastic time today, Mother.”\nReturning to my room, I flopped down on my bed. Checking my phone, I saw a message from Eun-ha.\n[Here are the reference books I bought today!]\n[Oh, thanks.]\n[How about around 3 PM for the movie tomorrow?]\n[That’s fine with me. How much is it? I’ll send you the money.]\n[Don’t worry about it. You can buy the popcorn tomorrow, right?]\nI grinned as I read the messages from Eun-ha, rolling around in bed.\nLife couldn’t possibly be this sweet, could it? It felt like compensation for the hard times I had been through.\n[Okay. Let’s meet in front of the cinema by 2:40 PM tomorrow.]\n[Alright, see you tomorrow. Thanks for carrying the reference books today.]\nAfter our chat, I immediately opened my closet.\nI wonder what I should wear tomorrow.\nMaybe I should just go with something neat and casual.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

What on earth was I thinking? Surely, he must think I’m weird... What the heck... He doesn’t think it’s weird, right? He doesn’t think... it’s a date, does he?!”\nOf course, I could go to see a movie with Han-gyeol, but the timing felt awkward. Han-gyeol carried that heavy bag all the way to my home, and... above all... why am I so concerned about it?\nI rolled my feet in frustration, trying to think, but my thoughts just tangled into knots.\n“Maybe I’m just overthinking? It’s possible, right? Wait, wasn’t it Han-gyeol who asked if I’d seen the movie? ‘Out of courtesy...’ Yes! That’s it! He probably thought I asked out of courtesy. I should ask my brother about this..”\nI got up from my bed and headed straight to my brother’s room.\n“Bro!”\n“Argh! Geez! Knock first!”\n“Can it! Just stop watching p*rn. Anyway, how would a guy feel if a girl invited him to see a movie?”\n“He’d feel like he owns the world! Whoa! Why? Is there a friend of yours who wants to watch a movie with me?”\n“What nonsense are you talking about?! It could simply be a casual invitation to watch a movie. Why would he feel like he owns the world?!”\n“Come on, isn’t it obvious? She’s basically asking him out on a date!”\nAs soon as my brother finished speaking, I stormed back into my room.\n“Ughhh! I wish you would just drop dead!”\n“What kind of bullshit is this all of a sudden! You damn bitch!”\nWith a loud bang, I shut the door and threw myself onto my bed again. I tightly hugged the pillow on my bed and rolled around.\nA movie date with a guy I’ve known for barely a week?\nUgh… I have no idea how I’m going to face Han-gyeol tomorrow.\nBut the problem wasn’t that.\nFirst of all, I don’t like Han-gyeol that way... and I doubt Han-gyeol likes me... We aren’t exactly close friends yet, so I still feel I should be a bit cautious.\n“What should I wear?”\nIf I dress too casually, he might think I always dress like that, and that’s concerning.\nBut then, what if I dress up? Considering it’s in response to a movie date invitation, wouldn’t that be weird too?\nShould I just say I’m not feeling well? Ughhh! That’d be even strange!\n“Haaa... Why did I even do that?”\nIt felt like question marks were popping up over my head.\nWhy did I suddenly suggest going to the movie? Was the atmosphere even right for that?\n“Ugh, what atmosphere!”\nAs I repeatedly threw myself on and off the bed, a thought flashed across my mind.\nHan-gyeol mentioned he has someone he likes. Is it okay for him to watch a movie with me despite that?\nThat’s the weirdest part. Typically, if you want to impress someone you like, you’d keep your distance from other girls, right?\nYet, since the beginning of the semester, he had been hanging out only with me, studying with me at night, and even proposing dinner together. He didn’t hesitate to accept the movie invite either.\n“Hmm... Anyone could easily misunderstand this, couldn’t they?”\nI rubbed my chin, pondering for a moment.\nIn such situations, wouldn’t most girls wonder, ’Does he like me?’? Judging from our pizza conversation, he seems to get along well with other girls too. There was a certain smooth flow to his interactions that was intriguing.\n“Sigh... I don’t get it. I can’t read him at all!”\nI leaned back.\nI had thought the soft bed would catch me, but I ended up smacking my head into the wall with a loud thud.\n“Owwww... It hurts!”\nThe idea that Han-gyeol might like me was purely speculative.\nIf he did like me, he would have suggested the movie first, right? We’re close, but it’s within the boundaries of friendship. I’ve never really felt butterflies... or have I?\nThe image of Han-gyeol behind me, pulling out a book. The back of his hand, swiftly blocking a basketball flying towards me.\nAnd the gesture today, when he casually carried my things for me...\n“Ughhh! No! It’s only been a week, there’s no way!”\nI vigorously waved my hands in the air, dispelling the intrusive thoughts.\nUpon reflection, it seemed I was the only one overthinking things.\nFrom the beginning to the end, Han-gyeol was simply being kind.\nIt was not right to find motives in someone’s act of kindness.\n“So... what should I wear tomorrow?”\n****\nAfter tossing and turning, I eventually fell asleep last night.\nPerhaps due to the lack of proper sleep, I found myself dozing off even during the tutoring session.\n“Eun-ha, didn’t you sleep well last night?”\n“Huh? No?! Yes?! No, I’m fine!”\nHyun-joo unnie* stared at me with a peculiar look in her eyes.\nWith a hint of curiosity, she carefully closed the reference book in front of her.\n“Eun-ha, who was that kid I met yesterday?”\n“What?! All of a sudden? He is just a classmate. A friend!”\n“Aha~ A friend? Since when?”\n“Since third grade, we’ve been desk mates! That’s all!”\n“Oh, just desk mates? Just attending classes together?”\n“Well, as desk mates, we did become close and did various things together... Why?”\nThe corners of Hyun-joo unnie’s lips slightly curled up.\n“Do you, by any chance, like that friend?”\n“What?! No, not at all? Han-gyeol is just a friend! It’s only been a week since we met!”\n“Oh... Just a week and already calling each other friends?”\nUgh! I feel like I’ve fallen into my sister’s trap.\n“Eun-ha, what are you doing after tutoring today?”\n“Huh? Oh, there’s a movie I’ve been wanting to see, so I was planning to go.”\n“Oh my? Going alone again? Want me to come with?”\n“Uh... I have someone I’m planning to watch it with, so it’s a bit-”\n“-That someone isn’t the one I met yesterday, right? Who would go watch a movie with a friend they’ve only known for a week? my Eun-ha wouldn’t think of that, right?”\nFacing my sister’s confident gaze, I immediately backed down.\n“Ah-! It’s really not like that...”\n“But you are going to see a movie?”\n“Yes...”\nWhen I hesitated with my words, my sister immediately grabbed her stomach and burst into laughter.\n“Ahahaha! my Eun-ha is just too adorable!”\n“D-Don’t laugh! I’m telling you, I don’t have feelings for him!”\n“Mhm~ I believe you, Eun-ha~”\n“Ah- Sis!”\n“Ahahaha! I’m sorry! You’re just so cute that I can’t help it!”\n“Stop laughing! I really don’t like Han-gyeol that way!”\nSeriously… My sister’s teasing was so annoying.\nIn the end, our tutoring session that day came to an abrupt end, and we decided to meet up on a weekday.\nAfter a quick lunch, I changed into the outfit I had picked out the day before.\nIt was a typical attire, neither too dressed up nor too casual.\nI wore light blue jeans, and a white sweatshirt, and donned a subtle sky-blue padded jacket.\nNow, as I was about to slip on my Converse sneakers and head out, I ran into my brother.\nWith his tummy jutting out, my unsightly kin stared piercingly at me.\n“What are you looking at?”\n“You… where are you going?”\n“I’m off to see a movie.”\n“Why are you all dressed up to see a movie?”\nWith widened eyes, I promptly took off my shoes and grabbed hold of my brother’s head.\n“What?! What do you mean, ‘dressed up’? I always dress like this! What are you talking about all of a sudden?”\n“Huh? You’re always dressed like this? Aren’t you the one who always wears workout clothes and a black long padded jacket?”\n“That’s the image I give off?! No! I always dress like this!”\n“That... what was his name... Seo-ha, right? Are you meeting him?”\n“Why are you bringing up Seo-ha-!”\nWhen I shouted in frustration, my brother covered his ears and said,\n“That’s... because you dress like that only when you’re meeting him?”\n“Ughhhhh! I’m going to kill you! You jerk!”\n“What... what did you just call me?!”\nI immediately ran to my room and changed into my black long padded jacket. I put on my usual sneakers and hurriedly headed to the movie theater.\n“Ugh... because of that damn brother of mine...”\nI arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our agreed-upon time and looked for a place to sit. While searching for a seat, I spotted a guy who had a similar silhouette to Han-gyeol.\n“Huh?”\nHe was wearing a grey short-padded jacket, a navy sweatshirt, and wide pants. I wasn’t sure if it was Han-gyeol, so I observed him from a distance. However, since he was looking down at his phone, I couldn’t see his face clearly.\nThen, he started stretching his neck from side to side. As soon as he lifted his head, I recognized his face and cautiously approached him.\nWithout startling Han-gyeol, I slowly walked up and stood in front of him.\n“Huh? You’re early.”\nWhen I approached, Han-gyeol looked up, recognized me, and flashed a bright smile. Then, abruptly standing up, he still beaming, asked,\n“Shall we go buy popcorn first?”\nSeeing Han-gyeol act so nonchalantly, my mind started to wander.\nWhy does he always greet me with such a warm smile?\nIt’s making me involuntarily smile back.\nHe’s such an odd one.\n“Do you always smile like that at everyone?”\n“...”\n“...”\n“...”\nWait, did I just blurt that out loud?\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: \"Unnie\" (언니) is a term used by females to refer to an older female friend or sister in Korean.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Huh?”\nDid I approach too hastily?\nBut the suggestion to watch a movie came from Eun-ha.\nIt wasn’t just a simple query, nor did it seem like a joke given her expression.\nWith a puzzled look, I glanced down at Eun-ha, and she swiftly waved her hand in the empty air.\n“Sorry-! I was thinking to myself, and it just slipped out!”\nWhat made her voice out that thought?\nDid I do something off?\nWas it because I had confidently said I liked someone yesterday?\n“No, I don’t smile at everyone like this.”\nStill, it seemed right to give her an answer.\nVague, but enough to make her wonder.\n“Huh?”\nEun-ha looked visibly taken aback.\nI wanted to gaze at that surprised expression of hers for a while longer, but I too was feeling a tad embarrassed.\n“So, I’ll go buy the popcorn? Will you wait here?”\n“Huh...? Oh! Yeah! Go ahead!”\nI quickly got up from my seat and headed straight for the snack corner next to the ticket booth.\n“I’ll have a double combo, please. And for drinks, two cola.”\n“Sure. What flavor would you like for the popcorn?”\n“Caramel popcorn, please.”\n“Okay. Please wait on the right side.”\n“Thank you.”\nI waited for a moment as the popcorn order was being prepared.\nFrom a distance, I saw Eun-ha playing with her bangs as she waited for me.\nWhether she had bangs or not, she looked pretty. I wondered why she seemed so conscious of them.\n“She’s truly adorable.”\n“Your popcorn is ready~”\n“Ah! Yes! I’m sorry! Thank you!”\nI tried to carry both the popcorn and the cola at once, but it was too cumbersome due to their size.\nAs I momentarily pondered how to manage, Eun-ha timely approached from beside me.\n“I thought you might have trouble carrying it all by yourself.”\n“You came just in time. Can you hold the popcorn?”\n“Sure. Did you get the straw?”\n“Yeah. Let’s head up.”\nEun-ha and I took the escalator together and entered the theater. Once we sat in the seats that Eun-ha had reserved, she began to take off her long padded coat.\n“I’ll hold the popcorn for you. You’re taking off your long coat?”\n“Oh- Yes, thanks.”\nAs Eun-ha took off her coat, I got a clear view of her casual attire. Light blue jeans paired with a white crewneck tee, a rather common outfit, but it looked distinctively special on her. My heart fluttered as I watched her adjust her hair.\n“The theater is a bit warm, right?”\n“Huh? Oh- Right. Wearing this coat does make it feel warmer.”\nEun-ha settled into her seat beside me.\n“Did you see the trailer for this movie, Han-gyeol?”\n“Yes. It looked interesting.”\nThe film was one of those occasional heartwarming stories about a young man, worn out and beaten by reality, who returns to his hometown. Such a movie would probably resonate more with working adults than high school students. But then again, perhaps that was just a stereotype?\n“Han-gyeol, do you want to take turn in holding popcorn?”\n“Huh? No, it’s okay. If I feel uncomfortable, I’ll just playfully poke your arm and give it to you.”\n“Okay. Oh? It seems like the movie is about to start. Enjoy.”\n“Yeah.”\nGradually, the theater darkened.\nAs the movie officially began, I stared blankly at the screen. The opening scene, as expected, was of an employee getting scolded by his boss.\nThe sight of the worn-out protagonist dragging himself back to his apartment after a day full of scolding seemed all too familiar to me. I soon found myself engrossed in the film.\n-Tap\nWhile I was engrossed in the movie, Eun-ha gently tapped my arm with her finger. When I turned to look at her, she was staring intently at my face.\nFrom her surprised expression, it seemed she had accidentally touched me while trying to grab some popcorn.\nWith a bashful smile, Eun-ha picked up some popcorn and popped it into her mouth.\nAfter that, nothing particularly eventful happened.\nThere weren’t any youthful romantic events like hands touching while reaching for popcorn.\nThe film passed its midpoint and approached its climax, eventually coming to an end.\n“Shall we get up?”\n“Yeah.”\nEun-ha and I exited the theater together.\n“How was the movie? You seemed really engrossed.”\n“Did I? It was interesting. It felt like a genuine portrayal of adult life.”\n“Haha! What do you mean? If someone overheard you, they’d think you’ve lived an entire adult life.”\n“I just meant it felt that way~”\nWe accomplished today’s goal of watching a movie.\nWe could part ways now, but going home directly felt a bit disappointing. However, suggesting to do something else here seemed a bit daunting...\nWhile I was lost in thought, I noticed an arcade next to the cinema.\n“It feels a bit too soon to go home. Want to stop by the arcade?”\n“Huh? The arcade?!”\n“We might as well drop by before heading home.”\nTaking the lead, I walked ahead, and Eun-ha promptly followed behind.\nOf course, it made sense. Surprisingly, Eun-ha really liked arcades.\nShe had a backstory of frequently playing fighting games with her older brother when they were young, so it seemed she wouldn’t mind. The only concern was that Eun-ha was exceptionally good at them.\n“Do you like games, Han-gyeol?”\nEun-ha’s eyes began to sparkle.\n“Huh? Not particularly? I don’t play them that much.”\n“What do you usually do at home?”\n“Read novels, watch movies, read manhwa, or take naps.”\n“Really? Did I accidentally interrupt your rare personal time?”\n“No! Absolutely not!”\nI hastily corrected myself, worried that Eun-ha might misinterpret.\n“Listen! Well... I do enjoy my alone time, but it’s not like I particularly revel in solitude. I also want to watch movies with friends and play games together...”\nCome to think of it, I had many things I wanted to do.\nIt was just that I didn’t have friends or the time to do them.\n“Haha! Got it. Let’s head to the arcade. Han-gyeol, do you happen to play fighting games?”\nEun-ha looked up at me, her face lit up with a bright smile.\nI had tried the games Eun-ha liked before.\n“Bring it on.”\n“Huh? Are you good?”\n“Well? I know the basic combos?”\n“Really? Then I’ll also play for real.”\n“Bring it anytime.”\n“Okay!”\nI took a seat in front of the gaming console, and Eun-ha moved to the spot opposite me.\nBecause we sat with the game machine between us, she playfully leaned her head to the side to get a better view.\n“Which character do you pick, Han-gyeol?”\n“Me? The one who kicks. What about you?”\n“I just go with the high school girl character. Hehe.”\nThough she was smiling, there was a certain ease in her grin.\nWith the thought of giving her a taste of defeat, the game promptly started.\n-Tap-tap! Tap-tap!\n“Starting on the offense.”\nThere was no need to gauge Eun-ha’s skills.\nThinking that an all-out attack was the only way, I launched a combo. But just when I was certain my combo had landed perfectly... Eun-ha’s counter-move enveloped my character.\n“Huh?”\nRight after, she initiated a mid-air combo. Following that, my character never seemed to want to touch the ground again.\nWhat’s this? She’s even got the screw moving down perfectly.\nAs soon as my character got up, I threw a one-two punch, but it was effortlessly blocked by her counter. Watching my character spin helplessly in the air, its HP rapidly decreased.\nOf course... Eun-ha had spent her childhood years immersed in games. I shouldn’t have expected to win without serious preparation.\nFrom the second round, I too went on the offensive, with fire in my eyes.\nBeyond the arcade machine, the clattering sound of controllers signaled the intensity of our fierce battle.\n- Thunk...! Tap-tap! Tap-tap-tap!\nEun-ha was always ready with her counter, waiting for me to make a move.\nTo outsmart one’s opponent, a thorough understanding of them is essential. Determined not to face defeat a second time, I approached the match cautiously...\n“Phew...! That was good.”\nI took the second round.\nEun-ha, perhaps not pleased with the unfamiliar taste of defeat, leaned her head closer to the arcade machine.\n“Honestly. Han-gyeol’s really good.”\n“You’re not exactly holding back either, Eun-ha.”\n“Ugh... I’m going easy on you?”\n“You shouldn’t say that after losing, should you?”\nSubsequent to that, Eun-ha took the third round, while I claimed the fourth.\nBefore the final round, I took a deep breath and grasped the controller.\nBut then, Eun-ha’s combo suddenly changed.\nEun-ha’s previously cautious gameplay was nowhere to be found, replaced by unexpected techniques.\nNo matter how much I tried to throw punches afterward, Eun-ha aggressively pushed through. Seizing the moment I was taken aback, she finished me off with a wall combo.\n“Whew-! That was a close one. Han-gyeol, you’re good!”\n“Even if you say that to a loser, it feels like pity... And what’s with that sudden change in combo at the end?”\n“Ah-! It was still fun, wasn’t it? It felt great playing after such a long time.”\nDarn. I shouldn’t have suggested coming to the arcade.\n“Huh? Han-gyeol, look! There’s a claw machine. Wanna try?”\n“You seem really eager.”\n“Huh? Oh- did I get too excited? It just feels like I’m genuinely having fun after a long time.”\n“Haha! I didn’t mean it in a bad way. Should I try grabbing one for you?”\n“You sure about that?”\n“Is that a challenge?”\nEun-ha and I headed straight for the claw machine. Although I had faced defeat, seeing Eun-ha with a broad smile on her face somehow made it all feel worth it. Perhaps my being in this novel’s world was a gift from the gods, meant to let me experience this kind of youth.\n“Pick one. Which should I get for you?”\n“That blue turtle over there.”\n“Watch closely. I’ll show you how it’s done.”\nI promptly inserted a ticket into the machine.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 3 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "We were carefully measuring angles at the claw machine.\nConsidering the doll inside was likely worth around 12,000 won, another failure would make the whole endeavor seem futile. We’d already burned 10,000 won into this, after all. But now, with the claw hovering so close to the prize chute, it felt as though we were on the cusp of triumph.\n“Do you want to try the last turn, Eun-ha? I feel like I’m just not good at this.” Han-gyeol asked me.\n“Me? Me do it? I’ve never played the claw machine before!”\n“Who knows? There might be something like Beginners’ luck.”\n“Um... Okay! I’ll try it! But you’ll have to guide me, alright?”\n“Trust only in me!”\nI switched places with Han-gyeol and started moving the claw around.\n“Han-gyeol...how is it? Is it good?”\n“Uh, maybe a little to the left?”\n“Like, this way? Should I press the button now?”\n“Ah... Just a tiny bit to the right!”\n“Like this?! How about now?!”\n“Seems good!”\n“Alright, pressing it now...”\nAs I cautiously pressed the button, the claw began its slow descent. Its pincers perfectly wrapped around the doll, lifting it into the air for a suspenseful moment.\nThen, as if destined, the blue turtle doll slid right into the prize chute.\n“Wooooow! Han-gyeol, we did it!”\n“Wooowww! It worked on the first try when Eun-ha did it?! You’re a natural!”\n“Really?!”\nHan-gyeol bent down and retrieved the doll.\n“Here—Eun-ha, it’s a gift.”\n“Haha! Thanks! But I feel bad just taking it, so I’ll give you 5,000 won?”\n“Huh?! Um... No. I got it because I wanted to give it to you as a gift.”\nI couldn’t decline the kindness radiating from Han-gyeol’s genuine smile.\nBut still, it was a bit embarrassing, as this was the first time I had ever received a doll from a guy.\n“Ah... then I’ll gratefully accept it.”\nI hugged the doll a little tighter.\n“Alright. Let’s head home.”\nAs we made our way back home, with the blue turtle doll nestled in my arms, I pondered our unexpected events. I had thought we were just going to watch a movie and part ways, but we ended up hanging out at the arcade.\nAnd each time I recalled Han-gyeol’s expression after his defeat at a fighting game, a smile couldn’t help but bloom across my lips.\nHan-gyeol is a really interesting person, and surprisingly easy to talk to.\nI even felt a little guilty for initially being wary of him.\n“So, why are you so good at fighting games?”\n“Ah, I used to play a lot of games with my brother. Not so much recently, though”\n“Does that mean your brother is better than you?”\n“Not at all! My brother is worse than me. Why? You want to try playing against him?”\n“To be honest, I’d just like to win against anyone at this point.”\n“Haha! Then, uh—”\n“Hm?”\n“Nothing! We can just do it online!”\nFor a moment, I almost asked if he wanted to come over to my house to play against my brother.\nThe questions and conversation flowed naturally in front of Han-gyeol, brazen and unguarded.\nAt this point, we’d crossed the line from mere familiarity to something more...\nHan-gyeol seems to have a knack for making people feel incredibly comfortable around him.\nSo I should be a bit more careful.\nBold words could slip out without thinking.\n“Well, I’m not really good, I don’t really game that much. I only play occasionally when hanging out with friends.”\n“Is that so? We are in our senior year after all. Ugh—I don’t want to go to school tomorrow.”\n“Same here. I’d rather skip school, but what can we do?”\n“Have you ever actually skipped school, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’ve talked about doing it dozens of times, but never actually did. What about you, Eun-ha?”\n“Me neither.”\nWe were about halfway home.\nThis was the same spot where Han-gyeol and I had parted ways after eating chicken last time.\n“See you tomorrow then, Han-gyeol!”\n“Wow, time flew by as we talked. Make sure you get home safely, Eun-ha.”\n“Will do! See you tomorrow!”\n“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”\nAfter parting ways with Han-gyeol, I walked home alone.\nI hadn’t expected the day to be so enjoyable.\nImages of Han-gyeol watching the movie with an indifferent face flashed through my mind.\nWhen he smiles brightly, he’s like a puppy... but when he’s expressionless, perhaps he’s more like an eagle?\nI felt a little uneasy comparing a friend to animals, but that was my impression.\nHe’s like a child at times, but occasionally seems so mature.\nIf I had to describe Han-gyeol to someone, that’s how I’d explain him.\nWhen we were gaming with the console between us, his expressions were so entertaining.\nThe flustered look on his face was something I suspect I’ll think about often.\nNext time we go to a movie, we’ll definitely have to stop by the arcade again.\n“I’m home.”\n“Eun-ha, you’re back?”\n“Mom? I thought you were busy with work?”\n“Even the busiest people need at least one break a week.”\n“And Dad?”\n“Your dad will be busy until next week. He swung by earlier just to pick up some clothes.”\n“Ah... if he had called, I would have freed up some time for him...”\nAs expected, Dad wasn’t home.\nHe said he would be busy last weekend, but it seemed he was busy this weekend too.\nI wish he’d take better care of himself, but there were adult matters I, as a youngster, couldn’t understand.\n“What’s that doll in your hand?”\n“Oh, my friend and I watched a movie and played a claw machine afterward.”\n“Ah, I see. Make sure to wash your hands since you’ve been out.”\n“Will do.”\nI headed to my room to change clothes first. And after washing my hands in the bathroom, I went to the living room. My brother was sitting on the floor leaning against the sofa, munching on apple slices.\n“How’s school, Eun-ha? Must be tough being a senior?”\n“Huh? Not really? I’ve made friends, and I don’t find anything particularly challenging. Being a senior is a bit stressful, though.”\n“Mom, she’s not studying these days and is all into dating— Ouch!”\nI kicked my brother’s shoulder for making unnecessary comments.\n“Dating? Is there someone special?”\n“No, no, it’s not like that. I’ve just become fast friends with a guy, and my brother is blowing it out of proportion.”\n“Mom, she was even going to wear a short padded jacket instead of a long one today.”\n“Would you please stay out of it? So, who is this friend?”\nI briefly described Han-gyeol in response to my Mom’s question.\n“He seems mature for his age? He’s incredibly kind, considerate, and good at sports too. I don’t know why, but I felt very comfortable around him. Oh, I didn’t mention his name. It’s Lee Han-gyeol.”\nMom looked at me with a warm smile.\n“We went to see a movie today, and well, it’s a movie that could potentially be boring. I had intended to watch it alone, but Han-gyeol seemed really engrossed in it. I was a bit worried that I was subjecting him to a dull film, so I glanced over now and then, and he was thoroughly enjoying it. It’s like, I got a sense of his maturity? A mature vibe? His calmness was really palpable.”\n“Ah, that’s rare to find in people nowadays,” Mom said with a smile.\n“But sometimes he acts really childish too. Like, the doll I was holding? We got it from the claw machine together. He looked confident at first but struggled quite a bit. Hehe—so he spent 10000 won to get a 12000 won doll. After he got it, he bounced around joyfully, offering it to me. His expression was so happy, it made me happy too. He’s undeniably a young kid at heart.”\nI didn’t just talk about today’s events; I also mentioned what happened yesterday.\n“By the way, he bumped into Hyun-joo unni and me at the bookstore yesterday. We shared some pizza that she’d bought. Later, I picked up a bunch of heavy reference books, and he insisted on carrying them for me. He said it was the least he could do after ‘mooching off the pizza.’ He’s really considerate. I didn’t ask if he’s good at studying, but he knows a lot. We’re desk mates, so I saw him looking at computer components on his phone. Speaking of which, he also gave me a rundown of the computer components you were interested in, bro.”\nAs soon as I finished my story, my brother shot up from his seat.\n“What?! You’re saying this guy is that guy?!”\nMy brother seemed to be holding him in high regard, apparently because the computer parts Han-gyeol had recommended were quite helpful.\n“Whoa, calm down. What’s the big deal?”\n“Ah, Mom... That guy is legit. I was skeptical at first, but his recommendations were spot-on: cost-effective and well-balanced. Man, he’s really something. He’d make a great son-in-law—ow!”\nI kicked my brother in the thigh.\n“Ouch... Why did you hit me?”\n“I told you it’s not like that with Han-gyeol!”\n“What do you mean ‘it’s not like that’? You’ve only started the new semester, and you’re already all about this guy!”\n“Wh-What are you even talking about?!”\n“Don’t you recognize your own feelings? Mom, my sister here’s totally clueless—Ouch! Why are you hitting me, Mom?”\nMy brother rubbed the top of his head.\n“You ungrateful brat... What do you mean by calling your sister ‘clueless’?”\n“Why are you picking on me?!”\n“Ugh! You obviously haven’t learned your lesson.”\n“Mom, Eun-ha always talks about how she wants me dead!”\n“Quiet. My daughter doesn’t know such things.”\n“Man, this is so unfair! Don’t I count as your child too?!”\n“Quiet. You’re re-enrolling next semester, period.”\nWhile Mom and my brother were talking, I was still spaced out. I cautiously went back to my room and lay down on my bed. It wasn’t bedtime yet, but I could feel my face flushing.\nNow that I think about it, what did Han-gyeol mean by saying he doesn’t smile at everyone that way? Was he implying that we’re close friends? Imagining any deeper meaning might be my own speculation, but why can’t I get that comment out of my head?\n-Buzz!\nMy phone vibrated on the desk. There was a message from Han-gyeol.\n[You get home safe?]\n[Yeah. You?]\n[All good. See you at school tomorrow.]\n[Yeah, see you! Today was fun.]\n[Same here. Next time, let’s watch a movie of my choice.]\n[Deal.]\nAfter our brief text conversation, I looked down at the stuffed animal that Han-gyeol had given to me and gave its cheek a gentle pinch.\nA friendship just one week old...\nTwo moments of subtle excitement.\nOne unexpected encounter.\nOne planned meeting.\nWe’re just friends, right...?\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Yesterday was truly the happiest Sunday of my entire life.\nEun-ha and I watched a movie, played video games, and even took a stab at the claw machine.\nI wish every week could be like this from now on.\n“Today, we will have class president elections during Ethics class, so anyone who wants to run for class president should be prepared. That’s all.”\nAs soon as the homeroom teacher finished the announcements and left, I slumped down onto my desk.\nAh, this is so relaxing. To be able to lie down like this.\nIf this was a corporate setting, I would be bombarded with disapproving glances for this kind of posture.\nEun-ha, sitting beside me, asked as she stared at my slumped figure.\n“Aren’t you interested in running for class president, Han-gyeol?”\n“Nah. I have a principle of never taking roles like class president, group leader, or team leader wherever I go.”\n“Why? It’d look good on your school record, wouldn’t it?”\n“Mm— Not really? I’m planning on applying for university through regular admissions anyway.”\n“Ah, I see. Somehow, you seem like you’d make a good class president, though.”\n“I’d do it if I have to, but I don’t particularly want to. Haha.”\nTaking on any form of leadership was a hassle in itself.\nI already have enough things to worry about; I don’t need another added responsibility.\nWillpower is a limited resource; one has to use it efficiently and wisely.\nFor instance, most of my willpower these days was directed towards Eun-ha.\nI was also focused on studying, so I didn’t want to divert my willpower elsewhere.\n“How about you, Eun-ha? Are you interested in running for class president?”\n“Not really, I have no particular interest. I also don’t plan to enter university through special admissions based on school activities or anything like that.”\n“Are you aiming for regular admissions too?”\n“Hmm? I’m preparing, but I think I might go with an essay-based or subject-specific admissions. I’m studying for regular admissions just to meet the minimum grade requirements.”\n“You seem to have everything planned out.”\n“Eh, I wouldn’t say that. By the way, Han-gyeol, have you decided on what major you want?”\nAt Eun-ha’s question, I hesitated for a moment.\nIn the first place, I thought that living a normal life would be good, so there was no such thing as a dream.\nTo me, living a normal life meant having my own house, my own car, and secure retirement.\nBut achieving that ‘normal life’ turned out to be harder than I had thought.\nNo matter how hard I tried, my dreams only seemed to drift further away as I lived.\nWill this life be any different?\n“I’m thinking... maybe Business Administration, Accounting, or perhaps Real Estate Studies?”\n“Any particular reason?”\n“Not really? But I think those fields suit me, and I’ve always wanted to go into a major related to finance. How about you, Eun-ha?”\nI already knew Eun-ha’s dream.\nUnlike me, she had a dream that shone brightly.\nEun-ha seemed a bit shy as she said I should guess what it was.\n“Do your mind-reading, Han-gyeol. Guess it?”\nI had been guessing wrong a lot lately, so I thought to answer this one right today.\n“Hmm, Fashion and Clothing? It seems like a good fit for you, Eun-ha.”\n“Haha, wrong. But thanks for the flattering guess.”\n“Then how about Marketing? Advertising? You’d excel in those.”\n“Nope! But it’s a bit similar, though..”\nEun-ha’s dream was to create ‘beautiful videos.’\nThe format doesn’t matter. Just videos that someone, somewhere, would find beautiful.\nThat was Eun-ha’s dream.\n“I’m not sure. Can you give me a hint?”\n“Um- Should I just tell you?”\n“Yeah, tell me. I’m really curious.”\n“I want to make beautiful videos.”\n“Beautiful videos? What does that mean?”\n“Videos that are so captivating they make people stop in their tracks.”\nLike me, her dream wasn’t tied to a specific profession. It was about doing something she loved.\nEun-ha’s face lit up as she spoke passionately about her dream.\nSeeing her like that, I couldn’t help but smile.\n“That’s awesome. If anyone can do it, you can.”\n“Uh..?”\nMaybe it was the slightly embarrassing sincerity of my words, but Eun-ha hesitated for a moment before letting out a shy laugh.\nI didn’t have much more to say, given my lack of knowledge, but I was truly rooting for her.\n“Hehe, thanks.”\nSeeing Eun-ha smile made my heart flutter all over again.\nAs our brief conversation ended, the bell rang, signaling the start of the next class.\nNow that I had some information about university admissions, I was able to concentrate better during the lessons.\nThe more the class progressed, the more forgotten knowledge resurfaced in my mind.\nFor some reason, it wasn’t as draining as I had expected, maybe because I found joy in each piece of knowledge coming back to me.\nIt seemed like tasks weren’t as tough when you find them necessary. I sure didn’t feel this way during my actual high school years.\nAfter the first, second, third, and fourth periods were over, lunchtime finally arrived.\nBy now, it had become natural for Eun-ha and me to walk to the cafeteria together.\nWe stood side by side in line, waited our turn, grabbed our trays, and took our seats facing each other.\nAs I watched Eun-ha take small bites of her food, a smile spread across my face while I ate my own meal.\n“Eun-ha, here.”\nAs soon as we left the cafeteria, I pulled an orange-flavored candy from my pocket and handed it to her.\n“Ah, thanks. Do you always have candy in your pocket, Han-gyeol?”\n“Of course. They’re the never-drying orange-flavored candies, after all.”\n“Haha! What even is that? So, what kind of snacks do you like, Han-gyeol?”\n“Hmm? Orange-flavored candies.”\n“Anything else?”\n“Uh...Yōkan?”\n“Huh?”\nTruth be told, I used to eat Yōkan every day.\nNot in this life as Lee Han-gyeol, but in my original one, my go-to snacks were Yōkan and orange-flavored candies.\nWhen I was a child, my grandmother raised me, and Yōkan was the only snack she would allow me to have.\n“Wow...You’re the first person I’ve met who likes Yōkan.”\n“Hahaha! Yeah, it’s not common. Even in middle school, some kids teased me, saying it was strange.’”\n“Really? That must’ve been tough.”\n“Not at all. The kids I used to play with in elementary school vouched for me, saying I had been like this since the first grade.”\nAh, I got carried away.\nIn the life of Lee Han-gyeol, Yōkan seemed to be something he had never even glanced at.\n“Do you want to skip the classroom and go eat Yōkan at the canteen?”\n“Uh? I left my wallet in my bag.”\n“I’ll buy it for you! Let’s head to the canteen.”\n“I’ll happily accept your offer.”\n“Great!”\nWe didn’t return to the classroom but headed straight for the canteen.\nHowever, there was one thing I overlooked.\nThe canteen was incredibly crowded during lunchtime.\nNavigating through the chaotic canteen seemed like a questionable endeavor.\n“Eun-ha, it’s too crowded. Maybe next time— Huh?”\nJust as I was about to suggest we leave, Eun-ha rolled up her sleeves. She looked up at me with a determined expression and said.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll be right back!”\n“What?”\n“Wait here!”\nEun-ha gripped two thousand-won bills in her hand and plunged into the crowd.\n“Uh, isn’t that...kind of dangerous?”\nEun-ha was pushed back and forth and pushed out of the crowd several times.\nOnce, twice... Each time she emerged, her hair became increasingly disheveled.\nEventually, she stood before me, her hair a tangled mess, proudly holding a piece of Yōkan.\n“Here! It’s Yōkan, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha handed me the Yōkan without bothering to fix her hair. I burst into uncontrollable laughter.\n“Pfft— Hahahaha! Look at your hair, Eun-ha. It’s a total mess!”\n“Don’t laugh! This is the price you pay to go to the canteen during lunch.”\n“Hahahaha! Now I can’t just eat this, I’m too grateful!”\n“What?! No, you have to. Otherwise, there’s no point. Eat it right now.”\n“Hahaha! I’m sorry, it’s just too funny.”\n“Stop laughing already!”\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. You’re just too cute, Eun-ha. Oh, my stomach!”\nWatching me, Eun-ha also cracked a small smile.\n“Seriously, stop laughing!”\n“I’ll enjoy it, Eun-ha. Should I savor it?”\n“I’ll buy you another one next time, so just eat it.”\n“Okay. Buy me another one next time.”\n“Sure, I will.”\nI carefully unwrapped the gold foil from the Yōkan inside its box.\nBefore taking a big bite, I offered some to Eun-ha.\n“Do you want to try some?”\n“Is that okay? I’ve never had it before.”\n“You should try it now.”\n“Alright, just give me a little piece.”\nI cut a slice from the Yōkan on the foil and handed it to Eun-ha.\nWith a serious expression, Eun-ha examined the Yōkan before popping it into her mouth.\nI was curious about what she would say as she chewed.\n“Hmm...”\n“How is it?”\n“Hmmm...”\n“Don’t like it?”\n“Ummm...”\nEun-ha’s head tilted in contemplation.\nAnd then, gulp—she swallowed the Yōkan.\n“It’s not really to my taste.”\n“Haha! That’s fair.”\n“But it wasn’t bad.”\n“Want some more?”\n“No, no! You eat it!”\n“Hehe, I will.”\nI took a big bite of the Yōkan Eun-ha had bought.\nIt tasted even better because it had been a while since I had it last.\nEun-ha looked up at me, so I asked.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“Nothing. You’re just really enjoying it.”\n“Haha! What do you mean? Did you think I was pretending to like it?”\n“No, I was just surprised. Let’s head back to the classroom.”\n“Alright.”\nUpon arriving at the classroom, Eun-ha immediately pulled out a toothbrush and toothpaste from her locker.\n“Han-gyeol, aren’t you going to brush your teeth?”\n“Huh? I’ve got some Yōkan left. I was planning to finish it and then brush.”\n“Alright. But lunchtime is almost over, so don’t take too long.”\n“Got it.”\nAfter Eun-ha left the classroom, I nibbled on the remaining Yōkan.\n“It’s extra sweet today. I’m gonna rot my teeth.”\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Since Han-gyeol and I had decided to have night study and dinner together, we stayed after school.\nHowever, there was this awkward gap between the final bell of the 7th period and the time we’d set for dinner. And since I hadn’t signed up for any after-school classes, it was just Han-gyeol and me, alone in the empty classroom.\nJust the two of us. Completely alone.\nWhy wasn’t anyone else around?\nWhat should I even talk about?\nFighting games? Schoolwork? Class president elections?\nOr perhaps delve into movies or dramas we both enjoy watching?\nI found myself realizing how little I actually knew about Han-gyeol.\nEventually, I just glanced at him as he was studying next to me.\nI couldn’t help but notice that Han-gyeol had surprisingly long eyelashes for a guy, and his skin was somewhat pale...?\nThe way he sat upright while studying made him look like an honest person.\nSeeing such an honest person was rare these days, so I wondered—what kind of person does Han-gyeol like?\n‘..?’\nWho does Han-gyeol like?\nIn the first place, what kind of person would Han-gyeol be interested in?\nWould it be someone cute? Or perhaps someone very mature? Or someone cool?\nWhat would be their height, or body type?\nWhat kind of personality would he prefer?\nMaybe he likes something unexpectedly radical?\nAh, he was in the literary club, so maybe it’s a girl he knows from the club?\nOr maybe a girl from the same class?\nHowever, I had never seen him talk to any girl other than me. And he didn’t really converse with anyone else in the class either.\n-Thump-!\n“Hey-! You’re here! Han-gyeol! Let’s go play basketball!”\nA boy from our class burst into the room, holding a basketball and looking for Han-gyeol.\nThere were still about 30 minutes left until dinner, so I thought for sure Han-gyeol would go...\n“Ah, sorry. I’m in the middle of asking Eun-ha a question.”\n“Ah, are you studying? My bad. Then let’s play next time!”\n“Sure.”\nThe boy from our class immediately closed the classroom door and ran off to another class.\n“You didn’t go because of me?”\n“Hm? No, I really have a question to ask you.”\n“What is it?”\n“Um... I can’t solve this geometric progression problem. Can you help?”\nHan-gyeol pointed to a problem in his reference book.\nIt was a problem I recognized, maybe because we bought the same reference book.\n“Ah! Where are you stuck?”\n“I’ve found the first term, I just need to find the common ratio, but I don’t know where to look for the scale factor.”\n“Hmm... Since it’s a sector, you can use the radius to find it. You got that far?”\n“Yeah. The ultimate goal is to find the length of S2′s radius, but should I use the rectangles to find the scale factor?”\n“Um... That could be a way, but I solved it with the right triangle.”\n“Aha—so would this work?”\nHan-gyeol traced through the problem with focused eyes.\n“Ah! I think you can handle it on your own from here.”\n“Oh— it was easy. Guess I was overthinking by trying to solve it within a rectangle.”\nWith ease, Han-gyeol solved the problem.\n“Wow, you did it? I only gave you a hint.”\n“Your hint was spot-on, that’s why it worked. Thanks for the help.”\n“Come to think of it, the mock exams for March are the week after next... I’m worried.”\n“Don’t worry too much. It’s not like it’s the June or September mock exams.”\n“You seem pretty relaxed, Han-gyeol? I haven’t even properly studied social studies yet...”\nWe were in our third year of high school now, so we couldn’t just play around all the time.\nIf only Han-gyeol and I had been in the same class during the second year, it would have been more comfortable to hang out.\n“I’m the same.”\n“What?! Han-gyeol, did you just read my mind?”\n“Huh?”\n“Are you really a mind reader? That’s starting to freak me out!”\n“No... Considering it’s March, most people probably haven’t finished studying social studies yet, right?”\n“Ah—”\nSo that’s what it was about.\nAfter that, we naturally started studying together.\nHan-gyeol picked up things faster than I had expected.\nIt was quite interesting to see how smoothly he solved math problems.\nJust five minutes before dinner time, we closed our reference books.\n“We got a lot of studying done.”\n“Haha, we did, didn’t we? It’s more effective when we do it together.”\n“I didn’t disturb you, did I?”\n“Not at all! The questions you asked were actually challenging, so it was a good review for me.”\n“That’s a relief. Alright, let’s go have dinner.”\n“Sure.”\nWe packed up our bags and headed to the cafeteria.\n“Today’s dinner menu is—”\n“Ah-! They might be serving stir-fried beef brisket and bean sprouts?”\n“Wow— you memorized the menu?”\n“Ah—”\nWhat could one do when they felt like they have a very big appetite?\nI had been maintaining my weight, but I was eating a bit more recently.\nSo today, I decided to have a smaller portion.\n“Your serving seems smaller today?”\n“Ah, haha... I’ve been eating a bit more lately.”\n“No worries, you’re on the skinny side anyway, so it’s fine if you eat more.”\nHan-gyeol spoke without an ounce of hesitation.\nI felt a bit embarrassed, but it also felt nice.\n“Haha... thanks for saying that.”\n“That’s why you should eat more.”\nHan-gyeol generously picked up a portion of beef brisket with his chopsticks and placed it on my plate.\n“Just so you know, I haven’t used these chopsticks yet.”\n“Ah-! That’s not a problem, but then you won’t have much left to eat.”\n“Me? I don’t like beef.”\n“Don’t lie—! Who on earth doesn’t like beef?”\n“I’m serious. Enjoy it. I wouldn’t eat it even if you gave it back.”\nUgh... How could I refuse when he put it that way?\n“Alright... I’ll eat well, then...”\nIt was both embarrassing and touching to be cared for like this.\nJust as I was about to take a bite, I noticed Han-gyeol staring intently at me.\n“Why, why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Because it’s a pleasant sight?”\n“What?”\n“Just enjoy your meal.”\nHonestly, I couldn’t fathom what he found so ‘pleasant’ about it.\nHe was a guy filled with mysteries from head to toe.\n***\nAfter dinner, we were on our way home.\nHan-gyeol and I exchanged brief goodbyes at our usual parting spot.\n“See you tomorrow, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yep, take care. See you tomorrow...?”\n“Absolutely, you take care too, Han-gyeol.”\n“Will do~”\nAfter watching Han-gyeol walk in the opposite direction, I headed home. Although we were going our separate ways, my mouth was still enjoying the orange-flavored candy he had given me.\nI had bought him some Yōkan, a jelly-like snack he likes, but I still felt a little guilty for always mooching candy off him. Conveniently, there was a convenience store on my way, so I went in.\n“Welcome.”\n“Hello.”\nAfter a quick browse, I finally found the Yōkan section. Never did I think I’d be buying this in my lifetime.\nI grabbed three packages and took them to the counter.\n“That’ll be 3,600 won.”\n“I’ll pay with a card.”\n“Sure, insert the card here. You’re good to go.”\n“Thank you.”\nThe weather is still cold, so they won’t melt in my bag, right?\nAs soon as I arrived home and took off my shoes, a weird creature jumped at me.\n“Eun-ha! Oh, my special sister...”\n“Ahhhh! What the hell are you doing?!”\n“Would you help this poor brother of yours just once?”\n“What now? If it’s about allowance, I’m also on a tight budget, so no!”\n“It’s not about money!”\n“Then what is it?”\n“Will you listen?”\n“No.”\n“Why?! Don’t you want to help your one and only brother who is suffering?!”\nIt was not that I particularly minded, but...\nI looked down at my brother with a somewhat affirmative expression.\n“What is it?”\n“Ah! You remember Han-gyeol, right? The saint who helped me with my computer specs?”\n“Yeah, but what does this have to do with him?”\n“I tried assembling the computer myself and... well, I messed up.”\n“Then go to a computer store.”\n“I already took out all the components and botched the assembly a bit. I don’t have the guts to repackage it and take it to a store.”\n“You’re not expecting Han-gyeol to help, are you?! How can I ask him for such a favor when I have only known him for a week!”\n“Why not?! You’ve already gone to movies and bookstores together! A favor like this should be fine!”\n“Absolutely not! Do you think Han-gyeol is some kind of volunteer? He’s busy too! Just go to a computer store!”\n“I can’t! They might charge extra if I bring it in this condition!”\n“Then you should’ve gone in the first place! Han-gyeol is off-limits! He’s busy!”\n“Ahhhh! I’ll buy you pizza!”\nShould I really kill him?\n“Still no.”\n“Really, really no?”\n“No!”\n“Really, really, really no?”\n“No, I said!”\n“Well, it can’t be helped then...”\nFor some reason, he gave in easily. But then he naturally snatched my phone from my hand and moved the screen toward me.\n“Face ID is quite handy...”\n“Give it back!”\n“Now that it’s come to this, I’ll call Han-gyeol myself!”\nSuddenly, he started scrolling through my contacts.\n“You jerk—! Give it back!”\n“Aha! Helping a brother in need is common courtesy! Ah, Lee Han-gyeol. Hmm, what a noble name!”\n“Ahhhh! Don’t dial! Don’t dial—!”\nBut that damn brother of mine actually called Han-gyeol. That too on speaker.\n“Are you insane? What are you going to do if he actually picks up?”\n“Ahahaha! Let’s hear what Han-gyeol sounds like!”\n-Click!\nThe call connected and Han-gyeol’s voice came through.\n-Hello?\nI quickly kicked my godforsaken brother in the ribs.\n“Aaargh!”\nSnatching the phone from my fallen brother, I took over the call.\n“Uh, uh, I’m sorry! My brother was playing a prank... Ha ha...”\n“Help me out, Han-gyeol-urgh!”\nI continued the call while pressing down on my brother’s head.\n“Stay still! I said it’s not happening! Han-gyeol, you can hang up!”\n“Save my computer-urgh!”\n-Your computer?\n“Don’t worry about it! My brother’s just spouting nonsense!”\nBut it seemed Han-gyeol had heard the whole fiasco between me and my useless brother.\n-If it’s the weekend, I could help...\n“Yahoo! Han-gyeol! I’ll welcome you with open arms!”\n“No way! It’s your mess, so you clean it up.”\n“What! Han-gyeol offered to help!”\n“No! Han-gyeol’s busy!”\n-Haha! No worries, I’ll come over this weekend!\n-Click!\nHan-gyeol ended the call after saying that.\n“Really!”\n“Yahoo!”\n“Idiot! Drop dead! Just drop dead!”\n“Aaargh! Why?!”\n“Now I have to clean up because of you!”\nThis damn brother of mine... URGHH!!!\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Alright, it’s been a while since the semester started, so let’s go ahead and change seats.”\nMy ears perked up at the words of our homeroom teacher—words as shocking as a bolt from the blue.\nWeren’t we supposed to sit in numerical order for at least a month? Wasn’t that the unwritten rule?\nHad the teacher already memorized all our names and faces?\nWhat a competent teacher.\n“Come here and draw a number. Let’s start with number 1.”\nOne by one, the students from the front rows got up to draw a number.\nThey were drawing slips, cut from standard A4-size paper, from a box.\nI didn’t even wish for the slight chance of ending up as Eun-ha’s partner again.\nAll I hoped for was a seat somewhere close to her.\n“Next, numbers 11 to 20 come up.”\nThe students in front of me hurried out, leaving Eun-ha and me leaning against the classroom wall.\nIt would be nice if Eun-ha felt a little regretful about us being separated, but I guessed that was probably not the case yet?\nShe might also want to get to know some of the other girls better.\nI shouldn’t be too greedy.\nAs I was lost in thoughts, Eun-ha, who had been in front of me, reached her hand into the box.\nShe rummaged around for a bit and then pulled out a slip.\nI discreetly glanced at the number she’d drawn.\nNumber 17... Interesting.\nIt was the same seat as before.\nIn that case, please let me have 18.\nI prayed to all the gods.\nPlease, grant me number 18.\nI quickly snatched a piece of paper after a brief prayer and checked the number.\n“Lee Han-gyeol. Number 23.”\n“Ah! Teacher, can I please draw again?”\n“Life rarely gives you a second chance, you know.”\n“Are you saying that you want to teach that harsh reality to a developing sprout like us?”\n“You’ll be adults by next year, won’t you? Alright, moving on~”\nWith my options diminishing, my only choice was to find whoever drew number 18 and attempt to swap.\nI was carefully watching who would pick number 18 when—\n“Jeong Harim. Number 18.”\n“Oh—I get to sit next to Eun-ha.”\nIt was Jeong Harim who had triumphantly drawn the coveted number 18.\nHowever, there wasn’t a legitimate reason to switch with her.\nIf I did, rumors that I liked Eun-ha would surely spread...\nSigh... I have no choice. Let’s be grateful that her new partner isn’t a guy.\n“So, what’s your number, Han-gyeol?”\n“I got 23. How about Eun-ha?”\n“I got 17. We’re pretty far apart. Kind of a shame.”\nShe spoke with an air of nonchalance, so casual that I couldn’t even tease her about it.\nAm I just deluding myself?\n“Hi Eun-ha~”\n“Harim, you got 18? Awesome.”\n“Haha, yeah, that’s how it turned out. Please take good care of me.”\n“Mhm.”\nWhat happened to the Eun-ha who had just said it was a shame? Was she really this welcoming?\n“Ah, take your time moving. I need to gather my things too.”\n“It’s fine. I don’t have much in the drawer, so it won’t take long.”\n“Take care, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, yes~”\nI trudged over to seat number 23, lugging my textbooks.\nMy new seating partner was a guy who would constantly ask me to play basketball with him whenever he had a chance.\nHis name was Jang Yujin.\n“Oh! Han-gyeol, you’re my partner. Now I won’t be bored.”\n“You’re not disappointed it’s not a pretty girl?”\n“...Having prejudices is not good in today’s world. And also I don’t discriminate—”\n“Teacher, I’d like to request a seat change due to the potential for inappropriate same-sex interactions.”\nI immediately reported the situation to the teacher, but he ignored me.\n“Really? If that’s what you think, why don’t we meet up sometime~”\n“That’s not possible—”\n“Dude, chill! I’m joking!”\n“Don’t come near me. Just so you know, I’m completely straight.”\n“Same here.”\n“No need to hide it. I’m not judging.”\n“I said it was a joke—!”\nI ended up with a rather noisy partner.\n“Alright, let’s start the lesson.”\nAfter everyone switched seats, the teacher immediately resumed teaching.\nAt that, everyone collectively sighed.\nOf course, I did too.\n“You guys... You’re all third-year students now. Why did you think you’d have time to play? Open your books now.”\nThat line never changed, no matter how many years passed.\nAnd so, the lesson began, and I started taking diligent notes.\nWithout Eun-ha beside me, I felt an overwhelming sense of emptiness.\nThe moment the boring class ended, my eyes instantly darted to where Eun-ha was sitting.\nBut Jeong Harim was already deep in conversation with her, so I didn’t bother going over.\nSticking too closely to her since the start of the semester might make us the subject of idle chatter.\nI also thought it’d be good for Eun-ha to build some friendships with the other girls in the class.\n“Hey Han-gyeol, you got anything to eat?”\n“You’re not giving me anything, so why ask?”\n“Man, you’re harsh. We’ve even played basketball together.”\n“Doesn’t feel like we have been very close, though?”\n“What if I were a pretty girl?”\n“I’d be sprinting to the convenience store to fetch some snacks right now.”\n“Ahahahahaha! That’s hilarious. Hey—up for some basketball after school?”\n“Nope.”\n“Wow, just gonna shut me down like that?”\n“We’ve got P.E. first period tomorrow. Let’s play then.”\n“Fair enough.”\nFor the first time since the semester began, I wasn’t seated next to Eun-ha. While it felt somewhat empty, part of me believed it was for the best.\nWe do have a study session tonight, so there’ll be time for us then.\nWith that thought, I seized the opportunity and approached Eun-ha’s desk as soon as the bell rang.\n“Eun-ha, shall we study—”\n“Ah! Han-gyeol. You know Harim, right?”\n“Ah, yeah, I do. Hi.”\n“Hi.”\nMy intuition was sending warning signals.\nSomething about this girl was sketchy.\nMy life experience was sending me strong warning signs.\nI didn’t think she was a bad person, but I got the sense she was reading more into the dynamic between Eun-ha and me than she should.\n“Harim mentioned she wants to study with us on Thursday during the evening study session. Is that okay?”\n“Uh? Yeah, shouldn’t be a problem.”\n“Wow, thanks. I had a feeling you’d agree.”\n“By the way, Jeong Harim, what are you going to do for dinner?”\n“Oh, don’t worry. A friend is leaving campus early, so I’ll use his student ID to grab something to eat.”\nSigh... looks like I can’t have any alone time with Eun-ha today.\nThe three of us ended up studying together, and the dynamic somehow made me more self-conscious. I hesitated even to offer Eun-ha the orange-flavored candy I had in my pocket.\n“Hmm... English is still tricky, isn’t it?”\n“What is it? Hmm... yeah, it’s difficult. I’m not too sure about the grammar myself. Han-gyeol, do you get this problem?”\nShe couldn’t possibly think that I’d understand something that had stumped her. Still, I leaned on my experience of drafting countless work emails in English.\nEun-ha and Jeong Harim handed me a long passage.\n“Hmm... this is a question on syntax, right? Harim, you chose option 2; why did you pick that one?”\n“Well... it looked like an adjective to me, so I just went with it.”\n“Didn’t you read all the way to 5?”\n“I was short on time, so I just answered what I thought was right and moved on.”\nNot exactly a commendable study strategy...\n“Alright, let’s leave 2 for now and look at 3, 4, and 5.”\n“Uh...”\nJeong Harim seemed to ponder for a moment before her pencil halted at 4.\n“Wait, so the answer is 4? Then why isn’t it 2?”\n“Option 2 also utilizes inversion but places an adjective in the predicate position.”\n“Oh...! Yeah, you’re right! I hadn’t thought of that because option 1 also had inversion. Thanks.”\n“No problem.”\nAfter returning the workbook to Harim, I refocused on my own work. To be honest, I was still trying to figure out the “correct” way to navigate this new social dynamic.\nI couldn’t be overly friendly with Harim like I was with Eun-ha, but at the same time, I didn’t want Eun-ha to perceive me as indifferent.\nHowever, being seen as kind to just anyone would be a headache in its own right.\nIf I was going to subtly make a move, I needed to make Eun-ha feel that she was treated a little differently by me compared to others...\nThis is hard.\nIn the first place, I was not exactly a pro when it came to human relationships.\nEven more so in the current situation where I was longing for a special connection called a romantic relationship.\nIf I was just unconditionally nice, the other person might feel burdened and pull away.\nAnd if I kept a moderate distance, I failed to express my feelings to the other person.\nTo become lovers, a balanced blend of patience and courage was necessary.\nIf only there were a definitive answer, like a test.\nI had heard that push-and-pull dynamics were necessary in a relationship, but I didn’t expect it to be this complicated.\n“By the way, you guys are always together, huh?”\nJeong Harim suddenly spat out a pointless question.\n“Yep! We were study buddies before I got paired with Harim, so we’ve gotten quite close.”\n“Hmm— really? You guys aren’t dating or anything? I have a pretty good sixth sense, you know.”\nHarim propped up her chin and looked at Eun-ha and me in turn.\n“Haha—! No, not like that. Han-gyeol and I are just friends.”\nEun-ha waved her hands in the air as if to dispel any misconception.\n“Is Han-gyeol not denying it either?”\nI somewhat disliked the cunning in Harim’s query.\nIt seemed obvious that she sensed something between Eun-ha and me.\nLooking back at my actions up to now, they had all been ambiguous.\nBut I realized I had never properly taken the lead with Eun-ha.\nAll I had done was ambiguously state that “I’ve liked someone for a long time.”\nBeyond that, I had only shown actions that could be seen as goodwill toward her.\n“Do I really need to deny it?”\n“Huh?”\n“If Eun-ha were my girlfriend, I’d undoubtedly be over the moon.”\nIt might be a bit forward, but today, just for today, I’ll take the reins.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Eun-ha, what’s on your mind? You seem pretty serious.”\n“Ah! No, it’s nothing! Haha! Let’s go!”\nIt was break time during night study sessions. I was returning to the classroom with Harim after a quick restroom trip.\n“Is it because of what Han-gyeol said earlier? About how he’d be happy if you were his girlfriend?”\n“Wh-what?! No, no! He was just joking, you know.”\n“Was he, though? It did sound like a teasing joke, but there seemed to be a kernel of truth in it.”\n“Haha... You’re probably reading into it too much. Han-gyeol has had feelings for someone else for quite a while.”\nI awkwardly smiled as I said this to Harim. But she looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.\n“When did you two discuss this?”\n“Ah-! I shouldn’t have said that...”\nI immediately regretted blurting out something I shouldn’t have.\n“Don’t worry about it. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it. But I’ve never seen Han-gyeol talk with another girl.”\n“I’ve also found that strange... It’s possible she’s from another grade or even another school.”\n“Hmm... What do you think of Han-gyeol? He’s pretty great, isn’t he?”\n“Um... Han-gyeol? He seems mature, and it seems like he’s good at both studying and sports...”\nI felt a little embarrassed saying this. More than anything, I admired his kindness and wanted to learn from it.\n“Hehe..”\n“However, it’s not just me who thinks so! Don’t you agree, Harim?”\n“Totally~? He’s pretty rare. More articulate and thoughtful than most guys around.”\n“Exactly! I think Han-gyeol is really considerate too, even if he doesn’t realize it himself.”\n“What’s this~? Giving him immediate approval? You can’t, you just can’t. What if you fall head-over-heels for him?”\n“Ah... Han-gyeol has someone he likes, so there’s that.”\n“Does having someone he likes mean you can’t like him?”\n“Huh?”\nAt Harim’s question, I stopped in my tracks.\nWhy did her question feel so heavy?\n“Emotions aren’t always rational, you know.”\n“Hmm... true. But if I know someone likes someone else, I think I should keep myself from liking them.”\nI said this because I didn’t want my feelings to complicate matters for anyone emotionally.\n“Hmm... well, if that’s how you feel, then let’s leave it at that. Come on, let’s go.”\n“Haha! Right. It’s the last session, let’s focus and then go home.”\nArm in arm, Harim and I headed back to the classroom.\nHan-gyeol was studying even during break time.\nThe diligent look of him studying... seemed a bit impressive.\nHe was furrowing his brow, perhaps solving a difficult problem.\nHan-gyeol really was the kind of person who naturally caught one’s eye.\n“Eun-ha? Aren’t you going in?”\n“No, let’s go in.”\nIt was true that my focus was a little off because it was the last study session of the night.\nBut for some reason, I couldn’t concentrate on my studies.\nIt felt like I was just reading words.\nBefore I knew it, I was tapping my pencil against my notebook.\nI needed to collect my thoughts.\nWhy am I like this right now?\nI took a moment to sort out my feelings honestly.\nFirst question: Am I like this because of Han-gyeol?\nThe answer was ‘yes.’\nSecond question: Why am I feeling this way specifically because of Han-gyeol?\nUpon reflection, no clear answer came to mind.\nIt was a difficult question to answer, this one about Han-gyeol.\nI decided to consider all possible scenarios.\nDo I have feelings for Han-gyeol?\nHmm... I don’t think it’s that kind of feeling.\nHowever, it was clear that we had a comfortable and familiar relationship.\nSo, what about the notion that Han-gyeol might like me?\nThat was wrong from the get-go. Han-gyeol already said he had liked someone for a long time.\nHowever, the person he spent the most time with at school was none other than me.\nIf I had to pick one, I think I was curious about how Han-gyeol views me.\nTo be more specific, why did he choose to spend so much time with me, despite having feelings for someone else?\nHmm—having sorted my thoughts, it became clear.\nI had been harboring questions about my relationship with Han-gyeol.\nWas it okay to be this close with a guy who was already interested in another girl?\nWhy was I even questioning this?\nIt did feel odd to be close with a guy who was already into someone else.\nMany say that men and women couldn’t be just friends, but with Han-gyeol, it felt like we were genuinely just... friends.\nWe hadn’t known each other for very long, but if Han-gyeol were to suddenly disappear, would I feel a bit hurt as a friend?\nBut if I, as a person of the opposite gender, harbor such hurt feelings, that could be misconstrued by others.\nFriends...\nYes, we were friends, but he was a male friend with feelings for someone else.\nSo the real question became: Would I feel hurt if my male friend suddenly became romantically involved with someone else and drifted away from me?\nYes, that was the conclusion I had come to.\nI shouldn’t let my petty hurt feelings interfere with a friend’s love life.\nI should probably refrain from doing things like going to the movies together like we used to.\nAh—but there’s one problem...\n****\nAfter the night study session wrapped up, I began my walk home.\nHarim took the bus home from the bus stop in front of the school, leaving just Han-gyeol and me walking home together.\n“Eun-ha, about coming to your place the day after tomorrow.”\n“Ah, that? Don’t worry, everything’s all set. Just come whenever it’s convenient for you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Is there anything to prepare? I’m just coming over to fix your brother’s computer.”\n“Well, I tidied up the house a bit because it was messy.”\n“I usually don’t care about stuff like that.”\n“People usually do, though.”\nI had to admit, Han-gyeol didn’t seem like the type to fuss over such things.\n“What time should I come? When your tutoring ends?”\n“That’s okay with me. And my brother said he’d buy lunch, so don’t bother eating beforehand.”\n“Alright.”\nA boy was coming to my house...\nIt was not exactly the same, but even my childhood friend Seo-ha hadn’t been over since middle school.\nIn essence, this was the first time I was bringing a boy home since hitting puberty.\nThis was all because of my useless brother.\nI swear, I’m going to kick his butt when I get home.\n“Will your parents be okay with it?”\n“Ah, my parents are usually busy, even on weekends.”\n“Really? So, it’s just you and your brother?”\n“Seems like it.”\n“And when your brother was in the military?”\n“I was mostly alone.”\n“Must have been boring.”\n“It’s fine. I’m used to it.”\n“If you’re ever bored, call me. I’ll keep you entertained.”\n“Hahaha! Sure!”\n“I mean it! I’ll come running anytime.”\n“Thanks~”\nThat’s Han-gyeol for you. Always kind, always considerate, always ready to lighten the mood.\n“Ah, we’re almost there.”\nWe had arrived at the spot where we always part ways.\n“Ah, let me walk you home. It’s already past ten.”\n“Uh...?! No, that’s okay! It’s not that dangerous here.”\n“True, but it’s better to be cautious in this world. But if it makes you uncomfortable?”\n“No, not at all! I just don’t want you to go out of your way. I’d feel guilty.”\n“Not at all. If you were a guy and I were a girl, you would do the same, right?”\n“In that case…could you walk me to the main road at least?”\n“Sure. Let’s go.”\nIt was late…so his concern was understandable.\nIt’s natural…right?\nI started to feel awkward the moment I became self-conscious.\nI should strike up some conversation.\n“By the way, where did you learn all that?”\n“Huh? Learn what?”\n“You know, assembling computers! Most people don’t know how to do that.”\n“I’m the type who prefers learning by doing, so I picked it up along the way.”\n“You seem to know a lot of interesting things, Han-gyeol.”\n“Really? Isn’t that normal?”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol leaned in, his face flushed.\nI instinctively stepped back.\n“Ah!”\nBut I tripped over a rock behind me and started to fall backward.\nAt this rate, a comical tumble was guaranteed.\n“Hey, be careful.”\nBut Han-gyeol grabbed my arm, pulling me forward just as I was about to fall backward. My face ended up pressed against his chest. And I quickly pulled away.\n“Ahaha...! Thanks!”\n“No problem. It seems like I startled you.”\n“Well, we’re almost there, so I’ll go on my own from here!”\n“Huh? We’re not there yet.”\n“See you tomorrow!”\nI ran off as fast as I could.\nStrange things kept happening when I was around Han-gyeol.\nWas it because we spent so much time together?\nI thought I had figured out the reason for my concerns during the evening study session...\nBut I still couldn’t deny it.\nI didn’t know what I was feeling.\nWere my emotions toward Han-gyeol really just comfort and friendliness?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Even as a high schooler, I couldn’t just go empty-handed to a friend’s house for the first time. A fruit basket seemed overly formal, and a box of energy drinks felt more suited for a hospital visit, so neither option appealed to me.\nIn the end, I bought a roll cake from a local bakery and made my way to Eun-ha’s house.\nAfter walking for a while, I reached my destination.\nThe moment I pressed the intercom button and stepped into the elevator, I was hit with an overwhelming sense of nervousness. Finally, the elevator doors slid open, revealing the hallway that led to Eun-ha’s front door.\n-Ding-dong-\nAs soon as I pressed the doorbell, the front door opened immediately. There stood Eun-ha, dressed in casual clothes to greet me.\nShe wasn’t wearing pajamas, but she looked comfortable.\n“You’re here!”\n“Yes.”\n“Come on in!”\nFollowing Eun-ha’s lead, I walked inside. At the shoe rack, I encountered the curious gazes of Eun-ha’s family members.\nFrom the right, there was Eun-ha’s cousin sister whom I’d met before, then Eun-ha’s mother, and finally Eun-ha’s older brother.\nI was aware that Eun-ha’s father was often busy, but it seemed he wasn’t around even on the weekend.\n“A-ah, hello. I’m Lee Han-gyeol, a classmate of Eun-ha.”\nI bowed politely, but all I got back were curious glances. It was slightly awkward...\n“Aunt, that’s the guy.”\n“Hyun-joo, your voice is too loud. Han-gyeol, was it? Come on in. I’ve heard a lot about you from Eun-ha.”\n“Eun-ha talked about me at home?”\n“Oh my—of course. We’ve heard so much we’re practically tired of it—”\n“Mom! Stop embarrassing me! Everyone, go back to your rooms!”\n“Ah, what? I was just telling the truth. Are you embarrassed?”\n“Aunt, she’s probably embarrassed. After all, a guy from the same class is visiting.”\n“Sis, you too?! Han-gyeol! don’t take them seriously! They’re just teasing!”\n“Yeah, yeah.”\nFeeling more at ease thanks to Eun-ha’s mother’s warm reception, I took off my shoes and proceeded further into the house.\n“Ah, I brought this. It felt odd coming empty-handed.”\n“Oh my, how thoughtful of you. I’ll bring the roll cake to your room.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Did you come to set up Eunwoo’s computer today?”\n“Yes, that’s right.”\nSo, Eun-ha’s brother’s name was Eunwoo. Come to think of it, this was my first time seeing him in person.\nOur eyes naturally met.\n“Ah, can I call you Eunwoo Hyung?”\nIt seemed like he somewhat resembled Eun-ha. Would it be impolite to say siblings look alike?\n“No, I should be the one calling you Han-gyeol Hyung. I apologize for welcoming such an esteemed guest to this humble place.”\nHe is an interesting character.\n“No need for that. Speak casually. Then where should we go?”\n“I’ll take you to my room... this way.”\n“Haha...! Sure.”\nHe was a bit hard to read in some ways.\n“Then Eun-ha, I’ll be assembling the computer in Eunwoo Hyung’s room.”\n“Ah... okay! Let’s go eat something delicious later, on Hyung’s dime.”\n“Sure, sure. See you later?”\nJust as I was about to part ways with Eun-ha, her cousin Hyun-joo suddenly interrupted.\n“What—? That won’t work. You’ve come all this way, you should also take a look at Eun-ha’s room-”\n“-Ah, Sis! I’ll be in my room with you, so if he needs anything, he can call me. And Han-gyeol if my brother does anything weird, scream! I’ll come running right away!”\nIt seems Eun-ha was embarrassed to show her room, so she pushed her sister Hyun-joo into her own room.\n-Thud.\nAs the door closed, I entered the room across from Eun-ha’s, Eunwoo’s room.\n“So, this is it.”\n“Did you keep all the original boxes?”\n“Indeed. The box is essential, whether for after-sales service or resale.”\n“Haha. Seriously, feel free to speak casually. It’s more uncomfortable for me if you use formal language.”\n“Hahaha! Well then, so be it! If you need anything, just say it! I’m sorry for asking you for such a favor!”\n“No worries. I enjoy assembling computers, and I couldn’t say no to Eun-ha’s request.”\n“Oh? So my sister is quite popular at school, huh?”\n“She’s kind and gentle, don’t you think?”\nAt that, Eunwoo slightly shook his head.\n“Are we even talking about the same person?”\n“Is she not like that at home?”\n“Don’t even get me started. She’s the exact opposite of kind and—”\n-Bang!\nSuddenly, The door burst open.\n“Shin Eunwoo...!”\n“Jeez! You scared me! What the heck?!”\nEun-ha was standing there, with her face flushed.\n“Don’t make me say it twice. If you say anything unnecessary to Han-gyeol, I’ll make sure you regret it.”\n“Look at this. You call her kind and gentle? She doesn’t even call her own older brother ‘big brother’, such a rude—”\n“Han-gyeol! Let’s just go! We don’t need to help people like this!”\n“No! It’s fine if you want to leave, but Han-gyeol can’t!”\nEun-ha and Eunwoo each grabbed one of my arms and pulled me toward them.\nHm—Being the object of the Shin family’s affection wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But thanks to the arrival of Hyun-joo, the sibling conflict was immediately resolved.\n“Goodness, what a commotion. Eun-ha, why don’t you stick around in this room to supervise Eunwoo?”\n“Han-gyeol, is that okay? If it bothers you because there are too many people, you can say no.”\n“Huh? Not really? I don’t mind if there are a lot of people. It’s comforting to have Eun-ha nearby.”\n“R-really?”\nWith that, Eun-ha quietly took a seat across from me.\n“Should I stick around to watch, too?”\nEun-ha’s cousin, Hyun-joo, also sat down next to Eun-ha.\nJust before I began assembling the computer in earnest, the door swung open, and Eun-ha’s mother entered the room.\n“Here, have some roll cake to keep your energy up while you work.”\n“Ah, Thank you, I appreciate it.”\n“Of course~”\nTo my surprise, Eun-ha’s mother also settled into a chair.\n“Um, why are you sitting down, Mom?”\n“Huh? I’m just curious about the boy my daughter brought.”\n“It’s getting a bit cramped with five people in the room, isn’t it?”\n“Then why not do it in the living room?”\n“Should we? Let’s move to the living room.”\nIt was a bit awkward, but I picked up the computer components and headed for the living room.\nBefore starting the assembly, I took stock of what had been done so far. At a glance, the CPU and cooler seemed to be assembled, but the cooler was installed quite haphazardly.\nThe intake and exhaust were also reversed, and the attachments didn’t look secure. I dismantled it to reassemble it properly.\n“Why are you taking that off?”\n“Ah! The intake and exhaust are reversed, and the cooler is a bit wobbly, so I’m going to reassemble it.”\nAs I answered Eun-ha’s question, I detached the cooler and restarted the assembly from scratch.\nOnce I got started, the tension disappeared, and I carried on assembling the computer while chatting casually.\nBut at some point, everyone went silent and was intently watching my hands.\n“It got so quiet all of a sudden that it startled me.”\nEun-ha’s cheerful mother broke the silence with a bright smile.\n“Oh my! Right? Why is everyone so quiet?”\n“We were all just amazed at how skillful you are. We must’ve been watching you without realizing it.”\n“Yeah, where did you learn to do this?”\n“Wow! Should I call you Han-gyeol Hyung after all?”\n“Eunwoo, you’re a computer science major and you can’t even assemble a computer?”\nAt Eun-ha’s question, I paused and looked at Eunwoo.\n“Stop looking at me like that. It’s embarrassing.”\n“Just because you are in computer science doesn’t mean you would be adept at hardware.”\nThen I said to Eunwoo.\n“Hahaha! You sure know your stuff!”\n“Haha... Is this much wire management good enough?”\n“Yes! I’m more than satisfied.”\n“Then let’s check if the computer works.”\nI picked up the assembled computer and headed back to Eunwoo’s room. After connecting the power and the monitor, it started up perfectly.\nFrom there, we completed the basic settings and wrapped things up.\n“Whew—It’s done. Call me if you have any more problems.”\n“Ha...Han-gyeol Hyung...!”\nEunwoo suddenly hugged me.\n“What are you doing to Han-gyeol—! Get off!”\n“Thank you..! Let’s go eat! I’ll treat you.”\n“Back off!”\nEun-ha pulled Eunwoo away from me and stood in front of me.\n“Eunwoo, you’re noisy. Just give me your card! I’ll go eat with Han-gyeol!”\n“What?! It’s only courteous for me to treat him myself!”\n“When did you become so considerate!”\nIf I had to choose, I would prefer to have a meal with just Eun-ha.\n“Why don’t we eat at home?”\n“Huh?”\n“You can have dessert outside with Eun-ha, but let’s eat at home first.”\n“Ah! In that case, I’ll gladly accept.”\n“Great~”\nDeciding to eat a home-cooked meal from Eun-ha’s mom, the rest of us headed to the living room.\nThe four of us debated what to do and ultimately decided on playing a game. I naturally thought of the fighting game I had played with Eun-ha before.\n“Eunwoo Hyung, how about a round of a fighting game?”\n“Oh—Is that a challenge? I accept.”\nI asked Eunwoo if he wanted to play a game, but Eun-ha, sitting on the sofa, chuckled softly and said,\n“Look at the second-in-command trying to take charge.”\n“What did you say?! Come down here. Let me show you what ‘My real powers and skills’ is.”\n“Forget it. Play with Han-gyeol. He’s good too.”\n“Come down while I’m still asking nicely. Don’t trip over your own arrogance.”\n“Forget it. Han-gyeol, my brother always uses the same combo. Just know that and you’re good!”\n“Hey! Stop giving tips! Are you taking his side because he’s your friend?!”\n“Taking Han-gyeol’s side is a hundred, no a thousand times better than taking yours!”\nEun-ha and Eunwoo seemed quite close. Eventually, the sibling showdown began, and I sat on the sofa, watching the game with Hyun-joo noona.\nJust then, Hyun-joo noona gently tapped my arm and cautiously asked,\n“What do you think? Isn’t Eun-ha so cute?”\n“She really is. She has a different aura at home. Very cute.”\n“Hehe... Eun-ha! Han-gyeol says you’re cute!”\n“Wha—?!”\nEun-ha’s body twitched as she looked visibly surprised.\n“He says you’re very cute~”\nWas Eun-ha blushing because she was embarrassed by my comment, or was it because she was starting to have some feelings for me?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“How’s it? Does it suit your taste?”\n“Yes, it’s really delicious! I’m glad I didn’t eat outside.”\n“Hehe... You sure have a way with words, don’t you?”\n“I mean it, though!”\n“Alright then, eat as much as you want. Let me know if you need more.”\n“Thank you.”\nWe were all seated at one dining table, enjoying our meal together.\nHan-gyeol neatly picked from the various dishes. Watching him eat, my mom wore a contented expression. I was silently grateful to Han-gyeol for making her smile.\nIntermittent small talk continued until the meal came to an end.\nI got up to clean up, and Han-gyeol also immediately rose from his seat.\n“I’ll help with the cleaning.”\n“No, you don’t have to. You’re our guest, so just relax in the living room.”\n“Ah, but that would make me feel more uncomfortable, Aunty. I’ll help Eun-ha clean up.”\n“Really? Then I’ll leave it to you two. Work together and make it quick.”\nMy mom didn’t object either.\n“Alright then, I’ll count on you.”\n“Anytime.”\nTogether, Han-gyeol and I moved the empty dishes to the sink.\nI was just about to put on rubber gloves to start washing when I saw Han-gyeol still right beside me.\n“You can relax in the living room now.”\n“No, I’m comfortable here beside you. Let me help.”\n“Uh...?! O-okay. How about I scrub and you rinse?”\n“Sure. Can you move a bit to the side?”\nI lathered up the dishes and passed them to Han-gyeol, who rinsed off the suds with water.\nIt was just dishwashing, but for some reason, it made my heart flutter a bit.\nI stole a glance at Han-gyeol’s face, but he seemed nonchalant, simply focused on rinsing the dishes.\n“You two look just like a married couple.”\nMy older brother, who was sipping water behind us, made another unnecessary comment.\n“What—What are you talking about?! Stop spouting nonsense and go back to the living room!”\n“Why are you getting so worked up? I just made a casual observation.”\n“Hahaha! You two do seem very close. As an only child, it makes me a bit jealous.”\nIt was an embarrassingly straightforward comment, but Han-gyeol didn’t seem to mind.\nHe silently turned his attention back to the sink and continued rinsing the dishes.\n“Um... sorry about my brother’s stupid comments.”\n“Don’t worry about it. I can see why he might get that impression.”\n“What?!”\nI couldn’t help but raise my voice at Han-gyeol’s nonchalant response.\n“Hahaha! I’m just joking.”\n“Seriously, Han-gyeol, you’re not bothered by such comments?”\n“Well, they’re a bit embarrassing, but it’s not like I hate hearing them.”\n“Wha—?!”\n“It’s another joke~”\n“Hey!”\n“Haha! Sorry, just hand me the next dish.”\nTurned out, Han-gyeol was quite the prankster.\nAfter we finished doing the dishes, we enjoyed some fruit in the living room.\nMom, however, seemed intensely curious about Han-gyeol.\n“Do you usually help out a lot around the house?”\n“I wouldn’t say ‘a lot.’ But if I see something that needs to be done, I’ll give it a hand.”\n“Is that so~? Would you like to be our son-in-law?”\n“Would you accept me?”\n“Of course~ You’re more than welcome.”\nMom and Han-gyeol got along like peas in a pod.\nThe embarrassment, as always, was mine to bear.\n“Ah, Mom! Han-gyeol, stop it!”\n“Sorry, it’s just that your reactions are so entertaining, Eun-ha!”\nBlushing furiously, I lightly thumped Han-gyeol’s arm.\n“Aha-ha! Ouch! I was wrong, sorry Eun-ha!”\n“Hahaha! You two are so entertaining!”\nEver since Han-gyeol arrived at our house, laughter filled the air. And thus began a more serious conversation. Mom shot another question at Han-gyeol.\n“So, you and Eun-ha are buddies, huh? You didn’t know each other before, right?”\n“No, I knew what she looked like from passing her in the hall. We only became classmates this year.”\n“Eun-ha, did you know him?”\n“Um? To be honest, I really didn’t know Han-gyeol. This is the first time I even noticed his face, and we’re in the same grade.”\nAs I candidly answered, my brother chimed in.\n“Wow, that’s harsh. Han-gyeol knew you, but you didn’t know him? How ruthless.”\n“It’s not untrue, but... this isn’t your cue to jump in, is it?”\n“Han-gyeol, didn’t I tell you? My sister isn’t exactly the epitome of kindness and warmth-- urgh!”\n“Quiet! Stay put!”\nI threw a pillow at my brother’s face. Finally, he calmed down a bit.\n“It’s pretty rare for a boy and girl to be just friends. You two must really get along?”\nHyun-joo, my cousin sister, looked at Han-gyeol and spoke. If there was anyone I should be more cautious around than my older brother, it was her.\n“I was surprised too. Eun-ha and I aren’t old friends, but we clicked instantly.”\n“Exactly, right? In such cases, you either really get along or one side is trying super hard to fit in.”\n“I guess so? Eun-ha is considerate, so we both make adjustments for each other.”\n“See? If you’re making adjustments for each other, you might as well be a couple.”\n“Ah, sis! Han-gyeol and I are not like that!”\n“Hahaha! Sorry, sorry!”\n“Seriously...! Enough with that talk!”\nAfter banning that line of discussion, we spent time engaging in light conversation. Most of the questions were about Han-gyeol, but no one tried to link him and me romantically any further.\nTime passed, and eventually, Han-gyeol started to prepare for his departure.\n“Well, it’s about time I head home. Thank you for the wonderful meal.”\n“Sure, come again? I’ll prepare something different next time.”\n“Haha, your words are more than enough. I’ll take my leave now.”\n“Alright.”\nAfter grabbing his bag, Han-gyeol stood up and I followed suit.\n“I’ll walk you out a little.”\n“No need, it’s still cold outside. Stay in.”\n“I insist. I’ll at least walk you to the entrance.”\n“Alright, then. I’ll be going now. See you next time.”\nHan-gyeol laced up his shoes and bowed courteously.\n“Bye, come back and visit.”\nWith that final exchange, Han-gyeol and I left the house. We were waiting for the elevator when our eyes met. Startled, I instantly looked away.\n“What’s the matter? Are you avoiding my gaze? Are you mad because I teased you?”\n“No—?! Not at all.”\nWhy did I do that?\n“Today was really fun.”\n“Wasn’t it a bit chaotic? You might have found it tiring.”\n“What? I actually liked the hustle and bustle. I’ll visit again.”\n“Next time, come when it’s quieter, then. It’s usually too loud.”\nWait, did that sound weird?\nA feeling of unease crept in, and when I looked up, Han-gyeol seemed utterly flustered.\n“Look, Eun-ha. No matter how close we are, I can’t just come over to an empty house with just a girl in it.”\n“That’s not what I meant! I was just saying it’s nice when it’s quiet!”\n“Haha! Don’t worry, I know it was just a slip of the tongue. Everyone often makes those.”\n“Haha... I should be more careful.”\n“Was it a Freudian slip?”\n“No! Ah? The elevator’s here!”\n“Then, I’ll be going. Go back inside, Eun-ha.”\n“Ah? I’ll walk you to the entrance.”\nI offered to see him off, but he shook his head, refusing.\n“It’s still too cold outside. You might catch a cold, just go inside.”\n“I’m really fine...”\n“Do you want to spend more time with me?”\n“You—!”\n“Haha! Just kidding. See you at school next week?”\n“Uh, yeah... Take care? Text me when you get home.”\n“Sure. Take care.”\nAfter exchanging handshakes, the elevator door closed. When I returned home, everyone was still talking about Han-gyeol.\n“Ah? You’re back early? What happened?”\n“Han-gyeol said it was cold outside and told me to go back in.”\n“Look at this! Now it’s a hundred percent confirmed, you know?!”\n“Really... But isn’t that something a kind-hearted person would say? Some people are just considerate.”\n“Ah! I’m going crazy! Eun-ha is exactly like you, aunt! Anyone can see Han-gyeol likes her!”\nI quickly interjected into their conversation.\n“What are you guys talking about?!”\n“Eun-ha, Han-gyeol definitely likes you. Didn’t you feel anything?”\n“No, no! Han-gyeol said he’s liked someone for a long time!”\n“But what if that’s you? You didn’t feel anything at all?”\nAt Hyun-joo’s question, a flurry of memories flashed through my mind. But all of those could have been coincidences; it was hard to conclude that Han-gyeol liked me based on that. However, a recent comment from Han-gyeol lingered in my ears.\nWhy am I thinking about him saying he’d be really happy if I were his girlfriend?\nIt could’ve been a joke... but my heart fluttered strangely.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It was the break time during the third period.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol. Tomorrow is White Day*. Got anyone special to give a gift to?”\n“If I don’t have anyone, should I give it to you?”\n“Ah, there you go again. That was just a joke, you know?”\n“Then maybe don’t cross this line on my desk if you’re so concerned.”\n“And what will happen if I do? Will you be mine?”\n“I’ll cut your throat in one slice.”\n“How harsh.”\nAs I was pulling out a textbook from my drawer, the conversation shifted.\nEver since Yujin replaced Eun-ha as my desk partner, we have been chatting quite often.\nHe was not noisy, and he had a kind of relaxed aura, so we quickly became friends.\n“Han-gyeol, who the heck invented White Day?”\n“Probably some company. Why are you asking all of a sudden?”\n“Just wondering if there might be a girl whom I would give a chocolate.”\n“Join the club, man. I’m in the same boat as you.”\n“Huh? You are not giving Eun-ha anything?”\n“That would be weird. We’re not dating or anything.”\nI knew tomorrow was White Day, but giving Eun-ha chocolates was out of the question. I was just thinking of giving her the usual orange-flavored candy instead.\n“Isn’t it common for male and female friends to exchange gifts anyway?”\n“That’s true only if the friendship is laced with flirtation.”\nHuh? Was I flirting?\nWell, from my current perspective, it might be a one-sided flirtation.\nShould I give something? Eun-ha might be secretly hoping for it too.\nBut that would essentially be like confessing. What should I do?\nThe more I thought about it, the more I found myself entangled in a web of mixed feelings.\nI had tried to think of a way to give it without any awkwardness, but it seemed impossible.\n“Great, now because of you, I’m really torn about whether to give it or not.”\n“So what? Just give it. Melt some chocolate, make it into a heart shape, and give it.”\n“Why on earth would I do that? That’s like taking a derivative only to integrate it afterward..”\n“What’s with that extremely cold and logical reasoning?”\n“Just because I put effort into it doesn’t mean it’s filled with sincerity.”\n“But Han-gyeol, think about it. The constant generated through differentiation and integration could symbolize ‘love.’ Like my heart for you.”\nYujin made a heart shape with his hands as he said this.\nAt that, I couldn’t help but furrow my brow.\n“Integration constants aren’t always positive, you know.”\n“Man, you have zero romance in you.”\n“Saying a guy who was talking about love with Integration constant, huh...”\n“It’s poetic, bastard. Romantic.”\nI subtly cast a glance towards Eun-ha, who seemed blissfully unaware that tomorrow was White Day. Should I give her something?\nIt felt presumptuous, but the least I could do was offer a token of friendship.\n“I’ll go ahead and give her something.”\n“To who? Ah, Shin Eun-ha?”\n“I can’t help but care because of you.”\n“So you rationalize it like that?”\n“Think whatever you want.”\n“Hey, let’s play one basketball game after school today.”\n“Do you think you’re some basketball star? You lose every time.”\n“Actually, I’ve been playing against kids from other classes. And yeah, still losing.”\n“Ah, fine then. It feels bad to refuse anymore.”\n“Lovely!”\nEun-ha would be fine if she was with Jeong Harim.\n***\nEver since the classroom seating arrangement changed, my conversations with Eun-ha during breaks had become less frequent.\nIt made sense given the dynamics between us, but it still left me feeling somewhat empty.\nOnce class ended, I often found myself stealing glances at her.\nIt was a selfish emotion, but it was my emotion nonetheless.\n“Eun-ha.”\nAfter all the afternoon classes were over, I promptly headed over to Eun-ha’s seat.\n“Hm? Han-gyeol.”\n“I won’t be around during after-school hours today; I’ve got a basketball game planned with kids from another class.”\n“Ah, okay. What about dinner?”\n“I’ll be back by dinner time. You’ll be with Jeong Harim, right?”\nMy gaze shifted towards Jeong Harim.\n“How could I leave pretty Eun-ha all alone?”\n“Thanks for that. See you later, then?”\n“Sure. If I’m not in the classroom, just give me a call.”\n“Okay.”\nAfter speaking with Eun-ha, I immediately headed to the basketball court with Yujin.\n“Did you really have to tell Shin Eun-ha?”\n“We’re having dinner together, so I told her.”\n“Anyone would think you’re a couple.”\n“How does it look to you? Do we look like a couple?”\n“You were pretty close before, but lately, not so much. So it’s a bit unclear.”\nYujin, who was holding a basketball, shared his observation.\nBased on what Yujin was saying, it probably hadn’t been the hot topic among other kids.\n“So, which class are we up against today?”\n“Class 8. We’re betting sodas and bread.”\n“Class 8? Are there good players?”\n“It should be a balanced match, but keep an eye out for Kang Seo-ha.”\nAt those words, my steps toward the basketball court halted.\n“Kang Seo-ha?”\n“Yes, Kang Seo-ha from Class 8.”\nI never thought I’d cross paths with him like this...\nWith that final exchange with Yujin, we entered the basketball court.\nAs Yujin had said, Kang Seo-ha was standing on the other side.\nAnd on one side of the basketball court was Kang Seo-ha’s girlfriend, ‘Dolphin.’\n“Han-gyeol, you look pretty fired up. Or is it just me?”\n“If we lose, we die. If we lose, we die. If we lose, we die. If we lose, we die.”\n“Ease up, man. Why so intense all of a sudden?”\n“Quiet. Just give me the ball.”\nDribbling to the center of the basketball court, I faced Kang Seo-ha.\n“So you’re the one Yujin was talking about? Word around is that we’d have been down 3-0 if you were playing.”\n“They’re just exaggerating. Let’s just not get hurt, okay?”\n“Sure, sure.”\nWe warmed up, twisting and turning, then started the game. We agreed to play for two quarters of ten minutes each, so I didn’t think it’d be too exhausting.\nHowever, as the second quarter unfolded, I found myself soaked in sweat with the score tied at 25-25.\n“Ugh, I’m dying. How many minutes are left?”\n“No clue, dude. Maybe around three minutes?”\n“What?! That much time left? I feel like I’m going to pass out.”\n“If you have the energy to speak, run, you idiot... Geez, I’m wiped. Why is Kang Seo-ha playing so hard today?”\n“Maybe because his girlfriend is watching?”\n“Damn it! Couples are the problem!”\nCould it be just because of that? Why did it seem like he was gunning for me? Was it because I had been hanging around Eun-ha, or was I just imagining things?\n“Phew... If you rejected her, just leave it at that. Why are you rambling?”\n“What nonsense are you spouting? Have you lost it?”\nI didn’t want to lose at basketball or anything else. But just as we were deep into the game, two unexpected guests entered the court: Eun-ha and Jeong Harim, both in sneakers, clearly there to watch us play.\nThey exchanged a quick greeting with Dolphin, who was already sitting in the corner of the court.\n“Of all the times, Eun-ha shows up now...”\nAnd it had to be when I was playing against Kang Seo-ha, someone she still had complicated feelings for. The sight of him excelling on the court could send her emotions spiraling.\n“Does Eun-ha’s arrival give you some sort of power-up?”\n“It certainly fuels my competitive drive.”\n“What? Look out, here he comes!”\nKang Seo-ha was barreling toward us, dribbling the ball at an alarming speed. I felt a surge of determination to stop him, even though physically I was near my limit.\nThump-thump!\nI went head-to-head with Kang Seo-ha, arms flailing in an attempt to block him. Suddenly, he made a quick cut to my right. I hesitated, knowing that reaching out would result in a foul.\nHe jumped and released the ball. It went in. My stomach churned as I watched him celebrate with high-fives from his Class 8 teammates.\nI gathered everyone and said, “Let me take a three-pointer, just once.”\n“Why should we give it to you?”\n“Exactly. Why you? Can you even block properly?”\n“We don’t have much time; why not play it safe?”\n“Right. Han-gyeol is good at offense but sucks at defense. Can’t block for shit.”\nThese little brats...\n“If we lose, I’ll buy all the sodas.”\nUpon hearing that, my teammates immediately changed their tune.\n“Alright, we trust you. Go for it.”\nLook at them switch up their stance. How much could a beverage cost anyway?\n“Yo, block it!”\nThe Class 8 players took their defensive stances. We advanced, the ball making its rounds among us.\nThen, the ball was in my hands. Thanks to Eugene’s excellent defense on Kang Seo-ha, I took the shot.\n-Swish!\nThe ball sailed through the net. As much as I wanted to throw my arms up in celebration, I played it cool and headed back to our side of the court.\n“Wow, Han Gyeol, you’re quite the player, huh?”\n“Heh, what are you talking about? You were just criticizing my defense a minute ago.”\n“Time’s running out; let’s play it safe.”\n“Sure, let’s do that.”\n“Ha, look at Han-gyeol showing off. You must be feeling pretty good about yourself.”\nWell, why wouldn’t I? I felt I made a pretty cool shot. Plus, Eun-ha saw it.\n“So, is this the final play?”\n“If we block this, we win; if they score, we lose. There’s not much time left.”\n“Agh, I suck at defense.”\n“Just don’t foul. And you—take the center! Make sure you block Kang Seo-ha this time.”\nOnce again, I found myself confronting Kang Seo-ha. He dribbled swiftly toward me.\nBut wait... wasn’t he a little too fast? Without slowing down, he leaped and threw the ball to the right.\n“Damn.”\nBut Kang Seo-ha couldn’t beat his own speed, tumbling forward and colliding with me. As we both lay crumpled and hurting on the floor, Eun-ha ran toward us from outside the court.\nIf she still had lingering feelings for Kang Seo-ha, it would make sense for her to rush to him—\n“Han-gyeol!”\nInstead, Eun-ha ran past Kang Seo-ha and sat down in front of me, asking with a deeply concerned expression.\n“Are you badly hurt?! Let me see!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: White Day in South Korea is when guys give back gifts to the girls who gave them stuff on Valentine’s Day; it’s on March 14th.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Han-gyeol headed to the basketball court with a boy from our class.\nEver since we were no longer seat partners, the time we spent together had greatly diminished.\nEven if I came to school early in the morning, we couldn’t have much of a conversation since our seats were far apart.\nAfter class, we were together until dinnertime, but today he went to play basketball.\n“Eun-ha, if you’re sad about it, you should’ve just told him not to go.”\n“What?! No! That’s not it! Absolutely not!”\n“Hmm~ You seemed to stare at Han-gyeol’s back for quite a long time though~”\n“You’re mistaken. Let’s study, study! We have mock exams next week!”\n“If Eun-ha says so~”\nI suddenly recalled something my sister Hyun-joo said over the weekend, and it made me feel more embarrassed.\nAlmost fleeing, I picked up my study book and started reading the text from top to bottom.\nBut I really didn’t know why everyone kept saying things like that.\nHad I been too attached to Han-gyeol?\nWas that why?\n“Hey, Harim.”\n“Yeah. What’s up?”\n“I’m just curious, so I’m asking…”\n“Okay, go ahead.”\n“Why did you say what you just said?”\n“Huh? What are you talking about?”\n“You assumed I would be sad about Han-gyeol going to play basketball. Why did you think that?”\n“Ah- Did it hurt your feelings? If so, I apologize. I’m sorry.”\nWhen Harim offered a sincere apology, I quickly waved my hands in dismissal.\n“Not at all! I wasn’t hurt or anything. I’m just purely curious why you thought that.”\n“Ah- Honestly?”\n“Yes, honestly.”\n“Can I really be honest?”\n“Yes, you can be really honest.”\nTaking my earnest urging seriously, Harim looked into my eyes and said,\n“Well... because it seems like you like Han-gyeol?”\n“Wha-?! Why?! In what way?! It’s not like anything happened between Han-gyeol and me!”\n“Ahh- I’m not concluding that. But you seem interested in Han-gyeol.”\n“Can I ask what gave you that impression?”\n“It seems like you laugh especially bright when you’re with Han-gyeol?”\n“…Huh?”\nFrom the look on Harim’s face, it was clear she wasn’t joking.\nI blinked a few times before waving my hands in the air, trying to explain.\n“Well, that’s because Han-gyeol is considerate and also funny!”\n“I guess Han-gyeol does seem that way, though I haven’t observed him much.”\n“Right! You think so too, Harim? Han-gyeol just has this easygoing nature!”\n“But even when Han-gyeol isn’t doing anything, you seem slightly happy. Why’s that?”\n“Ah-! That’s also because Han-gyeol is easygoing. Being around him feels comforting, you know?! Like he’s always considerate? Uh-uh! Like I’m being respected!”\n“Hmm- So you’re saying, ultimately, Han-gyeol is an extremely comforting person to you?”\n“Exactly! Just like you said, Harim!”\n“Isn’t that what love feels like?”\n“...?!”\nI couldn’t argue with Harim, only flailing my hands around.\n“Ah-ah! So, what I mean is-”\n“Eun-ha, can you keep your hands still?”\n“Harim, you’re misunderstanding. I haven’t even known Han-gyeol for that long.”\n“Who says there’s a set amount of time to fall for someone?”\n“But you still need a certain amount of time, right?!”\n“You do know the saying ‘love at first sight,’ don’t you?”\n“Ugh… But I didn’t fall for Han-gyeol at first sight or anything!”\n“Then maybe you fell for him at fifth sight.”\n“Wh-?!”\nI like Han-gyeol? I like Han-gyeol?\nFor a moment, my face flushed bright red.\n“Well, these are just my thoughts, and I’m not defining your feelings for you~ If you say that’s not true, then that’s not true.”\n“Uh… Han-gyeol and I are just friends, friends. It’s probably because I spent a lot of time with him at the beginning of the semester that it looked that way.”\n“Right. If you say so, then that’s that. Ah- I don’t want to study anymore. Want to go out and clear our heads?”\n“Sure. Let’s take a short walk.”\nI was also struggling to focus on my studies.\nI had planned to just take a lap around the track and head back to the classroom when I noticed some kids playing basketball on the court.\nThinking Han-gyeol might be among them, my eyes naturally drifted in that direction, but I quickly looked away.\nI didn’t want to give Harim the wrong idea.\nHowever, it seemed Harim noticed where my gaze had landed.\n“Do you want to stop by and watch Han-gyeol play basketball for a moment?”\n“Uh?! We could go straight back to class, you know? Seriously!”\n“We can just watch for a little bit. Let’s stay for a short while.”\n“Alright.”\nI redirected my steps, which were originally heading back to the classroom, towards the basketball court.\nWith each step, Han-gyeol came more clearly into my line of sight.\nBut then my eyes met with Jung Yeon’s, who was sitting in a corner of the court.\n“Huh? Eun-ha!”\n“Jung Yeon. What are you doing here?”\n“I came to watch Seo-ha play basketball.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nAs I scanned the basketball court again, I noticed Seo-ha was there as well.\nSeo-ha was dribbling the ball and happened to be facing off with Han-gyeol.\nI felt an odd emotion but couldn’t identify what it was.\n“Hi, Harim.”\n“Hey, Jung Yeon. So Seo-ha is your boyfriend?”\n“Yes. Oh, it looks like your class is playing against ours?”\n“Yep. Who’s winning?”\n“It’s a tie. Some kid from your class is good at basketball. We greeted each other once, what was his name?”\nCome to think of it, I had run into Jung Yeon and Seo-ha at the library at the beginning of the semester. That was when they met Han-gyeol.\n“Ah- His name is Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah, right. That’s the guy who was with you at the time, right?”\n“Uh…?! Yeah. That’s right. He’s a friend from my class.”\nJung Yeon seemed unfazed, but for some reason, I felt uneasy.\nI was planning to watch just for a little bit before heading back to my seat.\n“Eun-ha, since we’re here, shall we stay until the end?”\n“Um... no, let’s go back in a bit. Haha.”\n“Ah, okay then.”\nAfter that, we watched the basketball game in silence.\nEven while dripping with sweat, Han-gyeol energetically released the ball from his hands.\nFrom quite a distance, he effortlessly sunk the ball into the hoop—\n-Swish.\nAlthough his teammates cheered him on and lifted him into the air, all Han-gyeol did was laugh softly.\nHe had every reason to be ecstatic, but he maintained a faint smile.\n“Han-gyeol seems happy but he’s pretending not to be. Haha.”\n“Hm?”\n“Ah- it’s nothing!”\nIt was then that my eyes returned to the basketball court.\nSeo-ha had leaped high, and Han-gyeol was standing right in front of him.\n“Huh?”\nFor a moment, I closed my eyes tightly in surprise, but the sound of their bodies colliding made me snap them open immediately.\nThe moment I saw Han-gyeol fall to the ground, I found myself blurting out—\n“Han-gyeol!”\nI instinctively stepped onto the basketball court and rushed over to him, kneeling beside him.\n“Are you badly hurt?! Let me see!”\n“Uh...?!”\n“It looked like a pretty hard collision! Did you hit your head too? Is your wrist okay? Does it hurt here?”\nI noticed Han-gyeol clutching his left wrist, so I cautiously took his wrist to check.\n“Ahhhhhhh?!”\n“Is it so painful that you have to scream?! Huh? It’s really swollen!”\n“No, no, I’m fine...! It’s not that serious.”\n“There’s no bleeding... Can you move your wrist a bit?!”\nHeeding my words, Han-gyeol gingerly moved his wrist.\n“How does it feel? Does it hurt?”\n“It’s a bit sore, but I don’t think it’s seriously injured.”\n“Let’s go to the nurse’s office to get a bandage then. Can you stand up?”\nI looked intently at Han-gyeol’s face.\nHis face was slightly flushed.\n“Ah... I think I twisted my ankle a bit.”\n“Okay—no visible bleeding... I’ll help you up. Let’s go to the nurse’s office. Come on, get up carefully.”\n“Ah—Thanks.”\nIt was then that I tried to support the now-standing Han-gyeol.\nOh right, Seo-ha had also fallen, but he seemed to be unharmed.\n“Ah—! I’m sorry about that. I got too eager. Eun-ha, I’ll support him.”\nSeo-ha apologized to Han-gyeol, but neither of them were particularly close friends, so—\n“It’s fine. I was planning to go back to the classroom with Han-gyeol anyway, so I’ll take him to the nurse’s office.”\n“Ah...okay. You said your name was Han-gyeol, right? I’m really sorry. Are you hurt badly?”\n“Ah—not at all. Don’t worry about it. These things can happen in sports. Let’s go, Eun-ha.”\nI supported Han-gyeol, who had his arm over my shoulder, as we walked towards the nurse’s office.\nI felt bad for Harim, who was standing outside the basketball court, but I asked her to grab Han-gyeol’s bag.\n“Ah—should I bring your bag too, Eun-ha?”\n“Could you? But wouldn’t that be too much for you alone?”\n“Then I should ask some of the guys for help as well.”\n“I’ll wait for you in the nurse’s office with Han-gyeol.”\n“Alright.”\nLimping along, Han-gyeol was smiling despite his injury.\nI wondered what could be so funny when his wrist and leg might be fractured.\n“Why are you smiling when you’re hurt?”\n“Huh? Am I smiling right now?”\n“Yeah. You’re smiling a little.”\n“Well, we did win the basketball game after all.”\n“What—?! Now’s the time to think about basketball?”\nAs I shifted suddenly, Han-gyeol wobbled significantly.\n“Ah—! Careful, careful!”\n“It’ll be alright as long as you support me well.”\n“Stop kidding around. What if you fall?”\n“Haha! Point taken. Let’s go a bit slower, shall we?”\n“We should walk carefully, right?”\n“Absolutely~”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“The school nurse isn’t here... I’ll go look for some bandages, so you just sit here, Han-gyeol.”\nMy ankle was actually fine; did I lie for no reason?\nBut if I had told Eun-ha that my ankle wasn’t hurt, she probably wouldn’t have supported me, so I just went along with it.\nI felt a bit guilty for lying to Eun-ha, but it was a necessary evil.\nShe suddenly grabbed my hand and looked concerned when she heard about it.\nAt that moment, any pain in my wrist disappeared, and my previously calm heart started pounding like crazy.\nHonestly, it was a fairly reasonable lie.\n“Here’s a bandage! Han-gyeol, ankles are a bit tricky to bandage well, should we look for an air bandage?”\n“Ah- Thanks. But I think my ankle feels better now. I don’t feel any issues walking.”\n“Really? Can you walk?”\n“Yeah. I’m genuinely fine now. Can you give me the bandage?”\n“You hurt your wrist, right? You probably can’t apply it well, so let me do it for you. Give me your wrist.”\n“Ah- Sure, please go ahead.”\nEun-ha carefully grabbed my left arm.\nI was wondering what if I smelled like sweat, but Eun-ha conscientiously applied the bandage.\nMy heart fluttered again, watching Eun-ha meticulously put the bandage on my wrist.\nI was nervous in case she might heard my heart pounding.\n“Be a bit more careful next time you play basketball. Though it wasn’t really your fault, Han-gyeol.”\n“I should be. Sorry for making you worry, Eun-ha~”\nAs I spoke with a mischievous tone, Eun-ha playfully slapped my back.\n“Ouch! That hurts, Eun-ha! I am technically a patient, you know.”\n“I shouldn’t have worried. I thought you had a serious collision, but you’re fine.”\n“Now it’s not my wrist, but my back that hurts.”\n“Shh...! Want another slap?”\nWhat was this? I felt good even though I was being scolded.\nThis was a very dangerous emotion.\n“Eun-ha, did you see me play basketball?”\n“Yeah. I saw the tail end of it.”\n“Did you see me make the three-pointer?”\n“Yeah. I saw Han-gyeol make a three-pointer and pretend not to be happy about it.”\n“Puahaha! Was it that obvious?!”\n“You’re laughing even though you’re hurt?”\n“I’m all better now.”\nEun-ha looked at me as if she was shocked by my words.\nBut I was happy that Eun-ha ran over to me without hesitation and even gave me support.\nEven though I felt sorry for making her worry, a part of me was glad to be the recipient of Eun-ha’s concern.\n“Is your ankle alright? You don’t have any other injuries?”\n“Haha. No, I’m fine. When Jeong Harim arrives, let’s grab our bags and go eat.”\n“Phew- What a relief.”\nThud-!\n“Hey guys, we’re here~”\n“Ah! Why is Lee Han-gyeol’s bag so heavy?”\nJeong Harim came in holding Eun-ha’s bag, and Yujin came in holding mine.\n“Hey Han-gyeol, are you badly hurt?”\n“No, I’m fine. Thanks for bringing my bag.”\n“I’m hungry, let’s go eat.”\n“Yeah, let’s do that. Oh, Eun-ha, do you want to come too? Jeong Harim should join as well.”\nWhen I asked Eun-ha, she nodded her head in agreement.\n“Jeong Harim? You should come too.”\n“Wow- I’m invited as well? Thanks. But what are we eating?”\n“Good question. Eun-ha, do you have anything in particular you want to eat?”\n“Hmm— If I say I don’t have a preference, you’re going to suggest pork cutlet, aren’t you?”\nI nodded in response.\n“Then let’s go for tteokbokki! Is that okay with you all?”\n“I’m fine with whatever Eun-ha says. Hey Yujin, you good with that?”\n“I eat anything, so I’m good. What about you, Jeong Harim?”\n“I like tteokbokki too. There’s a place near the school, should we go there?”\n“Let’s do that! We can eat and part ways afterward.”\nAs soon as we left the infirmary, the four of us headed straight to a tteokbokki place near our school.\nWe spotted a few students in our school uniforms and settled ourselves at a corner table.\nEun-ha and Jeong Harim were perusing the menu, contemplating what to order.\n“Do you guys handle spicy food well? Harim is fine with it.”\n“I’ve never tried, but I can handle spicy food. How about you, Yujin?”\n“I’ve never had this before either, but I can handle it. Both Han-gyeol and I aren’t familiar, so you guys can order as you like.”\n“Hmm—then shall Harim and I order as we please? Can we choose the toppings too?”\n“Yeah, that’s fine.”\nAfter much deliberation, Eun-ha and Jeong Harim finally pressed the table bell to order.\n“Yes, would you like to place your order?”\n“Will one pot of tteokbokki be enough for four people?”\n“Hmm, one pot usually serves 3-4 people. But if it’s not enough, you can add some rice balls.”\n“Ah, in that case, one original-flavored tteokbokki, along with rice balls and drink, please.”\n“We have peach, plum, and pineapple flavors for the drink. Which would you like?”\n“Peach flavor, please.”\n“Alright, it will be ready shortly.”\nEun-ha and Jeong Harim were smiling from ear to ear, delighted to eat tteokbokki.\nHowever, Yujin and I had no idea just how spicy the tteokbokki that the two girls had ordered would be.\n***\n“Ugh...! Ha...! Hey Yujin, is there any drink left? Just a sip!”\n“Ha...! Sorry, there’s some left but I can’t spare it. Why is this so spicy?”\n“I know, right...! I’ll get some ice water.”\n“Hey, don’t you know that drinking water when it’s spicy only makes it worse?”\n“Then let’s just order another drink and share it.”\n“Alright. Shin Eun-ha, Jeong Harim, we’re ordering another drink. We’ll pay for this one separately.”\nUnable to bear it any longer, Yujin hastily left the table.\nContrary to Yujin and me, Eun-ha and Jeong Harim were effortlessly enjoying the fiery tteokbokki.\nThe initial drinks that were poured at first hadn’t diminished much at all.\nWhat the hell? Did they have a high tolerance or something?\n“Should we have ordered it less spicy...are you okay?”\n“No, it’s delicious. Extremely delicious, but also incredibly spicy.”\n“Ah, here, eat a rice ball. It should help a bit.”\n“Ah, thanks. I’ll enjoy it...!”\nEun-ha pushed the bowl filled with rice balls towards me.\nI quickly picked one up with my chopsticks and popped it into my mouth.\nAh, it definitely helped to have some rice.\n“Hey, hey—Han-gyeol! I brought the drink. Time for an emergency transfusion.”\n“Hurry, can’t you see someone is about to die here?”\n“Ugh...! It’s tasty, but so spicy.”\n“You’ve been saying the same thing for a while now.”\nYujin and I refilled our cups and took large gulps. Our struggles seemed amusing to the girls.\n“Haha! Didn’t you both claim to handle spicy food well?”\nEun-ha asked with a beaming smile.\n“We didn’t know it would be this intense..!”\nYujin and I responded in unison.\n“Next time, let’s order the beginner’s level of spiciness.”\n“You don’t have to, really. This is delicious too.”\nI didn’t want to spoil Eun-ha’s favorite dish just because I couldn’t handle it.\nHowever, that was just my opinion, and Yujin looked at me with wide eyes.\n“Hey, are you nuts, Han-gyeol? They’re offering to get the beginner’s level!”\n“If we keep eating it, we’ll get used to it. Endure.”\n“You make a fair point. Alright, let’s dig in again.”\n“Great. Go for it, Yujin. Hey—try the rice balls too. They’re good.”\n“Okay, accepted.”\nWe tried again, but there was no escaping the spiciness.\nAfter finishing our meal, we all went outside to make our separate payments.\nIt looked like we wouldn’t have time for anything else, so we decided to part ways there and then.\n“Han-gyeol and I are walking. Harim is taking the bus, how about you, Jang Yujin?”\n“Me? I’m close to school, so I can just walk. But it seems like my path is in opposite directions?”\n“Ah, Is that so? Well, see you all tomorrow! Today was fun. Han-gyeol, let’s go.”\nSomething I needed to do came to mind.\n“Ah, Eun-ha, sorry. I’ve got plans to go somewhere with Yujin, so I think we’ll have to part ways for today.”\n“What? We do..?”\n“Then see you tomorrow, Eun-ha! See you too, Jeong Harim!”\n“Huh? Ah—okay. See you tomorrow!”\n“Take care.”\nI quickly grabbed Yujin’s bag and pulled his back.\nYujin looked puzzled for a moment but played along with my story.\n“Ah, right! I almost forgot! See you all tomorrow, then?!”\nOnce we were far enough away from the girls, Yujin turned to me.\n“Hey, what plans do we have? This is the first time I’m hearing about it.”\n“We need to create a ’constant of integration.’”\n“What the heck are you talking about? You’re not serious, are you?”\n“Let’s go make chocolate.”\n“Why am I involved in this?”\n“I’ll buy you chicken.”\n“Just leave it to me. As far as I remember, there’s a store near my house that sells what we need.”\n“Lead the way.”\n“Hehe! This is hilarious. Anyway, it sounds fun so I’ll help.”\n“So, no chicken then?”\n“You bastard...!”\n“Sorry.”\nTogether, Yujin and I went to the supermarket to buy everything we’d need for making chocolate.\nI was a bit worried since it was my first time making chocolate and we were short on time. I bought extra chocolate just in case we messed up.\n“Do you think you can make all of that?”\n“Better to have too much than too little.”\n“So, where are we making it?”\n“We don’t really have an option, do we? At my place.”\n“No. We’re going to my place. My parents run a business, so they’ll be coming home late.”\n“Isn’t that too much of a bother?”\n“Why would you care about that? Let’s go.”\nI felt like I’d made a reliable friend after all.\n“By the way, my younger sister will be back from school soon.”\n“Should we need to tell her?”\n“I’m the older brother.”\n“Isn't this too much?”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Chocolates were visible all around the hallway.\nToday was White Day, so some boys were giving chocolates to girls.\nProbably most of them were couples, right? White Day confessions weren’t that common, after all.\nWatching the smiling men and women in the hallway, I unknowingly felt a sense of anticipation welled up within me.\nYet, I found it strange that I held such anticipation while shifting my gaze towards Han-gyeol’s seat.\nCould he possibly give me one too...?\n“Eun-ha, did you get any chocolate from Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah—?! No?! I don’t think Han-gyeol cares much about White Day. Besides, he always brings me snacks, so I’m content with that.”\n“He gives you snacks?”\n“Huh? Han-gyeol gives me candy almost every day, you know?”\n“Oh, really? I’ve never seen Han-gyeol give candy to anyone.”\n“Ah—?!”\nSo, he was giving them only to me...\nI felt a little happy.\n“Hehe…”\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Ah! It’s nothing!”\nI accidentally let out a smile.\nMaybe once he got closer, he would give candy to Harim as well?\n“Hmm- Would he give me some if I ask?”\n“Are you talking about the orange-flavored candy?”\n“Oh, there’s a specific flavor too? Yeah, that one.”\n“I guess he might if you ask?”\n“I wonder~”\nHarim looked down at me with a slightly ambiguous smile.\nAll I did was hurriedly shift my gaze out the window.\nWhen lunchtime came, I planned to have lunch with Han-gyeol, but he was nowhere to be found in the classroom.\nAs I wondered where Han-gyeol was, I saw him through the window talking to Jang Yujin.\nThe window was slightly open, so I could hear bits of their conversation.\nI didn’t mean to eavesdrop... but I heard them.\n“I told you, the constant of integration doesn’t necessarily have to be positive.”\n“Looking at the outcome, it seems you’re right... and could anyone even hate it since it’s handmade chocolate?”\n“That’s true. Ah- Fine, I’ll decide.”\n“Okay, let me know your decision later. Enjoy your meal.”\nHandmade chocolate...?\nSwish-\nHan-gyeol entered the classroom after finishing his conversation.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Ah—! Han-gyeol! Shall we go eat?”\n“Oh, sure. What’s for lunch today?”\n“I think they’re serving some chocolate snacks because it’s White Day?”\n“Really? Sounds exciting. Let’s go.”\nAs we headed to the cafeteria, Han-gyeol was unusually quiet today.\nFrom his conversation with Jang Yujin, it was clear that he was going to give chocolate to someone.\nI couldn’t help but wonder if that someone might be me, but that was probably just my overactive imagination, right?\nStill, I was curious.\nWho would be the recipient of Han-gyeol’s handmade chocolate?\nAnd since he brought it to school, it must be a student here, right?\nSomeone from our class, maybe? Or another class? If so, who?\n“Eun-ha, is there something on my face?”\n“Huh...?! No! I was just lost in thought.”\n“Is that so? Ah- enjoy your lunch.”\n“You too, Han-gyeol.”\nThroughout lunch, my mind was preoccupied with thoughts of chocolate.\nIn the end, I couldn’t finish my meal.\n“Eun-ha, did you finish eating?”\n“Ah—, yeah. I’m not very hungry today.”\n“Are you not feeling well? Do you want to go to the infirmary?”\n“Huh? No, I’m fine. I just don’t have much of an appetite.”\n“Ah, I see.”\nAfter lunch, we headed straight back to the classroom.\nShould I ask him before brushing my teeth? I pondered.\nWe had grown quite close, so it wouldn’t be entirely out of line to ask who he likes, right?\nBut... I just couldn’t bring myself to ask so casually.\n“Alright, Eun-ha. I’m going to brush my teeth.”\n“Ah—, okay...!”\nHesitation got the best of me, and Han-gyeol walked out of the classroom.\nAt least he didn’t give any handmade chocolate to me.\nMy eyes naturally drifted to his hands.\nShould I not get my hopes up?\n***\nDuring the afternoon classes, I didn’t really talk to Han-gyeol.\nBut every break, I checked where he was and whether he was holding anything in his hands.\nBy the time the fifth and sixth periods had ended, and all afternoon classes were over, I still hadn’t figured out who the recipient of Han-gyeol’s handmade chocolate would be.\nAfter all the classes, Han-gyeol picked up his bag and walked over to me.\nCould it be?!\n“Eun-ha, let’s study together.”\n“Ah—, sure. Harim went straight home today, so you can sit next to me.”\n“Okay. Is it alright if I ask you questions if I get stuck?”\n“Of course. And I’ll do the same?”\n“Sounds like a fair deal.”\nHan-gyeol opened his reference book and started studying.\nI didn’t want to disturb him, but curiosity was eating me up.\nI wanted to cautiously broach some topics before asking my burning question.\n“Ah—, is your wrist okay, Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah... yeah. It felt better when I woke up.”\n“I see.”\n“Mhm.”\nAnd just like that, the conversation came to a halt.\nThis wasn’t what I had in mind.\nShould I muster a little courage?\nYes! I’ll just go ahead and ask!\n“Um, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? Is there something you don’t understand?”\n“Uh...did you give chocolate to anyone today?”\n“Huh? No. Why?”\n“Ah, no reason. Just curious because it’s White Day.”\n“Oh—, so you want some chocolate?!”\n“What?! No! That’s not what I meant!”\n“Ah—, in that case...hold on a sec.”\nHan-gyeol opened his bag and took something out.\nMy heart was pounding, hoping it might be handmade chocolate, but it was a ready-made chocolate.\n“Here, this is for you, Eun-ha. I planned to give it to you earlier. Were you expecting something?”\n“Wha-? Wow, thanks! I really didn’t think you’d actually give me chocolate...”\nI managed a smile as I spoke, but I couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed.\nIn the end... wasn’t this the difference between a friend and someone he liked?\nPerhaps it was natural to give handmade chocolate to someone he had feelings for, and a ready-made chocolate to a friend.\nMaking handmade chocolate for someone wasn’t just about ‘making your own chocolate.’\nHow many men have ever made chocolate in their lives?\nTo go to the effort of making chocolate by hand means one wants to give a special gift to someone precious.\nThe mere thought of this would make any woman happy.\nAnd any woman would imagine it, right?\nShe would envision the entire process that went into making that chocolate.\nThe trips to the grocery store, deliberating over which chocolate to buy.\nThe awkwardness of facing a range of unfamiliar tools.\nThe potential embarrassment of placing seemingly unmasculine items on the checkout counter.\nAnd what about back at home?\nWhat excuses might he have given to family members who asked whom he was making chocolate for?\nSure, he might have come up with a variety of excuses while making the chocolate, but they’d likely see right through him.\nMaybe he sweated as he melted the packaged chocolate in hot water and stirred it with a spoon.\nPerhaps things weren’t going well, so he had to play a tutorial video on his smartphone.\nAfter all the effort of melting the chocolate, he must have pondered about what shape to make it in.\nHe might also have deliberated over how to package it.\nIn essence, handmade chocolate was a special gift that encapsulates all those moments.\nIt was a visible token filled with a man’s every worry and emotion, in my opinion.\nThat was why the chocolate became even more special, sentimental, and too precious to eat.\nThere was a moment when I felt secretly envious of the girl who would receive such chocolate from Han-gyeol.\nStill, I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.\nAfterward, I managed to keep smiling as we studied and had dinner.\nIn the end, Han-gyeol didn’t find the girl to give his handmade chocolate to, but I was just curious anyway.\nTo be honest, there were times I wondered if I might be the one Han-gyeol likes.\nSome of the things he had done for me have led me to think that way.\nBut now, I felt like I’d got my answer.\nThe person Han-gyeol liked wasn’t me.\nI guessed the right thing to do was to support a friend’s love, right?\nWhy do I feel this sense of awkwardness?\nWas it the anxiety that a close male friend might suddenly turn his attention elsewhere?\nOr was it because I entertained the thought that he might like me, and he doesn’t?\nBoth were inherently selfish emotions.\n“Eun-ha, ready to go if you’re done eating?”\n“Ah- Yeah. Sorry, I was lost in thought for a moment. Haha.”\n“You okay today? You seem a little down.”\n“No, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it. Let’s go.”\nIf Han-gyeol ended up with the person he liked, we wouldn’t be able to continue like this anymore, would we?\nWhy did the walk home today feel so much shorter than usual?\nWas it because the thought crossed my mind that this could be the last time?\nIn the end, we reached the point where we’d part ways, without having exchanged any words.\n“Alright, Han-gyeol. See you tomorrow.”\n“Ah... um, Eun-ha, wait a second!”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“Well, you see...”\nAnd at that moment, Han-gyeol reached into the bag he was carrying on his back and pulled something out.\nIt was something wrapped beautifully, and he cautiously handed it to me.\nI took it without saying a word and tilted my head in puzzlement.\nHan-gyeol, scratching his cheek, spoke up.\n“Look, it’s White Day, right? So, I was on my way home yesterday, and I just happened to see this chocolate-making kit! It didn’t look too difficult, so I got carried away and made it. But since it’s my first time, I had a hard time mixing it properly, and it didn’t even taste good! After I froze it and tried to take it out, it just cracked! So, the shape is a bit... weird. But the taste is actually pretty good, okay? I tried a few and they taste alright! I mean, they say you eat with your eyes too, but I promise, the overall taste is good! I originally wanted to give you this instead of the store-bought one, but the shape came out all wrong...”\nHan-gyeol was explaining all this to me, clearly flustered.\nI had never seen Han-gyeol this disconcerted before.\nHe must have been incredibly embarrassed.\nAnd he must have been hesitating this whole time.\nPerhaps from lunchtime or maybe since he arrived at school, he had been waiting for the right moment to give this to me.\nIf that was the case, then Han-gyeol spent the entire day at school thinking only about me.\nI was not sure if I should even think that way.\nBut I wanted to believe it; I wanted to be deluded into thinking Han-gyeol thought about me all day.\nThe idea that he was worried about me made me incredibly happy.\nMy heart... It’s started to flutter.\nThump-thump? Ba-dump-ba-dump? Thump-Thump?\nIt was a wildly erratic beat, one I couldn’t even begin to describe with words.\nIn the end, I had no choice but to hug the chocolate Han-gyeol gave me tightly to my chest, bowing my head.\nMy cheeks were flushed so hot I could feel the warmth.\nI couldn’t hide my feelings anymore.\nI realized that this feeling was love.\nI couldn’t let him see my face right now.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Three days had passed since White Day.\nIt wasn’t until Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday that I became certain.\nLately, Eun-ha was avoiding me.\nThat was my final conclusion.\nWas the homemade chocolate too much? Or was she just shy?\nWhatever the reason, it was clear that Eun-ha was currently avoiding me.\nI had evidence.\nI tried to greet Eun-ha in the morning, but she deliberately avoided making eye contact with me.\nShe disappeared somewhere during lunchtime, saying she had made plans to eat with Jeong Harim.\nEven yesterday, on Thursday’s night study session, she went home early, claiming she had something to do.\nDid I make her feel too pressured?\nPerhaps it would have been more reasonable to stick to a ready-made one?\nI felt a bit hurt that she started avoiding me all of a sudden.\nWas she going to skip tonight’s study session as well?\nIf she did that, I would really feel hurt.\n“What are you thinking so deeply about?”\n“Nothing much.”\n“Then lighten up your face. You look really scary right now.”\n“What’s wrong with my expression?”\n“It’s like a hunter chasing after a deer.”\n“What does that even mean?”\nIf we were going to get specific, maybe Eun-ha was the deer and I was the hunter.\nAfter a brief conversation with Yujin, I looked toward Eun-ha—or should I say, the deer.\nBut then, swiftly, Eun-ha’s gaze shifted forward.\nI was sure she was looking at me... or was it just my imagination?\nOr do my eyes really look like those of a hunter right now?\n“I just can’t figure out why she’s acting like this.”\n“Why? Who? Shin Eun-ha?”\n“She doesn’t seem angry or anything... I don’t know.”\nIf she were angry, she wouldn’t have looked in my direction to begin with.\nBut if she was not angry, then why was she avoiding me? That was the question.\nIs she shy? Does that mean her feelings toward me have changed?\nI couldn’t think of any other reason for now.\nI had never been in a proper relationship, so I never assumed that I was doing a good job at approaching a girl.\nThat was why I had always been cautious... Yet, I couldn’t help but wonder if I had been too eager.\nBut no matter how much I thought about it, this didn’t seem like a reason for her to avoid me.\nI was just so confused.\n“I’m going to the canteen, you want to come? I’m hungry.”\n“It’s only been one period since lunch, didn’t you eat?”\n“I did, but the food today was terrible, so I didn’t eat much. So, are you coming or not?”\n“Let’s go. I could at least have a glass of cider.”\n“Is something bothering you? Feel free to spill the beans.”\n“What are you talking about? Let’s just go. Do they have cider at the canteen?”\n“They had Cola last time I checked. Probably no cider.”\n“Guess I’ll settle for regular cola then.”\nYujin and I left the classroom and reached the canteen.\nI got a Cola, and Yujin bought a bread roll as we headed back to class.\n“Hey, you haven’t been hanging out with Shin Eun-ha these days. Did you guys have a fight?”\n“You have a knack for picking up on unnecessary details. No, we didn’t fight. But it does feel like some distance has grown between us.”\n“I noticed you guys aren’t eating together or walking home together lately.”\n“That’s what I’ve been wondering about too. Maybe she’s focusing on studying since the mock exams are next week.”\n“That suddenly makes me depressed. They say the March mock exams predict your college entrance exam scores... I’m worried.”\n“Don’t worry about it too much. It’s all up to you.”\n“You talk as if you’ve already taken the college entrance exam.”\nAh, that’s right.\n“It’s just something people say. Let’s think positively.”\n“Sometimes you act like an old man, you know?”\n“Say I’m mature. It sounds better.”\n“Old man.”\n“You bastard, I swear...”\n“Ah, right. I’ll drop by Class 8 for a bit, so you can go ahead.”\n“Okay, but we don’t have much time before the bell rings, so hurry back.”\n“Alright.”\nIt was right when I was about to enter the classroom, sipping on my cola...\nI ran into Eun-ha, who was on her way out of the classroom.\n“Ah-ha, hey Han-gyeol.”\n“Um...”\nI looked at Eun-ha cautiously,\nWith eyes akin to a hunter watching its prey.\n“Can you move a bit? I need to get by...”\nIt was frustrating.\nI had always known that Eun-ha could be a little stifling.\nShe was the contemplative type, which could be seen as cautious but also a little frustrating.\nEspecially when it came to human interactions.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Huh?”\n“Why have you been avoiding me lately?”\nI wanted to clear up this frustration as soon as possible.\nTo do that, I needed to have an honest conversation with Eun-ha.\nI needed a dialogue that was, to some extent, persistent enough to get a reasonable explanation.\n“Uh...?”\nEun-ha looked puzzled, but I didn’t say anything.\nI just stared at her, wanting a different answer.\nBut Eun-ha couldn’t say anything and simply lowered her head.\nThen she spoke, in an almost inaudible voice.\n“That’s not it...”\nNo matter how much I thought I knew about her, I couldn’t know everything.\nWhat I knew was limited to the Eun-ha of the past.\nI couldn’t know what the present Eun-ha was thinking.\nIn other words, if she didn’t tell me, I couldn’t fully understand.\nI knew and understood that Eun-ha wasn’t the best at expressing herself.\nBut if it continued like this, it was going to be a problem for any kind of relationship between Eun-ha and me.\n“It’s not like that? Recently, you don’t even say hello to me in the mornings. As soon as lunchtime hits, you vanish. And yesterday, you left without doing night study, saying you had something going on. You’ve been acting like this ever since I gave you that chocolate gift... Did it make you uncomfortable? Or did you not like it?”\nI wanted to know.\nWhat Eun-ha was thinking.\nWhy she was avoiding me.\n“Well, that is not...”\n“Then what is the reason?”\n“I have, um, reasons. I have to go!”\nBut all I could do was watch Eun-ha’s retreating figure.\nIt was frustrating, but I couldn’t bring myself to be angry at her for this alone.\nI knew from the start that Eun-ha was the frustrating type.\nBesides, my heart was pounding just from making brief eye contact; there was nothing I could do.\n***\nI couldn’t focus at all during the sixth period.\nLet’s objectively summarize the situation.\nThe reason Eun-ha was avoiding me boiled down to one of two things.\nEither she felt burdened by the homemade chocolate I gave her, or there had been a change in her feelings towards me.\nIf I had to guess which, I’d say the latter was more likely.\nThe first piece of evidence was Eun-ha’s expression.\nHer visibly flushed face was the most logical reason to consider it.\nBesides, even if she felt burdened, it was not like Eun-ha to so blatantly avoid me.\nIf she was truly uncomfortable, she’d likely have gradually distanced herself from me.\nIn other words, suddenly putting this kind of distance between us was hard to swallow.\nHowever, I couldn’t completely rule out the former possibility.\nWhat if Eun-ha felt so overwhelmed she couldn’t even speak?\nWhile it was unlikely for now, what if that was the case?\nDamn. I’m beginning to understand those dense and clueless male protagonists a bit.\nIf I misjudged the situation, a downward spiral was inevitable, so I had to consider every possibility.\nCharging ahead blindly wasn’t appropriate for the current situation.\nThe risk was too high if I was wrong.\nEspecially for teenagers and men in their 20s, the most dangerous thing was to mistake a girl’s intentions, thinking she liked them.\nI had seen more than a few cases where someone made that mistake, took the plunge, and faced a setback.\nIn short, this was a critical juncture that would determine the future of my relationship with Eun-ha.\nShould I push since I’ve pulled before?\nNo, that would be a complete disaster if I got pushed away in return.\nBesides, I didn’t quite understand the concept of pushing away someone I liked.\nBut continuing to pull might make the situation worse.\nScrew it. I would just be myself.\nThere was no use in worrying; a clear answer wasn’t going to come.\nEun-ha had always been a frustrating type to deal with, so I would just have to ask her directly.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll go ahead. Have a great weekend.”\n“Sure. Take care. Enjoy your weekend.”\nYujin hurriedly grabbed his bag and left the classroom.\nOne by one, the students filed out until it was just Eun-ha and me left alone in the room.\nI strode over to Eun-ha’s desk.\nSince Jeong Harim wasn’t at her seat, I sat next to Eun-ha.\n“Hey, Eun-ha.”\n“Huh?! Why, Han-gyeol?”\n“You’re not avoiding me because you feel uncomfortable or dislike me, right?”\n“Um... No! Of course not!”\n“If you do feel that way, can you just tell me instead of mulling it over alone?”\n“Huh...?”\nI poured out to Eun-ha the dilemma I had been grappling with.\n“Look, I get that there are things we should be cautious about since you’re a girl and I’m a guy. But if there’s anything I’ve done to make you uncomfortable, I wish you’d be upfront about it. I want to hear your honest thoughts, Eun-ha. I don’t want to make assumptions on my own. So, please, be honest about your feelings with me. From Wednesday until today, Friday, I’ve felt like you’ve been avoiding me. I’ve been frustrated not knowing why, and it hurt that it seemed so sudden. These are my thoughts, and these are my feelings.”\nAs I spoke calmly, Eun-ha looked at me with wide eyes.\n“Um... It’s not that... I just...”\n“I’m sorry for bringing this up so suddenly.”\nEun-ha seemed as though she still hadn’t sorted out her emotions fully.\nPressing for an answer now would likely not yield her true feelings.\n“You don’t have to answer now. Take your time to think it over and let me know when you get a chance. I’ll be on my way then. Have a good weekend.”\n“Ah— Yeah... Take care, Han-gyeol.”\nGiven the circumstances, this was probably the best course of action for now.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Han-gyeol. It’s not that I was avoiding you...\nI was just feeling a bit under the weather, and I looked unwell.\nI wasn’t avoiding you at all; I really was just not feeling well–\n“Ha– Even though I wrote it, it doesn’t sound believable.”\nTap, tap–\nI deleted all the messages I intended to send to Han-gyeol.\nYes, that was right. I hadn’t seen Han-gyeol face-to-face for the past few days.\nAnd the reason for that was the emotions I was currently feeling.\nIt was definitely love, wasn’t it?\nI hadn’t even been able to eat the chocolate Han-gyeol gave me on White Day.\nAnd whenever I saw the doll Han-gyeol gifted me, my heart started to race.\nHow could I possibly look Han-gyeol directly in the eyes, feeling like this?\n“This is serious...”\nAfter finishing my night studies, today I went straight home, washed up, and went to bed.\nI wondered what Han-gyeol was doing right now.\nHe must be feeling hurt, right? But he didn’t seem angry.\nRather, Han-gyeol honestly shared his feelings with me.\nAs I laid there, the image of Han-gyeol’s face—speaking his feelings so honestly and courteously—flashed before my eyes.\nI felt really guilty, especially considering I should be reflecting on my actions. Yet my heart raced at the thought of Han-gyeol.\nBut no matter how much I thought about it, my cheeks turned red once again at the sight of Han-gyeol’s mature demeanor.\n“So cool…”\nI knew...\nEver since I was a child, people told me that I couldn’t express my thoughts openly.\nI had been scolded to speak honestly.\nI knew all of that. But it hadn’t been easy to change.\nI always worried about what would happen if my honest words twisted my relationships.\nJust like there were well-intentioned lies, there could be cruel honesty, too.\nThat was right.\nI was a coward who did nothing because I was scared of what others would think.\nAs much as I hate to admit it, and even though I disliked this part of me, this was who I was—Shin Eun-ha.\nBut for the first time,\nSomeone calmly shared their thoughts and emotions with me.\nOn top of that, someone who didn’t rush me for an answer and even gave me time to think.\nThis was all new to me.\nFor the first time, I was not scared of conflict with someone.\nThat was because Han-gyeol’s words were filled with such consideration.\nIt was a peaceful, quiet, and exceedingly comfortable friction between us.\n“Ugh–! But I still can’t say it...!”\nHow could I say that I had been avoiding him because I think ‘I like you’?\nHow could I possibly tell him that my cheeks flushed like a radish and my heart raced when I saw his face?\nAnd I couldn’t even dare to ask, ‘Does Han-gyeol like me too?’\nAm I delusional?\nBut Han-gyeol gave me handmade chocolate, didn’t he?\nCould it be that Han-gyeol also has feelings for me?\nOr am I making a big deal just because I received one piece of handmade chocolate?\nI mean, I did attribute significant meaning to that handmade chocolate.\nJust... Well, it was entirely possible to give chocolate to a close female friend!\nYes! We live in a fairly open-minded era, after all.\n“Ahhh–! No, I don’t know! I just don’t know!”\nLying in bed, I kicked my legs in the air.\nI rolled back and forth, but my thoughts remained jumbled.\nI didn’t want to be distanced from Han-gyeol like this.\nI messed up; it was my turn to approach him.\nBecause Han-gyeol was open about his feelings.\nEven though he could have been mad, he honestly shared his thoughts with me.\nBecause he mustered the courage for me, who was so poor at expressing feelings...\nYes. I’ve decided to be honest about my own feelings as well.\nI mustered up the courage to pick up my phone.\nAnd then set it back down.\n“Ahhhh–! It’s impossible! What should I say? That I’m sorry?”\nMuttering to myself in bed, I still couldn’t say why I’d been avoiding Han-gyeol.\nAnd today of all days was a Friday, meaning I won’t see Han-gyeol until next Monday.\nHa– It’s clear that a painful weekend lies ahead.\nIn the end, I decided to consult the internet while holding my smartphone.\nI mean, we live in the Information age, right?\nSurely, I would find a decent solution as I rummaged through the web.\nBut all I found were words better suited for romantic relationships.\nAnd... some methods seemed inappropriate for a minor like me.\n“Ha– I miss him...”\nIt was not surprising anymore.\nI was not terribly confused by these feelings.\nI just missed Han-gyeol and wanted to get along well with him again.\n***\nSince it was the weekend, I had a tutoring session with my sister, Hyun-joo, in the morning.\nWith the march mock exams next thursday, we reviewed everything once more.\nAlthough thoughts of Han-gyeol occasionally crossed my mind, I forced myself to concentrate on the lesson.\nHowever, once the tutoring was over and we were eating, Han-gyeol was all I could think about.\n“Hey Eunwoo, what’s up with Eun-ha?”\n“I don’t know, she’s been noisy in her room since yesterday.”\n“Eun-ha, what’s going on? Why are you acting like this?”\nEven amidst my sister and brother’s questions, I just stared blankly at the sky.\nAs I looked at the blue sky consistently, I thought of Han-gyeol.\nWhat on earth am I thinking?\n“Haha…hahahahahahahaha… This is big trouble.”\n“Eunwoo, why is she like this?”\n“I don’t know, she just suddenly became like this.”\nHan-gyeol had become too entangled in my daily life.\n“Oh, right. I had something to ask Han-gyeol. Is it okay to contact him on the weekend?”\n“Why wouldn’t it be? I even asked him yesterday if he wanted to have tutoring session.”\n“But yesterday was Friday. It’s the weekend today, so I don’t want to unnecessarily bother him.”\n“Wow, Shin Eunwoo, you’ve become quite considerate.”\n“I should be good to Han-gyeol.”\n...Huh? What does that mean?\nI turned my head towards my sister and brother.\n“What are you talking about? You both have Han-gyeol’s number? How did you get it?”\n“Huh? We exchanged numbers when Han-gyeol came to our house. Mom probably has it too, you know.”\n“What?! Even you, sis?”\n“Yep. Why, is that a problem?”\n“No way! Show me!”\nAt my insistence, my sister and brother nonchalantly showed me Han-gyeol’s contact info on their phones.\n“So you guys have been in touch with Han-gyeol from time to time?”\n“Like I said, I asked him just yesterday if he wanted to have a tutoring session.”\n“I contacted him the other day to ask him to play a game, and we played a game or two together. Since he is a senior in high school, I didn’t play much? And do not misunderstand.”\nI couldn’t believe it.\nEven my mom had Han-gyeol’s contact information...\n“What the heck?! Why are you guys in touch with him and not telling me?”\n“Well, you can contact him too, right? Did you guys have a fight or something?”\nMy brother spoke with a furrowed brow, hitting the nail on the head. And I was left speechless.\n“What?! Are you serious?! How dare someone like you upset the great Lee Han-gyeol, the virtuous gentleman of our age?! I’ve never been so disappointed in you, my little sister. Grab your phone right now and confess your sins to Han-gyeol. He’ll forgive you with his immense grace; he’s a saint of this era, after all.”\n“So, what should I send? Just that I’m sorry? Brother, you have to help me.”\n“Fine. As someone who shares biological gender as him, I’ll tell you.”\nMy brother crossed his arms and spoke solemnly.\n“Tell him you want to go eat pork cutlet.”\nTrusting this man was my mistake.\n“What are you talking about?! Han-gyeol isn’t some pork cutlet fanatic! You think one meal will solve everything?”\n“What?! How dare you disrespect pork cutlet?! It’s the perfect food!”\n“Do you think Han-gyeol is some eight-year-old kid?! Denied! Totally denied!”\n“Ha– Even when I offer a surefire method, you don’t take it... You’re hopeless.”\n“Shut up!”\nI turned my gaze toward my sister Hyun-joo.\n“Sis... Do you have any good ideas?”\n“First, why did you guys even fight?”\n“We didn’t... I mean, it’s more like I messed up one-sidedly.”\n“Um... I do have an idea, but...”\nTrustworthy Hyun-joo hesitated at the end of her sentence. I promptly grabbed her arm, but she avoided my gaze.\n“Tell me! How can I make it up to Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah, actually, now that I think about it, the idea is somewhat problematic.”\n“It’s fine! It’s my mistake, so I’ll take responsibility!”\n“It’s not about taking responsibility or anything like that.”\n“Then at least tell me! I’ll be the judge!”\nMy sister finally spoke, her expression slightly troubled.\n“Well, it might not be appropriate for a minor like you... I’m sorry.”\nMy face flushed instantly.\n“Ah, Sis! What am I going to do if even you’re like this?”\n“I’m sorry, Eun-ha! I momentarily forgot you’re still in high school!”\n“Hey, Shin Eun-ha! Just ask him to go eat pork cutlet like I said!”\n“You be quiet! Does that even make sense?!”\n“Still, how about giving Eunwoo’s idea a chance?”\n“Sis! Why are you siding with him?!”\n“But we don’t have any other options, do we?”\n“I guess so...”\nWas pork cutlet seriously the best solution we could come up with? But then again, Han-gyeol was also male just like my brother.\nI cautiously placed my phone on the dining table.\n“What if he reads it and ignores it? What if he thinks I’m joking?”\n“Hey, Shin Eun-ha. Just trust your brother. If something goes wrong, I’ll take responsibility!”\n“Ah...you’re sure you’re going to take responsibility, right? Should I send it? I’m really sending it!”\n“Ah, just stop being so hesitant and send it!”\nCarefully, I typed out the message to send to Han-gyeol.\n[Han-gyeol, want to grab some pork cutlet tomorrow?]\nAs I was contemplating whether to send it or not, my brother impatiently pressed the send button.\n“Ahhhh! What do we do now that it’s sent?”\n“I did it because you were being indecisive!”\n“Ah! The 2 ticks appeared!”\n“Already?!”\nMy brother, sister, and I all stared at the phone screen. A few seconds later, a reply from Han-gyeol arrived.\n[Sure. What time shall we meet?]\nI held my smartphone and stared hard at my brother.\n“You’re not thinking this is over, are you? Make sure to apologize properly when you meet him~”\n“What should I say when apologizing?”\n“Just apologize sincerely, what’s there to worry about? You overthink things. Sometimes you just have to let it out.”\n“Just let it out? Really? Will that be enough?”\n“If it’s Han-gyeol, he’ll probably accept it.”\nMy brother looked more like a big brother today. Intrigued, I took a discreet glance at him.\n“Ah, this is making me cringe. I’m off to play some games!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I have been studying since this morning.\nGiven that I had to retake the college entrance exams, I really had to invest a lot of time in studying.\nAfter lunch, when I was about to get back to my books, my smartphone buzzed with a message.\n-Vrrrm.\nI hadn’t expected anyone to reach out to me today, but the message was from Eun-ha.\n“Ah, that was quick.”\nI had thought we would catch up on Monday, but here she was, texting me now.\nI swiftly unlocked my phone and read the message, only to shake my head in disbelief.\n[Han-gyeol, want to grab some pork cutlet tomorrow?]\nHmm, is offering pork cutlet the new high schooler way of apologizing?\nThat couldn’t be. Who apologizes with pork cutlet?\nEun-ha must have come to this conclusion after some serious thought on her part.\nBut she decided to apologize by treating me to pork cutlet?\nIt was so cute that I burst out laughing without even realizing it.\n“She’s too adorable.”\nI quickly tapped on my smartphone screen.\n[Sure. What time shall we meet?]\nIt would be perfect if we met and apologized properly, but I didn’t expect much from Eun-ha.\nJust the fact that she was making this effort was satisfying for me.\nI was proud of her for trying, and it was also endearing.\nThis was how we would come to understand each other, little by little.\nAfter all, people couldn’t change overnight.\n[How about 2 p.m. tomorrow? Let’s meet at Sangdong Station.]\n[Alright. So, we’re having pork cutlet for lunch, right?]\n[Yep!]\nI wanted to extend the conversation a little more. But I suspected that Eun-ha thought she had upset me, so I also wanted to tease her a bit.\nAs devilish as it sounded, her reaction would probably be cute, so I decided to end the conversation.\n[Alright then, see you tomorrow.]\nSmirking, I put my smartphone back on the desk.\nI wanted to see Eun-ha right this moment, but I decided to hold back.\nAt least this means she no longer found me burdensome.\nI still didn’t know the depth of her feelings for me, but it felt like we had gotten a bit closer as a man and a woman.\nI would confess my feelings when I think her emotions had grown to an overwhelming extent.\n“Ah, I really need to study.”\nI still had a lot of studying to do for today, and there was also work piled up for tomorrow.\nBut it would all be worth it for tomorrow.\nThe thought of meeting Eun-ha kept a smile on my face.\nIn the end, I put down my pencil for a moment and flopped onto my bed.\nWhat was Eun-ha thinking when she sent that message?\nDid she spend all of yesterday and today pondering how to phrase it?\nJust imagining Eun-ha, flustered and torn about how to reach out, my heart began to pound wildly.\nA sense of relief washed over me that I was making the right moves, while my feelings for Eun-ha grew stronger.\n“Ah, my heart’s going to burst from the excitement.”\nAfter about an hour spent lost in thoughts about Eun-ha, I finally returned to my desk.\n***\nThe next morning, as soon as I woke up, I immediately showered and changed my clothes.\nI even subtly styled my hair while standing in front of the bathroom mirror.\nI also considered changing up my hairstyle but didn’t want to make it too obvious.\nEun-ha might think I’m mad, so maybe I should maintain a neutral expression today.\nOr is that too harsh? Let’s just stick to the usual.\nIt was questionable if I could even keep a straight face in front of Eun-ha.\nBut leaving all of those thoughts aside, I left my house and arrived at Sangdong Station.\nEun-ha was sitting on one of the chairs near the ticket gates, staring intently at something.\nAs I tiptoed behind her, I heard her muttering to herself.\n“Han-gyeol. I’m sorry. This isn’t it. I’m sorry for making you feel this way. No, this isn’t right either. What should I say? I’m sorry for avoiding you, Han-gyeol. What if he ask, ‘Is that all?’ What then? Uh... So Han-gyeol, was I wrong? It’s also the same and doesn’t sound right...”\nShe was uttering the cutest words.\nI had to seal my lips tight to hold back the laughter. And with that, I took a few steps back.\nOnce I was at a distance where I couldn’t hear Eun-ha’s murmuring, I cautiously called out her name.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Ah!”\nStartled, she almost threw her smartphone into the air but managed to catch it just in time.\nShe turned her head, looked at my face for a moment, and quickly stood up.\n“Huh? You’re here?”\n“Yeah, want to go grab some pork cutlet?”\n“Sure, it’s this way. Just follow me!”\nI followed Eun-ha as she trudged along.\nShe still seemed to find it difficult to look me in the eye.\nBut given that she had done so much, it was high time for me to take a few steps forward too.\nI walked up to her side and asked what she did yesterday.\n“What did you do yesterday? Tutoring?”\n“Huh... Yeah, tutoring and... well, some other stuff, but I don’t really remember what.”\n“Oh, is that so? I did some studying and went to bed early.”\n“Aha! Really? You went to bed early? Good job!”\nThe lighthearted conversation continued, but the unspoken words hung heavy in the air. What lay ahead was still uncertain, but for now, we were moving in the right direction.\nHolding back laughter was harder than I thought.\nShe was just too adorable.\nI bit my lip as we arrived at the pork cutlet restaurant.\n“Two pork cutlets, please. Ah—Han-gyeol, do you want to try the cold noodles? They’re supposed to be really good here!”\n“You’ve been here before, Eun-ha?”\n“No? It’s my first time, too. I looked it up online, and this place is supposed to be the best.”\nAh, so she looked up a popular place.\nThis was making my heart flutter in its own way.\n“Alright, let’s have the cold noodles, too. We can share.”\n“In that case, two pork cutlets and one cold noodle, please.”\n“Sure, it will be ready in a moment.”\nAfter Eun-ha placed the order, I passed her the utensils and water.\nShe took a sip, thanking me, while subtly gauging my expression.\nAh—how can I be mad when I’m with someone like this?\nStill, I tried my best to keep a poker face.\nIt would be meaningless if Eun-ha didn’t express what she really thinks.\n“Your food is ready.”\nThe waitress laid the pork cutlets on the table, and Eun-ha kept stealing glances at me.\nShe was likely pondering what to say. Normally, I’d pick up the conversation, but not today. If Eun-ha didn’t share her thoughts, I intended to maintain this atmosphere until we head home.\nStill, I acted as if I wasn’t mad.\nI sincerely responded to the questions she threw my way.\nWe had some back-and-forths, but there was no extended dialogue.\nIn the end, I didn’t get the chance to delve into her thoughts about me until we finished eating the pork cutlets and cold noodles.\nWhen I was about to pay, Eun-ha quickly pulled out her card and paid.\n“I’ll transfer the money to your account, Eun-ha.”\n“No, no! How about we go to a café?”\n“A café?”\n“Yeah. We just had a meal; let’s have dessert at a café. You can pay there, right?”\n“Uh—yeah. Sure.”\nWe went to a café and stood side by side in front of the kiosk.\nI added honey bread and a blueberry yogurt smoothie, which I planned to drink, to our order list.\n“What will you have, Eun-ha?”\n“Um... I’ll have the same as you.”\n“Blueberry yogurt smoothie?”\n“Yes, that one.”\nBoth of us knew that something remained unsaid, but for now, the unspoken words were no match for the sweet treats that awaited us.\nEun-ha usually goes for Hallabong Ade...\nCould this be the mirroring technique?\nOr is Eunha flirting with me?\nNah, Eun-ha isn’t the type to flirt...\nWhy had she suddenly become so unpredictable?\n“Is there something on my face?”\n“No, just wondering. Have you ever had a blueberry yogurt smoothie before?”\n“No? I just wanted to try it since you’re having one.”\n“Oh—okay.”\nDamn it. Calm down, my heart.\nThere were bound to be countless more heart-fluttering moments ahead.\nIf I get like this every time, it’s going to be a tough road.\nContrary to my inner dialogue, my heart was pounding quite fast.\nWe waited next to the counter until the drinks and honey bread were ready.\nWhen I carried the tray filled with our ordered drinks and bread to the table, it was time to talk.\nIt seemed like a good moment to start a conversation, but Eun-ha still appeared hesitant.\nI didn’t want to be the one to break the ice first.\nThen, Eun-ha’s small lips began to move.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“About what you said to me on Friday...”\n“Mhm.”\nThe air grew tense, both of us keenly aware that a pivotal conversation was about to unfold.\nEun-ha finally broached the subject.\nShe looked me squarely in the eyes and, with a deadly serious expression and a heartfelt tone, apologized.\n“I’m really sorry.”\n“Huh?”\n“Yeah... you’re right. I’ve been avoiding you since Wednesday.”\nWith each word that Eun-ha spoke, my heart quivered.\nI hadn’t expected her to apologize so earnestly. Knowing how clumsy she could be with words, I thought she would hem and haw.\n“But it’s not because I dislike you or find you burdensome, like you said. To make you understand, I have to tell you the reason, but it’s a deeply personal matter, making it difficult even to share with you, who are directly involved. But really! Seriously! It’s not because I dislike you or find you burdensome! We became super close as soon as the semester started, and you’ve helped me out a lot... More than anything, I don’t want to distance myself from you. I can’t tell you the reason, but these are my true feelings! But please believe me! I genuinely don’t dislike you.”\nI had never seen this side of Eun-ha.\nNot outside this novel, nor within it.\nStill feeling restless, still finding it hard to express her thoughts openly...\nBut the sight of her desperately conveying her emotions to me was incredibly beautiful.\nI already thought I was head over heels for Eun-ha.\nI thought my affection for her couldn’t grow anymore.\nBut it seemed my feelings were only growing stronger the more time I spent with her.\nThis is a big deal.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Han-gyeol didn’t say anything in response to what I’d said.\nWas my best effort still not enough? Was he still angry?\nAfter pouring out my words, I felt adrift in the ensuing silence. Just as I began to worry that I’d done something wrong, Han-gyeol finally spoke.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Huh?”\n“You said you can’t tell me the reason because it’s personal, right? That’s enough for me. In fact, I wanted to hear you say just that. I appreciate you being honest with me.”\nAs soon as I saw the corners of Han-gyeol’s mouth raising slightly, I turned my head around without realizing it. I tried to hide it, but I could feel my face turn red again.\nI was initially worried that Han-gyeol would feel frustrated because I couldn’t tell him the reason, but now I was really relieved.\n“Thank you for saying that...”\nThe atmosphere felt a little awkward even though I was glad things seemed to be resolving well. We hadn’t had a major fight or anything; we’d merely smoothed out a minor knot.\nThe moment felt both awkward and embarrassing. But I felt relieved because Han-gyeol had accepted it as it was.\n“It’s a bit awkward, huh? haha.”\nHan-gyeol just vocalized what we were both feeling. I couldn’t read his mind, but he seemed like a remarkably clear and straightforward person. Honest and direct, speaking without any pretense. It was seemingly simple but in another way, there was nothing more difficult.\n“Actually, I was thinking the same thing. It’s a bit awkward!”\nIn the hopes of being even just a little like Han-gyeol, I also openly expressed my thoughts.\n“Well, let’s eat then. We haven’t even touched the food we ordered.”\n“Sure, let’s. Ah- I’ll do it. Could you pass me the knife and fork?”\n“Oh, will you? I’m not so good at cutting bread.”\nHan-gyeol who was preparing to cut the bread, handed me the knife and fork.\nAlthough I was not particularly skilled at it either, I did my best to slice the bread neatly.\nAfter that, we each picked up a piece of bread with our forks and ate.\nIt tasted sweet and delicious. Perhaps it tasted better because I was sharing it with Han-gyeol.\n“Ah- right. My sister and brother mentioned they contacted you. Is that true?”\n“Ah- Yes. Hyun-joo Noona asked if I wanted tutoring, and Eunwoo Hyung invited me to play a few rounds of a game, so we played together.”\n“If you feel uncomfortable, please tell me. I’ll talk to them about it.”\n“They both approached me so carefully that I didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. I can sense their consideration.”\n“Hyun-joo Unni being considerate is one thing, but my brother too?”\n“He seemed even more considerate than Hyun-joo Noona.”\nDoes he really idolize Han-gyeol or something? As long as Han-gyeol is okay with it, it doesn’t really matter.\n“Ah- come to think of it, we have our mock exams next week.”\n“Yeah, our first mock exams since entering senior year of high school. I’m a bit nervous.”\n“Just relax and you’ll do fine. Don’t worry too much.”\n“I’d feel guilty if I don’t get a good score. By the way, how do you usually study, Han-gyeol?”\n“I only listen to online lectures. It suits me better. When I can concentrate, I can listen continuously, and when I need a break, I can take one.”\n“You’re quite efficient on your own, aren’t you?”\n“Not always. Somehow, things go better when I’m with someone I’m comfortable with. But you are the only person like that, Eun-ha.”\nI was quite pleased with Han-gyeol’s remark. I even had to resist the urge to break into a big grin.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Yes? What?”\n“Sorry for telling you this late, but there’s some whipped cream on the right corner of your mouth.”\n“What-! Why are you telling me just now?”\n“I was contemplating whether it’s right to tell a girl that she has cream on her face.”\n“You can tell me right away next time!”\nI hastily wiped the right corner of my mouth with a tissue.\n“By my perspective, I meant the right. From your perspective, it’s the left. Haha”\n“Ugh-!”\nEven though I was embarrassed, I couldn’t help but keep staring at Han-gyeol’s smiling face, trying to imprint the memory so I wouldn’t yearn for it when I got home.\nWe continued talking about various things on our way home.\nTo be honest, I wanted to spend more time with Han-gyeol, but I couldn’t be selfish.\n“Then, Eun-ha. See you at school tomorrow.”\n“Yep. Take care, Han-gyeol. Thanks for the drink and bread.”\n“Sure thing. Let’s eat something without whipped cream next time?”\n“Hey!”\n“Haha! I’ll be off. See you tomorrow~”\n“Yep. See you tomorrow.”\nAfter saying goodbye to Han-gyeol, I headed home as well.\nHowever, I couldn’t help but turn around to steal a last glance at his retreating figure.\nLunch and a café visit, and then just straight home... It’s a bit disappointing, isn’t it?\nShould I gather the courage to extend our time together next time?\n****\nWhat greeted me when I returned home was the stuffed animal Han-gyeol had given me.\nI squeezed the doll sitting on the table a few times before flopping onto my bed.\nWhat does Han-gyeol think of me?\nWould giving me handmade chocolate mean he thinks of me as someone special?\nOr is it presumptuous to think that I might be special to Han-gyeol?\nAs those questions swirled in my mind, I cautiously hugged the stuffed animal to my chest, hoping it would calm my racing heart.\nYet, if anything, my heartbeat only sped up even more.\nWhat could Han-gyeol be doing now?\nIs he washing up and lying down on his bed like me?\nContemplating whether to reach out, I finally picked up my smartphone.\nI clicked on Han-gyeol’s profile to check if he had uploaded a profile picture.\nBut there was only the default profile image, same as mine.\nNevertheless, I mustered the courage to send Han-gyeol a message.\n[Did you get home safely?]\nThis should be fine, right?\nBut the gray ticks indicating an unread message disappeared almost immediately.\n[Yeah, I got home safely. How about you, Eun-ha?]\nI was delighted at the swift response.\nLying on my bed, I move my fingers happily.\n[Yeah, I got home safely.]\n[What were you doing?]\n[I was just lying down. How about you, Han-gyeol?]\n[I was also just lying down.]\nThere were no grey ticks appearing in the messaging window with Han-gyeol.\nHe must be staring at our chat, just like me.\nThe realization that we were looking at the same screen made me inexplicably happy.\nWith a joyful heart, I tapped on my smartphone screen.\n[Did you have any plans for today? I called you out so suddenly.]\n[Hmm? No, I didn’t have any particular plans. Thanks for calling me out.]\nWith a sly chuckle, I sent the message.\nHan-gyeol had a way of making everything sound so charming.\nI threw him a joke that was a little out of character for me.\n[If you’re thankful, buy me something delicious.]\n[Sure. I’ll make sure to get something without whipped cream.]\nUgh—\n[A mistake. A mistake. Forget it now.]\n[But I only eat bread with whipped cream.]\n[Stop lying!]\nAh—was that last message a bit too aggressive?\nBut before I could dwell on it, Han-gyeol effortlessly brushed it off with cheeky banter.\n[You’re right. I was lying.]\nI burst into laughter.\nI was sure I was being tased, but I didn’t know why I was laughing?\nI continued our text conversation, grinning all the while.\nTopics ranged from what we ate for breakfast, to locking eyes with a stray cat on our way home, to warnings about catching a cold as the temperature was set to drop next week.\nIn our chat, where the grey ticks indicating an unread message never appeared, Han-gyeol and I kept texting.\nEventually, the subject shifted to profile pictures.\n[Do you never set a profile picture, Eun-ha?]\n[Yeah. I don’t even know what to set, and I haven’t really paid attention to it.]\n[To be honest, me neither. But since it came up, should we try setting one?]\n[What are you planning to use?]\n[Wait and see.]\n[Okay.]\nI waited for Han-gyeol to return to the chat.\nSuddenly, his profile picture changed, and I immediately checked it out.\nIt was a picture of cream bread, and I burst into laughter.\n“Pwahaha! What is this?!”\nAlone in my room, I laughed so hard that I was wheezing. My stomach hurt from laughing so much.\n[How’s my profile pic?]\nHan-gyeol, having changed his profile picture, was back.\nStill laughing, I shot back a reply.\n[Han-gyeol, you better take that down. You brought up the profile picture topic just to do this, didn’t you?]\n[Wasn’t it clever?]\n[You’re in big trouble now?]\n[Okay, I’ll change it quickly.]\n[Yeah, hurry back.]\nI waited for Han-gyeol again.\nBut instead of changing his profile picture, he sent another message.\n[Eun-ha, why isn’t my profile picture changing?]\n[Don’t lie! What would you do if I was able to change it?]\n[Sorry. I’ll hurry and change it.]\n[Come back quickly.]\nHan-gyeol reverted his profile picture back to the default and returned.\n[Now that I’ve tried changing it, how about you give it a go, Eun-ha?]\n[Me? Hmm—give me a moment to think.]\nI paused my texting to ponder.\nMy profile picture had always been the default.\nAs I was contemplating what to choose, my eyes fell upon the blue turtle doll that Han-gyeol had gifted me. I propped it up against the headboard of my bed and took a quick photo.\nI briefly admired the picture in my gallery but ultimately couldn’t bring myself to set it as my profile picture.\nBecause it felt like it would give away my feelings.\nBecause I had tightly embraced this plushie earlier.\n...Because I was clearly thinking of Han-gyeol when I did it.\nMy heart was pounding so loudly that it felt like its sound reached my ears.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Today was the day of the March mock exams.\nThe saying that the March mock exams predict one’s college entrance exam scores still seemed to hold weight.\nA serious atmosphere permeated the expressions of most of the students in the class.\nOf course, Eun-ha was also sitting at her desk, engrossed in her studies.\nShe was so focused that it was impossible to even strike up a conversation with her.\nAfter all, this was the final year before the college entrance exams.\nNaturally, everyone wanted to take their first steps on a positive note.\nHaving gone through the college admissions process once myself, I was also a bit nervous.\nBut to me, a ‘good college’ meant a college where Eun-ha and I could be together.\nSince I hadn’t made many memorable moments in high school, I wanted to make some in college.\nSome might think that was an ulterior motive, but I couldn’t care less.\nWhat I wanted was clear to me, and nothing else needed to be considered.\nAfter becoming an adult, I wanted to experience everything life had to offer with Eun-ha.\nI wanted to drink with her and travel far places with her.\nIf I could do all the things we couldn’t do as students, what could be happier?\nBut what about the military service that comes with adulthood?\nAh... suddenly my future seemed bleak.\nThe thought of having to shave my head again and go back to training camp made me want to die.\nI inadvertently let out a heavy sigh.\n“Ha…”\n“What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing, my future just looked a bit grim for a moment.”\n“Because of the March mock exams? You said you did fairly well last time.”\n“No, it’s a different concern.”\n“Like what?”\n“I’d rather not comment. It’s an insurmountable issue.”\nTalking about military service with Eugene sitting next to me seemed far-fetched.\nThe term military service would probably occupy a minuscule space in Eugene’s mind.\nBut what would Eun-ha do while I would be in the military?\nThere was a saying about love withering away, and most couples did break up.\nWhat do I do then?\nThere was also a saying that distance between bodies leads to emotional distance, too.\nShould I just go ahead and marry first? No, that’s definitely jumping the gun.\nBut if I want to make sure she waits for me, wouldn’t it be best to legally become husband and wife?\nHowever, getting married right after becoming an adult—our parents would never allow it.\nIn the end, I couldn’t clear my mind of these thoughts until the Korean language exam paper was right in front of me.\nRight, worrying now would accomplish nothing; there’s nothing guaranteed or actionable at this moment.\nLet’s think simply.\nThe best course of action was to solve the problems in front of me and dutifully accomplish what needed to be done.\nAnd the thing that needed to be done was ‘How can I make Eun-ha like me more?’\nIt could be through studying hard.\nOr by showing her my best side.\nTo make that kind of effort, I too needed to like Eun-ha more.\nBut strangely, that didn’t seem like it would be a problem.\nI couldn’t explain why, but the size of my increasing love for Eun-ha seemed proportional to the amount of time we spent together.\nInexplicably, I felt that no matter how much time passed, thinking of Eun-ha would always bring a smile to my face.\nWhen I thought of her, nothing else came to mind.\nNot the uncertainty of the future, not the regrets of the past.\nHer smile was enough to make me forget everything else.\nIt made my heart race but calmed my mind at the same time.\n“Alright, start the exam.”\nI opened the exam paper and started answering it swiftly.\nHonestly, I wasn’t confident in Korean language, but I still managed to answer all questions within the time limit.\nEun-ha also seemed a bit drained, slumping at her desk.\nNot wanting to disturb her rest, I didn’t approach her.\nIn the end, the long 100-minute math exam started without us exchanging any words.\nMath was my strongest subject compared to others, so I solved the problems one by one.\nI skipped the excessively difficult questions and carefully tackled the manageable ones.\nThough I tried to solve the last question with the time I had left, it was a lost cause.\nSoon, the test time was up, and the exam papers and OMR sheets were collected by the teacher.\nWith my hands atop my head, I looked over at Eun-ha; she didn’t look pleased.\nIt looked like she didn’t get the result she had hoped for.\nLunchtime had started, but Eun-ha was just staring blankly at the blackboard.\nI wanted to cautiously approach her, but I had no idea what I could say to comfort her.\nThe more one strives, the greater the disappointment hits them.\nI tried to think of words that could console the disappointed Eun-ha, but nothing came to mind.\nSaying that the March mock exams aren’t worth stressing about would feel like negating all of Eun-ha’s efforts up to this point.\nOn the other hand, I couldn’t just say that results are always cold and impartial to someone who had been working so hard.\nDespite pondering, I couldn’t think of anything to say to Eun-ha.\nI considered telling her all of this, but I knew it would just make her feel worse.\nEveryone had gone to have lunch, and only Eun-ha and I remained in the classroom.\nAfter about ten minutes, Eun-ha lifted her head and shifted her gaze toward me.\nThen she slowly walked over and stood in front of my desk.\n“Han-gyeol, I don’t feel so well today. So can you go eat lunch alone?”\n“Huh?”\nShe must be feeling so disappointed that even food wouldn’t settle well.\nSeeing Eun-ha force a smile despite her downcast mood, I couldn’t insist we go eat together.\n“Ah—Alright.”\nHer expression said she wanted to be alone, so I ended up having lunch by myself.\nWhen I returned to the classroom, Eun-ha was lying on her desk.\nI chose not to approach her.\nI didn’t want to bother her unnecessarily.\nBeing with someone doesn’t always make hard times less difficult.\nSometimes you want to simmer down alone, and sometimes you want to sort out your thoughts by yourself.\nThe courtesy of not asking, ‘What’s wrong?’\nThe consideration of not probing, ‘Is something bothering you?’\nThe kindness of not pressuring someone to open up.\nThe discretion of not asking even when you know, and even when you want to know.\nI decided to fill half of such incomplete compassion with quiet patience.\nLunchtime ended, followed by English, Korean history, and politics tests. Now it was time to head home.\nOn my walk home with Eun-ha, not a single word was exchanged on the way.\nIt was filled only with silence.\nWe just moved our feet in mute unison.\nThen I finally heard Eun-ha’s voice at the spot where we always part ways.\n“See you tomorrow, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, take care, Eun-ha.”\n“Sure, you too.”\nWe said goodbye without even the customary cheerful wave.\nI could only watch Eun-ha’s dejected figure walk away.\nEven when I got home, my mind was filled with thoughts of her.\nWould she skip dinner after skipping lunch?\nShould I send her a message?\nIs she flipping her blanket over her head and crying in her room?\nI wanted to suppress my worries, but to do that, I had to contact Eun-ha.\nI wanted to hear her upbeat voice to reassure myself; I wanted to see her smile and say she was fine.\nBut knowing Eun-ha’s selflessness, I couldn’t.\nIf I were to ask if she was okay, she would undoubtedly force a smile and say she was.\nSo asking her if she was okay would only make her feel worse.\nAll I could do was stand quietly beside her when she finally felt better.\nI held my smartphone for a while, worried about Eun-ha, before setting it down on the desk.\nEven during dinner, even while trying to focus on online lectures, Eun-ha was all that occupied my mind.\nI checked my phone several times, thinking she might contact me.\nI even checked the messaging app a few times, worrying I might have missed a message from her.\nStill, as it turned 10 p.m., there was no contact from Eun-ha.\nToday seemed like a day when I wouldn’t be able to reach her.\nFinally giving up, I washed up in the bathroom and returned to my room.\nBeing tired from the mock exam, I decided to go to bed early.\nBut the moment my back touched the bed, my phone on the desk started to ring loudly.\nStartled, I rushed to the desk and picked it up.\nThe smartphone screen clearly displayed, ‘Eun-ha.’\nI swiftly pressed the call button to answer her call.\n“Hello?”\n- Hello. Were you sleeping, Han-gyeol? I’m sorry. I called you so late...\nThrough the phone, I heard Eun-ha’s frail voice.\nThe moment I heard her downtrodden voice, a part of my heart felt cold.\nI wanted to comfort her right away, but regretfully, my stupid self didn’t know what words to utter.\nIn the end, I continued the call with Eun-ha using a very common phrase.\n“No, I don’t go to sleep this early. What’s up?”\nAsking ‘What’s up?’ felt like a mistake.\n‘I should’ve switched to another topic,’ I thought, filled with regret.\nIn a very feeble, yet terribly fragile voice, Eun-ha spoke.\n- I just... felt like calling you, Han-gyeol.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I had miserably failed.\nThe questions weren’t particularly difficult, yet no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find the right answer.\nI should have moved on to the next question, but I stubbornly clung to the problem, thinking I was close to solving it.\nIn the end, I failed to manage my time and, consumed by impatience, couldn’t properly answer the other questions either.\nWhen I got home, I didn’t even bother to check my answers.\nI didn’t want to face what I knew would be a dismal outcome.\nWas it because I didn’t put in enough effort?\nOr did I simply not try hard enough?\nEnveloped by a sense of defeat, I couldn’t bring myself to leave my bed.\nAll I could do was close my eyes and try to sleep.\nAt least when I’m asleep, I don’t have to think about anything.\nBut the despair was so overwhelming that I couldn’t even fall asleep.\nAfter tossing and turning for a while, I went to the bathroom to wash my face and returned to bed.\nFinally, I caught a fleeting moment of drowsiness and fell asleep.\nBut somehow it felt like I had just blinked for a second.\nI was sure I had slept, but it didn’t feel like I had.\nFully awake, I remembered exactly what was on my mind before I drifted off.\nI checked my phone; it was already past ten in the evening.\nI closed my eyes to quickly fall back asleep, but sleep didn’t come.\nI stared at my phone beside my bed, wishing sleep would overtake me.\nBut there was nothing particularly interesting, and it only made my heart ache more.\nI had no one to blame but myself, and there was no one to confide in.\nSo why was it that the first person to come to mind was Han-gyeol?\nWhy did I keep thinking about him so intensely when I was this tired and worn out?\nWhy did I feel this childish need to rely on someone and throw a fit?\nAlthough it was late and I couldn’t see his face, I still wanted to hear his voice.\nNormally, I would have hesitated, but at that moment, I had become a rather selfish girl.\nTap-tap—\nI tapped my phone screen and called Han-gyeol directly.\nThough it felt a little off, and I was about to hang up, Han-gyeol’s voice suddenly came through.\n- Hello?\nHearing Han-gyeol’s voice made me feel a bit sad.\nThe pent-up frustration seemed to be leaking out from within me.\nI held my phone and spoke to Han-gyeol.\n“Hello. Were you sleeping, Han-gyeol? I’m sorry. I called you so late...”\nI apologized for calling at such a late hour.\nHowever, Han-gyeol assured me it was fine without a moment’s hesitation.\n- No, I don’t go to sleep this early. What’s up?\nI couldn’t be honest in answering his question.\nI missed you.\nI can’t see you.\nSo, at least I want to hear your voice.\nUnable to utter any of these feelings, I had to skirt around them.\n“I just... felt like calling you, Han-gyeol.”\nI regretted it as soon as the words left my mouth, afraid he’d think I was being childish. But then I heard his voice right away.\n-I see. Eun-ha, are you planning to go back to sleep?\n“Um? I’d like to, but I slept too much earlier, so sleep’s not coming easily.”\n- Then, do you want to go for a night walk?”\n“Huh? Isn’t it too late for that?”\n- It’s not bedtime for me either. If you’re up for it, I can come by your place.\nIf it were any other day, I would have told him not to come.\nIt was inconvenient, and it was too late.\nBut today, I wanted to accept Han-gyeol’s kind offer.\nI wanted to go for a night walk with him.\nShyly, I agreed.\n“Yes, let’s go for a night walk.”\n- I’ll cycle over, it won’t take long. Get ready.\n“Huh? Ah— Yeah. Come carefully!”\nThe moment I heard Han-gyeol was on his way, I jumped out of bed.\nQuickly changing out of my casual pajamas and into a tracksuit, I stepped outside, shoving a hat onto my disheveled hair.\nIs this too much of an imposition? A moment of regret crossed my mind.\nThen I saw it—a faint glow of light in the distance.\nIt was Han-gyeol, stopped in front of my apartment building, his classic bike blending shades of sky blue and white.\n“Huh? Eun-ha, you’re already outside? I was about to call you.”\n“You got here so fast, Han-gyeol... Be careful riding your bike, don’t speed too much.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind next time.”\n“So, where to for our night walk?”\n“Good question. Anywhere you want to go?”\n“The lake park.”\nIt was a bit far from our houses, but I really wanted to go there. And since he had a bike, I thought I’d ask.\n“If we walk, it would take about 20 minutes.”\n“Why don’t we ride your bike, Han-gyeol?”\n“We could get there faster that way. Are you going to ride on the back?”\n“If you don’t mind.”\nCarefully, I climbed onto the back seat of Han-gyeol’s bike. I knew what this meant—clinging to his waist. It was a somewhat embarrassing action, but...\nRight now, I felt like Han-gyeol would graciously accept my whims.\n“Ready to go, Eun-ha?”\n“Uh-huh. You need to go slowly, okay?”\n“Sure. Still, be careful and hold onto my waist tightly.”\n“Okay.”\nWith a cautious reach, I grasped Han-gyeol’s waist. I wanted to lean against his broad back but restrained myself.\nFor now, all I could do was gaze at his broad back. He looked dependable and mature as he quietly pedaled on.\nI was so glad we decided to take this night walk. The cool air soothed my flushed cheeks.\nMy mind, so clouded with dark thoughts when I was home, cleared the instant I saw Han-gyeol. It was a strange phenomenon—seeing the face of the boy I like could instantly dissolve any gloom.\nIt must be due to Han-gyeol’s kindness, showing up at my doorstep without a word. And more importantly, his considerate treatment of me, without prying, as he always does.\nI should have said I wanted to go farther. Then we could have stayed out longer.\nIt was a night filled with selfish thoughts.\n***\nUpon arriving at Lake Park, we parked the bike and took a short walk through the grounds. Although it was my idea to visit the lake, I felt like I spent more time looking at Han-gyeol’s face.\nThe atmosphere was romantic, just the two of us walking around the lake park late at night.\nI wondered what Han-gyeol was thinking. Was he as conscious of this as I was?\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Hmm? What’s up?”\n“Thanks for coming. And sorry for bothering you.”\n“Hey, no need to apologize. We don’t live that far apart, anyway.”\n“Still, thank you. I was feeling a bit down, but I feel better now.”\n“Well, that’s good to hear.”\nMy eyes darted away the moment I saw Han-gyeol speak, illuminated by the moonlight.\nMy heart was pounding so loudly, that I feared it would drown out the surrounding sounds. But I couldn’t just show him my back, so I faced Han-gyeol again.\n“I messed up my mock exams.”\n“Oh, I see.”\n“I studied hard, but the results were disappointing. I was both mad and sad.”\n“Yeah, that’s completely understandable. You did work hard, after all.”\nHan-gyeol’s soft response was comforting. I was grateful he was just willing to accept my emotions. And his empathetic nature continued to warm my heart.\n“Do you think I worked hard?”\n“Yes, you worked really hard.”\n“I’m not so sure.”\nHan-gyeol halted his steps.\n“Should we sit for a while? I’ve walked a lot.”\n“Sure, there’s a bench over there.”\nAs soon as we sat down on a bench facing the lake, Han-gyeol began to speak.\n“You know, when I don’t feel like I’ve worked hard enough, I convince myself that I haven’t. You’re probably the same. But from what I see, you have worked hard.”\nI listened carefully to Han-gyeol’s words.\n“I mean, you come to school early every morning, you never doze off during class, you even go to the standing desk at the back if you get sleepy. I’ve often refrained from talking to you because you’re always studying even during breaks. So, I’m not forcing you, but I think you should also believe that you’ve worked hard.”\nHan-gyeol avoided eye contact, perhaps a little embarrassed by his heartfelt speech. I also turned my gaze toward the lake.\nSo, he had been watching me all this time.\nHan-gyeol also looked at me from time to time.\nThe person I like had noticed me as well.\nIrrespective of my hard work, that simple fact stayed with me. Embarrassed, I clenched the hem of my pants.\n“Thank you.”\n“Mm.”\n“Really, thank you for saying that!”\nI was looking at the placid lake, but inside, my emotions were anything but calm.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I had just blurted out something somewhat embarrassing.\nIt was precisely at that moment when I was trying to hurriedly switch the topic of conversation.\nGrrr-!\nThe origin of the roaring sound was Eun-ha’s stomach.\nIt was so loud that even the people jogging behind us could hear it... but I knew.\nThat I must never acknowledge that I heard it.\nI spoke casually.\n“It’s Friday tomorrow, so hang in there a bit longer. Take some rest over the weekend.”\n“Hahaha...! Yeah, we both should! It’s getting really late! Let’s head home quickly-”\nGrrr-!\nEun-ha couldn’t finish her sentence and grabbed her stomach.\nI continued to act as though I hadn’t heard, biting my lip tightly.\nHold it in. If I laugh now, it’s over.\n“Shall we?”\n“Yeah! Let’s go home! It’s already late-”\nGrrr-!\nThe sound from Eun-ha’s ‘stomach clock’ grew louder as time passed.\nWell, she did say she skipped lunch and napped during dinner, so she must be really hungry.\nIn such situations, it was better to act like I didn’t hear, but I decided we should get something to eat.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“...Did you hear?”\n“Since when do you think I’ve been hearing it?”\n“Hey-! If you’re going to pretend you didn’t hear, then pretend till the end...!”\n“Puhahaha! Sorry, sorry! Let’s go eat something.”\nI stood up from the bench, looking at a completely flustered Eun-ha who had turned as red as a beetroot.\nThe time was a little past eleven at night.\nI quickly turned on my phone and searched for a 24-hour snack bar nearby, and there was one.\n“Eun-ha, let’s go eat.”\n“It’s probably closed by now...?! And I’m not hungry! I’m fine!”\n“After hearing that ‘Grrr-’ sound three times, I can’t trust you.”\n“Ugh...! Stop teasing! I haven’t eaten anything since lunch...”\nEun-ha, now speaking candidly, looked incredibly adorable.\nI wanted to gaze a little longer at her blushing face, even up to her ears, but I had to restrain myself.\n“Let’s go. It’ll be weird to eat something at home now.”\n“I guess so, but...”\n“Come on. We’ll get there quickly if we go by bike.”\nAs I cautiously extended my hand, Eun-ha grabbed it and stood up.\nI wanted to keep holding her hand, but both of us seemed too shy, so I promptly let go.\n“Don’t we have school tomorrow, Han-gyeol? Isn’t it too late for you to be out? What did you tell your parents?”\n“Huh? I just told them I’d be out for a brief night walk, and they said it’s fine. What about you, Eun-ha?”\n“My parents are busy until the end of this week, and my brother said he’s meeting a friend today.”\n“What-? So you’ve been alone at home this whole time?”\n“Yeah. So what?”\nThinking about Eun-ha feeling lonely in a house where four people live made my heart ache.\nI knew Eun-ha’s parents were busy, and I understood, but it still bothered me a bit.\nThe thought that she might have been lonely made me want to spend more time with her.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hm? What?”\n“If you’re bored, call me anytime, okay?”\n“Haha! Sure. I’ll even call you in the middle of the night then.”\n“Go ahead, go ahead. You can call me anytime, without any reason.”\nI looked down at Eun-ha as I spoke.\nEun-ha’s head turned quickly.\n“I was...I was joking.”\n“I know. Wait a moment, I’ll go get the bike.”\nWhen I brought over the bike, Eun-ha didn’t climb onto the back seat but stared intently at the bike instead.\n“Why?”\n“Hm—Do you think I could carry Han-gyeol?”\n“Wouldn’t it be too much?”\n“Probably...?”\n“Do you still want to try it?”\n“Yes!”\nEun-ha was so enthusiastic that I immediately gave her the bike.\nHowever, the saddle height wasn’t suitable, so I adjusted it first.\n“Han-gyeol, get on.”\n“I feel like I’m risking my life. You know how to ride a bike, right?”\n“Of course. Stop worrying and get on.”\n“Alright, I’ll trust you.”\nI climbed onto the back seat behind Eun-ha.\nBut now that I thought about it, I should have held onto her waist.\nWould it be alright to hold her...? Well, she held me, so it shouldn’t matter, right?\n“Han-gyeol? You’ll fall if you don’t hold on.”\n“A—Ah.”\nI cautiously grabbed Eun-ha’s waist.\nEun-ha pedaled as hard as she could, but it still seemed to be too much for her.\n“Then... let’s get st—Ack!”\nThe bike didn’t move forward.\nEventually, it tilted to the side, and I tightly grabbed Eun-ha’s waist to stabilize us.\nIt was just for a moment, but I almost felt like I was embracing Eun-ha’s slender waist.\nI immediately let go, but Eun-ha also seemed slightly surprised.\n“I—I guess it’s too much after all! Let’s just walk.”\n“Yeah, you carrying me is definitely too much.”\n“Haha... I guess so...”\nIn the end, I walked alongside the bike, and Eun-ha walked next to me.\nI didn’t want to forget the sensation of holding onto her waist just now.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“Was it heavy when I rode on the back of the bike? You can be honest.”\nA lie... Hesitation here could be fatal.\n“No, you were so light I didn’t even notice I was carrying you.”\n“Hahaha! What’s that about!”\nGood.\nI didn’t hesitate for even a second.\nIf I had hesitated, I would have been in big trouble.\n“Was it heavy for you, Eun-ha, when you carried me?”\n“Yes, it was really heavy.”\n“Puhaha! What’s that? Tell me I’m light too.”\n“Ah—! More than being heavy, it felt like, ’Ah, this is definitely a real guy.’”\nFor a moment, my face felt like it was on fire.\nEun-ha had a habit of casually dropping comments like that.\n“Ahem... if that’s the case, then so be it.”\n“Should I have said you’re light?”\n“Not at all? Feeling like a ‘real guy’ is enough for me.”\n“Good to hear. Do you go on night walks often, Han-gyeol?”\n“Night walks?”\nBefore I found myself in this novel’s world, I often took solo walks.\nI’d tire myself out on purpose, took a shower, and went straight to sleep.\nI loved sound sleep as a way to stop thinking about anything.\nBut walking aimlessly alone wasn’t as nice as walking with someone.\nBy dozens, if not hundreds of times.\n“Yep. Do you go on night walks often?”\n“No, I came out to cheer you up, Eun-ha.”\n“Really?”\n“You didn’t know?”\n“I had my suspicions. Anyway, thanks. Seriously. You really lifted my spirits.”\nEun-ha really did look better when she smiled.\nIf she was always smiling, there was nothing I couldn’t do.\nI used to think it was nonsense that someone’s smile could make one happy, but maybe it was not.\n“Is that the snack bar you were talking about?”\nEun-ha pointed to a snack bar with the lights on.\n“Yes, let’s go in.”\n“Great. I’m actually starving.”\n“Haha! But you weren’t making any noises earlier.”\n“Hey-!”\n“Sorry, sorry, just kidding. Let’s go in.”\nAs we walked into the snack bar, Eun-ha was glued to the menu board.\n“What do you want, Eun-ha?”\n“What about you, Han-gyeol?”\nI wasn’t particularly hungry after having dinner, but it’d feel awkward if only Eun-ha ate. So I decided to have a roll of kimbap.\n“I’ll go for pork cutlet kimbap.”\n“Then I’ll have tuna kimbap.”\n“That’s it? Nothing else?”\n“Yep, that’ll do.”\nI felt like it might not be enough, but maybe she wanted to keep it light since it was getting late.\n“Excuse me, we’ll take one roll each of tuna kimbap and pork cutlet kimbap, please.”\n“Sure, I’ll bring it out for you shortly.”\nEun-ha looked slightly delighted at the prospect of getting some food. I couldn’t take my eyes off her as she happily took out her chopsticks.\n“Here’s the kimbap you ordered.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Thanks~”\nEun-ha’s eyes widened at the sight of the two rolls of kimbap. She quickly shoved one piece into her mouth, chewing enthusiastically.\n“Eun-ha, slow down. You’re going to choke.”\nToo busy eating, Eun-ha only nodded her head. When I set a glass of water in front of her, she smiled as if pleased.\nShe looked as cute as a hamster... or perhaps like a charming bunny. But she seemed unaware of her own cuteness. We quickly finished our rolls and left the snack bar.\n“I’m full.”\n“Are you good with just one roll?”\n“Yeah, I’m fine.”\nI checked my phone and realized it was almost midnight. It was time to take Eun-ha home.\n“Let’s start heading back. I’ll walk you home.”\n“Ah... I feel like I’m bothering you.”\n“I can’t let you go alone. I’d worry too much. Let’s go.”\n“Okay.”\nOn the way back, Eun-ha was her usual, cheerful self. Her steps seemed lighter, happier. We quickly arrived in front of her apartment building.\n“Alright, Han-gyeol, I’m heading in.”\n“Sure, take care. Sleep well.”\n“Thanks for today. Seriously. I feel so much better.”\n“Go ahead, it’s getting chilly out.”\n“Do you have your earphones with you?”\n“I’ve got wireless ones, why?”\n“Let’s talk on the phone as you head back. Put your earphones in.”\nAs I took out my earphones and popped them in, Eun-ha waved goodbye with a bright smile.\n“Ready? Go ahead inside. See you at school tomorrow.”\n“Yeah. I’ll call as soon as I get in, okay?”\n“Sure.”\n“See you tomorrow, Han-gyeol.”\nI watched as Eun-ha entered her apartment building and then hopped back on my bike. It wasn’t long before she called me, and I pressed my earphones to answer.\n- Are you on your way?\n“Yep, of course.”\n- How long will it take to get home?\n“About 20 minutes? Why?”\n- I can’t sleep. I thought maybe we could talk a bit more.\n“No way. We have school tomorrow, and you shouldn’t be up too late.”\n- You’re right. We should’ve gone for a night walk on Friday. Then we could’ve stayed up late.\n“Let’s go for a walk next time we have a chance.”\n- That sounds good. I’d like that.\nThat night, I took the long way home.\nEun-ha’s voice was too sweet to part with too soon.\nI wanted to hear more of her voice.\nI wanted to talk a bit more.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "When I opened the classroom door in the morning.\nWhen the homeroom teacher finished speaking.\nWhen the class started.\nOr even when the class ended and it was break time...\nI was always looking around for Han-gyeol.\n“Eun-ha, stop staring.”\n“Huh? What?”\nIn response to my question, Harim cautiously whispered in my ear.\n“Stop staring at Han-gyeol…”\n“What-?! No, I wasn’t! I didn’t look at him!”\n“Do you think I would believe that given the current situation?”\n“What’s the current situation?”\n“It’s quite a difficult situation for you, right?”\nAt that, my eyes widened and I asked Harim.\n“Is it that obvious…?”\n“Yes. Very. Your eyes are practically heart-shaped.”\n“Is it that bad?! Wait, not here, let’s talk somewhere else…”\n“Huh…?”\nI quickly led Harim to a corner of the hallway.\n“Eun-ha, I don’t have any money.”\n“I’m not trying to rob you… Just tell me, when did you find out?!”\n“I had my suspicions, but today I’m certain.”\n“Why?! Why on Earth?!”\nI looked at Harim, clearly agitated.\nHarim shrugged and then relentlessly cornered me.\n“Anyone would notice if you keep staring like that, even if they’re dense.”\n“Do you think Han-gyeol noticed?”\n“My god! You’re not even thinking of denying it? At least try to lie.”\n“Ah... I don’t think you’d believe me even if I lied.”\n“You’re quick to read the situation, huh?”\n“Yeah, I hear that a lot.”\nAs I spoke confidently, Harim stared at me intently.\n“So, are you going to confess?”\n“Wha-?! No! I’m not planning on doing that…yet.”\n“Why? It seems like he’d accept your feelings.”\n“Don’t gamble if you’re not certain. You know what I mean?”\n“Where have I heard that before?”\n“I’m just thinking of taking it slow for now.”\nLast week, I steeled my resolve.\nOf course, that was all I did—no further actions were taken.\nStill, we continued texting over the weekend, so I considered that progress.\n“Shall we go back in? Just act like you didn’t see anything.”\n“Okay. But stop staring.”\n“Hehe... alright.”\nAs soon as I returned to the classroom, I found myself looking for Han-gyeol again.\nHe was seated at his desk, going over a practice test from last week.\nI thought about cautiously approaching him but held back, not wanting to disturb his studies.\nBeing a fellow student prepping for exams, I must exercise some restraint with my feelings. Perhaps this ‘exam-taker’ status serves as an obstacle to becoming Han-gyeol’s significant one.\nWhat am I to Han-gyeol?\nCould I be someone significant enough that there was no need to rush things?\nIn other words... were we in a ‘situationship’ right now?\nCould I be the person Han-gyeol said he likes?\nBut he mentioned he liked them for a long time... it felt like there was some distance between us. Was he just saying things back then? His tone didn’t seem serious either.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah? What is it?”\n“Look out the window.”\n“Why?”\nWhen I looked out, I saw flower buds yet to bloom.\nUpon closer thought, cherry blossoms would be in full bloom next week.\nA time when the world was drenched in shades of pink.\n“How about you both go to a cherry blossom festival?”\n“A cherry blossom festival? Isn’t that a bit much?”\n“What’s excessive about it? Friends can go see cherry blossoms too.”\n“Is that so? Then what should I say to invite him?”\n“That’s something you’ll have to figure out.”\n“Okay. I’ll give it my best shot.”\n“Huh?”\nHarim seemed puzzled by my answer.\n“Why?”\n“I thought you’d be indecisive about what to do.”\n“Ah... well, that’s true, I kind of am.”\n“Hmm- alright. They say love changes people—”\nI quickly covered Harim’s mouth.\nCarefully removing my hand, I whispered to Harim.\n“I think... Because it’s Han-gyeol, it would be okay.”\nBecause Han-gyeol accepts my heart as it was.\nHe accepts my honest thoughts and honest feelings as they were.\nThat was why I could be honest with Han-gyeol.\nI won’t be clumsy anymore.\nI won’t think and judge alone anymore.\nSlowly. But not too late.\nI was planning to approach.\n****\nAfter all the classes were over, I went over to Han-gyeol’s seat first.\nStudying together in a classroom with just the two of us was more enjoyable than I thought.\nI felt like I studied well when I was with Han-gyeol.\nIt was nerve-wracking, but there was also a comfort I felt from Han-gyeol being next to me.\nAlthough turning my head occasionally revealed Han-gyeol in deep concentration, giving me heart palpitations.\nSo I had to work harder.\nIf anyone said my grades dropped because of my affection, I’d be angry.\nI had to work harder and give my best, to show that my love for Han-gyeol had made me a better person.\nFor my sake and for Han-gyeol’s, my grades needed to rise again.\n“Ugh! This is tough.”\nHan-gyeol paused his studies and stretched widely.\n“What’s not working?”\n“Huh? Oh— I’m having a hard time reading the Korean passage. It takes me a long time to work on non-literary texts. I’m already 50 seconds over.”\n“Do you have, like, your own way of marking things, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? Marking? You mean like underlining?”\n“Mm— can you show me the passage you were working on?”\n“Here.”\n“Is it okay if I make some marks?”\n“Go ahead.”\nAt a glance, it seemed that Han-gyeol only underlined when working through non-literary passages and didn’t make any other markings.\nI read the non-literary passage that Han-gyeol had been working on from top to bottom.\nI made various annotations here and there, as I had my own system and was pretty confident in Korean.\n“So Han-gyeol, you only underline when you read non-literary passages?”\n“I underline parts I think are important, yes.”\n“Ah— This is something I learned from my sister Hyun-joo. Take a look.”\nI kindly explained to Han-gyeol,\n“I put squares around definitions of terms, then underline the explanation that follows. Keywords get circled. When words like ‘however’ appear, I mark a ‘V’. And you know how non-literary passages about ideas sometimes feature opposing views? I label those as A, B to easily compare their characteristics. Doing this cuts down time when you have to refer back to the passage.”\nUpon hearing me, Han-gyeol looked at me with amazement.\n“That makes sense. It’ll definitely be easier to review the passage later this way.”\n“Yep. That’s how I do all my non-literary questions.”\n“What do Q and A stand for here?”\n“Oh, Q marks problems or questions brought up in the passage, and A marks solutions or answers.”\n“Nice… This feels like the right way to study. Thanks.”\n“You don’t have to follow my markings exactly. Just do whatever works for you.”\n“Mm— No, I want to do it the way you showed me. It’s easier to see. Can I ask again later?”\n“Huh? Sure, anytime!”\nI felt good about it.\nIt seemed like I had genuinely helped Han-gyeol, and moreover, he would be using the same annotations as me.\nI felt somewhat shy at the idea of melting into a small part of Han-gyeol’s life.\n“Studying with Eun-ha really seems to make a difference.”\n“Really? I also feel like I study well when I’m with Han-gyeol.”\n“Then we should study together often.”\n“Yeah. I like that idea. How about we do it every Saturday?”\n“Huh?”\nAh— did I come on too strong?\nI thought it would be fine.\nWas suggesting we meet on weekends too much?\n“Ah— never mind. Weekends are probably—”\n“No, I’d really like that. I enjoy studying with Eun-ha. But I’m not bothering you, am I?”\n“Not at all! Studying with Han-gyeol is good for me too, and you teach me a lot!”\n“Alright? Then we’ll start studying together this week.”\nI felt like I had said the right thing.\nTruth be told, the goal was the cherry blossom festival next Saturday.\nWe could at least see the cherry blossoms on our way home from studying, right?\nI started to feel a bit excited.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hm? What’s up?”\n“I know it’s weird to say this right after we decided to study together, but—”\n“Mm-hmm.”\n“Would you like to go see the cherry blossoms next week?”\nI was so taken aback that I flinched.\nWas he thinking the same thing I was?\nCould this be another of Han-gyeol’s cunning schemes?\nDid I give myself away?\n“Cherry blossoms?!”\n“Yeah, cherry blossoms.”\n“Um... When?!”\n“Next Saturday, for a bit?”\nThis is…\nHe must have been thinking the same thing.\nThere was no reason to decline, after all.\nYes, I would love to.\n“Sure, I’d like to.”\n“Great. I won’t take up too much of your time. So let’s study hard until then?”\n“Yeah! I’ll study from here... to here!”\nI grabbed a hefty portion of the reference book’s pages.\nFor the sake of the cherry blossoms, I had to handle this much studying.\nBesides, it felt like studying this way would be more effective.\nIt was always better to study when there was a clear reward.\n“Is it not too much, right?”\n“Not at all. I wanted to go see the cherry blossoms too. But we can’t neglect our studies, so I’ll study up to here.”\n“Haha—! Okay, then I’ll also do from here to here.”\n“Isn’t that too little?”\n“Huh? Isn’t this much already a lot, Teacher?”\nBeing called ‘Teacher’ amused me a bit.\nI added a few more pages to the portion that Han-gyeol had selected.\n“Then, Student Lee Han-gyeol, you should do from here to here~”\n“That’s too much. Cut it down.”\n“Hehe, no. Can’t do.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Is there anyone here who got the first grade in math on the March mock exams? If you’re here, come up and solve this problem.”\nIt was third period, math class.\nThough the results weren’t officially out yet, I could roughly estimate my grade by looking at the cutoff scores.\nMath had always been a strong subject for me, and luck had been on my side this time, landing me in the first-grade score range.\nIn other words, I was precisely the person our math teacher was looking for.\nHowever, my judgment was to keep my mouth shut during times like these.\n“Hey, Lee Han-gyeol, didn’t you have first grade in math? Why aren’t you raising your hand?”\n“Keep it down, dude. It’s better to lay low at times like this…”\nWhat I had learned in society was that drawing attention to yourself could often lead to a backlash.\nStaying unnoticed and blending in was essential for survival. Boasting about my skills or capabilities was best avoided.\nThen, suddenly, Jang Yujin raised his hand and proudly declared,\n“Teacher, my desk-mate is the Newton of our class.”\nThis punk?\nI’ll see him later.\n“Oh, really? Then come up and solve this problem. Let’s see the Newton’s skills.”\n“Teacher, I’m a math-phobe. All I can do is punch numbers into a calculator.”\n“Quit the nonsense and come up to solve it.”\n“Yes.”\nAll eyes in the class turned to me.\nFeeling that staying seated would be more disadvantageous, I eventually went to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk.\n“Solve this problem. You can’t just write down the answer.”\n“Sure.”\n“What’s ‘sure’? Do you think you’re some office worker?”\nThe class chuckled at the teacher’s joke.\nHearing the laughter, I felt the tension rise. I had never been the type to enjoy being the center of attention.\n“Ah- I’ll, I’ll solve it.”\nI looked at the problem and silently wrote down the equation.\nI wanted to finish quickly, anticipating another of the teacher’s awkward jokes if I took too long.\nFinally, I wrote the answer in a corner of the board and told the teacher,\n“I’ve solved it.”\n“Never mind the explanation, is the answer 4? Are you sure? Double-check.”\n“It seems correct.”\n“Seems correct? Are you sure? Is it right or not?”\nUgh—There’s always at least one teacher who enjoys these frustrating games.\n“I’m sure.”\n“What will you do if you’re wrong?”\n“There’s no way I’m wrong.”\nMy confident declaration elicited a chorus of awe from my classmates.\nI had to clench my eyes shut to endure the ‘Oohs’ and ‘Aahs’.\n“How did you know it had a repeated root?”\n“The function has an absolute value applied to a quadratic function... If a quadratic function has a repeated root, it should be differentiable.”\n“Perfect. Nice to meet you, Newton.”\nHaa, this math teacher is tough.\n“Ah... Yes, I’ll go back to my seat.”\n“Well done.”\nEven as I returned to my seat, I felt some lingering gazes.\nAh—this is precisely why I hate going up to the board.\nOnce seated, I glared at Jang Yujin.\n“Hey Newton, what’s up?”\n“Don’t call me something weird.”\nThe rest of the math class proceeded smoothly.\nHowever, as soon as class ended, I found myself entangled in something annoying.\nThe guy sitting in front of me asked for help with a math problem.\n“Newton, can you explain this problem to me?”\n“Don’t call me that. And have you tried looking at the solution manual?”\n“I just did. Still don’t get it.”\n“Too bad. Show it to me.”\nI was not particularly good at teaching, but it was easy because the guy who asked knew precisely what he didn’t understand.\nSo, I spent my break time not actually taking a break but explaining a math problem to my friends.\nThe real issue was that this little spark ignited by Jang Yujin seemed to be turning into a bigger fire.\nDuring the next break, a girl I rarely spoke to came up to ask about another math problem.\n“Han-gyeol, can you help me with this?”\nWhile she was asking about a math problem, I faced a dilemma.\nDeclining harshly could label me a cold person, which concerned me.\nBut neither did I want Eun-ha to see me helping another girl with her studies.\nThese kinds of situations usually lead to misunderstandings.\nSo, this was my conclusion.\n“I’m sorry. I don’t know how to solve this problem either. If you figure it out, could you let me know too?”\n“Ah—sure, I will.”\nIf I say I didn’t know, that should be the end of it.\nIt was not like I was inviting trouble into my life.\nSatisfied with my deft handling of the situation, I sneaked a glance at Eun-ha.\nWhoosh—\nShe turned her head away.\nDid I mess up?\n***\nAfter the fourth period, I had lunch with Eun-ha.\nI was thinking of spacing out a bit after brushing my teeth when Eun-ha approached with her textbook and notebook.\n“Han-gyeol, I have some questions to ask. Can you help?”\n“Uh? Sure.”\nShe usually asked after all the school lessons were over, but today she asked during lunchtime.\n“I hope you don’t mind—it’s a lot, actually. It might take up the whole lunch break.”\n“Why worry about that? Just tell me what don’t you get?”\n“Ah—there’s quite a bit, so let’s take it slow. This and this...and also this and this one...”\n“Yeah, that is quite a lot. But it’s fine. Alright, let’s go step by step.”\n“Mhm.”\nAs I wrote down the solution on my notebook, I explained each step in detail to Eun-ha.\nWhenever I clarified my approach, she nodded and listened attentively.\nBy the time we finished all the questions, there were barely ten minutes left of lunch break.\nGuess it wasn’t an exaggeration to say it’d take the whole time?\n“Han-gyeol, I’m sorry. I made you spend your whole lunch break on me.”\n“Nah, it’s fine. And the questions were pretty tough, so it was a good review for me too.”\n“Ah—but would you mind if I bring more questions next break?”\n“Aren’t you working too hard lately? Take it easy, you’ll wear yourself out.”\n“No, I can’t afford to fail twice.”\n“Alright, alright.”\nHelping someone who was working hard was a natural course of action.\n“Oh right, do you have any candy, Han-gyeol?”\n“Of course. Want one? Didn’t you just brush your teeth?”\n“Um—a single candy should be fine. Just one, please.”\n“Okay, here.”\nI pulled a candy from my pocket and handed it to Eun-ha.\n“Do you always carry around multiple candies?”\n“Hmm, not sure about the exact number, but I always have some.”\nEun-ha and I planned to spend the remaining 10 minutes in such idle chatter.\nJust then, the girl who had asked me a math question during the previous break approached my seat with her reference book in hand.\nI was having a rare one-on-one conversation with Eun-ha—what impeccable timing.\n“Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What is it?”\n“What do you mean ‘what is it?’ You said to let you know if I figure out the question.”\n“Ah—right, right. There isn’t much of a lunch break left, but that should be okay?”\n“The time’s not the issue... if you’re talking with Eun-ha, we can do it later.”\nQuite an observant friend, huh?\nBut it seemed that Eun-ha had different thoughts.\n“Huh? I’m curious too, is it okay to explain it to both me and Han-gyeol?”\n“You too, Eun-ha?”\n“Yeah. If it’s a problem that Han-gyeol can’t solve, I probably can’t solve it either.”\n“Um... Okay.”\nThe girl from class sat across from both Eun-ha and me.\n“Ah, I was planning to write it down as I explained. Eun-ha, can I borrow your notebook?”\n“Sure, sure! Feel free to use it.”\nEun-ha promptly handed over her notebook.\n“Thanks. Alright, let me explain. This problem initially—”\nThe girl started detailing the solution on Eun-ha’s notebook. However, midway through, I felt like I got the gist of how to solve it. It would be awkward to cut her off, so I just nodded along.\nBut then, something odd caught my eye in Eun-ha’s notebook.\nIt looked like the math problem Eun-ha had asked me about earlier was already solved on it. But it wasn’t even in my handwriting, and the notebook I used to help her understand was my own.\n“Han-gyeol, were you listening?”\n“Huh? Of course, I was. Thanks for explaining it to me.”\n“Sure, I’ll head back now. If you have more questions later, just ask, okay?”\n“If I have a problem, I’ll ask you. Thanks for coming over to explain it.”\n“Alright.”\nSo, the girl who had asked about the problem returned to her seat. The class was almost over, so Eun-ha began to pack her stuff too. She picked up the reference books and pencil case she had brought, and just as she was about to pick up her notebook, my hand gently landed on it.\n“Huh? Why?”\nWith a puzzled look on her face, Eun-ha stared at me as I spoke with a sly grin.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“What?”\n“From now on, only bring questions you don’t know the answers to, okay?”\nFor a moment, Eun-ha flinched, and her face slowly started to turn red.\n“I, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”\n“No, it’s just that you seem to understand things so well.”\n“The bell is about to ring! I’m going back to my seat!”\nEun-ha hurriedly grabbed her notebook and fled back to her seat.\nWhen will I confess? How many kids should we have, and what would be good names for them?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I admit, the jealousy I felt seemed a bit odd, even to me.\nIt was strange that I, who was not even Han-gyeol’s girlfriend, would feel jealous.\nBut whenever Han-gyeol talked to another girl, a part of my heart ached.\nI wished that a part of his heart would ache too, whenever he saw me talking to another guy.\nWishing for the guy I like to feel heartache... it was an incredibly selfish thought.\nEven though I couldn’t make the person I liked happy, there I was, harboring these terrible thoughts.\nI knew it was a selfish feeling, but I couldn’t help but feel like it.\nI wished he would only talk to me; I wished he would only study with me.\nI wondered if Han-gyeol had a vague sense of how I felt.\nDid he pick up on it when he saw me asking questions about problems I already knew the answer to?\nI was nervous about whether he catch on, but I also wished he would.\nIf he was caught on and saw me as more than a friend, I hoped he came a little closer to me.\nI hoped he approached me a bit more boldly, without any caution.\nI hoped he came close enough that even someone as oblivious as me could be sure of it.\nOf course, I was making an effort too.\nHoping to convey how I felt, I took various actions.\nFor example, during class, I occasionally look at Han-gyeol instead of the blackboard.\nI could keep looking at Han-gyeol, diligently taking notes with his gaze fixed on the blackboard.\nOccasionally, when he yawns, I thought he looked really cute.\nThey say when a girl finds a guy cute, it’s game over.\nI didn’t know who said it, but it felt true.\nI wanted to be Han-gyeol’s girlfriend.\nI wanted to be in a relationship where I could boldly tell him not to talk to other girls.\nBut there was more than one thing troubling me.\nThe fact that we were both students preparing for exams.\nThe lack of assurance that I was the girl Han-gyeol liked.\nThe possibility that all my current speculations might be baseless.\nAbove all, there was the risk that we might end up worse off than strangers to each other.\nSo, I was slowly approaching Han-gyeol.\nI was not sure if I was doing it right. I hoped it was not burdensome for him?\nI was sorry to the teacher lecturing passionately at the front, but I couldn’t focus on the class.\nMy mind was already filled with Han-gyeol; there was no room for anything else.\nHan-gyeol was undoubtedly a good person.\nNot just from my subjective viewpoint, but objectively as well.\nIn other words, there might be other girls who shared my feelings for him.\nThere could be a girl who fell for him at first sight, watching him solve math problems effortlessly during class.\nMy heart was racing, and I was pondering how to calm it down.\nIn the end, I couldn’t concentrate, and the fifth period ended as such.\n“Eun-ha, what are you thinking so deeply about?”\nHarim, who noticed my lack of focus, asked me.\n“Huh? Oh, it’s nothing.”\nHarim looked around and whispered.\n“Were you thinking about Han-gyeol again?”\nI was embarrassed, but cautiously nodded my head.\n“At this point, it’s not even surprising.”\nMm—since the topic came up, I decided to ask Harim something.\n“Hey, Harim. I have something I want to ask you.”\n“Huh? Is it about studying? Because that could be tricky. You might get mad at me.”\n“No, it’s not about studying... um... wanna go to the canteen? We can talk while we’re there.”\n“Sure, let’s go and come back quickly.”\nI left the classroom with Harim and headed toward the canteen.\nAfter passing by the crowded bathrooms, I cautiously asked her.\n“Do you think Han-gyeol is good-looking?”\n“Hmm...? Why are you suddenly asking that?”\n“I just want to hear what you think about how Han-gyeol looks, objectively speaking.”\nHarim seemed momentarily perplexed by my question.\nStill, she candidly expressed her thoughts.\n“To be honest, he’s pretty attractive, isn’t he?”\n“Right? You think so too, Harim?”\n“Yeah. He’s good at basketball, good at studying... It doesn’t seem like there’s much he can’t do, you know? It feels like he’s above average in everything?”\nI nodded again.\nI was well aware that Han-gyeol was a jack-of-all-trades.\nHe could assemble computers, make chocolate, and even handle household chores!\nHan-gyeol was objectively a really great guy, through and through.\nThe thought that I might not be the only one smitten with him became even more pronounced.\n“Plus, Han-gyeol is so kind, gentle, and considerate,” I said.\n“That’s true. He seems like a deep thinker,” Harim responded.\n“Exactly! That’s what makes him seem so mature.”\n“Do you think he’s unusually mature for a high school student? Though, I’m not exactly sure where I get that impression.”\n“Yeah, it’s probably just something ingrained in him,” I said, agreeing with Harim’s statement.\n“So, why? Are you worried that some other girl might like Han-gyeol?”\nHarim had hit the nail on the head.\nBut since I’d already mentioned it to her, I nodded.\n“Hmm. I don’t think you have any reason to be anxious.”\n“Well, I don’t know if it’s anxiety, or jealousy, or what... I’m not even sure what I’m feeling,”\n“Regardless, I don’t think you have anything to worry about.”\n“Why?”\n“Because, from what I can see, I think Han-gyeol likes you,” Harim added, lending credibility to her speculation.\n“Wait, you think Han-gyeol seems to like me, from what you’ve seen?”\n“I can’t say for certain, but that’s the vibe I’m getting.”\n“Can you tell me specifically what gives you that impression?”\n“Well, there are quite a few things. For starters, the way he looks at you?”\n“The way he looks at me?”\nI tilted my head in curiosity.\n“The way Han-gyeol looks at you is different from how he looks at other people.”\n“Really? Can you elaborate?”\n“You probably haven’t noticed since Han-gyeol always smiles at you, but he’s not that expressive? He doesn’t smile much.”\n“What? Han-gyeol smiles a lot! He’s always so cheerful.”\n“Really? I’ve never seen him smile when he’s not with you. The only other time is maybe a brief smile while playing basketball?”\nHarim’s observations added another layer of credence to her claim.\nI wanted to hear more from Harim.\nI looked at her intently, my eyes practically begging her to continue.\n“More than anything, when he looks at you, it’s like he’s looking at something adorable?”\n“What? No way, it can’t be that much, can it?”\n“He looks at you like you’re a cute little animal or something.”\n“A little animal?”\n“Yeah. Anyway, since we’re at the canteen, let’s buy something.”\n“I’ll get it!”\n“Fine, then I’ll just have one drink.”\nI hurriedly paid for the drinks with my card. We continued our conversation as we returned to the classroom, using the canteen as a sort of pit stop. Harim elaborated further on her thoughts.\n“He gives only you orange-flavored candies. To me, it seems like Han-gyeol is trying to express his feelings for you in his own way.”\n“What if you are just imagining things?”\n“I think the chances of that are slim.”\n“Mm-hm! Anyway, thanks for the help!”\n“Well, I did get a free drink out of this. Let’s hurry; we’ll be late.”\nThe sixth period felt clearer in contrast to the fifth, which was laden with heavy thoughts.\nCould it be true, what Harim said? That Han-gyeol likes me? If we both like each other, that would be more than fantastic.\nHowever, despite my cheerful thoughts, the clear sky had suddenly darkened.\nUgh, just when I was feeling good. When something unexpected like this happens, it makes me uneasy.\nThe weather forecast had said it would be clear all day. But it didn’t matter since I had an umbrella in my bag anyway.\nAs the seventh period started, raindrops began to fall. I looked out the window momentarily at the sound of rain tapping against the glass. It didn’t seem like it would stop soon.\nDid Han-gyeol bring an umbrella? I hoped he hadn’t, so we could share mine on the way home.\nAs the seventh period ended with the sound of rain, Harim looked out the window and asked me,\n“It’s raining pretty hard. Do you have an umbrella?”\n“Yeah, I have one in my bag.”\n“Isn’t it heavy to carry around all the time?”\n“I get used to it, so it’s fine.”\nWhile talking to Harim, Han-gyeol walked over to my seat. Quickly, before our homeroom teacher returned, he asked me,\n“Eun-ha, do you have an umbrella?”\nI immediately countered his question.\n“Hm? Do you have one, Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah, I always have one in my bag. You don’t have one?”\nI had just told Harim that I had an umbrella. But without a second’s hesitation, I lied.\n“That’s right, I don’t have one.”\n“Really? Then let’s share mine. I’ll walk you home.”\n“Okay, thanks! Our teacher is coming; go back to your seat.”\n“Alright.”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol hurried back to his seat, Harim looked at me with a mischievous smile.\n“Then what was that you just told me earlier?”\nI hurriedly brought my index finger to my lips and said,\n“Shh—”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was on my way home with Eun-ha, who said she didn’t have an umbrella.\nFortunately, I always kept an umbrella in my locker, just in case.\nTo be honest, I was expecting something like this to happen someday, but it came sooner than I thought.\nBut there was one problem.\n“Eun-ha, your shoulder is getting really wet.”\n“It’s okay! Since it’s your umbrella, it’s natural that you don’t get wet. Don’t worry about me! I actually like the rain.”\n“But you should come a little closer—”\n“It’s okay! Really!”\nEun-ha was insisting, even as her shoulders got soaked.\nOn the other hand, not a drop of rain touched my shoulders.\nWasn’t it normal for a guy’s shoulder to get wet at times like this?\nThat was usually how it goes.\nUsually, it was the guy whose shoulders get wet, and the girl finds it romantic.\nWhy was it the opposite now? But, it was strangely heart-fluttering.\nStill, I couldn’t let Eun-ha, the girl I like, keep getting drenched.\nIn addition, at this rate, Eun-ha would be soaked through by the time we get to her house.\nThinking that, as I subtly tilted the umbrella toward her, Eun-ha quickly grabbed my hand that was holding it.\n“Really, it’s fine! It’s natural that you don’t get wet!”\n“I get it, because I’m the one with the umbrella. But I won’t catch a cold or anything, so it’s okay.”\n“No. I can’t let your shoulder get wet. Absolutely not.”\n“I don’t understand. Why are you so stubborn about this?”\n“Let’s call it a matter of conscience.”\n“Conscience?”\n“Yes, it’s a thing! Seriously, you should not get wet!”\nEun-ha pushed my hand away desperately.\nShe was stubborn in the strangest ways.\nNo choice then.\n“Fine, we’ll do it like this.”\nCarefully, I placed my hand on Eun-ha’s wet shoulder and pulled her under the umbrella.\nAs I did so, I spoke without taking my hand off her now-soaked uniform.\n“If we walk shoulder-to-shoulder, we won’t get wet, right?”\n“Uh, well... that’s true, but—”\n“Do you want to walk shoulder-to-shoulder? Or should I gallantly keep you dry with an umbrella?”\n“I want to walk shoulder-to-shoulder.”\n“I thought so— Wait, what?”\nShe wants to walk shoulder-to-shoulder?\nWe are not even dating, are we?\nDid I hear that wrong?\n“I want to walk shoulder-to-shoulder.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes. Really?”\n“Why?”\n“Because I can’t let your shoulder get wet!”\nWhat’s going on? Why is she so proactive?\nIs she that against getting my shoulder wet?\nI couldn’t tell if it was out of goodwill or personal interest.\nEither way, I was happy to walk shoulder-to-shoulder with Eun-ha.\n“Alright.”\nOnce we actually started walking shoulder-to-shoulder, the atmosphere turned awkward.\nEun-ha’s unexpected reaction had caught me off guard.\nWe weren’t even holding hands, but every time Eun-ha’s body brushed against my arm, my heart skipped a beat.\nI felt like we should talk about something, but I couldn’t think of anything to say.\nWait, are we seriously going to walk like this all the way home?\nIsn’t she embarrassed? I’m incredibly embarrassed.\nIsn’t this a physical contact? Or is shoulder-to-shoulder okay?\nPersonally, I’d consider even this to be a form of physical intimacy.\n“Do you like rainy days, Han-gyeol?”\nI used to dislike them, but it seemed that was going to change from today.\n“Um—kind of. Do you like rainy days, Eun-ha?”\n“Yeah. There’s something nice about the smell of rain. It feels somewhat emotional, you know?”\nPerfect—this moment was exactly that: emotional.\nWalking shoulder-to-shoulder under a small umbrella on a rainy day.\nIt’s so youthful, isn’t it?\nThe only drawback was that Eun-ha’s shoulder was soaking wet.\n“There’s definitely an emotional vibe.”\nWith that, our conversation came to another halt.\nI should’ve said I like rainy days, had I known this would happen.\nWithout exchanging any more words, Eun-ha and I simply synchronized our steps.\nIt was awkward, but my heart was fluttering.\nIf someone saw Eun-ha and me right now, would they think we were just friends?\nWouldn’t we look like a young couple, sharing an umbrella as we head home?\nI stole a glance at Eun-ha’s face, and noticed her cheeks were a shade pinker, as if she were embarrassed too.\nNot wanting to break the mood, I simply walked toward Eun-ha’s home.\nI wanted to savor this heart-fluttering moment just a little bit longer.\nI hoped Eun-ha’s heart was pounding as fiercely as mine.\n“Turns out this is a bit embarrassing after all...”\n“Hm?”\nWhen I showed my confusion, Eun-ha looked into my eyes and asked,\n“Are you... embarrassed too?”\nSo this is what it feels like when your heart sinks... It’s way more devastating than I thought.\nCould it be the added emotions of the rainy day?\nOr perhaps it was Eun-ha’s shampoo scent, subtly gracing the tip of my nose.\nUnable to quell my racing heart, I turned my head outside the umbrella.\nBut Eun-ha swiftly tugged at the hem of my shirt, urging an answer.\n“Why aren’t you answering? Answer me.”\n“Uh...?”\n“Are you embarrassed or not?”\nWith an expression begging for a quick response, Eun-ha looked up at me.\nKnowing she’d press for an answer until she got one, I swallowed hard and said,\n“I’m incredibly embarrassed.”\n“I thought so.”\nEun-ha softly stepped away from me.\nI also lowered my hand from her shoulder.\nRegrettable as it was, we couldn’t continue walking shoulder-to-shoulder.\n“But like you said, my shoulders will keep getting wet, so let’s walk a little closer.”\n“Alright, let’s do that. I can’t have Eun-ha catching a cold.”\n“I hardly ever catch colds! I’m super healthy.”\n“Sure, sure.”\nI had to steer the conversation quickly so that my flustered state wouldn’t be discovered.\nAfter some thought, I blurted out something trivial.\n“We should eat pajeon* on rainy days.”\n“Pajeon is good! Do you know how to make them?”\n“Uh? No, never tried making any kind of pajeon.”\n“Ah, me neither, I’m terrible at cooking.”\n“That happens, you know.”\nWe awkwardly laughed while my mind scrambled for another topic.\nWell, we were almost at Eun-ha’s house, so I didn’t really need to stress about finding something to talk about.\nIt was the moment we reached the final stretch of road leading to Eun-ha’s house.\nThe narrow pathway was filled with puddles from the rain.\nChecking for any cars behind us, I noticed a car approaching at a slightly fast pace.\nNot wanting to get splashed, I discreetly steered us toward the edge of the road.\nFortunately, the car seemed to notice us, slowed down, and passed without incident.\nJust when I thought we had averted—\nTripped!\n“Ah!”\nI stumbled over a protruding brick on the sidewalk and tumbled forward.\nHolding an umbrella made it impossible to break my fall with my hands, and I landed face-first in a puddle.\n“Ha, Han-gyeol?!”\n“You’ve got to be kidding me…”\nCarefully picking up the umbrella, I stood and quickly held it over Eun-ha.\n“Is it time to cover me with the umbrella? Are you alright?”\n“I’m fine. I’m not hurt.”\n“What do we do... Your uniform is soaked.”\n“I’ll just have to wash it.”\nWhile neither my hands nor any other part of me were injured, my uniform was thoroughly drenched.\nEun-ha looked deeply concerned, more than the situation seemed to warrant.\n“I’m sorry! It’s all because I made you walk me this far.”\n“Don’t worry about it. I’m not hurt, and I can just shower when I get home.”\n“But doesn’t it take about 15 minutes to walk from here to your place?”\n“It’s not that far. I’ll just walk a little faster.”\n“Shower at my house! I’ll lend you my brother’s clothes!”\n“I think we’re talking about something weird.”\nEun-ha seemed to prioritize her moral code over her embarrassment.\nOnce again, she grabbed the hem of my shirt with a determined expression.\n“Still, this happened because I asked you to walk me! So you should let me take responsibility!”\n“What if I leave my umbrella here and run home?”\n“I’d chase after you with everything I have! Now, let’s go to my place.”\nEun-ha snatched the umbrella from me and grabbed my wrist with her free hand.\nHer grip was light enough for me to easily pull away, yet I found myself letting her lead.\nI’d been to her house before, and I knew her family, so they would probably understand.\n“Is Eunwoo Hyung home? I wonder if his clothes will fit me.”\n“Hm? He said he’s meeting a friend today, so he probably won’t be there.”\n“A quick call should do it, then. Your mom will be surprised when she sees me.”\n“My mom went out for a gathering at lunchtime; she won’t be there either.”\n“Ah, I see… Wait, what?!”\nI stopped and looked at Eun-ha.\n“So, you’re saying no one is at home right now?”\n“Yeah, what’s the issue? Isn’t it more convenient if nobody’s there?”\n“It’s inconvenient in another sense! How can I go into a house where a girl is alone?”\n“What choice do we have? My house is right there; you can just take a shower.”\n“I can’t do that. I’ll just go home and shower.”\nI promptly turned to leave, but Eun-ha desperately grabbed my bag.\n“No, you can’t go! I led you into this mess; I have to take responsibility! I can’t let you go, I’d feel too guilty!”\n“Eun-ha, you do realize it’s risky to let a grown man into a house where a woman is alone, right?”\n“Of course! But you’ve been to my house before, so it’s an exception. Plus, you’re not dangerous.”\nThat was Eun-ha’s perception.\nMen can always become a risk.\n“But back then, there was someone at home. Now you’re saying there’s nobody.”\n“You are not planning on doing anything bad.”\nI couldn’t ignore the atmosphere.\nI found it hard to argue with Eun-ha.\nTo argue would be to suggest I had ill intentions.\n“Got nothing to say? Let’s go. If we keep doing this, you’ll catch a cold.”\n“No, I should really go my home to shower...”\n“Nope! Absolutely not. Enough chitchat, come with me!”\nIn the end, I had no choice but to follow Eun-ha.\nReally, why does she have to be so good-hearted?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

Towels and loofah are in there, so feel free to use them. Take your time.”\n“Alright, alright.”\nThe moment Han-gyeol put down his bag and went into the bathroom, I was faced with a dilemma.\nWas it a divine punishment for lying about not having an umbrella?\nOr did the heavens push this opportunity towards me?\nWhatever it was, my thoughts were far from organized.\nThe guy I like was taking a shower in our bathroom.\nThat fact alone filled my head to the brim.\nWhat should I do while he’s showering?\nAh, right! First, I need to bring him some clothes to change into.\nI threw my bag into my room and quickly headed into my brother’s room.\nI opened the closet and pulled out a tracksuit that would fit Han-gyeol.\nJust as I was about to leave the room with the tracksuit in my arms, a sudden thought crossed my mind.\n“Do I... also need to give him underwear?”\nThere was no time to clutch my chest, which had suddenly dropped.\nIn movies and dramas, they usually just give the outer clothes to change into.\nWhy was there no mention of underwear? Are they waterproof or something?\nAh, no way.\nI paced back and forth in my brother’s room, utterly indecisive.\nShould I really give him underwear?\nNo, wait. His underwear might not even be wet, right? But what if it is?\nHan-gyeol is kind and considerate, so he might not even bring it up.\nStill, it was difficult to ask Han-gyeol, who was currently showering, if he needed underwear.\nAsking the guy I liked if he needed underwear was, well, a bit embarrassing.\nI only intended to invite him in for a shower, but now I had run into a significant hurdle.\nThe first clothes I ever gave to the guy I liked could be underwear.\nPeople might think I’m a pervert if they heared about it.\nBut I had decided to muster the courage and asked anyway.\nHan-gyeol is a kind guy who tends to take my words as they are!\nI stood in front of the bathroom door, swallowing my dry saliva.\nThe sound of the shower was audible, and I felt my face flush unintentionally.\nMy trembling hands clenched, I cautiously knocked twice.\n“Ha...Han-gyeol!”\nAs soon as I called his name, the sound of water inside the bathroom stopped.\n“Yeah, Eun-ha, what’s up?”\nHis voice came from beyond the door, and I responded assertively.\nThat’s right. Underwear is just another piece of clothing; there’s no need to be this embarrassed.\n“I’m leaving some clothes for you to change into out here. Uh—do you need underwear too?”\n“…”\nI asked with my face burning red, but Han-gyeol couldn’t see my expression from the other side of the door.\nHe didn’t say anything for a few seconds in response to my question.\nI wanted to scream—AAAAAAAH—but there was no taking back what had already been said.\nFinally, after a brief silence, Han-gyeol’s voice carried over the door.\n“Um...yeah, please.”\n“Alright, alright. My brother should have some new ones. I’ll leave them out here for you.”\nI quickly headed back into my brother’s room.\nI had to leave underwear at the door before Han-gyeol finished his shower.\nBut the problem was, I had no idea where the new men’s underwear was.\nFor this reason, I called my brother.\nAfter several rings, my brother picked up.\n- “What is it? I’m in the middle of a game. Spit it out.”\n“Listen without jumping to conclusions.”\n- “Fine, just say it quickly.”\n“Where is the underwear you’ve never worn?”\n- “What the hell? Why are you curious about the whereabouts of my new underwear?”\n“Quiet. I don’t care about your underwear. I just need a pair that’s never been worn.”\n- “Don’t you think this is still a weird request?”\n“Enough! Do you have it or not? It’s urgent.”\n- “What in the world? Why do you even need a new underwear of a grown man?”\n“I have to give it to Han-gyeol! You’re driving me nuts!”\n- “Are you insane?! What are you doing?! This is really crazy?”\n“It’s not like that! Han-gyeol got wet in the rain and needs it!”\nMy annoying brother finally seemed convinced.\n- “If that’s the case, why didn’t you say so earlier? You made me misunderstand.”\n“Just tell me where the new underwear is.”\n- “Open the drawer in my bed. There should be a box. You’ll probably find a pair that’s never been worn. Take that.”\n“Okay. Thanks. Bye.”\nI hung up abruptly and immediately opened the drawer my brother had mentioned.\nUpon opening the large box my brother had indicated, I realized I had to call him again.\n- “Why are you calling again?”\n“Oppa, don’t you have another color?”\n-“There’s probably nothing else in there. What color is left?”\n“Why does it have to be red?”\n- “Who cares? It’s underwear, and no one’s going to see it. Bye.”\nThis time, my brother was the one to hang up abruptly.\nIn the end, I had no choice but to sandwich the red underwear between the tracksuit at the door.\nGiving red underwear as a gift to the guy I like... I really want to hide in a mouse hole.\nBut with my fist clenched tightly, I knocked on the bathroom door.\n“Han-gyeol! I’ve left the underwear along with the tracksuit. You can use it! I’ll be in my room.”\n“Thanks.”\n“I’ll leave this next to the paper bag, just put your school uniform in it for now.”\n“Thanks.”\nI dashed into my room as if I were escaping.\nQuickly changing my clothes, I also tidied up my room.\nUgh, I should’ve listened to Mom and kept things organized regularly.\nI shoved all the clothes hanging on the chair into my closet and closed the door.\nI sat in the chair, waiting for Han-gyeol, unable to do anything.\nMy face was flushed...ears perked up, I sat there until Han-gyeol came out.\nSoon, I heard the faint sound of the bathroom door opening.\nAs Han-gyeol’s footsteps grew closer to my door, my heart began to flutter.\nI needed to calm down. I didn’t want to make things awkward.\nKnock, knock-\n“Eun-ha, I’m done showering. Can I use the washing machine?”\n“Uh, of course! The washing machine and dryer are in the utility room!”\n“Alright, thanks.”\nNormally, I would do it for him, but he probably needed to wash his underwear too.\nUnderwear…wait, underwear?! I bolted out of my room.\nMy own underwear was in the utility room!\n“Han-gyeol, wait!”\n“Whoa! You startled me! Why?”\n“I can take care of the laundry! Just give it to me.”\nI grabbed the paper bag Han-gyeol was holding.\n“No, it’s okay. I can do it myself.”\n“Wait a sec...!”\nI rushed into the utility room and covered the laundry basket.\nAfter hurriedly hiding my own underwear, I let Han-gyeol in.\n“Feel free to use it! I’ll be in the living room!”\n“Yes, yes. It’s my laundry, so don’t bother.”\n“Sure, sure!”\nI nodded repeatedly and sat down on the living room sofa.\nHan-gyeol put his laundry into the washing machine and came out to the living room.\nSeeing Han-gyeol’s damp hair, my heart fluttered a little.\nIt was the first time I saw Han-gyeol not organized.\nIt felt a bit embarrassing.\n“I’m causing a lot of trouble, huh? I’m sorry.”\n“No, don’t worry about it. Oh, you need to dry your hair, right?”\n“Yeah, where’s the hairdryer?”\n“Just wait a moment. I’ll go get it for you.”\nI got up from the sofa and brought the hairdryer from my room.\nAfter plugging it into the power strip next to the sofa, I handed it to Han-gyeol.\n“Ah, thanks.”\n“Sure. Is it uncomfortable to dry your hair standing? You can sit on the sofa to do it.”\n“Nah, it’s better not to get the sofa wet. I’ll do it standing.”\nHan-gyeol lifted the hairdryer to his head and started drying his hair.\nThe situation felt so couple-like that my heart started fluttering again.\nWe both used the same shampoo, and the same body wash—our bodies would smell the same.\nIf Han-gyeol were my husband... I would be incredibly happy.\nAm I getting ahead of myself, considering we’re not even dating?\nUnaware of my inner thoughts, Han-gyeol quickly finished drying his hair, revealing his forehead.\nBeing a guy, it didn’t take him long.\nAfter unplugging it, he handed the hairdryer back to me.\n“Thanks, it was useful.”\n“Yep. Do you need a comb?”\n“I don’t think it’s necessary.”\n“Ah, I see. When you are done, come sit on the sofa.”\nI patted the space next to me.\nAs soon as Han-gyeol sat down beside me, the scent of shampoo filled my nostrils.\n“We’ll have to stay until the washer and dryer finish their cycles.”\n“Yep. Do you want to watch TV or something?”\n“Might as well, better than just waiting.”\nI turned on the TV and scrolled through the channels, finally stopping at a dating reality show.\nI glanced at Han-gyeol to gauge his reaction.\n“There’s nothing else on... shall we watch this?”\n“Sure, I occasionally watch this too.”\n“Oh, you do? Then let’s stick with this.”\nWatching a dating show with the guy I like.\nIt can’t be a bad thing, right?\nPlus, I was curious to find out what kind of relationship Han-gyeol aspires to.\nThis seemed like a good excuse to ask him.\nJust then, Han-gyeol took the initiative.\n“Are you interested in dating, Eun-ha?”\nHe threw the question I was about to ask right back at me.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Huh?”\nEun-ha was staring at me with wide eyes.\nI thought it would be an appropriate question given the atmosphere, but maybe I jumped the gun too quickly.\nWell, her side was the one who had already asked me first, so I shouldn’t worry too much.\n“Why are you suddenly curious about that?”\n“Hm? Seems like a reasonable thing to wonder. If it’s a difficult question, how about another one? What kind of guy do you like, Eun-ha?”\n“Wha—?! What kind of guy do I like?! That’s basically the same context!”\n“Well, I thought you might have an ideal type in mind.”\n“Uh... well... you see...”\nLook at her, stumbling over her words.\nShe was so cute, I even wanted to bite her.\n“Someone who’s very kind?”\n“Isn’t that a bit too vague?”\n“Uh... then someone with manners!”\n“Uh-huh. What about appearance?”\n“Ap-appearance?! Uh... I don’t really care that much...”\nEun-ha subtly avoided my gaze. She was so adorable that I couldn’t help but tease her.\n“Come on~ You must have thought about it at least once.”\n“So what kind of girl do you like?”\n“Me? Hmm. If I tell you in detail, will you also tell me in detail?”\nEun-ha seemed to contemplate my proposal for a moment.\nStill, in the end, she nodded and looked directly at my face.\n“Alright. I’ll be specific, too. You go first.”\n“Where should I start? I did say it’s vague, but I also like kind girls.”\n“Mm-hmm. Anything else?”\nEun-ha nodded vigorously.\n“It might be a cliché, but I’d like someone whose smile is pretty.”\n“What do you mean by ‘a pretty smile’? You’re even more vague than me.”\n“Hm— I’ll explain in detail if you give me a little smile?”\n“How can I just smile on command... Make me laugh.”\nEun-ha looked at me with a puzzled expression.\nIf it was so easy to be funny just because someone told me to be, I would have been called witty by now\n“If there’s anything I can do, I’ll try it.”\n“Hmm, then poke your left cheek with your index finger.”\nNot a difficult task at all.\nWithout hesitation, I poked my left cheek with my left hand. I was utterly expressionless, but Eun-ha cracked a half-smile.\n“Pfft-! You actually did it?!”\n“Eun-ha, go look in the mirror with that exact expression.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“Because your ‘smile is pretty’~”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, the smile disappeared from Eun-ha’s face. Her cheeks gradually turned red, and she walloped me with a cushion lying on the sofa.\n“Agh! Why did you suddenly hit me?”\n“When I think about it, you’re always teasing me whenever you get the chance! You had it coming!”\nSo Eun-ha was the type to resort to violence when she was embarrassed.\nWell, it was not like it hurt that much, but I couldn’t keep taking hits. I swiftly grabbed her wrist as she swung her arm forcefully towards me. However, this action caused her to stumble towards me.\n“Huh?”\nWith a light thud, Eun-ha fell into my arms, and I caught her head instinctively.\nIt was an unexpected accident, but Eun-ha’s face was buried in my chest.\nFor a fleeting moment, I noticed that her hair smelled of the same shampoo I used. It was a scent that made me want to gently hold her head, which was buried against my chest.\nOne second, two seconds... Eun-ha showed no signs of moving away from me.\nIt seemed like she was keenly feeling the rhythm of my heartbeat.\n“Eun-ha... maybe you should get up now—”\n“Aaaaaaaaaah!”\n“Agh! You scared me!”\nEun-ha screamed and pulled away from me, retreating to the edge of the sofa and bowing deeply in apology.\n“Sorry, sorry! I was just so startled! I apologize! Did I make you uncomfortable?!”\n“There’s no need to bow like that! Calm down! If anything, it was better!”\nEun-ha lifted her head in surprise, only to immediately bow down again when she caught sight of her flushed face. I wanted to pat her disheveled hair which seemed to express her embarrassment. Figuring she wouldn’t be mad, I cautiously reached out.\nMy hand lightly touched the top of Eun-ha’s head. She flinched slightly but didn’t lift her head, so I gently stroked her hair. Her strands were incredibly soft, just as I had always imagined I’d find them if I ever got the chance to touch them.\n“You don’t have to apologize. It’s fine. Lift your head up.”\nOnly after I said that did Eun-ha slowly lift her head. She pulled at her own hair as if desperately trying to hide her expression, then glared at me, muttering.\n“Pervert.”\n“Pe, pervert?!”\n“You’re randomly stroking a girl’s hair. That’s creepy!”\n“Well, if you ask whether I’m innocent or creepy, I’d say I’m definitely on the creepy side.”\n“Whaaat?! It was a joke!”\n“So was mine—ouch!”\nEun-ha threw a cushion at my face. Her reflexes were top-notch. She’d be good at video games. And yet, the way she threw it so cautiously, worried that I might get hurt, was incredibly cute.\n“That’s unfair! I want to stroke your hair too.”\n“No, no. It’ll mess up my hair.”\n“Like you care. You barely do anything to it anyway.”\n“Sometimes, Eun-ha, your logic leaves me speechless.”\n“I’m generally quite rational! It’s just that you keep teasing me all the time!”\n“Exactly. Your reactions are just too entertaining for me to stop.”\n“Ugh! Enough with the sweet talk, just let me touch your hair!”\nEun-ha was still hiding her expression behind her hair. I could have simply let her touch my hair, but I wanted to tease her a little more.\n“Then shouldn’t I get a hug from Eun-ha~?”\n“That—that was an accident!”\n“Just because it was an accident doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, right?”\nEun-ha glared at me even more icily. Fair enough, maybe pushing it that far was a stretch.\n“Do you want a hug...?”\n“What?”\n“Do you want to hug?”\n“Uh?”\nI looked at Eun-ha, thoroughly flustered.\nWhat’s going on? Would she actually let me hug her if I said I wanted to? Is that even okay when we’re the only ones here?\nIsn’t physical contact usually off-limits in a flirty but not officially dating relationship?\nWith those thoughts lingering, I looked at Eun-ha. But then she slowly let go of her hair and spoke to me.\n“I was joking too...!”\n“Huh?”\n“It was a joke! You started it with your joke!”\n“Ah, I see. So you can dish it out too, Eun-ha...haha.”\nA joke, she says? With that expression?\nI felt like she would’ve let me hug her if I’d actually said I wanted to. Did I miss my chance? Now I was filled with regret.\nJust when I thought the atmosphere was becoming a bit awkward, I heard the laundry machine’s end cycle sound.\n“Ah? Looks like the laundry is done.”\n“I’ll go take care of it. It has a dryer, can I use the quick-dry setting?”\n“Yeah, sure. You can handle it alone?”\n“Of course. I’ll be right back.”\nI rushed into the utility room as if fleeing the scene.\nI promptly took out the laundry and stuffed it into the dryer. After setting it to quick-dry, I just slumped down.\nMy heart felt like it had taken a beating. Eun-ha was more of a wildcard than I’d expected. I couldn’t afford to let my guard down going forward.\n“It’ll take 25 minutes,” I said as I emerged from the utility room.\n“Yeah, even on quick-dry, it takes some time.”\n“Do you do a lot of chores at home, Eun-ha?”\n“Mhm, my mom and dad are usually busy and not home.”\n“Don’t you get lonely?”\n“Hmm... I can’t say I don’t, but it’s okay.”\nSeeing Eun-ha sitting alone on the living room sofa tugged at my heartstrings. I wasn’t sure whether to describe it as endearing or something I wanted to protect. All I knew was that I didn’t want Eun-ha to be lonely by herself.\n“So... we never did get to watch TV, huh? Haha.”\n“Ah, but didn’t you not tell me what type of guy you like, Eun-ha?”\n“I did tell you. I like someone who’s kind and polite. You didn’t get specific either.”\n“But I did say I like girls who have a pretty smile. At least tell me something similar, won’t you?”\n“Are you that curious?”\n“Yes.”\nEun-ha got up from the sofa and walked over to me. She then raised her hand to the top of her head and extended it horizontally in front of her.\n“Hmm— I would like a guy who is taller than me.”\n“Well, I’m certainly taller than you.”\n“Is that so? Does that make you my ideal type, then?”\nEun-ha looked up at me with a radiant smile.\nLately, Eun-ha seemed to be growing more assertive.\nWhat’s gotten into her?\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“I like guys who are considerate and well-mannered.”\n“Got it.”\n“Got it?”\n“Yeah, got it.”\n“What are you going to do now that you know?”\nEun-ha seemed to be thoroughly enjoying teasing me. I couldn’t meet her eyes directly as she leaned back, tilting her head side to side with a playful expression.\nI lightly flicked Eun-ha’s forehead with my finger.\n“Ugh— what are you doing?”\n“You were teasing too much.”\n“Tit for tat. Your turn, Han-gyeol.”\n“Haha, alright.”\nI exposed my forehead to Eun-ha, ready for my own flick. But she clenched her teeth and tensed her fingers, visibly applying force.\n“Eun-ha—! I went easy on you!”\n“There’s no such thing as ‘easy’ in a flicking game! One flick deserves another!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I had planned to go see the cherry blossoms with Han-gyeol this weekend.\nI was really looking forward to it, but I was feeling incredibly under the weather today.\nI had a slight fever, and even going to school felt like a struggle, but I decided to go anyway.\nAs soon as I opened the classroom door, Han-gyeol cheerfully waved at me.\nI mustered enough energy to wave back, my expression strained.\nBut upon seeing my weakened state, Han-gyeol immediately stood up from his seat.\n“Eun-ha, are you not feeling well?”\nHan-gyeol approached me, looking genuinely concerned.\nI didn’t want to worry him, but I was too drained to put on a fake smile.\n“Mmm... I’m not feeling too great today.”\n“Shouldn’t you take the day off? How about telling the teacher and going home to rest?”\n“Hmm... it’s not that bad. I took some medicine in the morning, and I think I’ll be okay after some rest.”\nEven after hearing that, Han-gyeol looked at me with a concerned expression.\n“If you’re really sick, leave early. Got it?”\n“Mmm, don’t worry.”\n“It’s hard not to worry when you look like that... Have a seat. If you need anything, just tell me.”\n“Mmm, thanks. I won’t push myself, so don’t worry.”\nI sank into my seat and immediately slumped over my desk.\nUgh... I haven’t felt this heavy in a long time.\nToday, the wind blowing in through the cracks of the window felt even more chilling than usual.\nI considered closing the window, but I was too drained to move.\nThen, with a ‘thud,’ I heard the sound of the window closing.\nSince Han-gyeol was the only one in the classroom, he must have done it for me.\nI should have lifted my head and thanked him, but I didn’t even have the energy for that.\nJust when I thought I’d thank him later, something was placed on my back.\n“It looks like you might be cold, so I’m covering you with my jacket. Get some rest. If you need anything, call me. I’ll be right here until Jeong Harim arrives.”\n“O-okay..”\nI spoke while still slumped over my desk.\nHan-gyeol remained silently by my side until Harim arrived.\n“Why are you sitting on my seat?”\nEventually, Harim came in and we exchanged a few words to update her on the situation.\nHan-gyeol continued the conversation with Harim in a very soft voice.\n“Eun-ha’s not feeling well. If she needs anything, call me.”\n“Hmm, shouldn’t she leave early?”\n“She said it’s not that bad. She’ll leave if it gets too severe.”\n“Alright.”\n“Yep. I’m going back to my seat now.”\nI felt Han-gyeol get up from his seat.\nI decided to thank him later.\nAnd then, Harim sat down and spoke quietly.\n“Eun-ha, if you need help, let me know.”\n“Yes...”\nDuring the morning announcements, I barely lifted my head, and throughout the class, I couldn’t focus on the lectures.\nBy the time lunch rolled around, all I could think about was resting in the infirmary.\nNo, should I leave early instead? I’m really not feeling well.\nNoticing my pale complexion, Harim spoke up.\n“Eun-ha, you really don’t look good. Why don’t you leave early?”\n“Mmm... should I? I feel even worse than I did this morning.”\n“Let’s tell the teacher and head home. Take a taxi.”\n“I guess I should... I was going to stay, but...”\n“Let’s go quickly. The teacher might be out for lunch.”\nI stood up, accompanied by Harim.\nHan-gyeol, who seemed to have been watching me, quickly approached.\n“Why? Heading to the infirmary?”\n“I think it’s better for Eun-ha to leave early, so we’re going to inform the teacher.”\n“Mmm, that sounds like a good idea. Rest up at home. Is anyone there?”\n“Yes, my brother will be there.”\n“Okay. Head to the faculty office.”\n“Right. Han-gyeol, you should go eat. Don’t worry about me.”\n“Don’t worry about me, either.”\n“See you tomorrow then.”\nAfter briefly greeting Han-gyeol, I headed to the faculty office to inform my teacher.\nHarim called a taxi for me in front of the school, and I arrived home a little earlier than usual.\nMy brother, who was watching TV in the living room, looked up, startled.\n“Left early?”\n“Yeah, I’m not feeling well.”\n“Have you been to the doctor? Want me to go with you?”\n“I have some over-the-counter medicine. I think that should do.”\n“Did you eat lunch?”\n“No appetite. I’m going to rest a bit.”\n“Alright. If you need anything, send me a message.”\n“Mm...”\nAs soon as I entered my room, I changed my clothes.\nEven on an empty stomach, I took some medicine and immediately crawled into bed.\nI pulled the blanket up to my chin and quickly fell asleep.\nMy head was throbbing, but perhaps due to the medicine, sleep overtook me.\nStrangely enough, Han-gyeol kept popping up in my thoughts, even though I was sick.\nHe was not my guardian, and he was the last person I should be thinking about when I was struggling...\nBut... I missed him.\n***\nI wondered how long I slept. It didn’t feel like a deep sleep.\nEven after waking up, I kept my eyes closed for quite a while.\nMy headache was better than in the morning, but it was still there.\nI was thirsty but didn’t have the strength to walk to the fridge.\nI ended up sending my brother a message from the phone on my bedside table.\nI sent a brief message saying, “Bring me some water?”\nThe message was sent instantly, but I heard noises from outside my room much later.\nWhat is he doing? His younger sibling is sick.\nNevertheless, I decided to be grateful that he was taking care of me.\nEventually, there were two soft knocks on my door.\n“Come in...”\nMy voice was so faint that it probably didn’t carry beyond the door.\nNormally, my brother would have come in without hesitation, but today he didn’t.\nI finally dragged my heavy body to the door and opened it.\n“When did you get so good at knocking...?”\nMy eyes were half-closed, so I didn’t get a clear look.\nBut as soon as I opened the door, the person standing there looked like Han-gyeol, not my brother.\nNo matter how unwell I felt, mistaking my brother for Han-gyeol was... quite serious.\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again, but it still looked like Han-gyeol.\n“Huh?”\n“Ah—Eunwoo Hyung said he has to go out tonight. He left about 15 minutes ago after staying with me.”\n“What...?”\n“Eunwoo Hyung called me and asked me to bring you a bottle of water.”\nThud!\nThe moment I realized the person in front of me was Han-gyeol, I shut the door.\nI crawled back into bed and dialed my brother’s number.\nClick—\nMy brother answered the call.\n“Why is Han-gyeol at our house...?”\n- Han-gyeol? He called to check on you, so I told him if he’s worried, he could come over.\n“How can you just call him over like that? He’s busy!”\n- He seemed really concerned, so I thought it’d be better if he came to see you himself. Besides, I have to go out tonight, and I didn’t want to leave you alone.\n“You should have called Mom or Dad. Or Hyun-joo Unni.”\n- You think I’m an idiot? Of course, I did. Mom and Dad said they couldn’t make it today, and Hyun-joo also said she was busy. There was no other option, little sis.\n“Ugh, fine. I’m hanging up now.”\n- Alright. If you need anything, leave me a message. I’ll pick it up on my way home.\n“Haa...”\nI put down my phone and headed back to the door.\nWith a sigh, I gently opened it.\nHan-gyeol was still standing there, holding a bottle of water.\n“I keep troubling you... I’m sorry.”\n“It’s okay. It happens between friends. Here’s the water.”\n“Ah- thanks.”\n“So... should I stay in the living room?”\n“No... come in...”\nI opened the door wider, inviting Han-gyeol inside.\n“How are you feeling?”\n“Better than this morning... but I didn’t tidy up, so the room’s a bit messy. It’s embarrassing.”\n“Not at all. It’s really neat. And it smells nice.”\n“Haha... Ah- don’t stand, sit down. You can use the chair.”\nUgh... My hair was disheveled, and here I was, utterly vulnerable, facing Han-gyeol. But seeing his face somehow made me feel reassured and incredibly happy. The thought that he cared enough about me to contact my brother gave me butterflies.\n“Then, I will sit down without hesitation.”\nHan-gyeol dragged the chair next to the bed and sat down.\nI gingerly perched myself on the edge of the bed.\nSeeing the water bottle I was holding, Han-gyeol immediately reached out.\n“Give me the bottle. I’ll open it for you.”\n“Nah, I can manage this much on my own.”\nI opened the bottle myself and took a sip.\nAfter closing the lid, I placed it on the nightstand beside the bed.\n“Have you eaten?”\n“Not yet.”\n“Do you want to eat first? I can go buy some porridge or something.”\nAs Han-gyeol subtly began to rise from his chair, I delicately grasped the hem of his clothes.\nAnd in a strained voice, I spoke.\n“I’m not hungry... just stay with me...”\nHearing my voice, Han-gyeol sat back down.\n“Were you... really worried?”\nIt was a rather awkward question.\nI knew he had no choice but to answer when someone was sick.\nEven though his expression could say it all, I wanted to hear it from Han-gyeol himself.\nI hoped that even when I wasn’t around, his daily life was infused with thoughts of me.\nTo my question, Han-gyeol answered with a faint smile.\n“Yes.”\n“Really?”\n“I was so worried I couldn’t even play basketball.”\nA laugh burst forth at Han-gyeol’s playful smile.\n“Pfft-! So you were really worried, huh?”\n“Yes. I was extremely worried. All I thought about all day was you, Eun-ha.”\nHonestly... as time went on, it felt like I was going to like Han-gyeol even more.\n“To tell the truth... all I could think about was you, Han-gyeol.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Haha...! That’s not like you, Eun-ha, to make a joke like that!”\nIt had been merely a month since we met.\nUntil becoming seniors, we’d never even spoken to each other.\nBut now, my heart kept racing because of Han-gyeol who stood before me.\nEven though I heard his voice every day, I always found myself yearning to hear it again. When he was not in sight, I missed him terribly.\nWhen did my feelings for him grow this strong?\nI thought I was managing my emotions well; I believed I could control them.\nBut apparently, it was too much to keep those ever-growing feelings inside.\nI even felt jealous watching him talk to other girls, pretending not to know the answers to questions I knew, just to have him explain them to me. On rainy days, I lied about not having an umbrella, just to share one with him, and walked shoulder-to-shoulder.\nI went so far as to lie because I wanted to be with Han-gyeol, even if it was just for a little while longer.\nI liked him that much.\nSo I decided not to hold back anymore.\n“It’s not a joke...”\n“Huh? What did you say, Eun-ha?”\n“I can’t stop thinking about you, Han-gyeol.”\nI looked him straight in the eye as I said it.\nAnd little by little, I started to unveil my true feelings.\n“To be honest, I’ve been feeling this way for a while now. I keep missing you, from the moment I wake up in the morning until I go to sleep at night. I can’t wait to go to school to see you, and at night, I want to call you just to hear your voice... but I’ve been too shy to dial your number. Instead, I lie in bed, telling myself that I should just go to sleep so I can see you at school the next day. But then my heart starts racing again, and I can’t fall asleep. So I toss and turn until I finally manage to get some sleep...”\nI thought I couldn’t hold back any longer.\n“I was so happy when I received chocolate from Han-gyeol! In fact, I was hoping all day that you would give it to me. I overheard you talking with Jang Yujin and found out you made the chocolate yourself! I was disappointed when you gave me a store-bought one at school, but so thrilled when you gave me the homemade chocolate as I got home.”\nOnly a sliver of my feelings slipped out, but I couldn’t stop myself. My emotions poured out uncontrollably.\n“The reason I avoided you, Han-gyeol, was because my heart would pound like crazy every time I saw you! My face would get hot, and I couldn’t even speak properly. I was scared you’d figure out how I felt. That’s why I avoided you. It was the same on the night we took that walk. I knew it wasn’t right to call you late at night, but I really wanted to hear your voice. Even last week, when I accidentally hugged you, all I could think of was wanting to keep hugging you. That’s how I’ve been these days. I can’t stop thinking about you. You’re all over my daily life.”\nI blurted out a lot of things, but saying what I really wanted to say was still difficult.\n“So what I’m trying to say is...”\nUp to this point, I had been making eye contact with Han-gyeol. But I couldn’t keep it up as I got to the final sentence.\nWithout realizing it, my gaze dropped, and I held onto the hem of my dress as I softly spoke.\n“What I’m trying to say is... I like you, Han-gyeol.”\nI clenched my eyes shut as I said it.\nI was dying to know what expression Han-gyeol was making, but I couldn’t bring myself to look up.\nThen, Han-gyeol’s gentle voice filled my ears.\n“Eun-ha, you have to look up if you want to hear my response.”\n“Can’t you just say it? I’m too embarrassed…”\n“No.”\n“Ugh…”\nI cautiously lifted my head to look at Han-gyeol.\nHe met my eyes with a bright smile.\nBut the embarrassment was too much—I swiftly turned my head away.\nMustering the courage to confess was a monumental endeavor of its own.\n“Uh—? You haven’t answered yet.”\n“You expect an answer without making eye contact?”\n“Nope.”\nHan-gyeol could be really mean sometimes.\nFinally, with my face flushed, I met his eyes.\nOnly then did he take my hand and speak.\n“I like you too, Eun-ha.”\nUpon hearing those words, my face heated up even more.\nI tried to cover it with my hand, but Han-gyeol firmly held it and wouldn’t let go.\n“So, about the cherry blossom festival we planned to go to this weekend—we should go as a couple, not just friends.”\nAt the sound of Han-gyeol’s soft voice, I simply nodded my head in agreement.\n“I’d like it if you could say it while looking into my eyes.”\n“Uh—! It’s embarrassing, okay! Fine! I want to go to the cherry blossom festival as your girlfriend, not just a friend!”\nHe really had to make me say it out loud, didn’t he?\nI sneaked a glance at Han-gyeol with a slightly peeved expression.\nHe teased me so many times, it was unreal.\nKnowing full well what I would say next.\nDefinitely sensing it all.\nAnnoyed, I pinched Han-gyeol’s cheek.\n“Eun-ha?”\nAs I squished Han-gyeol’s cheek, I let out my frustrations.\nHis cheek felt so soft and pleasant.\nBut Han-gyeol made a pitiful sound, as if it hurt.\n“Eun-ha, Aa—”\n“It can’t possibly hurt. I’m the one patient here.”\nStill, just in case it really did hurt, I let go of his cheek.\n“Fine, I teased Eun-ha, so I’ll go buy you some porridge.”\n“I’m not hungry... just stay by my side.”\nI was hungry since I hadn’t eaten lunch.\nBut if he goes out to buy food, I won’t be able to see Han-gyeol.\nI wanted to continue being with him like this.\nWe had just started dating; it was okay to be a bit clingy, right?\n“Koreans live for their meals, you know. Shouldn’t you eat something?”\n“I’ll eat after I sleep and wake up... Can we just stay like this for a little longer?”\n“What if your stomach growls loudly again? Wouldn’t you be embarrassed?”\n“Ah—! Forget that ever happened. That’s so impolite to a girl!”\n“How can you be so cute?”\n“Do you think you can just tease me like this?”\n“Have I ever made stomach noises in front of you?”\n“Ah—! I said forget it!”\nI spoke as I playfully kicked my feet.\nBut Han-gyeol laughed joyfully, clearly amused.\n“Fine, fine. But if you get hungry, tell me right away. I’ll have food delivered.”\n“Maybe order it in about an hour? I think I’ll be hungry by then.”\n“So precise with your stomach’s timing? No wonder it was so loud.”\n“Stop teasing me! Is this okay even when I’m your ‘girlfriend’?”\n“What’s not okay?”\n“Hey!”\nHe really teased me until the very end.\n“Let’s stop lying around and sleep a bit more. I’ll wake you up when the food arrives in an hour.”\n“I’m not sleepy, but I’ll lie down for now.”\n“Good. Lie down.”\nAs I folded my legs and lay on the bed, Han-gyeol covered me with the blanket.\n“But I slept so much that I’m not sleepy.”\n“Looks like it’s the perfect time for me to tell an interesting story. Let me think.”\n“Never mind that. What did you do in school today?”\n“I was thinking about you all day, okay?”\nHan-gyeol responded instantly.\nI burst into soft laughter.\n“You didn’t spend the whole day just thinking about me, did you?”\n“I did, actually. Thought about Eun-ha all day.”\n“You’re bluffing.”\n“It’s unfair when you say it like that.”\n“So, what did you think about?”\n“I wondered what kind of porridge Eun-ha might like.”\nI chuckled again at Han-gyeol’s words.\n“So, what did you decide?”\n“I thought you’d probably like tuna vegetable porridge.”\n“Why? Is there a special reason?”\n“No, I just settled on something generic after pondering a bit.”\n“So you didn’t think it through that much after all!”\n“You can’t keep wrestling with an unsolvable problem forever.”\n“Ugh— you’ve got me there.”\nMy boyfriend could be quite rational at times.\nBoyfriend...\n“So, what kind of porridge do you like, Eun-ha?”\n“Guess.”\n“Tuna vegetable porridge.”\n“Hey!”\nI sat up abruptly.\n“Ah, why does the patient keep getting up?”\n“You keep teasing me, Han-gyeol!”\n“How can you be so cute?”\nHearing the word ‘cute’ over and over made me blush.\nSeeing that I didn’t say anything, Han-gyeol gently laid me back down on the bed.\nHe then took my hand, which had slipped out of the blanket, and looked at me intently.\nI also gripped Han-gyeol’s hand firmly in return.\n“You don’t have to hold on so tightly; I’m not going anywhere.”\n“I, I didn’t hold on that tight.”\n“Ah, you’re stronger than you look.”\n“Ah—! Stop teasing me!”\n“Alright, I’m sorry.”\nNow I finally understood what Harim meant when she said Han-gyeol looked at me with so much love.\nHe might play cheeky pranks on me, but I could feel the way he cherished me in every glance and gesture.\nThose feelings filled my heart to overflowing.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hmm?”\n“Thanks for confessing. I really like you too, Eun-ha.”\nIt was the phrase I had been dying to hear, but when I heard it like this it made me even more embarrassed.\nUnable to say anything, I just stared back at Han-gyeol.\nHe is so mean.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Thank you. Take care on your way.”\n“Yes, enjoy your meal.”\nI received the porridge I ordered for Eun-ha from the delivery person.\nAfter closing the front door and heading back to her room, I found Eun-ha, my girlfriend, sitting propped up against the headboard of her bed.\n“It came faster than I expected. I thought it would take at least 20 more minutes.”\n“Right? Wait a second. I’ll set it up immediately.”\nI placed the bowl on a foldable table on the bed.\nI was planning to feed Eun-ha the porridge after unwrapping it.\nNoticing it seemed hot, I scooped a little and brought it to Eun-ha’s lips.\n“Say ‘ah’. I’ll feed you.”\n“I, I can eat by myself.”\n“Do you want to?”\nI had always thought it was natural to feed my girlfriend porridge when she was sick. But if she wanted to eat by herself...\nI handed the spoon back to Eun-ha. She cooled the hot porridge by blowing on it.\nShe only took a little at a time, but watching Eun-ha eat made me inexplicably pleased.\n“Don’t stare so much... It’s embarrassing.”\n“Is this what they mean when they say just watching someone eat can make you happy? You look so cute when you eat.”\n“Really... If you keep looking at me like that, I’ll get too shy to eat.”\n“Are you indirectly asking me to feed you? Should I?”\n“No...! I’ll eat on my own.”\nEun-ha looked at me with a slightly annoyed expression.\n“Is it good? It’s the Samgye-tang porridge you like, right?”\n“Yes. I usually eat Samgye-tang porridge when I’m not feeling well.”\n“I don’t think I would have ever thought of Samgye-tang.”\n“What kind of porridge does Han-gyeol like?”\n“Me? I like tuna vegetable porridge. Why?”\n“Next time you’re sick, I’ll make you tuna vegetable porridge.”\n“You’re not just buying it, you’re actually making it for me?”\nEun-ha nodded her head.\n“I guess I should fall ill sometime soon.”\n“Don’t even joke about that. Don’t get sick.”\n“Why? Oh, because if I’m hurt, it hurts your heart as well? Is that why you’re fluttering?”\n“Really... Stop mentioning things like that!”\nI always thought it was nonsensical when people said they wanted to be sick in place of the ones they loved.\nBut now, with the girl I liked feeling unwell, I genuinely wished I could take on her pain.\n“Eun-ha, recover quickly.”\n“Why? Because it hurts your heart too when I’m unwell?”\n“Exactly. It feels as if my heart is tearing apart.”\nEun-ha, perhaps a bit embarrassed, didn’t reply.\nThen, in a soft voice, she spoke to me.\n“Don’t just blurt out embarrassing things like that...”\n“Alright, alright. Since it’s embarrassing, just eat your porridge.”\nMy gaze might have been burdensome, but Eun-ha quietly emptied her bowl.\nHowever, when there was about a spoonful left, she sat the spoon down.\n“You left a spoonful. Not hungry anymore?”\n“No... My arm hurts, so I can’t hold the spoon.”\nDid she want me to feed her?\nI couldn’t just let that slide.\n“In that case, I’ll take care of the cleanup.”\nAs I swiftly went to pick up the spoonful left, Eun-ha stopped me.\n“Wait...! I want to eat the remaining bit.”\n“But didn’t you say your arm hurts?”\n“Yes, my arm hurts.”\nEun-ha, true to her nature, never said the most crucial thing.\nThis was so adorable that the corners of my mouth involuntarily curved up.\n“Han-gyeol...! Really...!”\n“Huh? Why? I’m pretty clueless. I can’t figure out what you mean by that.”\n“Ah- Feed me! You can feed me just a spoonful, right?”\n“Oh, that’s what you meant? Ah, you should’ve just said so. I would’ve fed you from the start.”\n“I was embarrassed...”\n“That’s understandable.”\nI did as Eun-ha wished and brought the last spoonful to her lips.\n“Here- Say ‘ah’.”\nI carefully slid the spoon into the slightly opened mouth of Eun-ha.\nThe way Eun-ha chewed and swallowed the porridge was unbearably cute.\n“Did you, by any chance, want me to feed you the porridge from the start?”\n“Not really. I’m not a child. I can eat porridge by myself.”\n“Alright, alright. I’ll fetch the medicine. Where is it?”\n“It’s on the dining table. Let’s go together. There’s also cleaning up to do.”\n“Stay seated. I’ll handle the cleanup.”\nAs I started to pick up the table and head out, Eun-ha reluctantly got up from the bed.\n“Lie down.”\n“But it’s strange for you to clean up after I ate.”\n“I’m your boyfriend. I can do at least this much.”\n“Even so...! I feel guilty being taken care of all the time.”\nEun-ha seemed to feel burdened being pampered like a child.\nTo me, it was alright if she acted a bit more spoiled, but considering Eun-ha’s personality, her response was natural. She was the type who disliked depending on others or being a bother.\nIn the end, after quickly tidying up in the kitchen, I returned to the room with Eun-ha. Eun-ha popped the pill I brought into her mouth and quickly swallowed it down with water.\n“Ugh... it’s bitter.”\n“It seems like your fever has subsided a bit. Don’t you have a thermometer?”\n“I think it’s somewhere, but I can’t remember.”\n“Well, I can check with my hand then.”\nI gently placed my hand on Eun-ha’s forehead.\nI couldn’t measure the exact temperature, but it didn’t feel much different from mine.\n“How is it?”\n“It feels about the same as mine, but maybe I’m just overthinking. Does your head hurt now?”\n“It’s a little throbbing, but it’s much better than before.”\n“That’s a relief. You’ve eaten and taken your medicine, so try to get some rest now. I’ll watch you sleep and then leave.”\n“Huh? Don’t you need to go home too?”\n“Leaving my sick girlfriend behind pricks my conscience.”\n“I’m sorry for being such a bother. You must have had things to do as well.”\nI playfully tapped Eun-ha’s forehead as she made a bitter expression.\n“Ouch-”\n“Instead of apologizing, you should say thank you.”\n“Of course, I’m grateful. But it’s fine, you can go home.”\nHearing Eun-ha’s words, I softly chuckled and stroked her hair. Eun-ha, slightly blushing, continued to enjoy my touch.\n“Do you feel uncomfortable with me being so close?”\n“Not at all! I’m truly grateful. I’m just sorry that’s why.”\nWhile continuing to caress Eun-ha’s hair, I said,\n“I want to be by Eun-ha’s side right now. But if you feel uncomfortable or burdened, I’ll head home. If you’re saying that because you don’t want to bother me, but you’d like me to stay, I’ll stay. Which one is it?”\nHearing this, Eun-ha slowly pulled the blanket up to her chin. After hesitating for a moment, she cautiously shared her true feelings.\n“I’d like you to stay...”\n“Then, I’ll stay.”\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes?”\n“Just because I said this, doesn’t mean you always have to cater to my whims.”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\n“If something important comes up for you, you should go and attend to it. I won’t ever be upset. I’ll never take it for granted. Understand?”\nI was a bit surprised at Eun-ha’s words.\nI didn’t expect her to be so forthright about her feelings.\nYet, I couldn’t hide my immense happiness at her candidness. Smiling in response to Eun-ha’s honest heart, I said,\n“Alright, I promise.”\n“Then, today... I’ll lean on you a bit more.”\n“Sure. Anything else you want?”\n“Hold my hand... until I fall asleep.”\nEun-ha gently pulled her hand out from under the blanket.\nI held onto Eun-ha’s hand and didn’t let go.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“I feel a bit sleepy, maybe because of the medicine.”\n“Alright, you should get some good rest.”\n“You won’t let go of my hand even if I fall asleep, right? Even if I let go, don’t you let go.”\n“Okay, I won’t.”\n“But if you think I won’t wake up for a while, you can go home.”\n“I will. Sleep with peace of mind.”\nEun-ha, with half her face covered by the blanket, continued to speak.\n“I really like you Han-gyeol...”\nI flinched at Eun-ha’s sudden confession.\n“Alright, alright. You should go to sleep.”\n“Don’t try to change the topic.”\nWhy was she so sharp at times like this?\n“I really like you Han-gyeol. So much that it feels unbearable.”\n“You’re quite bold with your words...”\n“I know, right? But if I don’t say it out loud, my heart keeps racing.”\nEvery time I heard Eun-ha’s words, my face turned red. Holding her hand, I was trapped, unable to escape this situation.\n“Ah- Han-gyeol, your face is turning red. Are you embarrassed?”\n“How can I not be when you say such embarrassing things?”\n“But what can I do if I really like Han-gyeol that much?”\nEun-ha’s eyes slowly began to close as if sleep was creeping in.\n“I really like Eun-ha too.”\n“Mm... I know...”\n“I’m glad you do.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha let out a soft chuckle.\nAnd then, in a very faint voice, she said,\n“But I like you more.”\nWith those words, Eun-ha’s eyes fully closed.\nWhen I didn’t respond, Eun-ha’s breathing became soft and rhythmic as she fell asleep. Even in her peaceful slumber, she held onto my hand tightly. I continued to look at her face, our hands intertwined.\nI didn’t know why she was so beautiful.\nI didn’t know why she was so lovable.\nAlthough we couldn’t measure the depth of each other’s feelings numerically, I believed we both felt the same way. But no matter how much I thought about it, I also believed Eun-ha’s feelings for me couldn’t possibly surpass my feelings for her.\nHowever, if by any chance, Eun-ha loved me even more than I loved her...\nThere would be no happiness greater than that.\n“Eun-ha, I still love you more.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The moment I woke up in the morning, I immediately got out of bed.\nHaving had a good rest, my fever had considerably subsided and I felt incredibly light.\nI hastily got ready and headed to school to see Han-gyeol.\nOutside the apartment complex, the cherry blossom trees signaled the arrival of spring, and I walked through the path lined with those trees, quickening my pace toward school.\nThe thought of seeing Han-gyeol made my steps faster.\nArriving at school earlier than usual, I opened the classroom door without hesitation.\nAs soon as the door creaked open, Han-gyeol looked up at me.\nAnd he greeted me with a bright smile.\n“Did you sleep well?”\nI too smiled brightly and nodded.\n“Mm-hmm. I slept well. How about you, Han-gyeol?”\n“I slept well too.”\nI promptly put down my bag and sat next to Han-gyeol.\nI had always wanted to do this every morning, and now I could sit beside him without any hesitation.\n“What about breakfast?”\n“I already ate. How about you, Eun-ha?”\n“I usually don’t eat breakfast.”\n“You were sick just yesterday. You should’ve had something today.”\n“It’s okay, I can eat a lot at lunch. What were you doing?”\n“I was finishing up the study portion that you assigned me, Eun-ha.”\n“Right! We’re going out the day after tomorrow, aren’t we?”\n“Yeah. Is there anything you want to do while watching the cherry blossoms?”\n“Anything you want to do is fine by me.”\n“Umm- Let’s see then.”\nIf it was something Han-gyeol liked, I liked it too.\nAbove all, just being together made my heart flutter.\n“What time did you leave yesterday?” I asked Han-gyeol, who was lost in thought.\n“I think it was a little after nine?”\n“You left that late?!”\n“I was planning to leave at ten. But Aunty came home a little past nine, so I left earlier.”\n“Oh, you saw my mom?”\n“Yeah. She offered to drive me home, but I declined.”\n“Why? You should have gone home comfortably.”\n“It’s not that far. And I didn’t want to leave you alone at home.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I giggled.\nHe really had a way with words.\n“You don’t have to worry anymore. I’m all better now.”\n“That’s right. You recovered overnight.”\n“Yes. Maybe it’s because Han-gyeol took care of me. Oh- you were studying, right? Can I study beside you?”\n“I’d actually feel left out if you studied far away.”\n“I’ll get my stuff quickly.”\nI hurriedly brought my reference book and sat next to Han-gyeol.\nI wanted to keep watching him concentrating, but I resisted and looked at my reference book.\nAt first, I couldn’t concentrate well, but gradually I began to study in silence.\nI summarized the key points in my notebook, effortlessly absorbing the knowledge.\nPerhaps it was the comfort of having Han-gyeol by my side, but I felt like I was studying better than usual.\nWhenever I encountered something I didn’t know, I’d ask him and he’d occasionally ask me as well.\nStudying, while relying on each other, felt both fun and thrilling.\nIf studying was always like this, it wouldn’t seem too difficult.\nAs time passed, students began to enter the classroom, and Jang Yujin also arrived.\n“Hey.”\n“Oh, you’re here?”\n“Studying from the morning... Impressive.”\nJang Yujin set down his bag.\nI, sitting in Jang Yujin’s seat, immediately started to tidy up my reference book.\n“Oh- Hold on, I’ll make room.”\n“It’s fine. Just stay seated. I mean, I can use your seat.”\n“Is that okay? And can you do it every morning?”\n“I don’t mind. But if someone sees, they might think you two are dating.”\n“Yes. We’ve been dating since yesterday.”\n“Oh, really? Congratulations.”\nJang Yujin congratulated us nonchalantly.\n“Aren’t you surprised?”\n“Mm. I thought you’d get together soon enough.”\n“Why?!”\n“I’d find it weird if you didn’t know. Anyway, congrats.”\nLeaving only his backpack, Jang Yujin headed to my seat.\nI immediately looked at Han-gyeol and asked,\n“Was it that obvious that I liked you Han-gyeol?”\n“Wasn’t that what you intended? It’s rather surprising.”\n“I didn’t entirely hide my feelings, but was it that obvious?”\n“I wasn’t completely sure it was just me, but when you came in pretending not to know the answers to questions you knew, I was certain. And also—”\nI quickly covered Han-gyeol’s mouth with my hand.\n“St-stop there...! It’s embarrassing, so don’t say it.”\n“It was cute. Next time just admit that you want to be right next to me and be hone-”\nAs soon as I released him, I had to cover his mouth again.\n“Seriously...! Stop teasing!”\n“Okay, okay.”\nI shifted my gaze back to the reference book.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“What?”\n“Do you have any questions that you ‘not know’?”\n“Oh, come on-!”\n***\nAfter finishing the morning study session with Han-gyeol, I switched seats with Jang Yujin again.\n“Good morning, Harim.”\n“Eun-ha. Good morning. How are you feeling?”\n“Yep, I’m better now. Oh, did you hear from Jang Yujin?”\n“About what? Oh- that you and Lee Han-gyeol are dating?”\n“You, you heard...! I wanted to tell you because I’m grateful to you in many ways.”\n“What did I do? So, who confessed?”\nAt Harim’s words, I spoke cautiously.\n“I... did.”\n“Huh? Really? What did you say during the confession? Tell me in detail.”\n“It’s a bit embarrassing to say...!”\n“You were just telling me how you were grateful to me in many ways, right? I’d be happy to hear.”\n“Well... I rambled on and just said that I liked him...”\nHarim looked at me with an intensely curious expression upon hearing my words.\n“So? What did Lee Han-gyeol say?”\n“Han-gyeol responded saying he likes me too.”\n“That was a straightforward confession. So, how do you feel?”\n“Yes... I like him a lot. I can’t even put into words how much I like him.”\nSeeing my smile, Harim spoke with slight astonishment.\n“Eun-ha... You make that kind of expression too?”\n“Huh?! What’s with my expression?”\n“It’s like you’ve conquered the world.”\n“Ah! Is it that obvious?”\n“Yes. You’re still beaming.”\n“The corners of my mouth won’t come down... What do I do?”\nHarim smiled warmly and said,\n“It’s good to be happy, what’s there to worry about?”\n“Yep, yep. I’m incredibly happy. I’m over the moon.”\n“What do you like most about Lee Han-gyeol?”\nResponding to Harim’s question, I answered immediately. If I were to describe the reasons I liked Han-gyeol, I could go on for hours.\n“For starters, he’s kind and considerate. I think that’s the most significant part. And, how should I put it? I feel like Han-gyeol is someone who would genuinely accept my feelings.”\n“That’s a good feeling.”\n“Yes, yes. I think so too. I always get the feeling that he’ll be on my side. That’s why I try to be the same for him.”\n“Huh?”\n“Just~ I mean, I really like Han-gyeol. Like really, you know?”\nIt might sound bashful and embarrassing, but I wanted to be that presence for Han-gyeol as well.\nA sincere relationship between us. I wanted Han-gyeol to feel the same emotions I was feeling.\nI was even confident that I could always be on Han-gyeol’s side.\n“So? When’s your first date? During the Cherry Blossom Festival?”\n“Yes. We’ve decided to go this Saturday.”\n“Have you chosen an outfit to wear for the date?”\n“I’m going to start thinking about it from today. What would be good?”\n“Do you know what kind of outfits Han-gyeol likes?”\n“Um... I’m not really sure. We’ve met in casual clothes, but back then, we weren’t dating.”\nIt was a genuine concern.\nI wasn’t sure about the style Han-gyeol prefered.\n“Should I ask him directly?”\n“No way! Eun-ha.”\n“Why, why?!”\n“There’s excitement in wondering what the other will wear.”\n“That’s true. But as for Han-gyeol...”\nHe would probably say I look beautiful no matter what I wear.\n“Of course, Han-gyeol will say you look beautiful no matter what.”\nI nodded in agreement with Harim’s words.\n“But aren’t you curious about his reaction if you really surprise him by looking extraordinarily pretty?”\n“Yes, yes! I’m very curious.”\n“Then let’s think about what you’ll wear.”\nHarim and I searched for date looks on our phones until our homeroom teacher arrived.\nI wanted to wear something so beautiful that Han-gyeol would be utterly spellbound.\nEven though the date was still two days away, I already started feeling excited.\n“Harim.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“I really like Han-gyeol.”\n“Ugh— That’s cring. You don’t have to keep telling me that.”\n“I’m sorry. But if I don’t say it out loud, I feel like I’ll only think of Han-gyeol during class.”\n“Han-gyeol should know that you’re like this~”\n“No way! Han-gyeol teases me whenever he gets the chance.”\n“But it doesn’t seem like you particularly dislike it, does it?”\n“Well, that’s true.”\nI didn’t mind Han-gyeol teasing me.\nIt felt mischievous, but it also felt like Han-gyeol’s way of expressing affection.\nAnd I loved seeing the bright smile on Han-gyeol’s face whenever he teased me.\nI even thought I’d love for him to tease only me for the rest of our lives.\n“So, you’re enjoying it then?”\n“I guess. I must really, really like Han-gyeol.”\n“I didn’t ask that much, Eun-ha.”\nHarim looked at me with a slightly incredulous expression.\n“I’m sorry.”\nEven as I apologized, I was grinning from ear to ear.\nJust the thought of Han-gyeol brought a natural smile to my face.\nThe fluttering in my chest just wouldn’t settle down.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Ah, what should I wear? This is such a tough decision.”\nDebating whether to wear a high-schooler-like blue jacket or opt for a slightly casual cardigan was a dilemma.\nFor pants, wearing straightforward black slacks seemed like a safe bet.\nI wondered if Eun-ha was facing the same worries as me.\n“Let’s just go with the blue jacket.”\nAfter some consideration, I decided on the blue jacket.\nThen, after stepping out, I asked my mother, who was sitting on the sofa.\n“Mom, do you think this blue jacket suits me?”\n“Just wear anything and head out. You were born looking just fine.”\n“I always keep that in mind.”\n“By the way, where are you off to?”\n“To look at the cherry blossom.”\n“Be careful out there.”\n“I will.”\nI put on my canvas shoes and opened the front door.\nI was already curious about what Eun-ha would wear.\nPerhaps a dress that matches well with spring?\nBut I hoped it wouldn’t be too pretty.\nI didn’t want her catching the eyes of passing men.\nWe had planned to meet at the subway station and head to the festival together, but Eun-ha suggested meeting at the mountain entrance where the festival was taking place instead.\nI boarded the subway, passed one station, then two, then three, and got off.\nUpon exiting, I saw many couples heading towards the mountain where the festival was being held.\n“I’m not even envious.”\nThe distant view of cherry blossom trees bathed in pink hues caught my eye as I decided to wait for Eun-ha at the entrance.\nWith approximately 20 minutes left until our scheduled meet-up time, I casually sat on a bench, observing the passersby.\nEach person strolled by, their faces illuminated with bright smiles, reveling in the sight of the blossoms.\nI too glanced at the cherry blossoms, but shifted my gaze to my phone, wanting to enjoy the view with Eun-ha.\nAbout 10 minutes passed this way when someone stood before me, repeating my name in a soft voice.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah-Eun-ha you are here...!”\nThe instant I saw Eun-ha, my smartphone slipped from my grasp.\nWith a thud, it hit the ground, but I couldn’t even think about picking it up.\nThe sight of Eun-ha standing before me was utterly entrancing, causing my soul to momentarily depart.\nA white sweater paired with a skirt the color of cherry blossoms and hair tied in a ponytail - from head to toe, Eun-ha was... breathtaking.\nI wanted to tell her she looked beautiful, but the word ‘beautiful’ was woefully inadequate to capture her allure.\n“An angel…”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I mean, I can’t find the right words to describe…”\nAt my words, a shy smile danced across Eun-ha’s face.\n“Does it... suit me?”\n“Yes. Extremely well.”\nNodding repeatedly, I responded.\n“I’m elated…”\nOnly then did I pick up the smartphone that had fallen.\nAs I rose from the bench, Eun-ha spoke, her voice laced with shy embarrassment.\n“Han-gyeol, you look great too.”\n“Thanks for saying that. I did put some thought into what I wore, though not as much as you did. It’s a bit embarrassing.”\n“No! You really look cool! From afar, I could only see you.”\n“You now effortlessly say things that can make one blush.”\n“I learned it from you.”\n“You’re becoming like me.”\n“They say you start to resemble someone you like.”\nToday, of all days, Eun-ha kept uttering words that sent my heart pounding. Feeling my face heating up, I averted my gaze here and there.\n“Han-gyeol, why aren’t you looking at me?”\n“You’re so beautiful it’s hard to look at you directly. It feels strenuous to my heart.”\n“I wore these clothes to show you. I wish you would look at me more.”\nAs Eun-ha wished, I stole a glance at her. The instant I saw her beaming smile, my face flushed furiously.\n“Han-gyeol, your face turned really red.”\n“It’s because of you, Eun-ha.”\n“Hey, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah. What?”\n“Can you... say it properly?”\n“Say what?”\n“I like hearing that I look like an angel and that I’m so pretty it’s hard to look at me... but can you say it properly?”\nWow— a critical hit.\n“Eun-ha, you’re incredibly beautiful.”\nUpon hearing my words, Eun-ha’s face turned red.\n“Now, let’s start our official cherry blossoms viewing.”\n“Great…! Where shall we start?”\n“Let’s admire the cherry blossoms for a bit, then grab some food nearby.”\n“Okay! Sounds good. Can we hold hands before that? It is not uncomfortable?”\n“Why would it be? Come on, let’s go.”\nAs I reached out my hand, Eun-ha softly grasped it.\n“Okay. Let’s go.”\nAs we passed the festival entrance, rows of cherry blossom trees bathed in pink hues stood side by side.\n“Wow—the cherry blossoms are so beautiful.”\n“Indeed. Pretty.”\n“Are you talking about the cherry blossoms?”\n“It was a double entendre.”\n“What does that mean?”\nEun-ha smiled brightly, evidently delighted.\n“Will we come to see the cherry blossom festival next year too?”\n“Yes. I’d like to attend the cherry blossom festival with Han-gyeol every year.”\n“Should we go to Yeouido* next year?”\n“If I’m going with Han-gyeol, any place is good.”\n“Let’s go to many other places next year.”\n“I don’t really care where we go. I would be happy anywhere as long as Han-gyeol is with me.”\nUpon hearing Eun-ha’s words, I stopped walking, prompting Eun-ha to look at me with a puzzled expression.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“Your words today are unusual…”\n“Why?”\n“Should I say, somewhat proactive? It seems like Eun-ha is always the shy one.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha stood before me, the corners of her lips slightly upturned.\n“It’s because I really like Han-gyeol.”\n“I know that.”\n“I like you so much.”\n“Could you not repeat it? It’s not good for my heart.”\n“I like you. I like you. I like you. I like you more than anything in the world.”\nIt was genuinely perilous.\nIt felt as if something was relentlessly squeezing my heart with all its might.\n“I like you too…”\nInevitably, my face turned completely red.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s take a picture.”\n“Not now, I need to cool down my face.”\n“That’s why I want to take it.”\n“Then Eun-ha should turn as red as I am.”\n“Try me if you’re confident!”\nCautiously, I held both of Eun-ha’s hands. While she seemed a bit shy, her face didn’t turn as red as mine.\n“Eun-ha, can I hug you?”\n“Uh…?”\n“Can I?”\n“Well…”\nEun-ha seemed to avoid my gaze for a moment, then nodded her head.\nAs I gently pulled Eun-ha’s hands toward me, she snuggly fit into my embrace.\nShe also wrapped her arms around my waist, and after a brief moment, we pulled away. Immediately, I checked Eun-ha’s face, and it was as uncontrollably red as mine.\n“Fair now. Let’s take that picture.”\n“Wa, wait—! Let my face cool down a bit!”\n“Look here—”\nI opened the camera app on my phone.\nOur faces were captured on the smartphone screen.\n“Now— Eun-ha, smile.”\n“Okay. Take a nice one.”\nBelieving we had achieved a good angle, I didn’t hesitate to press the shutter.\n“Take a look.”\n“Give me a second. Hmm, it came out well!”\nWhile I thought the picture looked fine, Eun-ha seemed to think otherwise.\n“Oh, no! What’s this? I’m completely red like a tomato! Delete it!”\nAs Eun-ha swiftly tried to snatch my smartphone, I raised my arm higher.\n“Hey, we have to commemorate our first photo as a couple.”\n“Oh—! We can take plenty more!”\n“You look cute, what’s the issue~? I should use this as my profile picture.”\n“Absolutely not!”\nEun-ha, raising her arm and pleading, looked unbearably cute.\n“Can’t I keep it?”\n“Don’t I look totally weird?”\n“Not at all. You look extremely pretty. If you want, I’ll delete it.”\n“Well... if you think it’s pretty... But send it to me too.”\n“Of course. I’ll send it right away.”\nI promptly sent the photo to Eun-ha.\nAfter examining the picture for a moment, Eun-ha subtly smiled.\n“Looking at it again, Han-gyeol, you’re also red like a tomato. I’m glad we didn’t delete it.”\n“Right?”\n“Still, I want to keep a proper picture too.”\n“Sure? Shall we take it with Eun-ha’s phone?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Look here.”\nAfter taking a few photos with Eun-ha’s phone, we looked at them. Eun-ha flipped through the photos, smiling brightly.\n“Han-gyeol looks incredibly cute.”\n“If you’re going to compliment me, can you say I look cool or handsome?”\n“You look both cool and cute. Ah— Can I use this as my profile picture?”\n“I don’t mind. Should I also use the same one for my profile picture?”\n“Ah— Wait…! I want to take one more picture.”\nEun-ha searched the ground for something, picking up a broken tree branch. She then plucked a single cherry blossom with a pop and placed it in my hair.\n“Oh, how pretty.”\n“It’s my first time having a flower in my hair.”\nWith a click, Eun-ha snapped a photo. She then showed it to me, giggling. Though I was expressionless in the picture, the flower in my hair looked ridiculously funny.\n“It came out really humorous.”\n“Don’t you find yourself a bit cute when you look at it?”\n“I have some conscience, Eun-ha.”\n“Really? You look super cute.”\nIt wasn’t a particularly good photo, but seeing Eun-ha smiling like this, I couldn’t bring myself to ask her to delete it.\n“Keep it.”\n“Okay. I’ll have to look at it every night.”\n“Now it’s Eun-ha’s turn.”\nI carefully placed a flower in Eun-ha’s hair. Smiling, she looked into the camera of my smartphone. After taking the picture with a click, I showed it to Eun-ha.\n“Wow! It came out really well, Han-gyeol. You can use this as your profile picture!”\n“I can’t use it. It’s hard to tell who’s the flower.”\n“Ah, what are you really saying..! It’s embarrassing!”\nEven as she said that, Eun-ha was smiling brightly.\n“I’m just kidding, just kidding. Should we stop taking pictures and walk a bit more?”\n“Yes, yes. Let’s hold hands again.”\n“Alright.”\nAfter grasping the hand Eun-ha extended, we began to walk again.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Yeouido: Yeouido is an island in Seoul, South Korea, and here they were talking about the Yeouido Cherry Blossom Festival, which is one of the most popular places to see the blooms each spring.\nAnd Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Han-gyeol, in the spring, we should always go to the cherry blossom festival. And in summer, where do you prefer: the valley or the beach?”\n“If I had to choose, I’d prefer the valley. What about you, Eun-ha?”\n“I like the beach, but I think the valley could be nice too.”\n“Then we could alternate each year.”\nEven though it was now spring, I found myself thinking about the upcoming summer.\nAnd even further, to winter.\n“How about watching the autumn leaves in fall? And maybe a ski resort in winter? Between skiing and snowboarding, which one do you prefer?”\n“I haven’t been to a ski resort, so I wouldn’t know. Of course, I’ve never tried skiing or snowboarding.”\n“Really? I’ve only been to a ski resort once during middle school with my family.”\n“Then we can go skiing this winter. We would’ve finished our college entrance exams, so it’ll be a good time to have fun.”\n“True. Unfortunately, we might have to study through this summer and fall.”\n“If it doesn’t interfere with our studies, maybe a day off wouldn’t hurt?”\n“That’s true. But don’t you think we’re planning too much fun?”\n“As long as we meet our study quota like this time, it should be fine~”\n“Right. Having a reward right in front of us does seem to make studying easier.”\nI continued chatting, hand in hand with Han-gyeol.\nI came here to see the cherry blossoms, but I found myself looking at Han-gyeol more.\nWhenever our eyes met, it felt both embarrassing and fun to turn away.\nAs we walked, a woman cautiously approached and spoke to me.\n“Excuse me, could you please take a photo for us?”\n“Of course! And after, could you do the same for us?”\nI readily nodded my head and asked.\nWe hadn’t managed to take a full-body photo, so I was grateful for her offer.\n“Of course. Why not?”\nAfter receiving the woman’s phone, I stepped back a little.\nThough our meeting was fleeting, I put my heart into taking the picture. Since we were asking for one in return, I couldn’t take it carelessly.\n“Hold on...! I’ll take just one more!”\nAfter taking a final shot, I handed back the phone. The elegant woman who took her phone from me expressed her gratitude without even checking the photos.\n“Both of you, please stand under the cherry blossom tree. I’ll make sure to capture you two beautifully.”\n“Ah—okay! Han-gyeol, let’s go.”\n“Alright. Thank you.”\n“Don’t worry, I’ve got the magic touch.”\nHan-gyeol and I thanked her before positioning ourselves under the cherry blossom tree.\n“Han-gyeol, what pose should we do?”\n“What do you feel like doing, Eun-ha?”\n“Um... How about a heart with our hands?”\n“Sure. Let’s do that.”\nWe both interlaced our thumbs and index fingers, forming a heart, and took the photo. After snapping our picture, the lady suggested, “Try a different pose!” We hesitated for a moment.\n“Oh, what should we do?”\n“Why worry? Just go with the flow. Come here.”\nGently, Han-gyeol placed his hand on my shoulder. Although a bit shy, I carefully wrapped my arm around Han-gyeol’s waist. With a natural smile playing on our lips, we looked towards the phone.\nAfter capturing the moment, the woman handed my phone back with a broad smile.\n“Thank you.”\nHan-gyeol and I expressed our gratitude once again.\n“We should be thanking you. Here’s the photo. Please check it out!”\nThe woman handed me my phone.\nI immediately looked at the photo she had taken, and it was beautifully captured.\n“Wow...! It came out so beautifully!”\n“Whoa...! Is this a photoshoot or something?”\n“Really? That’s good to hear.”\n“Thank you so much!”\n“Well then, we’ll be on our way. Wishing you both a beautiful relationship~ Thank you.”\n“Yes~ Wishing you both the same.”\nEven after the couple had left, we couldn’t tear our eyes away from the photo. It was so beautiful that I wanted to show it off to others. But, we had already decided to use the earlier picture for our profile...\n“Should we use it as our wallpaper?”\n“Do you want to set it as the wallpaper?”\nHan-gyeol and I spoke simultaneously. Surprised at our synchronous thought, we stared into each other’s eyes.\n“Whoa! You had the same thought as me?”\n“Exactly. Since we’ve already decided on the profile picture, I thought about the wallpaper.”\n“Me too!”\nI was thrilled that Han-gyeol and I were on the same page. We truly were a perfect match.\n“Eun-ha, are you hungry? We’ve been here for a while. Shall we go grab something to eat?”\n“Yes, yes. Let’s go have spicy pork stir-fry.”\n“Spicy pork stir-fry?”\n“You like spicy pork stir-fry, Han-gyeol. The pork cutlet is good too.”\n“I mean, I do like it, but is spicy pork stir-fry and pork cutlet really okay for our first date?”\n“There’s no hard and fast rule, right? And I love spicy pork stir-fry too!”\nSince Han-gyeol and I had pork cutlet last time, we decided on spicy pork stir-fry for today.\n“Do you want to eat something else?”\n“I want spicy pork stir-fry.”\n“You really want spicy pork stir-fry?”\n“Yes, I want to have spicy pork stir-fry.”\n“Alright, let’s go have some. Where should we go?”\n“Hmm... Good question. Let me look it up.”\nI quickly searched on my smartphone.\nAlthough I typed in ‘spicy pork stir-fry restaurants’, most of the results were snack bars. While I was looking for a place within walking distance, a ‘Gisa Shikdang*’ caught my eye.\nHmm... I remember hearing somewhere that ‘Gisa Shikdang’ is a real gem.\n“Should we go here?”\n“Where? Is this a Gisa Shikdang?”\n“Yeah. I heard somewhere that most ‘Gisa Shikdang’ are pretty good.”\n“I’m all for it, but don’t you want to go somewhere with a nicer ambiance?”\n“Of course, that’d be great too. But I want to see you enjoying the food you love.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol chuckled and said,\n“Alright. Where is it? If it’s far, should we take a bus or a taxi?”\n“It seems to be about a 15-minute walk. Let’s take our time walking.”\n“Sounds good.”\nStill holding hands, we headed toward the ‘Gisa Shikdang’. Some might find it peculiar, but as long as we, the ones involved, were happy, that was all that mattered.\n****\nAs we entered the Gisa Shikdang, we promptly placed our order.\n“Could we get two orders of spicy pork stir-fry, please?”\n“Sure~ It’ll be right up!”\nThe friendly-looking owner responded with a warm smile as he prepared our dishes.\nIt hadn’t been long since we ordered when two generous servings were placed in front of Han-gyeol and me. The side dishes laid out on each tray looked appetizing, and the spicy pork stir-fry appeared mouth-watering.\n“Enjoy your meal. If you need anything more, just let me know.”\n“Thank you. Let’s eat, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, it looks delicious. Let’s dig in.”\nHan-gyeol was the first to take a bite of the spicy pork stir-fry.\nSeeing his joyful smile, I felt happy too. As I began to eat, I thought to myself how glad I was to have come here. The food was as delicious, and I felt like we’d be visiting frequently.\n“Wow- This is really good.”\n“Right? It feels like we’ve discovered a gem.”\n“Whenever we crave spicy pork stir-fry, we should come here.”\n“Let’s do that.”\nIt seemed Han-gyeol really enjoyed it.\nOur first date was incredibly successful.\nThe excitement on our way to the date location.\nThe thrill upon arriving there.\nThe memories made under the cherry blossom tree.\nThe delicious meal.\nIt was a perfect date without a single flaw.\nAfter finishing our meal quickly, we promptly stood up. We were the only customers who looked like students. With adults present, we carefully pushed our chairs in and headed to the counter. The prices were reasonable, and everything seemed satisfactory. Great value for the money, perhaps?\n“Ah- Han-gyeol, I’ll cover this one. You can get the drinks at the cafe later.”\n“Mm- Is that so? Let’s do it.”\nAs I was pulling out my card, the owner spoke with a smile.\n“Oh, a gentleman earlier already paid for you.”\n“What?! Really?”\nHan-gyeol and I exchanged surprised glances.\n“Yes. He said you two looked like his children, so he covered it for you. You can just leave.”\n“Has he left long ago?! We didn’t even get to thank him···!”\n“Oh, he’s been gone for quite a while now. He must’ve already taken a taxi.”\nAs Han-gyeol and I stood there flustered, an older gentleman from behind commented.\n“Seems he paid on your behalf because you reminded him of his children! It’s alright, you should go.”\n“Seeing young faces like yours in a place like this must’ve brightened his day! Of course, he’d cover it. Be careful on your way out, students!”\nUpon hearing the gentlemen’s remarks, Han-gyeol smiled and gave a respectful bow.\n“Thank you. Enjoy your meal!”\nSeeing Han-gyeol bow, I instinctively lowered my head as well.\n“We, we had a good meal! Please enjoy yours.”\nWith a final exchange of greetings with the gentlemen, we exited the restaurant. It was challenging to articulate the feeling — whether it felt warmly emotional or had a ticklish excitement — but we were elated.\n“Shall we head to the cafe now?”\n“Yes! I’m in such a good mood, I’ll treat you.”\n“That’s problematic. I’m also in a good mood, so I want to pay.”\n“How about rock-paper-scissors? Best of three?”\n“Just one round.”\nIt was a day where we received kindness from a stranger whose name and face we did not know. Even if I were to lose a bet on such a day, I felt the mood would remain high all day long. It was a joyous day, memorable enough to be recalled in the distant future.\nPerhaps, love is about steadily stacking up memories known only to the two involved?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Gisa Shikdang: In Korea, Gisa Shikdang refers to eateries or dining places tailored for drivers, especially taxi drivers, offering them affordable meals and a place to rest during their breaks. Think of it as a counterpart to the American ‘truck stop,’ but more oriented toward urban taxi drivers than long-haul truckers.\nAnd Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

Where did you go for the Cherry Blossom Festival?”\nPerhaps it was because of the profile picture and the wallpaper, but most of our classmates knew about Han-gyeol and me.\nAs soon as I arrived at school, I was surrounded by my classmates, bombarded with all sorts of questions.\n“We started dating last week, and I was the one who confessed first.”\nMy whisper made all the classmates present show a mixture of shock and excitement, but soon enough, their faces twisted back into expressions of intrigue, leaning in closer.\nIt was understandable, given our age of nineteen, brimming with romantic notions about love and relationships.\n“Guys. The teacher will be here soon, maybe we should go back to our seats...?!”\n“No way, no way! We have a mountain of questions~”\n“I’m in trouble...haha...!”\n“How did you confess?!”\n“Well...I just babbled on and then told Han-gyeol I liked him.”\n“Kyaaa-! And then? What did Han-gyeol say?”\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, I lowered my head and said,\n“Han-gyeol said...he liked me too.”\n“Hehehe...! Really? So, how is it? Is it nice?”\n“Yeah. It’s really nice. Now- guys! The teacher really will be here soon, let’s sit down.”\n“Okay, okay. We might have prodded you too much? Date nicely~ If Han-gyeol does something wrong, tell us.”\n“Mhm mhm. Go quickly.”\nAfter all the classmates went back to their seats, I had a brief chat with Harim.\n“Eun-ha. You look tired.”\n“Huh? Do I? I was on the phone with Han-gyeol until late last night, so I slept in.”\n“That’s not what I need to know, but okay…”\n“Ugh- sorry. But if it’s not Harim, I have no one to talk about this.”\nHarim wore a pleasantly surprised smile at my words.\n“So, talking like that, huh? So? How was the Cherry Blossom Festival?”\n“It was~ awesome. I wore the outfit that you and I picked out, and Han-gyeol really loved it. Thanks.”\n“Really? Then let’s go shopping together next time.”\n“Yeah. Sure. Ah- the teacher’s here. Now shh-”\nAs soon as the conversation with Harim was over, the homeroom teacher came in.\nThe teacher said it was time to adapt to our senior year in high school and that we needed to live a life as serious exam students now.\nEven though it felt a bit conspicuous starting a relationship with Han-gyeol during such a time, if I could turn back, I’d confess again.\nEven while dating, my feelings for Han-gyeol kept overflowing.\nThey were emotions I couldn’t contain from the start.\n***\nAfter the 1st and 2nd periods ended, the 3rd period of math class began.\nSince Jang Yujin introduced Han-gyeol as ‘Newton’ before, the math teacher would call Han-gyeol whenever.\nToday was no different; the teacher called Han-gyeol to solve the problem written on the board.\n“Newton, come out.”\n“Ah- Why is it always me?”\n“You’re Newton, aren’t you? So come out.”\n“Ugh- Teacher. How about giving a chance to other students sometimes?”\n“Fine. Is there anyone else who will solve the math problem instead of Newton, no, Lee Han-gyeol?”\nAt the math teacher’s words, a silence enveloped the classroom.\nIn a silence so thick one couldn’t even hear breathing, I cautiously raised my hand.\nThe math teacher’s eyes widened, staring intensely at me.\nAnd then, looking back at Han-gyeol, he shouted.\n“Newton! You must be a good guy, huh?! This is the first time I’ve seen someone volunteer during my teaching career! Alright! She’s solving it instead?”\nWith the teacher’s words, the class turned their heads towards me.\nWith a proud smile, they let out a collective, ‘Oh~’ in astonishment.\nI was so embarrassed that if there were a mouse hole, I would want to crawl in and hide.\n“...Yes! I’ll try to solve it instead.”\n“But why do you want to solve it instead? I’m genuinely curious.”\nThe classmates answered the teacher’s question.\n“They’re dating.”\n“They went to see the cherry blossoms over the weekend.”\nHearing the classmates’ words, the math teacher looked at me.\n“If you can’t solve it, will you stand behind your boyfriend and take the class? Still want to solve it?”\nThe math teacher teased me with those words.\nBut since the math teacher started it... I responded a bit boldly.\n“If, if I get it right, please grant me a favor.”\n“Wow~ Making a deal here, huh? Hey, Newton. Should I accept this?”\n“Teacher, please accept it manfully.”\n“Wow~ This is fun. Alright. I accept. But if you can’t solve it, how about a buzz cut for Newton?”\n“Teacher, that seems a bit too harsh. In a few years, I will have to shave my head anyway*...!”\nThe situation seemed to be escalating.\nBut there was no turning back now.\n“I, I accept! Then, is it okay if I make an appropriate request too?!”\n“Eun-ha? Wait a moment... Eun-ha?!”\nHan-gyeol urgently stood up from his seat.\n“It’s okay. I just need to get it right.”\n“No, Eun-ha. Just wait! Life has moments where what you are sure is the right answer turns out to be wrong-!”\n“Hey, hey. Someone shut Newton up.”\nWith the math teacher’s statement, the boys sitting in front and behind silenced Han-gyeol by covering his mouth.\n“Uhh-! Uhhuhh-!”\n“Don’t worry. I can solve it.”\nI assured Han-gyeol, locking eyes with him.\nSeeing my gaze, Han-gyeol quickly calmed down.\nBut honestly, I wasn’t certain.\n“Maybe...?”\n“Uhh-! Uhhuhh-!!”\n“Puhahahaha-! Alright! If you’re wrong, your boyfriend gets a buzz cut. If you’re right, I’ll grant your request.”\n“You promise, right?! You can’t go back on your word!”\n“If I break a promise, I’ll remain a bachelor for life. What will you do if your boyfriend refuses to cut his hair?”\n“In that case, I’ll cut my own hair.”\n“Wow~ I will honor it forever... Now- everyone, applause!”\nAs I received the class’s applause, I boldly walked to the chalkboard.\nAlthough I read the problem slowly, it certainly wasn’t easy.\nStill, I took a deep breath and picked up the chalk.\nWhile sketching the graph of the function on the board, I found the graph that suited the problem.\nFrom then on, I checked the conditional statements, wrote down the formula, and as time passed, wrote down the answer.\nHowever, the number seemed somewhat ambiguous.\n“486...? The number is slightly ambiguous; do you want more time?”\n“Just...one moment, please! Let me double-check.”\nOnce again, I went through the problem, checking for any missed points.\nAlthough the number 486 bothered me, I chose not to change my answer, holding onto confidence.\n“It’s 486.”\n“Are you sure? I’ll really shave Newton’s head if it’s wrong, you know?”\n“It’s the correct answer, so it’s okay.”\n“Really? Or else what?”\n“There’s no way it’s wrong.”\nAs I spoke firmly, the teacher wore an inscrutable expression.\nWas I wrong after all? Was it an incorrect answer? I was confident that Han-gyeol would even be okay with becoming bald!\nThe moment I swallowed, the teacher clapped his hands.\n“Wowwww~! That’s the correct answer!”\n“Woah-! Really?! It’s 486?! Han-gyeol! I got it right!”\nI looked at Han-gyeol with a smile.\nWithout a word, Han-gyeol gave me a thumbs up.\nI wanted to run over and hug him right then and there, but alas, we were at school.\nStill, I was in an extremely good mood.\n“Alright. What’s your request?”\nIt seemed like the teacher was going to keep his promise and grant my request. The vow of lifelong bachelorhood must have weighed on his mind.\n“Let me sit next to Han-gyeol during math class-!”\nWhen I made my confident request, not only the teacher but all of my classmates looked at me, their eyes wide.\nI thought it would be a request anyone might make...!\nThe math teacher alternated his wide-open gaze between Han-gyeol and me.\nI hadn’t anticipated this reaction.\nIt seemed like I had blurted out something immensely embarrassing.\nWhile my face heated up in an instant, a few mischievous boys stood up.\n“Teacher! My stomach hurts!”\n“My stomach hurts too!”\n“Teacher! My molar is sensitive! I think I need to go to the nurse’s office.”\n“Aaargh-! Send me to the dentist...!”\nWhen a few of the playful boys shouted, all the classmates laughed.\n“Alright, alright- settle down. A promise is a promise, so do as you please. I mean it. You can go back to your seats now.”\n“Yes...!”\nI returned to my seat, doing my best to hide my blushing face.\nThe math teacher opened the textbook again and continued the lesson.\nHe picked up the chalk and began writing an equation on the board, then suddenly stopped.\nHe put down the chalk with a thud- and looked back at us.\n“Kids. We have a big problem.”\n“Why?”\n“Ugh- I felt like someone had smacked my head with a hammer. I can’t teach like this.”\nThe whole class burst into laughter at the teacher’s comment.\nIt took quite some time before the lesson resumed.\nEven though I was embarrassed for making such a bold move, now I can sit next to Han-gyeol during every math class.\nAs that little wish became a reality, the corners of my mouth kept rising.\nI’m so happy.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: *: In South Korea, individuals entering mandatory military service are often required to shave their heads as part of the military grooming standards.\nAnd Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Alright- That concludes our lesson for today. Newton and Newton’s girlfriend, please sit together from the next class. Date sweetly. That’s it. Class is over.”\n“Thank you for your hard work~”\n“Sure~.”\nEven after the math teacher left the classroom and the lesson was over...\nNo one in the class got up from their seats.\nThey silently looked back and forth between Eun-ha and me, seemingly observing how we were getting along.\nThere were those who looked with envious eyes, and those who softly lamented, as if to ask, ‘Is this really happening?’\nI stood up, thinking that if either Eun-ha or I made a move, the others would go about their own business.\n“Eun-ha, let’s go to the canteen.”\n“Ah- Yep!”\nIt seemed like Eun-ha had the same thought, for she hastily got up from her seat.\nQuickly, she rushed to my side and we exited the classroom together.\nEun-ha couldn’t meet my eyes, perhaps because she was incredibly embarrassed about the current situation.\n“That was a very bold move, wasn’t it?”\nAt my words, Eun-ha stopped in her tracks and covered her face with her hands.\n“Eun-ha, even your ears are red. It’s okay. I was really happy.”\n“Uuu···! I didn’t think they’d react that much! Was I really that bold?”\n“Essentially, you said you wanted to be with me all day.”\n“That’s not wrong, but···!”\n“What?!”\nI was also caught off guard by Eun-ha’s remark.\nDating really sends the heart pounding without any mercy.\n“Is it not the same for Han-gyeol···? Is it just me?”\nEun-ha looked at me through the cracks between her fingers.\nI couldn’t lie when she looked at me with such hopeful eyes.\n“Me too···”\n“Is Han-gyeol embarrassed?”\n“I wasn’t embarrassed!”\n“You definitely were just now?!”\n“Eun-ha. At this rate, break time will end. Let’s hurry to the canteen.”\nAs soon as I attempted to draw a boundary, Eun-ha promptly blocked my path.\nShe obstructed the direction I was trying to go with her entire body, demanding an answer.\n“You have to answer properly.”\n“Hmm···!”\n“Give me an answer. Were you embarrassed?”\nWhen I resignedly nodded, Eun-ha wore a profoundly happy smile.\nPerhaps Eun-ha was even better at expressing her emotions than I was.\nOnly then did she come to my side and match my pace as we walked.\nAs we passed through the hallway crowded with kids, Eun-ha cautiously took my hand.\nWith a mischievous grin- she looked up at me.\n“Does Han-gyeol get embarrassed if I say things like I did earlier?”\n“If you say embarrassing things, of course, it’s embarrassing.”\n“I really like seeing Han-gyeol’s embarrassed expression.”\n“It’s not a face I particularly want to show, so why do you like it?”\n“Well... because only I get to see Han-gyeol’s embarrassed face. And also-”\nEun-ha continued shyly.\nBiting my lip slightly, I braced myself for Eun-ha’s next words.\nSurely they would be words that would strike my heart...!\n“I’m so happy because it feels like I get to monopolize Han-gyeol’s embarrassed expression.”\nAs expected... I tried to bite my lip a bit harder, but it was futile.\nNo matter how many walls I built up, Eun-ha shattered them with a single word.\nWith that single phrase, a natural smile bloomed on my face.\n“Eun-ha. You really···!”\n“Why? Did I say something embarrassing again?”\n“No. Please keep expressing your feelings so honestly.”\n“Then, will you keep showing me that embarrassed face?”\n“I’ll show it as much as you want.”\n“Yes. I like it.”\nI guess I could no longer call Eun-ha a girl who was clumsy at expressing feelings.\nHow could I say that when she expresses her emotions so candidly?\n“Yes. I like Eun-ha too. Extremely so.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha’s face turned beet red in an instant.\nAlthough she had become adept at expressing, receiving expressions still seemed to be embarrassingly unfamiliar territory.\nSeeing her like this, she was indeed the Eun-ha I knew.\n“Why? Are you embarrassed now that I said it?”\n“Ah-! The canteen is going to close! Let’s hurry!”\n“Eun-ha. You have to answer properly.”\nWith a smile, I parroted back the same words Eun-ha had said to me.\nEun-ha wriggled side to side, trying to escape, but I blocked her with my body.\nOnly then did she speak in a small voice.\n“I’m embarrassed···”\n“Mmhm. I can tell by looking at your face.”\n“Ah-! Stop teasing!”\n“We should get a cream bun you like at the canteen.”\n“Ah-! That’s all in the past!”\n“You were so cute back then.”\n“Are you listening to me?! Forget about it!”\n“Alright-! Let’s go, my Cream Puff!”\n“Don’t call your girlfriend weird names-! What’s with ‘Cream Puff’?”\n‘I’m so happy I could die.’\nI too, wanted to monopolize Eun-ha’s embarrassed expression.\n***\nI was on my way home after having dinner with Eun-ha.\nShe was eating the orange-flavored candy I gave her for dessert.\n“Eun-ha, what are you going to do when you get home?”\n“Probably study? Midterms are in a few weeks.”\n“We couldn’t talk last weekend since you were sick, and we went to see the cherry blossoms over the weekend.”\n“Mm-hm. Why?”\n“Just thinking, whenever we have time, should we study together? I’m not attending any cram school or anything.”\nAt my suggestion, Eun-ha blushed, seemingly pleased.\nReally, her expressions transparently revealed whatever was on her mind.\n“Okay. Is it alright with Han-gyeol?”\n“I’d like to study with Eun-ha, too.”\n“Should we buy something to drink on our way home, then?”\n“Yeah. Is there a cafe on the way?”\n“Oh, there’s a cafe inside our apartment complex. Let’s buy from there.”\n“Today, I’ll have whatever Eun-ha’s having.”\nEun-ha seemed slightly pleased that I was matching my order to hers.\nShe asked me with a clear, bright smile.”\n“Even if I order something super unappetizing?”\n“Yes. Even if you order something super unappetizing.”\n“Really~ Stop liking me so much.”\n“How do I even do that?”\n“Can’t manage?”\n“Nope.”\n“Then keep liking me.”\n“I will.”\nWith bright, cheerful smiles, we arrived at the café.\n“Two Hallabong Ade, please.”\n“Sure. I’ll prepare them right away. Please wait a moment.”\nAfter placing the order, Eun-ha stood next to me.\n“Is Hallabong Ade okay? That’s what I ordered.”\n“Mm-hm. I like it too. But, Eun-ha, you seem to have a particular liking for citrus fruits.”\n“I like oranges, hallabongs, cheonhyehyangs, and tangerines too.”\n“Is there a specific reason why you like them so much?”\n“Umm...I’m not sure? I don’t remember well, but I think I’ve often eaten them since trying them in Jeju Island.”\nIt didn’t seem like there was a particularly special reason.\n“What fruit do you like, Han-gyeol?”\n“Just plain old apples.”\n“I’ll remember that.”\n“When we get old, Eun-ha can plant a tangerine tree, and I’ll plant an apple tree.”\nEun-ha’s bashful expression was something I wanted to see.\nSo, that was why I blurted out those words...\nUnexpectedly, rather than becoming bashful, Eun-ha responded with a smile.\n“Right. That would truly be nice.”\n“Hm-?”\n“I think I’d be okay with living and dying that way.”\nOf course, I too desired such a life.\nBut the weight of the words I just spat out, even to my own ears, was light.\nIt was a statement without even a vague plan, yet Eun-ha took it incredibly seriously.\nShe might have thought it was an irresponsible remark...\nBut rather, Eun-ha painted a picture of our future together in her mind and smiled.\nIf I’d known she would take it this way, I would’ve said it in a more serious atmosphere.\nSince I couldn’t take back what was said, I hastily apologized.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Huh? Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?”\n“I feel like I spoke too lightly.”\n“Huh? I know that even though you spoke playfully, it wasn’t empty words. So, don’t apologize.”\n“Will you believe anything I say?”\n“Of course. Wouldn’t it be weirder not to trust Han-gyeol, after all this time?”\nEun-ha spoke as if it was a given.\n“Is that so...? I’m curious. What do you see that makes you trust me like that?”\n“Seeing you speak honestly and accept things as they are?”\n“Eh? Isn’t that nothing special?”\n“In my personal opinion, I think that’s the hardest thing? Han-gyeol does so effortlessly what I find most difficult and can’t do. So, while it makes me envious, it’s also cool. That’s why I want to be like Han-gyeol, I guess. I want to become a person like you.”\nIt was a heart-pounding emotion, yet describing it as just ‘heart-pounding’ seemed inadequate.\nHow should I put it... it was a feeling that was immensely joyful, shy, and thankful all at once.\nIt felt like an affirmation of the person called ‘me’ and ‘my life’ in its entirety.\n“I really like that about you, Han-gyeol. Of course, there are countless reasons why I like Han-gyeol, aside from that.”\nIn my own estimation, I was not as impressive as Eun-ha thought I was.\nHowever, I deeply wished for Eun-ha to continue looking at me in that way.\n“I’ll try. So that Eun-ha can keep thinking of me like that.”\n“Hmm? Why try? Because Han-gyeol is already that person, aren’t you?”\n“Still, I’ll try.”\nAs I clenched my fist and spoke, Eun-ha softly laughed and gently stroked my head.\n“You’re so admirable.”\n“Let’s live planting tangerine and apple trees, no matter what.”\n“Shall we? Ah- does that mean we have to live in the countryside?”\n“Shall we secretly plant one each somewhere?”\n“Isn’t that illegal? Or can’t we buy just a small plot of land somewhere?”\n“Should I look around for some real estate?”\n“Should we look around together after exams?”\nWhen I spoke in jest, Eun-ha responded with a warm smile.\n“Let’s focus on studying for now and think about it step by step. We still have plenty of time.”\n“Yep! Let’s do that. Ah- I want to become an adult with Han-gyeol soon.”\n“What do you want to do once you become an adult?”\n“Hmm- I want to do everything that can be done as an adult, with Han-gyeol.”\n“Okay. Let’s do that.”\nThere was still a long time left until next year, yet I wanted to become an adult fast.\nThere were just too many things I wanted to do.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "When we got home, we sat down at a desk in the living room.\nLeaning back side by side, we each were engrossed in our studies.\nAbout an hour and a half must have passed like this.\nMy concentration was waning a bit, and my body felt slightly stiff.\nStretching out in a big yawn, I stealthily turned my head to the side.\nThe side profile of Han-gyeol, silently dedicated to his studies, came into view.\nIn a house occupied just by the two of us, being arm in arm with his girlfriend, he was impressively focused.\nIt was admirable and cool but on the other hand, slightly maddening.\nDid he not have any thoughts in his head?\nWas he too accustomed to coming to my house?\nTruthfully, I wanted to be a little playful.\nLike holding hands. Or resting my head on his shoulder.\nSomething like that.\nEventually, I subtly shifted, pressing my body closer to Han-gyeol.\nWhen our bodies touched, Han-gyeol turned his head toward me.\nWhat was he going to say?\n“Is it narrow? Should I move over a bit?”\n“Hm? No? It wasn’t really too narrow?”\n“But you need to study comfortably. I’ll move to the other side.”\nHan-gyeol gave a small, secretive smile and moved to the opposite side.\nTaking one step closer felt like being ten steps further away.\nYes, there should be days when my true feelings go unnoticed.\nYet, I wondered, how far would it take for him to recognize my heart?\nSlyly, I stretched out my leg and gave Han-gyeol’s foot a gentle nudge.\nHowever, Han-gyeol promptly pulled his leg inward.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Hmm. Why did you call me?”\n“I have a question I don’t understand.”\n“Oh yeah? Which one?”\nHan-gyeol stretched his head forward.\nOrdinarily, I would have turned the reference book for Han-gyeol’s convenience, but I did not.\n“Can you come over and help?”\n“Sure. Which one is it?”\nSetting down his pen, Han-gyeol came over to my side.\nI pushed the reference book towards him, pointing out the most difficult question.\nHan-gyeol carefully scanned the problem with his eyes and then pulled over his notebook.\n“Ah- this question? This one’s tricky. Look here.”\n“Hmm? You’ve worked on this question before?”\n“Yeah. Eun-ha and I studied with the same reference book.”\nThis wasn’t it...\n“Okay- this problem may sound a bit twisted, but it’s easy if we take it step by step. Don’t try to understand the problem all at once. If you think about the conditions while solving it, it’s easy, you know? Let’s first look at condition (a). The number of existing different real numbers k-”\nI thought Han-gyeol being good at studying was incredibly cool.\nHowever, him being too good at studying and things not going according to my intentions was slightly regrettable.\n“Did you understand?”\n“No, I don’t get it from the middle part.”\n“That can happen. Let’s go through the problem more carefully. Which part confused you?”\nI could just honestly say I wanted to have some physical contact, but I was terribly shy.\nAnd though it was selfish, I also wished that Han-gyeol would initiate the physical contact first.\nEven if it was not necessarily physical contact, I knew Han-gyeol liked me, but I wanted to feel more conspicuously loved.\nLike the gentle stroking he had given me before...\n“I understood condition (a), but I can’t understand condition (b).”\n“Ah- I also thought the explanation for that part was lacking. Let’s look at it again.”\nHan-gyeol explained it to me once more.\nI couldn’t make Han-gyeol’s consideration a wasted effort, so I listened intently.\nThanks to Han-gyeol, who made everything sink into my ears easily, I quickly understood.\n“So- Eun-ha, what’s the answer?”\n“41″\nI blurted out the answer nonchalantly.\nJust when I thought I should just be honest, Han-gyeol’s sizable hand touched my head.\n“Well done.”\nI jolted slightly when Han-gyeol began to tenderly stroke my hair.\nI shrugged my shoulders and continued to accept Han-gyeol’s gentle caress.\nA soft smile curled up at the corners of my mouth, radiating happiness.\n“Alright- let’s work hard on the rest of the study.”\nThe moment Han-gyeol stopped stroking and withdrew his hand,\nUnconsciously, I seized his wrist.\nI was the most surprised at my own action.\n“Whoa.”\n“Miss it?”\n“Uh-?! No! It’s just something I did without realizing.”\n“So, unconsciously, Eun-ha wants more strokes, huh?”\n“Ah-! Well... uh, if it’s okay with Han-gyeol, just a little more...”\nReally, just a tiny bit more; I won’t ask for much, just wished for a little more caressing.\nGently, I placed Han-gyeol’s hand back onto my head.\nThen, Han-gyeol began to stroke again.\nIt felt like being loved and it was comforting.\nBut I decided to refrain from behaving like that again.\nBecause I felt really really embarrassed.\n“Shall we take a short break from studying?”\n“Yeah. It doesn’t have to be long, just for a bit.”\n“Are you satisfied with the head-patting now?”\n“Hmm- just one more minute.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was an all-too-short one minute.\n“I should have said five minutes.”\n“...”\n“It’s fine now.”\n“Isn’t that too sharp of an ending?”\n“I’ll miss it too. But your wrist might hurt, Han-gyeol, so I’ll be content here.”\n“I’ll miss it too.”\n“Then, should I stroke your head this time, Han-gyeol?”\nBeing stroked was nice, but doing the stroking was also nice.\n“You’re going to stroke my head?”\n“Yup yup. I’ll stroke your head.”\n“Won’t your arm hurt because of the height difference, Eun-ha?”\n“Uh... then do you want to use my lap as a pillow?”\nI tapped my thigh lightly with my left hand.\n“Are you serious?”\n“Of course. Come on- hurry up.”\nAlthough it was a bit embarrassing, I quickly pushed the desk away.\nAnd gently brought Han-gyeol’s head onto my thigh.\nAs soon as Han-gyeol lay down with a soft tap on my thigh, I began to stroke his head.\n“How is it? Comfortable?”\n“Yeah. It’s super comfortable. Even makes me sleepy.”\n“You can sleep. I’ll do it until you wake up.”\n“That can’t happen. Who knows what Eun-ha might do.”\n“Will I only do bad things?”\n“Look at this. You’re only thinking about doing naughty things.”\nI asked playfully in response to Han-gyeol’s words.\nIt was a ‘now you try being teased too’ kind of feeling.\nIt seemed Han-gyeol was also a bit shy about this physical affection.\n“What’s the naughty thing~?”\n“Whatever Eun-ha is thinking.”\n“Uh...?!”\nWhenever I tried to tease, Han-gyeol always managed to turn it back on me.\nMy face was burning when Han-gyeol poked my cheek with a pop-.\n“Why are you making that face?”\n“Ah, seriously-! I’m teased again!”\n“What was that naughty thing Eun-ha was thinking?”\nHan-gyeol said, holding back laughter.\n“Forget it. I’m not telling.”\n“If you look closely, it’s Eun-ha who’s more cheeky, they say.”\n“What-?!”\nI poked Han-gyeol’s cheek with my finger.\nWhen I pressed down with a squeeze-, Han-gyeol’s cheek indented.\n“Eun-ha, you’re going to poke a hole in my cheek.”\n“Spending every day without fail just teasing your girlfriend...”\n“Do you dislike being teased?”\n“Huh? Not at all? I know it’s a form of affection from Han-gyeol.”\n“You pinpointed that.”\n“Isn’t it the truth?”\n“It is.”\n“See.”\nAlthough mischievous, Han-gyeol, resting on my lap, was incredibly cute.\nHis cheeks were soft, the hair smooth... it was lovable.\nI brushed Han-gyeol’s bangs aside, smiling.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Why?”\n“Conversely, am I properly expressing my affection to you?”\n“Huh?”\n“Me liking Han-gyeol. Can you feel it properly?”\nHan-gyeol’s eyes gradually widened at my words.\nSoon, his face flushed, and briskly, Han-gyeol sprung up and fled.\nHan-gyeol, who had run all the way to the end of the living room, was incredibly flustered.\n“Ah- where are you going? Come back quickly.”\n“No. Absolutely not.”\n“Ah, why- hurry up. Should I come to you?”\n“Uh-uh-? Eun-ha, you’re quite dangerous right now. Don’t come near.”\n“Even if your girlfriend asks you to come, you won’t, and even if I say I’ll come, you tell me not to approach. That’s too much.”\nWhen I spoke with a pout, Han-gyeol became even more confused.\nEven after I said so much, Han-gyeol became even more guarded.\n“Answer me. Can you properly feel that I like you, Han-gyeol?”\n“Yep. I feel it a lot.”\n“Really? What makes you feel it?”\n“Eun-ha keeps flirting with me.”\n“Me, me?!”\nHan-gyeol shut his eyes tight and spoke.\n“That’s also the case today. While I’m studying, you suddenly get close, don’t you? When I escape to the opposite side, you touch my foot, don’t you? When you ask me to explain an unknown problem, you make me come to your side, don’t you? You catch my wrist, trying to not stop me from caressing you, don’t you? You offer to let me use your lap as a pillow, don’t you...! It’d be strange if I didn’t feel it.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I too was taken aback.\n“Wha, what-?! You knew all along?!”\n“Surely, I don’t lack that much tact.”\n“Then, knowing all that, why don’t you show affection...! Is it burdensome when I do this? Do you dislike it?”\n“No! I really like it! Really, to the point my heart could burst...! But a house with just the two of us is too dangerous-!”\n“So, I am properly expressing my affection?!”\n“Yes. But expressing love through physical affection in a house with just the two of us is a bit dangerous, so I’m holding back.”\nUpon hearing Han-gyeol’s words, I was overjoyed.\nSeeing that Han-gyeol also wanted physical affection with me felt so good.\n“I still want to be affectionate with Han-gyeol right now.”\n“Eun-ha. Didn’t I say it’s not allowed when we’re alone in the house? Did you hear my story?”\n“Then where should we do it? We can’t at school.”\n“School might be better after all. In a different sense, the house is more dangerous.”\nThe human heart tends to want something even more when told not to do it.\nMoreover, I wanted to tease Han-gyeol, who ran away while feeling embarrassed.\n“Hehe...”\n“Eun-ha. I didn’t say that to make you laugh. I said it meaning you should be alert.”\n“Can’t we just hug for just 1 minute?”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Ah, whyyy- Just for 1 minute.”\n“Do you want to keep making things difficult...?!”\n“It won’t work. I’ll have to hug you then.”\nI pushed myself up from the floor.\nHan-gyeol also hurriedly rose from the spot.\n“Come here, Han-gyeol.”\n“It’s dangerous, Eun-ha.”\nIt seemed I had also found something to tease Han-gyeol with.\nPerhaps in terms of physical touch, Han-gyeol might be even more shy than me.\n“Just 1 minute. Just hug me for 1 minute.”\n“In the current situation, even 10 seconds is difficult.”\n“Ah, why-!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was having lunch with Eun-ha.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol. After eating, I plan to go to the store with Harim, so you might be left alone. Is that okay?”\n“Of course, it’s fine. I’ll be studying in the classroom during lunch. Don’t worry about me.”\n“When I come back from the store, should I get something for you? Maybe some ‘Sweet red bean jelly’? Or a soda?”\n“Um, I’ll be brushing my teeth, so I don’t think I’ll need anything.”\n“Okay, then. I’ll come back empty-handed.”\n“Sounds good.”\nAfter finishing our meal, we left the cafeteria. It felt a bit sad to walk in opposite directions, but it couldn’t be helped. Just because we were dating didn’t mean we had to be glued to each other all day.\nI went back to the classroom alone and took out a toothbrush and toothpaste from my locker. After squeezing some toothpaste onto the brush, I headed straight for the restroom.\nSince I ate early, I expected the restroom to be quiet. But, I ran into the last person I wanted to see.\n“Ah-”\nWith that short exclamation, the other person also turned his head towards me.\nIt was Kang Seo-ha, here to brush his teeth just like me.\n“Ah- You’re Han-gyeol, right?”\n“Yeah. I think this is the first time we’ve seen each other since playing basketball.”\n“Did you recover from that injury?”\n“Don’t worry about it. Injuries can happen during sports.”\nDid he not know that I was dating Eun-ha? Just as I thought that, Kang Seo-ha spoke.\n“I heard you were dating Eun-ha?”\nHe mentioned someone else’s girlfriend’s name rather informal and affectionately. Should I let it slide since they had been childhood friends?\n“Yes. How did you know?”\n“Our math teacher mentioned it during class.”\n“Did the teacher talk about it in a different class? That’s troublesome.”\n“He provided quite detailed information.”\n“I see. Anyway, yes, we’re dating.”\nAs I replied, Kang Seo-ha looked into my eyes. His gaze wasn’t cold, but it seemed he was a bit concerned.\n“Haven’t you known Eun-ha for just a short time?”\n“It’s been just over a month since the start of the new semester.”\n“It’s surprising. It wasn’t like you two knew each other before, and it’s not easy to get into a relationship in just a month.”\n“It doesn’t always take a long time to fall for someone.”\nIt was hard to discern exactly what he was thinking.\nBut there was a sense of him being on guard.\nWas it just my imagination?\n“What do you like about Eun-ha?”\n“It’s a topic that could take all day to discuss. I’m not sure how to answer that.”\n“I’d appreciate a brief explanation.”\n“She’s beautiful and cute. Kind-hearted.”\n“That she is.”\n“By the way, even if you two are close, shouldn’t you refrain from using her name with such informally?”\nI tried to say it as politely as possible, but I too felt slightly defensive.\nAt my remark, Kang Seo-ha momentarily looked taken aback but quickly returned to his usual demeanor.\nGiven that my girlfriend once had feelings for him, I could understand why I was feeling this uneasiness.\n“Ah- Sorry. It’s just habit.”\n‘Just habit,’ he says.\nI involuntarily gritted my teeth.\nI shouldn’t be bothered by this.\nI needed to let it slide and stay cool.\nBut it was irritating.\n“It happens. Just be mindful in the future.”\nIf I thought about the original character Kang Seo-ha, he was a guy with a good heart.\nIt was only from my perspective that he might seem negative. Objectively, he was a decent guy.\nFor Kang Seo-ha, Eun-ha had been a childhood friend he had known for a long time.\nThough their relationship had grown distant now, I couldn’t deny the time they’d spent together.\nI might be jealous, but I couldn’t erase the history between them.\n“Hey but make sure you keep Eun-ha happy. She’s the type to feel loneliness quite deeply. So don’t make her cry, understood.”\nAt Kang Seo-ha’s blunt remark, I found my brows involuntarily furrowing.\nRegardless of how he felt, wasn’t that statement crossing a line?\nConsidering Kang Seo-ha’s nature and the history he shared with Eun-ha, he might be curious about her romantic affairs and concerned for her as a friend.\nBut that didn’t mean he could be so overt about it.\n“Why do I need to hear that from you?”\n“What did you just say?”\n“I’m saying I don’t understand why I have to listen to such remarks from you.”\nSeeing my agitation, Kang Seo-ha looked slightly taken aback.\n“It’s just out of concern for Eun-ha as a friend. After all, you two haven’t been close for long, and then you’ve suddenly started dating.”\n“In terms of my relationship with Eun-ha, you are just an outsider who has nothing to do with me. I think it’s a bit meddlesome for you to say that.”\n“Hey, aren’t you reacting too sensitively? I thought it was something I could say as a friend of Eun-ha.”\n“If it was a same-gender friend or a family member of Eun-ha’s, maybe. But you’re different, aren’t you?”\nBecause he had previously rejected Eun-ha’s confession.\nI swallowed the words that almost slipped out, reaching the tip of my chin.\nDid he think his intentions were noble and thus justified?\nMaybe he believed that since his concerns arose from altruism for a childhood friend he spent a long time with, it was okay to voice them. But even if his underlying intentions were good, such words shouldn’t be uttered by someone who had already weighed and made decisions about his feelings for Eun-ha.\n“You want me to make Eun-ha happy? Sure. Of course, I will. Her happiness is more important to me than my own. Even without you telling me... I’d appreciate it if you don’t cross the line and mind your own business.”\nThis was the Kang Seo-ha who had thrown away the chance to make Eun-ha happy.\nI warned him as such.\n“More than anything, you couldn’t make Eun-ha happy. And you don’t have the right to.”\nAt my words, Kang Seo-ha appeared taken aback.\nIn the end, I left the bathroom without brushing my teeth.\nThough I had responded emotionally, I had no regrets.\nAlthough I still felt upset, upon entering the classroom, I found Eun-ha sitting in my seat.\n“Han-gyeol, did you go to brush your teeth?”\nI didn’t want to show Eun-ha my troubled side, so I approached her with a bright smile.\n“Yeah, I did.”\nAs I sat down next to Eun-ha, she tilted her head slightly.\n“Is something wrong?”\n“Huh? Why the sudden question?”\nI thought I had managed to hide my emotions well, but I couldn’t understand why she would ask that.\n“Your expression seems a bit different from usual. Are you tired?”\nI felt a twinge of guilt, as though I was hiding something from Eun-ha. Still, I thought it best not to bring up the matter regarding Kang Seo-ha.\n“I might be a bit tired because I went to bed late last night. Don’t worry about it.”\n“Hmm, okay. We have PE during the 5th period, so we should change into our gym clothes soon.”\n“Oh right, I totally forgot. I should’ve changed after brushing my teeth.”\n“It happens. Let’s change now.”\nEun-ha, with her gym clothes in hand, beamed a radiant smile. I playfully pinched her cheek.\n“Huh? Why?”\nAs Eun-ha gazed at me in silence, I spoke softly. It felt like I had never properly expressed this sentiment before.\n“I’ll make you happy.”\n“Wha- suddenly?! I mean, it’s a sweet thing to say but...”\n“I just wanted to say it.”\n“I’m already very happy.”\n“Then I’ll make you even happier.”\n“Okay...! But maybe the classroom isn’t the place for such declarations?”\nEun-ha bowed her head, seemingly embarrassed. Behind her, a group of students from our class glared at me as if they wanted me dead.\n“Is this school or heaven?”\n“For me, it’s clearly hell.”\n“I’m holding the black sword of hell.”\n“So, it’s the hellish sword?”\n“But why are we the ones crying...?”\nWhat kind of joke was that?\nThe setting was inappropriate.\nI quickly grabbed my gym clothes from my bag.\n“Eun-ha, let’s change into our gym clothes quickly.”\n“Okay. Let’s do that. Do you know what we’re doing during PE today?”\n“I think I heard we’re either playing dodgeball or kickball.”\n“That’s too bad, no basketball.”\n“Exactly.”\n“Still, they might give us some free time, right?”\n“Probably. But today, instead of basketball, I want to spend time with Eun-ha.”\n“That sounds nice to me.”\nEun-ha smiled brightly.\n“You have such a pretty smile.”\n“Thanks. I think your smile is pretty too.”\nWalking back to the bathroom to change into our gym clothes made me slightly anxious. I didn’t want to run into Kang Seo-ha again while with Eun-ha... I was so worried, but Eun-ha was staring intently at my face.\n“Han-gyeol, is something really bothering you?”\n“Huh? Does my expression look that bad?”\nAfter pondering my question for a moment, Eun-ha spoke.\n“Well, not bad per se... It just seems you’re concerned.”\nWas my expression that easy to read?\n“Han-gyeol, don’t take what I’m about to say too seriously.”\n“Huh? What is it?”\n“While I’m your girlfriend and you’re my boyfriend, there are certainly things we might find difficult to discuss. If ever you find something hard to talk about, just tell me it’s challenging. I don’t intend to force you to speak about something you find uncomfortable. Just be honest and tell me if you’re struggling. Right now, your expression seems troubled, and it’s making me anxious. That’s just how I feel.”\nI was slightly taken aback looking at the calmly speaking Eun-ha. Her words were strikingly similar to what I had told her before.\n“You don’t have to answer right away. Take your time and think it over. I’ll go change into my gym clothes now.”\nWith those words, Eun-ha entered the bathroom.\nIt was the same thing I had said to Eun-ha before.\nIt was what I’d told her after she had avoided me for days following my gift of homemade chocolates. While I had asked her to be honest with me, I too had failed to be forthright.\n“It’s... a bit embarrassing.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Han-gyeol’s expression was somehow different than usual.\nIf one were to ask me to describe specifically how it was different, it’d be a tough ask.\nShould I call it a woman’s intuition?\nI felt something indescribable. Even when I tried to recall that expression of Han-gyeol’s, it was the same.\nHowever, he seemed a bit angry and upset. After all, Han-gyeol was human. Not every day, every moment could be good. There would be days when he felt down for no reason, and days when his emotions were stirred by the smallest things.\nIt was entirely natural.\nIf anything, it was strange that I hadn’t seen this side of Han-gyeol until now.\nHe wasn’t always laughing, but he was as calm as a still lake.\nI wondered what could have angered Han-gyeol. But I couldn’t guess anything. I wanted to know, but Han-gyeol seemed hesitant to speak, and I didn’t want to force him to say anything.\nI didn’t want to pressure him into talking just because I was his girlfriend, insisting, ‘You should tell me because I’m your girlfriend.’\nI also didn’t like the idea of measuring the distance between someone based on how much I know about them.\nStill, there was a part of me that wished he would tell me. Logically, I shouldn’t ask, but emotionally, I wished he would confide in me first. But that was just my selfishness. I didn’t want my desires to burden Han-gyeol.\nDuring PE class, I briefly sat on a bench and chatted with him, but it was just a typical conversation. Throughout our chat, it felt like he was constantly thinking about something.\nI wondered if I had inadvertently made things more difficult for him with my earlier comments. Maybe I was mistaken, but I felt sorry if I made him worry needlessly.\nEventually, PE class ended, and I was on my way out, changing out of my gym clothes with Harim.\n“Eun, no. Shin Eun-ha.”\nSomeone called my name from the hallway.\nWhen I sneakily turned around to check who it was, it was an unexpected figure.\nPerhaps not the best person to run into under the current circumstances.\n“Kang Seo-ha. What?”\nI supposed I should be a bit formal.\nIt seemed the other party was formal too.\n“Sorry, can we talk for a moment?”\n“If it’s not urgent or important, can we talk another time? I have something I need to attend to right now.”\nI decided that I should be by Han-gyeol’s side right now.\nBut unexpected words spilled out from Kang Seo-ha’s mouth.\n“It’s about Lee Han-gyeol... is it not okay?”\nI flinched momentarily.\nThe two had only crossed paths twice at most.\nOnce on the first day of the semester in the hallway.\nAnd once during basketball.\nThat was it, so it felt strange that he had something to talk about concerning Han-gyeol.\nI looked at him skeptically and asked,\n“Why are you bringing up Han-gyeol?”\n“No, it’s just... I ended up having an argument with Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“What-? When? By any chance, during lunch?”\n“Yeah, briefly in the restroom during lunch.”\nThat was unbelievable.\nBut why?\n“Can you tell me more about it? Harim, just a moment. I need to talk. Can you put my gym clothes on my spot?”\n“Mm-hmm. Go ahead.”\n“Yeah, and please don’t mention this to Han-gyeol for now.”\nI quickly handed my gym clothes to Harim and headed to the end of the hallway.\nI didn’t want Han-gyeol to see me talking with another guy.\nReaching the end of the hallway, I directly asked,\n“What’s this about you arguing with Han-gyeol?”\n“You’re dating Lee Han-gyeol, right?”\n“Yes. But why?”\n“There was a small argument related to that.”\n“What could you possibly have argued about related to that? There’s no relationship between the two of you, right?”\nThe more we talked, the more I couldn’t understand.\n“Well... I’m sorry. I think I made a mistake. But I didn’t mean to either.”\n“Can you be more specific? Han-gyeol doesn’t get mad easily. I’ve never even seen him angry.”\n“Well... To be honest, I was a bit worried about you. You haven’t been with him long, but you’re dating him.”\nMy brows furrowed for a moment.\nBut I moved on for now.\nI could judge after hearing the entire story.\n“So? What did you say to Han-gyeol?”\n“Just as a friend, I was a bit concerned... So I just told him to take good care of you, to make you happy.”\n“What?!”\nSuddenly, I understood why Han-gyeol was upset.\nIf another person says that when we have only been dating for a short while, it would be infuriating.\nAnd perhaps... maybe... Han-gyeol was even angrier because it was Kang Seo-ha who said it.\nI was not sure, and we never discussed this topic directly, but maybe Han-gyeol knew something.\n“Why did you say that to Han-gyeol? You don’t even know him that well.”\nThat made me even angrier.\nI thought I was the one who needed to be cautious.\nBut I guess I was wrong.\nNot just me, but others should be cautious too.\n“No, I-”\nI raised my voice a bit.\n“You were worried about me? Then you should have asked me first. What kind of person Han-gyeol is. What I think of Han-gyeol. You should have come to me. Why did you do that? I can’t understand. From Han-gyeol’s perspective, it’s like some stranger was butting in. Why couldn’t you think that far?”\nI looked at Kang Seo-ha with a bit of resentment.\n“Eun-ha, I was just concerned.”\n“We aren’t in a position to be ‘so concerned’ about each other. Strangers might not get it, but it’s even harder to understand coming from you. Shouldn’t we be even more careful? Put yourself in my shoes. If you were dating Jung Yeon, and some guy you barely know told you to treat Jung Yeon right, would you feel good?”\n“We’re friends. We have a history together.”\n“Even so, you shouldn’t have said that. How could... how could you say something like that? Especially you, being involved? Even if you didn’t mean to, that was a very careless thing to say.”\n“...”\nWe were bound to become distant strangers at some point.\nI thought we would slowly move away, but I didn’t expect things to blow up like this.\nI didn’t want to hurt anyone with my words.\nI thought that moving away would be the best decision.\nHowever, if my hesitation, the ties I had not let go of, hinder my future with Han-gyeol... I was left with no choice.\nI knew what was right and what was most precious to me now, so I spoke with a heavy heart.\n“It was hard for me to say this bluntly. I thought we would just move on with time. But given the situation, I have to be clear. I can’t help it if you feel hurt.”\nKang Seo-ha seemed a bit taken aback by my words.\nBut I continued.\n“It’s right for us to keep our distance. You, me, Jung Yeon. Even for Han-gyeol’s sake. The reason I acted this way until now was because I didn’t want to see you and Jung Yeon feeling sorry because of me. But if Han-gyeol gets hurt or troubled because of our past, it’s different. You don’t need to apologize to Han-gyeol separately. I’ll be going now. Even though I’ve spoken emotionally, it’s not out of anger. From now on, be careful.”\n“No, wait. How can you just end things like this?”\nAs I tried to pass him, Kang Seo-ha spoke.\nThe longer our conversation went, the more anxious I felt.\nEven talking to him now felt like a sin.\nTo his words, I responded more firmly.\n“I have to be clear. Han-gyeol has always been sincere with me. And I don’t want to lie even a little bit to him. I want to always treat Han-gyeol with utmost sincerity.”\n“That’s not like you. You’re not like this. Why are you acting this way all of a sudden? Is this the right way?”\n“Even if you say that, nothing will change. I don’t regret my actions now, and I think they’re right.”\n“No, you’ve never been this blunt.”\n“Yes, I wasn’t. But now, Han-gyeol is more precious to me than myself. I want to repay even half of what Han-gyeol has done for me. I want to make him feel the love I feel right now. That’s why I’m doing this. Even this conversation, just the two of us, isn’t good for Jung Yeon or Han-gyeol. I’ll be going. Please explain things to Jung Yeon too. Take care. I will, too.”\nI passed Kang Seo-ha and headed back to my classroom.\nThere was no time to be swayed by the past.\nI decided to focus solely on the time I would spend with Han-gyeol.\nAfter all, there was no room for anything else in my mind right now.\nAs soon as I reached the classroom, I looked for Han-gyeol.\nHe was still sitting in his seat, lost in thought.\n“Han-gyeol.”\nWe didn’t have much break time left.\nI quickly organized the words lingering in my mind.\n“Hmm?”\n“I handled things properly.”\n“All of a sudden? Did something happen?”\n“Nope, not at all. Anyway, I sorted it out!”\n“Did you bury someone in the mountains or something?”\n“No! But now there’s nothing for Han-gyeol to worry about. I handled it.”\n“What do you mean? What did you do?”\nWasn't this just like him?\nI pondered a bit more.\n“Don’t worry about what others say. I’m already incredibly happy because of Han-gyeol. So, I’ll make you happy in return.”\nHan-gyeol blankly stared at me.\nWhile looking into his somewhat dazed eyes, I spoke clearly.\n“I’m truly only looking at Han-gyeol. I truly only like Han-gyeol.”\nThe bell rang for the end of the break right after I clenched my fist and spoke.\n“You got what I said, right? Let’s talk after class.”\nI quietly returned to my seat.\nDid I convey my feelings properly? Did I express myself correctly?\nI hoped with all my heart that my feelings were genuinely conveyed.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "‘I’m truly only looking at Han-gyeol. I truly only like Han-gyeol.’\nEun-ha’s words kept echoing in my mind.\nI couldn’t hear the teacher’s lecture, nor could I read the words on the blackboard.\nI tried shaking my head to dispel the thoughts, but they only became clearer.\n‘...I’ll make you happy in return.’\nTo promise happiness.\nIt was rare for a man to hear such words.\nEun-ha’s shy and delicate side was endearing, but this occasional assertive side of hers was also appealing.\nThe problem was, that my feelings for this version of Eun-ha kept growing as time went by.\nShe was so adorable that it was driving me mad.\nSo cute that I even thought of biting her out of affection.\n‘How am I supposed to deal with these overwhelming emotions?’\nTo find an answer to that question, I sneakily glanced at Eun-ha.\nMaybe looking at her would help me alleviate these feelings.\nBut just as she came into my view, I realized she was also looking at me.\nOur eyes met, and we held each other’s gaze for a moment.\nWhen did she start looking?\nWhy wasn’t she paying attention during class?\nNot that I was one to talk, but it seemed Eun-ha felt the same way.\nWe couldn’t maintain eye contact forever, so I subtly turned away.\nI tried to play it cool, resting my chin on my left hand, but it felt like someone was playfully poking the side of my head.\nI’d bet an arm and a leg on it.\nEun-ha was watching me right now.\nI felt like fooling around even before class ended.\nStay calm for now.\nEun-ha and I were seniors.\nThe last thing we needed was our grades dropping because of dating.\nWe could flirt during breaks and after school.\nWith a sigh, I stared at the words written on the blackboard.\nMentally reciting a mantra, I tried to regain my lost concentration.\nI tightly gripped my pen and transcribed the writing from the board to my textbook.\nSomehow, I managed to maintain my frail focus and endured through the 6th period.\n“Alright, that’s it for today’s lesson. Hang in there for the last period.”\nThe moment the teacher left the classroom, Eun-ha and I immediately approached each other.\nWith a playful pinch on Eun-ha’s adorable cheek, I said,\n“Eun-ha, you should be looking at the board during class. Why were you looking at me?”\n“But Han-gyul, you were also sneaking glances at me instead of the board.”\n“Ugh... I have nothing to say.”\n“Ah- I wish we could switch seats. I’m too far from you right now.”\nEven her longing was so endearing.\nI tried to soothe these feelings by playfully squishing her soft cheeks.\n“Han-gyeol... Ahh-”\n“Sorry. Pinching your cheek just felt surprisingly good.”\n“Well... If it makes you happy, I don’t mind.”\n“What should we do after school? Want to go on a date instead of studying?”\nHonestly, studying today was out of the question.\nMy mind was so full of her that there was no room for anything else.\n“Really? Can we take a break from studying today?”\nUpon hearing my words, Eun-ha’s eyes began to sparkle.\nIt made sense. We had been constantly studying even when we wanted to flirt.\n“Yep. Let’s skip studying and go on a date.”\n“Ah- what should we do? What do you want to do?”\n“Hmm- there’s a new movie out. Want to go watch it?”\n“No, I don’t want to watch a movie. Let’s do something else.”\nEun-ha declined without hesitation.\nHonestly, it was unexpected. I hadn’t thought she would refuse.\nI didn’t really mind, but I was curious about her reason.\n“Why not? Not in the mood for a movie?”\n“It’s not good value for money.”\n“Really? Considering the time, it’s not that expensive.”\n“Not that kind of good value for money.”\nSeeing my puzzled look, Eun-ha subtly checked our surroundings.\nOnce she confirmed that our classmates weren’t interested in our conversation, she cautiously said,\n“I can’t see Han-gyeol during the time we’re watching the movie.”\n‘Man, she’s not giving me any breaks, is she?’\nI bit my lip a little harder.\nIf I didn’t, it felt like my heart would burst.\n‘Ah. So that’s what she meant by good value for money.’\n‘I see.’\nMy heart pounded violently.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hmm? Don’t you think it’s not good value for money, Han-gyeol?”\n“Yeah, I guess so. Is there something else you want to do?”\nThat was a close call just now.\nI mustn’t let my guard down-\n“Actually, as long as I can see you, Han-gyeol, I don’t mind.”\nI was rendered helpless by Eun-ha’s shy upward glance.\nI struggled to keep the rising heat from my face under control, but it was to no avail.\n“Han-gyeol, your face is red.”\n“It’s your fault.”\n“Ah- Han-gyeol, let’s go to a karaoke then. We can sing, grab some food, have dessert, and then head home.”\n“Karaoke?”\n“Yes. Karaoke.”\nThis was a problem.\nI didn’t even know what songs to sing.\n“Eun-ha, just to let you know, I’m a terrible singer.”\n“Why worry about that? Just sing comfortably.”\nTo be honest, I wanted to hear Eun-ha sing.\n‘Hmm- even if it’s embarrassing, I want to hear her voice.’\n“Alright. Let’s go.”\n“Yes!”\n***\nAs soon as school ended, we went straight to the karaoke.\nIt was a coin-operated karaoke room, big enough for three, maybe four people at most.\nIt was nicer than I expected.\n“Do you want to pick the first song, Han-gyeol?”\n“Hmm- I’m not confident. How about you sing first?”\n“I’m nervous too...! But you have to sing after me.”\n“You won’t laugh when you hear me sing?”\n“That goes for you too. I’ll start, okay?”\nEun-ha, with a cheerful smile, reserved a song.\nEven for someone like me who didn’t know many songs, it was familiar.\n“Ah- I’m looking forward to hearing you sing, Eun-ha.”\n“Singing in front of Han-gyeol makes me a bit shy. Do you know this song?”\n“Yes, I do. It seems like a song everyone has heard at least once.”\n“Really? Then you can do the rap part.”\n“What?”\n“Will you sing it?”\nSeeing Eun-ha’s expectant eyes, I couldn’t refuse.\n“Okay. I’ll take the rap part. It wasn’t very long anyway.”\n“Great!”\nWhen Eun-ha pressed the start button, the karaoke room darkened.\nA mirror ball on the ceiling spun as the accompaniment to Eun-ha’s chosen song began to play.\nThe bright and calm melody suited Eun-ha perfectly.\nEun-ha, gripping the microphone with both hands, looked incredibly cute.\nAs the instrumental break ended, beautiful lyrics flowed from Eun-ha’s mouth.\n“Coffee, I’ve had too much-”\nThe moment Eun-ha’s tender voice slipped out, I was taken aback. Even though it was the same voice I’d been hearing, it sounded strikingly different.\n‘What? Why does she sing so well?’\nHer clear and pure voice filled the karaoke room. Still holding the microphone with both hands, Eun-ha seemed to be having fun, gently swaying her head from side to side.\nWhen she sang the chorus, she would occasionally glance at me to gauge my reaction. When our eyes met, she shyly avoided my gaze.\nBefore I knew it, I was humming along to Eun-ha’s song. The first verse was gradually coming to an end, approaching the rap part. Eun-ha began to subtly look at me, and as promised, I picked up the microphone.\n“Like star-”\nSinging in front of my girlfriend was more embarrassing than I had anticipated.\nEun-ha, sensing my discomfort, held her microphone and joined in for bits of the rap part.\nThough the rap portion was only about 25 seconds long throughout the song, it felt much longer than I’d expected.\nAs soon as the rap ended, Eun-ha seamlessly continued with the song.\nI clapped to the beat, enjoying Eun-ha’s singing.\nOnce the song finished, she, seemingly embarrassed, darted to a corner of the room. She covered her face with both hands, sneaking glances at me.\n“Eun-ha, where are you going? Why are you hiding?”\n“I’m a bit embarrassed... I messed up some parts.”\n“Did you? I didn’t notice at all. You sounded amazing.”\n“No, don’t compliment me right now because I’m too embarrassed...!”\nHer bashfulness was utterly adorable.\nIt felt such a waste to just let this moment with Eun-ha pass.\n“You sang so well. I think I’ve fallen for you all over again.”\n“Ahh-! I told you not to tease me right now... I’m really embarrassed!”\n“Your expression says otherwise. You look so happy. You did great. You sang incredibly well.”\nEun-ha finally came back to my side and picked up the remote.\n“Now it’s your turn, Han-gyeol. What will you sing?”\n“Ah- I just want to keep listening to you sing.”\n“So, you want a full solo concert?”\n“Would you? How much is the ticket?”\n“Nope. Hurry up and choose a song.”\nSince Eun-ha sang for me first, I couldn’t refuse.\nI hadn’t sung much before, but for Eun-ha, what couldn’t I do?\n“Eun-ha, which song should I sing for you?”\n“Ah- there’s a song I want to hear. But I’m not sure if you know it?”\n“Hmm- which one?”\nEun-ha searched for the song using the remote.\nIt was a slightly older song, but it matched my taste.\n“Do you know this one?!”\n“Yes, I do.”\n“Sing this for me!”\n“Alright!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After having our dinner, we moved to a nearby dessert cafe.\nThe weather had warmed up recently, so we decided to have bingsu*.\nHan-gyeol was contemplating the menu, likely pondering over which bingsu I’d enjoy the most.\n“What bingsu should we get?”\n“Han-gyeol, you like strawberries, right? Let’s get strawberry bingsu.”\n“Can we? Then, let’s have strawberry bingsu and... injeolmi* toast.”\n“Can you eat all of that? We just had dinner.”\n“Maybe it’s because I sang, but I’m still hungry.”\nHan-gyeol said, slightly devoid of energy. Wanting to see him eat well, I promptly opened my wallet.\n“I’ll buy. Want anything else?”\n“It’s expensive. We split the meal, let’s split the dessert too.”\n“I want to buy it for you. But you can’t leave any behind.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol seemed a bit shy. Although he was initially good at expressing emotions and affection, now it seemed like I could also tell a bit just by looking at his expression.\nWhat he was thinking, what emotions he was feeling right now. Perhaps we had gotten a bit closer. Something made me happy.\n“Then I will gratefully accept and enjoy.”\n“Yes. One strawberry bingsu and one injeolmi toast, please.”\n“Yes. I’ve taken your order. I will notify you with the buzzer.”\n“Thank you. Han-gyeol, let’s go.”\nHolding the buzzer, we found a spot by the window. The outside had already darkened, and streetlights were illuminating the streets.\n“It’s already dark, and all we did was go to karaoke and have a meal.”\n“I know, right. Time seems to fly when I’m with you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Same here. It’s already April, and midterms are just around the corner.”\n“I also need to prepare for the June mock exams... It’s a bit worrying.”\n“Let’s study hard from tomorrow.”\n“Yep, yep. Absolutely. I think I will do even better since we had fun like this today.”\nSpending time with Han-gyeol seemed to give me the strength to endure tomorrow.\n‘Ah- Is tomorrow too short?’ It felt like I gained enough strength to last about a week.\nEven if something unpleasant happens, recalling today would allow me to smile.\nWe lock eyes, smiling, when the buzzer noisily rings.\n“Ah- I’ll get it. Stay seated.”\n“Thanks.”\nHan-gyeol went to the counter and returned with a tray containing bingsu and toast. Skillfully slicing the toast and deeply dipping the fork into it, he brought it directly to my mouth.\n“Here- Eun-ha, say ah-”\n“I, I can eat by myself.”\n“Oh- is that so?”\nAs Han-gyeol promptly put down the fork, I hastily took it up.\n“Didn’t you say you could eat by yourself, Eun-ha?”\n“Uh- I was just shy for a moment, that’s all.”\n“Mmhm. I knew that.”\n“Ah, seriously-!”\nHan-gyeol, trying to suppress his laughter, seemed slightly mischievous. This time, I brought the toast to his mouth.\n“Han-gyeol, say ah-”\n“I’ll eat well.”\nUnlike me, Han-gyeol bit into the toast unhesitatingly. I couldn’t tell if the food was delicious, or if he enjoyed being fed by me.\n“Is it good?”\n“Yep. It’s tasty.”\n“Should I give you another piece?”\n“Let’s have the bingsu first. Here- this one’s for Eun-ha.”\nHan-gyeol, smiling, picked up a strawberry placed on top with his fork. And without fail, brought it to my lips.\n“Han-gyeol can have it. This strawberry looks the most delicious, doesn’t it?”\n“I can’t give my girlfriend the second best-looking one, can I? My arm’s getting tired. Eat up, quick.”\nHan-gyeol really had a way with words. His tone wasn’t particularly soft or affectionate, but he chose only the words that made my heart flutter to whisper in my ear.\nHan-gyeol’s heart seemed so beautiful that I joyfully popped the strawberry into my mouth.\n“Is it good?”\nI nodded my head.\nAfterward, we emptied the bingsu while sharing small talk. I was full, but Han-gyeol, perhaps still hungry, wiped out even the toast.\n“Han-gyeol must’ve been really hungry, huh?”\n“Feels like I’m gonna gain some weight now.”\n“Does Han-gyeol eat a lot normally?”\n“Yeah. I think I eat quite a bit. Why?”\n“You look so happy when you eat. What food do you like the most? Besides the pork cutlet.”\n“That’s a tough one. But I should pick at least one, right?”\n“Mmhm. Like, really comfort food when you’re down.”\nAfter pondering my words for a moment, Han-gyeol spoke.\n“I like salmon.”\n“Salmon? Are you talking about sushi?”\n“I like everything made with salmon. I like sushi, and I like it as a rice bowl too.”\nI wanted to make it myself, but I had never handled salmon before.\nI could follow a recipe, but honestly, I was not confident.\n“It’d be nice if Eun-ha made it for me.”\nHan-gyeol spoke with a slightly hopeful look in his eyes.\nI was not confident, honestly, but if Han-gyeol wanted it, I wanted to make it.\n“I’ve never made it before, so I’m a bit unsure, but I’ll practice.”\n“It doesn’t matter. It can’t be tasteless if you make it.”\n“Well, I’m happy to hear that...so shall I make it over the weekend?”\n“Really? Then we should go to the mart together and buy what we need.”\n“Ah- let’s buy plenty. My brother and Hyun-joo Unnie will be there too.”\n“Let’s do that then.”\nIt seemed like it was going to be a fun weekend.\n“So, we’ve finished dessert, shall we head home?”\n“Already? Let’s sit a bit longer before we go.”\nWithout realizing, I instinctively held onto Han-gyeol.\n“Do you dislike the idea that much?”\n“No...! But I’m going to study hard from tomorrow, so can’t we stay a bit longer? I think it will be hard to study even if we go back now.”\n“Shall we take a walk in the park to help digest, then?”\n“Shall we? I’d like that. Let’s go to the lake park.”\nAs I tried to clear the table, Han-gyeol spoke.\n“If Eun-ha said it with such an expression, we should definitely go to Lake Park. Well then. That being said. So how much longer do you want to stay?”\nIt looked like I was caught.\nHan-gyeol’s smiled so adorable and lovely.\nBut now, I could reciprocate.\nI couldn’t always be shy.\n“I want to be with you until I die, why.”\nHan-gyeol’s expression suddenly hardened.\nI wanted to observe Han-gyeol’s stunned expression a bit more, but my face was also turning red.\n“Then I’ll bring it to the exit area and come back.”\nI hurriedly grabbed the tray and fled to the return station.\n***\nMoving our location to the lake park, we walked around, hand in hand.\nHolding hands now felt natural, but the fluttering excitement still lingered.\n“It’s refreshing and nice here.”\n“Aren’t you cold? Be careful not to catch a cold since it’s the transition between seasons.”\n“Eun-ha, who caught a cold not too long ago, should be more careful.”\n“Hey- do you really think I’ll catch it again?”\n“Saying that usually jinxes it.”\nWhile sharing such small talk, we continued our walk. Even while walking, my gaze consistently found Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re always smiling when you’re with me, aren’t you?”\n“Am I? I’m not consciously smiling.”\n“I was talking to Harim the other day and heard that Han-gyeol doesn’t show much facial expression.”\n“Really? Do I appear that way?”\n“Not to me, at all.”\nI shook my head from side to side as I replied.\n“On the contrary, Han-gyeol seems to smile quite a lot.”\n“It’s only for Eun-ha. Only to Eun-ha. Now that you mention it, didn’t you ask me the same thing before?”\n“Huh? Me? When?”\n“At the cinema. You asked, ‘Do you smile like that to everyone?’”\n‘Ah- that time.’\n“You remembered that?”\n“Of course. It was our first time going to the cinema.”\nOnly then did the memory vividly resurface in my mind.\n“What did I answer back then?”\n“You said you don’t smile like that to everyone.”\n“Oh right, right. Actually, I wanted to say that I only smile like that to Eun-ha, but I couldn’t say it at that moment~”\n“It’s already been a month since then. Time really flies.”\n“Indeed.”\nHan-gyeol also seemed to be in a good mood recalling that time.\n“So? Does Han-gyeol smile like that to everyone?”\n“No? I only smile like this to Eun-ha.”\n“Mmhm. Keep doing that.”\n“I find teasing Eun-ha the most fun!”\nHan-gyeol spoke playfully again. But now, even this playful side of Han-gyeol was endearing.\n“Go on. Tease me whenever you want to.”\n“Huh? That response is a bit different from what I expected.”\nHan-gyeol often threw fluttering words and playful teases like this. I knew now that it was shyness, a bashful way to spit out such words.\nAs time went on, discovering new sides of Han-gyeol became an enjoyment.\nHan-gyeol, surprisingly, was quite shy. Perhaps even shier than me. Knowing that now, I decided to act a bit more leisurely.\n“Why? Because you can tease me as much as you want?”\n“Now that you’re asking to be teased, I’m not sure how to tease you. Let me think for a moment.”\n“What’s that about? Then I should think too. I can’t always be the one getting teased.”\nBoth Han-gyeol and I pondered about how we should tease each other. But when nothing came to mind, I gripped the hand we were holding a bit tighter.\nSqueezing with force, Han-gyeol reciprocated by swinging our clasped hands back and forth vigorously. I tried to resist somehow but could not withstand Han-gyeol’s strength.\nMy heart continued to fill with these tiny playful acts.\nToday, tomorrow, and the day after, if days like these continue, I think I won’t struggle until the day I die.\nSmall yet certain happiness, Han-gyeol existed in all of those moments.\n‘I’m happy.’\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:Bingsu: This is a Korean shaved ice delicacy that involves the careful shaving or grating of a solid block of cream or milk to produce a dessert with a light, snowy texture.\nInjeolmi toast: Injeolmi toast is a popular Korean street food that combines the traditional flavors of injeolmi (Korean rice cake) with the convenient, Western-influenced concept of toast.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It was the day we talked about eating salmon on a weekday.\nSince early morning, Eun-ha and I had been shopping at a large supermarket.\nI pushed the cart around as Eun-ha roamed around the mart, picking up items here and there.\n“Hmm- I’ve never used tsuyu before. Should I try it this time? What do you think, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? Can you first explain what tsuyu is?”\n“It’s used when making sauce for salmon bowl.”\n“Do we have to use that?”\n“Hmm- The recipe I found used soy sauce.”\n“Then let’s use soy sauce.”\n“Why?”\nEun-ha looked at me with a puzzled expression.\n“Well, even if we buy tsuyu, we won’t use it again after today, right?”\n“I was thinking of making it often since Han-gyeol likes it?”\nI let my guard down again.\nMy heart fluttered like crazy.\n“Then let’s buy tsuyu. Have we bought everything else?”\n“Hmm- we have onions at home, should we buy a pack of radish?”\n“Let’s do that. They would look pretty on the salmon bowl.”\n“The vegetables are over there on that side. Let’s go.”\nAs Eun-ha walked ahead, she naturally interlocked her arm with mine.\nI was slightly surprised by the extremely natural skinship but didn’t mention it verbally.\nI simply matched her pace and walked toward the vegetable section.\nWe really do look like a married couple.\nUpon arriving at the vegetable section, Eun-ha unhesitatingly put a pack of radishes into the cart.\n“Radish are done... now all we need to buy is the salmon. Nothing else, right?”\n“This should be enough, shouldn’t it? We just have to buy the salmon?”\n“Hmm- it looks like it needs to be salted, but fine salt should be okay, right?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I heard it’s not good with coarse salt. Shall we go then?”\nI was about to turn the cart when Eun-ha gazed at me, aloof.\nWhen I subtly lifted my arm to the side, without a word, she slipped hers between my arm and torso.\n“Didn’t you link arms without saying anything earlier?”\n“Can you not point that out? It took quite a bit of courage, and Han-gyeol didn’t react at all.”\n“Did it seem that way? Internally, I was cheering because I was so happy.”\n“If you’re happy, express it. Sometimes Han-gyeol doesn’t express at all.”\n“Don’t you think there should be moments that pass leisurely and naturally?”\n“Hmm- hearing it, I guess so. So? Isn’t it uncomfortable linking arms?”\n“Not at all. Also-”\nWould it be a bit much to say we were like a married couple when we were just high school students?\nMarriage was still a long way off and carelessly uttering such words without any preparation should be avoided-\n“Like a married couple?”\n“Ooh-! What the heck. How did you know?”\nI stared at Eun-ha in surprise.\n“It was written all over Han-gyeol’s face?”\n“Have you now learned to even read minds?”\n“I guess I learned that from Han-gyeol too.”\n“You selectively speak only the fluttering words. Have you been attending a school for this?”\nAt my words, Eun-ha answered with a bright smile.\n“The tuition was quite expensive.”\nShe was playing along.\nWhy was she so kind?\nJokes that might seem uninteresting to others were fun when shared with Eun-ha. With that, we bought the salmon last and exited, holding a basket full of groceries.\nAlthough it was slightly heavy, wanting to show a robust image in front of Eun-ha, I monopolized the basket.\n“Han-gyeol. Isn’t it heavy? Shall we hold it together?”\n“Not at all? Is it super light? It’s lighter than when I picked up the Eun-ha reference book.”\n“Right. When Han-gyeol and I met at the bookstore, the attire was completely shabby, and I was embarrassed.”\n“If being shabbily dressed is to that extent, the disparity is too great with the shabbiness I know of? You were pretty even then.”\nEun-ha avoided my gaze, seemingly shy at my words.\n“I had pushed down my hat and was dressed quite casually···”\n“You’re blushing again. It’s about time you got used to this.”\n“How do I get used to this··· I think I’ll never get used to it until I die.”\n“Thinking of living together until death?”\n“Yup. Since I have no thoughts of parting.”\nThat was a hefty statement···\nSince it was Eun-ha who said it, the weight of those words felt exceptionally heavy.\n“Then make me salmon over rice every morning.”\n“Then Han-gyeol should make tteokbokki every evening.”\n“Isn’t this a losing deal for me? I’m okay with bargaining a bit more.”\n“Hmm- I’ll think a little more about it.”\nMy heart kept thumping as I looked at Eun-ha, who was smiling gently.\n“Do you like tteokbokki the most, Eun-ha?”\n“Yup. I’ve eaten it often since I was young, but I never get tired of it.”\n“Shall I make tteokbokki for you tomorrow then?”\nEun-ha stared intently at my face at my words.\nAnd responded with a pleasant smile.\n“Okay.”\n***\nAs soon as we got home, we washed our hands and headed to the kitchen together.\nEun-ha would do most of it, but I didn’t want to leave her alone in the kitchen.\nI too washed my hands and decided to help with washing vegetables or trimming ingredients.\n“Eun-ha, what should we start with?”\n“Can you peel the onions first? One or two should be enough.”\n“Okay, okay. Tell me if you need anything else.”\n“Yup, yup. I think we can take it slow. We have time since we have to marinate it in salt anyway.”\nAs we were cooking together in the kitchen, a loud voice came from the living room.\n“Wow~ Never thought I’d see this day. Thanks to Han-gyeol, I get to eat the salmon made by my younger sister! Thank you! Han-gyeol, you are a blessing that rolled into our house. If it’s okay, would you like to move in starting today?”\nIt was Eunwoo Hyung sitting on the sofa.\nHe was smiling brightly, but it was a hearty laughter quite different from Eun-ha’s.\n“Ah- Seriously! Don’t make unnecessary comments to Han-gyeol! Anyone would think I’m a younger sister who’s never cooked a meal!”\n“If I had asked you to make a salmon rice bowl, would you have made it for me? For real? Really? Betting on Han-gyeol?”\n“It’s enough not to starve. Why do I have to go to that length?”\nAs Eun-ha spoke with a momentarily cold tone, Eunwoo Hyung swiftly shifted his gaze toward me.\n“Han-gyeol, what did you say last time? My younger sister is what? Kind? Gentle?”\n“That··· must have been a story limited to me. And I like that.”\n“It’s deep love, isn’t it.”\n“Well, it is.”\nAs I conversed with Eunwoo Hyung, Eun-ha interjected straight away.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s not engage and do what we’re going to do.”\n“Right, right. Ah, I haven’t seen Hyun-joo noona yet?”\n“She postponed the morning tutoring to the evening, so I told her to come at the adjusted time. She’ll be here soon.”\n“I might have ordered too complex a dish.”\n“Why worry about that. Ah- Han-gyeol, can you tie my apron strings?”\nEun-ha draped a sea-blue apron around her neck and handed the strings to me.\n‘Stay calm.’\n‘There are no ulterior motives in Eun-ha’s actions right now.’\nAlthough it was an extremely embarrassing situation, I sincerely tied the strings as Eun-ha requested.\n“Thank you.”\n“No, I’m the one who should be thankful.”\n“Huh? Why Han-gyeol?”\n“Just··· thank you.”\nSincerely...\nTremendously...\n“Kiya~ Han-gyeol, did you know? She pondered for two hours before ordering that apron, you know?”\n“Ah-?”\nWhen I subtly looked at Eun-ha, her face was on the brink of explosion.\nCarefully placing the knife on the cutting board, Eun-ha dashed into the living room.\n“Hey you maniac-! Why would you say that! Why would you tell him!”\nEun-ha began beating Eunwoo Hyung, who was sitting on the sofa.\nIt started with kicks but then she began to relentlessly punch Eunwoo Hyung’s arm.\nYet, Eunwoo Hyung wore the world’s happiest smile, taking joy in it all.\n“Ahahahaha-! Even getting hit is fun right now~! Ahahahahahaha!”\n“You really deserve to be hit!”\n“Ouch! Hey! That hit the bone!”\n“I aimed for it. Just take it quietly!”\nEventually, Eunwoo Hyung stood up from the sofa and fled to his room.\nThe door locked with a ‘clank-’, but, fuming, Eun-ha banged on it.\n“Open it when I’m asking nicely.”\n- Open it when I’m asking niiicely~\n‘If I laugh now, will I be the next to die?’\n‘Hold it in. This is the most challenging not-to-laugh moment of the year.’\n“This...!”\nThough this aspect of Eun-ha was cute, the salmon couldn’t continue sitting at room temperature.\nGently, I took Eun-ha’s hand and led her to the kitchen.\n“Eun-ha, let’s focus on what we have to do.”\n“Ah- Yeah···!”\nNormally, I would bring up the apron story once more but···\nInstinct told me. If I teased her now, I would be the one placed on the cutting board.\nWhile she showed signs of gradually calming down, Eun-ha seemed tremendously embarrassed.\nWith a facial expression like that, it was even hard to give her a compliment saying it suits her well.\nEun-ha’s back, as she returned to the kitchen, incessantly lingered in my sight.\nI was conflicted, not sure whether she was embarrassed or genuinely angry at Eunwoo Hyung.\nFor now, I decided the priority was to calm Eun-ha down and seated her on a kitchen chair.\n“I’ll take care of the onions, so just sit here for a moment, Eun-ha.”\n“Okay...”\nI headed toward the sink, leaving the still-embarrassed Eun-ha behind.\nI cut the top and root of a sizeable onion and repositioned the knife.\nSwish-swish-\nWith somewhat awkward motions, I was peeling the onion.\nWas this how it was supposed to be peeled...?\nIt felt somewhat clumsy.\n‘Chef Baek Jong-won does it so skillfully.’\nSuch pointless thoughts crossed my mind while I was peeling the onion.\nThen, I heard Eun-ha quietly getting up from behind me.\nPerhaps she had calmed down a bit now...?\nEun-ha approached me and wrapped her arms around my waist without changing her expression.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“...”\nBurying her face in my back, Eun-ha silently embraced me tighter.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“...”\nSilence enveloped the kitchen, which was bustling just a few minutes ago.\nGulp-\nI swallowed dryly, but Eun-ha did not let me go.\nAfter about a minute of serenity, Eun-ha quietly separated herself from me.\nI was curious about Eun-ha’s expression now, but my own must have been serious too.\nIn the end, time passed without us facing each other or thinking of words that could change this atmosphere.\nEventually,\nShuffle-shuffle-\nThe sound of Eun-ha stepping backward reached my ears, which quickly turned into a dash- as she sprinted to her room.\nOnly after the thud of her door closing did I exhale the breath I’d been holding with a woosh-! and slumped in front of the sink.\n“I really almost died...”\nIn the end, peeling the onion and curing the salmon in salt were tasks I had to complete on my own.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As I entered the room, I threw myself onto the bed. Burying my face into the pillow, I screamed,\n“Aaaah-”\nUpon seeing Han-gyeol’s back, my mind was overwhelmed with the desire to hug him.\nIt was a broad back… it didn’t make sense not to hug him. Perhaps this was just my rationalization…\nI took a moment to compose myself and got up from the bed.\nCarefully, I opened the door and stealthily poked my head out. There, I saw Han-gyeol, busily moving about in the kitchen.\nAlthough I was incredibly embarrassed, I walked towards the kitchen as if nothing had happened.\nSurely, he must have heard my footsteps, but Han-gyeol didn’t turn around to look at me.\nHis broad back was still vulnerably exposed. I wanted to hug him again, but that probably wouldn’t be wise.\n“Um...I’ll take over from here.”\nWhen I cautiously spoke, Han-gyeol looked at me with a smile.\nI was embarrassed and ashamed but wanted to act as if nothing had happened.\n“Let’s just do it together.”\n“Huh? Han-gyeol, you know how to cook?”\n“Just the basics? Besides, it’s more fun to do it together.”\nHan-gyeol, considerately, suggested cooking together.\nAs it meant spending more time close to Han-gyeol, I readily agreed.\n“Sure. I like that better too.”\n“Do you have an apron I can use?”\n“Yeah. Of course, I do.”\nI fetched the apron folded at one corner of the dining table.\n“I’ve been handling onions. Eun-ha, can you put it on me?”\n“Ah- Okay. Can you bend your head down a bit?”\nAs Han-gyeol lowered his head, I hung the apron ties around his neck.\n“Han-gyeol, turn around. I’ll tie it for you.”\n“Mm.”\nAnd I tied the apron strings neatly for him. During that, seeing his back again made me want to hug him.\n“It’s done. The apron suits you well, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? Thanks for complimenting me. Ah- the onions are chopped. Next, we need to prepare the salmon.”\n“Mmhm. Han-gyeol, can you pour some salt into the scoop over there? I’ll handle the salmon.”\nI went to the cutting board and took out the packaged salmon.\nEven though it was prepped, I checked again for any bones. Then, carefully wielding the knife, I sliced the long piece of salmon in half.\n“Eun-ha, you’re good at cutting.”\n“Am I? Just average, I think?”\n“I just wanted to compliment you.”\nI burst into laughter at the unexpected compliment.\n“What’s that for? Hurry and pour the salt.”\n“Can’t I watch a bit more? I want to see Eun-ha cooking.”\n“It’s nothing big. Still want to watch?”\n“Yep. Extremely.”\nHan-gyeol nodded his head vigorously.\nHe was so adorable doing that, I couldn’t refuse.\n“Then carefully watch from the side?”\n“Yeah. After cutting it horizontally, what do we do next?”\n“We need to cut it vertically since it’s too big. Look- watch.”\nI lifted the knife and cut the salmon again, this time into halves.\nI was a bit nervous with Han-gyeol watching, but the salmon cut smoothly. That was a passing grade.\n“Now- we need to marinate this in salt for about an hour.”\n“That long? It seems like it would be delicious enough to eat like this.”\n“I want to make something even tastier, so bear with it. Still, want to try a bit?”\n“Yep. I like raw salmon just as it is.”\nUpon Han-gyeol’s words, I carefully sliced a piece from the salmon’s belly.\nI lifted a beautifully cut slice of salmon sashimi with my chopsticks and carefully handed it to Han-gyeol.\n“I will enjoy it.”\nHan-gyeol, taking the sashimi from me, was incredibly cute.\nHis slight smile, an indication of the deliciousness, warmed my heart.\n“It’s really tasty.”\n“You really enjoy it, too.”\nOur playful, sneering expressions locked for a moment before we refocused on the cooking.\nDoing something together with the person I liked, just that, warmed my heart.\nMy chest fluttered and tingled.\n“Eun-ha, is this enough salt?”\n“Mmhm. That’s plenty. You put in just the right amount.”\n“Yeah? I guess I do have a knack for it.”\n“That’s true. When I watch Han-gyeol, it seems like there’s nothing you can’t do. It’s amazing.”\nI said as I placed the salmon I had prepared into the scoop.\nHan-gyeol took the chopping board and knife I was using to the sink and washed them.\nOur movements synchronized seamlessly, no words were needed.\n“Hey- I’m human too; there are many things I can’t do.”\n“Oh? Like what can’t Han-gyeol do?”\nAlthough we weren’t looking at each other, our conversation continued.\n“I can’t cook, can’t play soccer; if you look, there’s probably a lot?”\n“Really? The Han-gyeol I’ve been watching seemed to be good at everything, a jack of all trades?”\n‘Ah- should I add a little more salt?’\nI picked up the salt shaker beside me.\n“I guess I only wanted to show Eun-ha the side of me that’s good at everything.”\nMy hand paused at Han-gyeol’s soft voice.\nSlyly, I turned my head to look at him.\n“So... if Eun-ha thinks that way, it went as planned.”\nHan-gyeol, speaking with a subtle smile, looked incredibly cool.\nThat was right. Han-gyeol was human and wouldn’t be good at everything.\nHe just didn’t want to show that side to me.\nI caught a glimpse of Han-gyeol’s desire to appear well in front of me.\n“I want to see the side of Han-gyeol that can’t do things, too.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol turned his head too.\n“Hmm?”\n“I want to see that side of Han-gyeol too.”\n“Oh? It’s a bit embarrassing to show.”\n“Well, that may be, but I still want to see that side of Han-gyeol.”\nUpon hearing my words, Han-gyeol stared at me intently.\n“Ah-! I’m not forcing you!”\n“Mmhm. I know.”\n“I’ll continue to like you even if you show me that side. And, I also want to be someone comfortable for Han-gyeol.”\nEven after I finished speaking, Han-gyeol still gazed at me.\nHis eyes, gradually reddening, changed quite powerfully.\n“Eun-ha, is it okay if I hug you now?”\n“What, what-?! All of a sudden? My hands are...from handling the salmon...!”\n“It’s okay. I want to hug you, so you just stay still.”\n“But, still...”\nIn the room, there was also my brother...!\nBut I do wanted to be hugged...!\nIf it was only for a very brief moment...\n“Can I?”\n“Yes...”\nAs my words ended, Han-gyeol walked toward me with big steps.\nAlthough his forceful strides slightly tensed me up, my heart began to beat rapidly.\nEventually, Han-gyeol tightly enveloped me in his arms.\nThe hug was a bit stronger than when we embraced last time, and my ear touched Han-gyeol’s chest.\nThe sound of Han-gyeol’s fiercely beating heart reached me.\nIt was a moment when I could palpably feel that his feelings were the same as mine.\nMy hands were thoroughly coated with salt, so I hadn’t planned on embracing Han-gyeol.\nHowever, wanting to hear the sound of Han-gyeol’s heartbeat a little more, I eventually wrapped my arms around his waist.\nHan-gyeol and I embraced each other like that for a while before cautiously letting go.\n“Han-gyeol, your heartbeat was really fast, huh?”\n“Was it? It always is when I’m holding Eun-ha.”\n“Really? It would have burst if we stayed like that a bit longer.”\n“You say scary things. But should we hug a bit longer?”\n“Did you miss it that much?”\n“Just a tiny bit?”\n“Okay.”\nI promptly nestled back into Han-gyeol’s arms.\n‘Ah, I really love this.’\nThe accelerating beat of Han-gyeol’s heart too.\nAnd the touch of his hands, again embracing my head.\nI loved all these moments, where warmth was conveyed.\n“Eun-ha, my back is going to break at this rate.”\n“Hey- it won’t break from just this.”\nI embraced Han-gyeol’s waist a bit tighter.\nBut at that moment, a click sound of bone came from Han-gyeol’s back.\nSurprised, I opened my eyes wide and looked up at Han-gyeol.\n“Ha, Han-gyeol-?! I heard a bone sound, are you okay?”\n“Mmhm. I’m fine. Don’t worry and let’s stay like this a bit more.”\n“Did I hug you too tightly?”\n“It felt like cracking a joint a little.”\n“What is that-!”\nA natural laughter escaped me at Han-gyeol’s witty joke.\nIt was then, while gazing at his gently smiling face, that a click sound of the door interrupted us, startling us into parting.\nMy brother, having left the room earlier, was walking towards the kitchen.\n‘Why on earth now, you darn brother…!’\nThe atmosphere was just really good a moment ago.\nI wanted to hug a bit more…!\n“Shin Eun-ha. Hyun-joo called, asking if there’s beer at home.”\n“I think there was a small can in the fridge. If you want to drink, go buy some.”\n“Ah- I suppose I should. I’ll run to the mart quickly.”\nWith that, my brother vanished from the kitchen.\nNot much later, upon hearing the sound of the front door opening, Han-gyeol approached me.\nThen, gently embracing me from behind, he rested his face on my shoulder.\nWithout a word, I accepted the heart-fluttering back hug.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hmm. What?”\n“The apron suits you well.”\n“Ugh- it’s embarrassing, stop praising me now.”\n“It’s the apron you chose to show me, right?”\n“Pointing that out makes it even more embarrassing...!”\n“Mm. Your face is totally a radish.”\n“Ah, really..! Stop teasing!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As soon as Hyun-joo noona arrived home, she immediately set up a table with Eun-ha.\nWhen salmon rice bowl and salmon sushi were laid on the table, Hyun-joo noona exclaimed in amazement.\n“Wow- What is this? Did the two of you make this?”\n“Ah- I just assisted. Eun-ha did most of it.”\n“No, no. Han-gyeol helped out a lot too. It’s not just assisting, we made it together.”\nEun-ha said, snuggling up next to me.\nAfter the hug, we had become a bit closer.\n“This quality is so good that it’s laughable. If Han-gyeol stays with us, can we eat like this every day?”\nEunwoo Hyung had the same reaction.\n“You going to talk nonsense again? Next time, just eat cold rice and seaweed.”\n“Isn’t that too harsh? Han-gyeol, come to our house often. Then, it feels like we can eat this every day.”\n“Yes. Let’s do that. Should we start eating now? It’s not good if it stays out for too long.”\n“Okay. Hyun-joo, you’re going to drink beer, right?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I’ll get it.”\nHyun-joo noona brought out two cans of beer she had stored in the fridge.\nThe cracking sound was pleasing to the ears, but I couldn’t drink under the circumstances.\nBecoming younger had its perks, but there were moments like this that felt regretful.\n“Do you two want a drink?”\nFor a moment, a natural smile formed on my face, but Eun-ha immediately intervened.\n“Unnie! We’re still students, we shouldn’t drink.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes, yes. We’re students... and exam-takers...”\n‘Goodbye, beer.’\nIt was only for a moment, but it was pleasant.\n‘Let’s meet again next year.’\n“Han-gyeol seems really regretful, doesn’t he?”\n“Not at all…”\n“It’s okay. Anyway, you’ll be able to drink next year, so just hang in there a bit longer.”\n“Hey, there’s no time to talk. Let’s eat quickly. I’m drooling like crazy.”\n“Right, right. Let’s eat. Thank you for this food.”\nEunwoo Hyung and Hyun-joo noona immediately took a bite of the salmon rice bowl.\nEun-ha and I tensely watched their reactions, anxious since we both had a hand in preparing the dish.\nThe two, who initially showed no reaction, carefully set down their spoons as if in sync.\nAh- This was a chance to score points. Was it a failure?\n“Why, what’s wrong? Does it taste strange?”\n“How is it?”\nHyun-joo noona and Eunwoo Hyung quietly alternated their gaze between Eun-ha and me. They then locked eyes with each other and suddenly jumped up from their chairs.\n“Wow-! What is this? Why is it so delicious? I need to take a photo.”\n“Han-gyeol Hyung. Seriously, please stay with us. I want to eat food like this.”\nHyun-joo noona quickly pulled out her phone to snap a picture, and Eunwoo Hyung enthusiastically grasped my hand.\n“I’m glad it’s delicious.”\n“My younger sister may be lacking, but please continue our family bond with generous affection.”\n“Yes, yes. Please keep eating. There’s sushi too, so enjoy.”\n“Hey, Hyun-joo, let’s toast.”\n“Mmhm! This is really good.”\nThe two sat back down and clinked their beer cans together. After taking a bite of the salmon sushi, they wore blissful smiles.\n“Eun-ha, they say it’s delicious.”\n“..Well, I made it with Han-gyeol, so of course.”\nEun-ha replied in a soft voice, but her lips curled up in joy.\n“Should we eat too?”\n“Mmhm.”\nAfter Eun-ha and I took a bite of the salmon rice bowl, we exchanged glances. With a twinkle in our eyes, we quickly emptied our bowls.\nOur first collaborative dish was a success.\n“Han-gyeol, there’s something I want to ask.”\n“Yes? What is it?”\nIn the middle of our meal, Hyun-joo Noona suddenly asked, her lips curling up in a mischievous manner that left me slightly uneasy.\n“Did nothing happen while you two were in the kitchen, wearing aprons?”\n“Pardon? What do you mean?”\nIt was a baffling moment.\nEun-ha paused in her eating, her ears perking up in attention, clearly contemplating the right response.\n“You know, like in the kitchen, sometimes there’s a spontaneous back hug or something like that? Like a scene from a movie~?”\nTo say nothing happened would negate the special back hug Eun-ha and I shared.\nBeing honest might make me feel embarrassed, but lying could possibly hurt her feelings.\nAs I hesitated, searching for words, Eun-ha delicately set her spoon down and spoke on my behalf.\n“Yeah, we just had a normal back hug.”\nShe seemed to think that if she answered confidently, we could move past it. But it backfired. Despite her nonchalant response, Eun-ha’s face slowly began to blush.\n“Eun-ha, are you feeling shy~? I mean, as a couple, that’s pretty standard. Right, Han-gyeol?”\nSince Eun-ha’s face was already beet-red with embarrassment, I figured I should step up and be assertive.\n“Yes, it’s an entirely ordinary thing.”\n“But then, why is your face also turning red, Han-gyeol?”\n“Oh, come on...”\nIn the end, my face turned as red as Eun-ha’s.\n“Ah- Seriously! Unnie, stop teasing us!”\n“Ahaha! You two are so cute! Should I take a picture of you both now?”\nHyun-joo Noona sneakily raised her phone, but upon seeing this, Eun-ha and I shouted in unison.\n“Absolutely not!”\n“Absolutely not!”\n***\nJust as Eun-ha and I were about to start cleaning up after our meal, Hyun-joo noona spoke as I began to gather the empty dishes.\n“You two can relax in the living room; Eunwoo and I will handle the cleanup.”\n“Yeah, it’s okay. You’ve been so kind to us with the meal, so we should at least handle the cleaning.”\n“We feel bad about earlier. Look, Eunwoo’s already willing to help.”\n“Yeah, Han-gyeol, you should rest. We got this! Just promise to cook for us again next time.”\n“Let’s take a break, Han-gyeol.”\nSince Eun-ha chimed in, I eventually agreed.\n“Alright, thank you.”\n“Han-gyeol, would you like some ice cream?”\n“Mhm, I’ll have whatever Eun-ha’s having.”\n“Okay.”\nEun-ha and I happily took an ice cream each and settled down on the sofa.\n“If you two are going to show affection, feel free to go ahead~ We won’t peek in the living room.”\n“Unnie! We’ll...we’ll decide on that ourselves...”\n“Alright, alright~ Eunwoo and I will mind our own business! We promise not to look~”\nThe laughter in Hyun-joo Noona’s voice from the kitchen caused our faces to redden once more.\nThe way Eun-ha said ‘We’ll decide on that ourselves’ gave off a rather bulldozer-like impression.\nIt was as if now that we were officially dating, there was no need for any more brakes.\nHyun-joo Noona and Eunwoo Hyung said they wouldn’t pay attention, but we couldn’t exactly indulge in overt displays of affection.\nI cautiously held Eun-ha’s hand tightly with my left hand. Eun-ha promptly grasped mine in return.\n“Han-gyeol, did you like the salmon rice bowl?”\n“Yeah, it was absolutely delicious. Let’s make it again sometime.”\n“We should. When should we eat it next?”\n“If we eat it too often, we might get sick of it. Maybe once a month?”\n“Sounds perfect. Tomorrow, we’re having tteokbokki, right?”\n“Yep, I’ll make it for you. Does Eun-ha prefer wheat rice cakes or regular rice cakes?”\nWhen I asked, Eun-ha pondered for a moment before replying.\n“I prefer the regular rice cakes. What about you, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m on team regular rice cake as well. How spicy do you want it?”\n“I like it moderately spicy.”\n“Moderation is always the hardest part when cooking.”\n“Maybe half as spicy as the tteokbokki we ate last time?”\n“Ah, should I try to replicate that? Do you think there’s a recipe online?”\n“Ah- We can probably find one on YouTube?”\n“Is it connected to the TV?”\n“Mhm. Here’s the remote.”\nEun-ha briefly let go of my hand to hand me the remote. I immediately navigated to YouTube on the television.\nAfter a brief loading screen, the display came into view and we both momentarily paused.\nEun-ha and I had the exact same reaction. The YouTube homepage was filled with videos of salmon.\nReal-life tips for handling salmon!\nDiscover how to buy the best salmon at the supermarket, just like those strong salmon swimming upstream.\nDIY Salmon sushi mukbang. Ft. Salmon rice bowl.\n“Uh...? Why are these the only videos showing up? How weird...!”\n“Ah, how much salmon content did you watch for the algorithm to recommend only salmon?”\n“Ugh! Stop teasing and let’s find that tteokbokki recipe!”\n“Oh, you’re so cute.”\nUnable to resist, I pinched Eun-ha’s cheek lightly.\n“Hey, let go! It’s embarrassing.”\n“Why do you always act so adorably?”\n“I’m not cute at all.”\n“Ah, I could die from how cute you are.”\n“Ugh! I told you I’m not cute!”\nEvery time I saw Eun-ha getting flustered, I wanted to tease her more.\nI wished I could proudly show off Eun-ha, who was playfully punching my arm.\nUnable to contain my laughter, I yelled towards the kitchen.\n“Hyun-joo Noona! Eunwoo Hyung! Isn’t Eun-ha the cutest?”\n“Hey! What are you saying?”\nI continued laughing and bragging about Eun-ha.\n“Eun-ha’s YouTube algorithm is filled with only salmon videos~”\n“Hey! No! It’s not...! I said it’s not!”\nAs Eun-ha tried to cover my mouth, I abruptly stood up from the sofa.\n“Eun-ha, what’s the issue? Is it weird for a boyfriend to find his girlfriend cute?”\n“It’s your mouth that’s the issue, Han-gyeol! It’s embarrassing, so stop it! Just stop!”\n“Ah, this is so fun. Eunwoo Hyung! I might just live here as you said!”\n“Heyyyy!”\nEun-ha hurriedly tried to grab me, but I swiftly jumped over the table in front of the sofa.\nWith the table between us, our expressions were polar opposites: Eun-ha, looking like she was about to explode, and me, laughing uncontrollably.\n“Han-gyeol, if I catch you, you’re dead.”\n“But then we wouldn’t be able to eat salmon together.”\n“Ugh, seriously! Come here! Come here now!”\nThis was way too much fun.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Yesterday, I made salmon rice bowls and sushi with Han-gyeol.\nToday, a plate of tteokbokki made solely by Han-gyeol was placed on the table.\nThe same exclamation of surprise as yesterday burst out, and Hyun-joo Unnie and my brother were busy eating.\n“It’s so delicious... I can’t even imagine a life without Han-gyeol Hyung now! From now on, our house will always be filled with joy- Ouch!”\nI kicked my brother in the shin for his unnecessary remarks.\n“Don’t burden Han-gyeol and just eat your tteokbokki.”\n“Thank you for enjoying it. I might not be able to make it often, but I’ll make it for you occasionally.”\n“Wow~ How can you be so perfect... It’s too much for my little sister.”\n“It’s not. Eun-ha is the one who’s too good for me.”\nHan-gyeol made a pleasant remark.\nI felt a little proud and teased my brother.\n“See? Han-gyeol said so.”\n“Have I ever seen such a sly thing? Han-gyeol, my little sister is so lacking.”\n“Come on, Eun-ha is amazing. She’s smart, kind, pretty, cute, and gentle. There’s so much to learn from her.”\n“Is this girl you are talking about from our Shin family, right? No matter how much I think about it, I can’t see anyone like this in our household.”\nMy brother kept poking at my nerves.\nI tried to kick him in the shin again but mistakenly kicked the chair instead.\n“Ouch...! It hurts...!”\n“Hahahahaha! Trying to get hit twice? This is too good.”\nHe obviously expected me to kick again.\nMy brother, always keen to pick a fight for no reason.\n“Ah, come on- you’re not kids. Stop fighting.”\nHyun-joo Unnie stepped in to mediate between my brother and me.\n“But he started it by getting on my nerves first.”\n“I just stated the facts, little sis.”\n“Why don’t you go out? Aren’t you staying home too much? Get out.”\n“I’ll go out after I eat tteokbokki and stay for about thirty minutes.”\n“I’d prefer if you left as soon as possible.”\n“I’ll stay longer just because you said that.”\n‘Such a petty guy.’\n‘Just leave already.’\n“Ah- is that so? Then, how about you go out with me?”\nUpon Han-gyeol’s suggestion, I quickly turned my head.\n“Huh? Han-gyeol, are you leaving right after eating tteokbokki?”\n“Of course? Eun-ha has to go for her private lesson, right?”\n“Um... that only lasts two hours though.”\nI was thinking of studying together after my private lesson.\nCome to think of it, I didn’t ask him to wait.\n“Should I wait until Eun-ha’s lesson is over?”\n“Oh- if Han-gyeol has plans, it’s okay. I totally forgot to tell you.”\n“No, I said that thinking I might disturb you. Truthfully, I wanted to study together too.”\n“You won’t be disturbing at all. Can you wait just two hours?”\n“Why not? I’ll be studying in the living room too.”\n“The living room table is too low, so study using the desk in my brother’s room.”\nWhen I said that, Han-gyeol shifted his gaze to my brother.\n“Is it okay with you, Hyung?”\n“Of course. Don’t worry about it.”\n“Thank you.”\nMy brother easily agreed.\nHe was really kind to Han-gyeol.\nIt must be because Han-gyeol set up the computer for him.\nBut it seemed like they got along well even without that.\n“Eun-ha, did you miss Han-gyeol that much at home~?”\nSitting next to me, Hyun-joo Unnie poked my side and teased.\n“Ah! No, it’s just that... studying with Han-gyeol helps a lot. The midterms are coming up!”\n“Is that so? I didn’t know you were this studious~”\n“It’s true! Studying with Han-gyeol really helps!”\n“That’s right. I study better with Eun-ha than usual.”\nHan-gyeol also sided with me.\n“You two look great together. Remember, don’t neglect your studies just because you’re dating.”\n“Of course! I study even harder now than before dating Han-gyeol.”\n“Me too. Eun-ha’s dedication naturally makes me work harder.”\n“Yep, yep. That’s right.”\n“You two are a good sight to see.”\nHyun-joo Unnie responded with a smile to our comments.\nAfterwards, we quickly finished our tteokbokki.\nI couldn’t keep Han-gyeol waiting for too long.\nAfter swiftly cleaning up, I headed to my room with Hyun-joo Unnie.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll be back after my lesson with Unnie. If my brother bothers you or is annoying in any way, feel free to come to my room, okay?”\n“Hey, punk. Am I some gangster? Why would I bother Han-gyeol?”\n“Just focus on your lesson and don’t rush. Make sure it lasts the full two hours.”\n“Okay, see you in two hours.”\n“Sure~”\nThinking of spending more time with Han-gyeol, a smile bloomed on my face.\nAs I entered the room, I hurriedly sat on a chair and opened my reference book.\n“Hey, Unnie. Let’s start the private lesson.”\n“Ahem, it’s not ‘Unnie’ during class.”\n“Teacher. Let’s start the lesson.”\n“Why? Don’t want to keep your boyfriend waiting?”\n“Yeah. I don’t.”\nWhen I carelessly responded in informal speech, my sister’s hand playfully hit my head.\n“Get your act together. Focus when you study.”\n“Yes...”\n***\nBefore I knew it, I was focused on the private lesson.\nIt was just hard in the beginning. Once I focused, I rarely got distracted.\nWhile I was stacking up in my head everything that Hyun-joo Unnie told me, someone knocked on my door with a knock sound.\n- Hey, I’m coming in.\nMy brother briefly said and then opened the door to enter. It seemed he stopped by my room before leaving.\n“Leaving now?”\n“Yeah. I’ll be back late after dinner.”\n“What about Han-gyeol? What’s he doing?”\n“He seemed drowsy after eating tteokbokki. Told him to comfortably sleep on the bed.”\n“Han-gyeol is sleeping now? On your bed?”\nI was so curious about how Han-gyeol looked while sleeping. I wanted to rush over and see him right away.\n“Yeah. I thought I’d say goodbye before leaving, but he was fast asleep, so I didn’t wake him. Anyway, I’m leaving.”\n“Yeah. Don’t come back drunk.”\n“Okay. Hyun-joo, be careful when you head home.”\n“Sure. See you next week.”\nWith that, my brother left the house, having piqued my curiosity.\nThere was still a long way to go before the private lesson ended... but I was so curious.\nBut asking my sister if I could go see Han-gyeol right now seemed rather childish.\nI had no choice but to hope that Han-gyeol wouldn’t wake up until the lesson was over.\n“Shall we continue with our studies?”\n“Yes.”\nThere was nothing to be done.\n‘Ah- but I really want to see him. Should I close my eyes and just ask?’\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes?”\n“How about we take a break a bit earlier today?”\n‘This is my chance!!’\n“Yes!”\n“That was a quick answer, wasn’t it?”\n“Just 10 minutes, neither more nor less!”\n“Alright. Just 10 minutes, okay?”\nI energetically nodded and headed toward my brother’s room.\nBeing careful not to wake Han-gyeol, I gently turned the doorknob.\nQuietly opening the door and sneaking into my brother’s room, I saw Han-gyeol lying on the bed.\n“Han-gyeol...are you...sleeping?”\nHan-gyeol didn’t respond to my call.\nI approached a little closer and gently looked at Han-gyeol’s face.\nWithout snoring or grinding his teeth, Han-gyeol was in a graceful pose, deeply asleep.\n“He’s so handsome...”\nI was resolved to gaze upon Han-gyeol during our brief break.\nAfter all, seeing Han-gyeol asleep was undoubtedly a rare sight.\nTo get a better look, I rested my arms on the edge of the bed and leaned over.\nHis eyelashes were unusually long for a guy.\nA sharp bridge of the nose.\nEven those soft-looking lips.\nI took them all in, without missing a single detail.\nHearing the faint sound of his breathing, the corners of my mouth naturally lifted.\nI really didn’t understand how he could be this handsome.\nHe was my boyfriend who was cute, dashing, and also so endearing.\nGathering my courage, I lightly poked Han-gyeol’s cheek.\nThe moment my finger touched, his brows twitched ever so slightly.\n“So cute...!”\nSimply gazing at a peacefully sleeping Han-gyeol warmed my heart.\nEven if I was just looking at him, to feel this way…\nEven by my own reckoning, it seemed I truly adored Han-gyeol.\nHe probably didn’t realize it.\nHow significant he was to me right now.\nHow wonderful would it be if I could genuinely convey all my feelings to him?\nHow elated would I be if I were someone more expressive?\nThough I had mustered up courage many times, I had never fully expressed my heart.\nI knew exactly what words would wholly convey my feelings.\nHowever, since our time together hadn’t been long, I had been cautious about voicing them.\nBut since Han-gyeol was currently lost in sleep, I decided to muster a bit more courage.\nThe words I had held back countless times, I whispered gently.\n“I love you.”\nIt was much more embarrassing than I had imagined.\nStill, having voiced it once, I felt I could do it better the next time.\nFor today, overwhelmed by my shyness, I decided to call it quits and carefully got up from my spot.\nI gazed at Han-gyeol’s face one last time and straightened his blanket.\n“Sleep well, Han-gyeol. See you in a bit.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Midterm exams were just around the corner.\nI should have been immersed in studying, but all I could think about was Eun-ha.\n“Hey Han-gyeol, what are you thinking about so deeply? Is something bothering you?” Yujin asked me.\n“Is it right to bring up something that will surely embarrass your girlfriend?”\n“So it’s about a relationship? I shouldn’t have asked. I wish I could turn back time.”\nEun-ha seemed to have mistaken that I was asleep, but I had been awake since she playfully poked my cheek.\nI still felt distant from reality because of Eun-ha’s recent confession of love. Every time I recalled that moment, I could hear her voice crystal clear.\nShould I admit I was awake?\nI wanted to see Eun-ha blush.\n“Man, this is really troubling me.”\n“If you’re troubled, just speak up. You’re not the type to hold back.”\n“You seem to know me better than I thought.”\n“Is there something on your mind?”\n“I feel embarrassed to bring it up too.”\n“Spare me… Spare me… Grant me the power to turn back time. Or please erase my memory for just a minute.”\nIf asked whether I love Eun-ha, of course, I do.\nIn my heart, I wanted to say I loved her a thousand, ten thousand times.\nBut to utter those three simple words required immense courage.\nHonestly, I never imagined she’d be the first to say it.\nEun-ha, who always struggled to express herself... That Eun-ha confessed her love first.\nIt made my heart race even more.\n“Ah- Eun-ha, she is so lovely. I want to marry her right after graduation. I want to make her happy.”\n“This is too much! Save me, God! Punish my friend who’s making fun of me here! Or grant me a weapon to punish this friend!”\nWhile I couldn’t express my fervent wish to her, Yujin was busy cursing me.\n“Stop with the cursing and suggest a solution for how I should deal with these feelings.”\n“Don’t you think asking for a logical solution to emotional problems is a bit much?”\n“Do you have a good solution or not? If I keep feeling like this, my grades will suffer.”\n“What kind of nonsense is that?”\n“I can’t study because I keep thinking about Eun-ha. This is like a disease. They say there’s no cure for it.”\n“You’re not going to tell me specifically what happened, are you?”\n“Sorry. I want to keep it as a memory known only to Eun-ha and me.”\n“Then just do the same thing she did. That’s all the advice I can give.”\n“Do the same thing? Isn’t that childish?”\n“Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.”\nIt felt slightly childish, but it didn’t seem like a bad idea.\nI subtly glanced toward Eun-ha, but she was laughing and conversing with Jeong Harim.\n“That was a decent solution.”\n“You’re satisfied just like that? Then why did you even ask?”\n“I couldn’t think of anything other than Eun-ha.”\nThat was right. By observing Eun-ha throughout the day today, an opportunity to tell her I love her might just come along.\n***\nThough I was resolute, there was no chance until the school classes ended.\nPerhaps because midterms were right around the corner, Eun-ha only focused on her studies, sitting next to me.\nShe seemed particularly engrossed today. Maybe it was just my perception.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol. I feel your gaze on me. Is there a problem or something?”\nIt was indeed a serious issue.\nShould I just tell her now?\nBut then I’d have to show her my embarrassed face.\n“No, I was just looking because I wanted to see Eun-ha’s face.”\n“It’s sweet of you to say, but we can’t do that now. Midterms are next week; we should be studying.”\n“You’re so stern. Aren’t you tired, Eun-ha? Don’t you feel like taking a nap?”\n“Not at all. We ended our call early last night and slept, remember?”\nI should’ve prolonged the call last night.\n“Did you stay up studying after our call, Han-gyeol? It’s not good for your health to study too late.”\n“No, I slept early too. I just suddenly wanted to see Eun-ha asleep, that’s all.”\n“What? Don’t wish for that; I look pretty awkward when I sleep.”\n“I only found it cute.”\n“Ah, you must’ve seen when I was sick.”\n“As always, you looked cute.”\nWhen I said she was cute, Eun-ha beamed with a smile, clearly pleased.\n“Thanks for the compliment.”\n“You’re not embarrassed by being called cute anymore?”\n“No. Now when Han-gyeol says I’m cute, it just makes me happy. It was embarrassing at first, but now I’m fine with it.”\n“I personally like seeing Eun-ha embarrassed. I often want to see that.”\n“Then try making me blush. Now, when Han-gyeol praises me, I feel happiness more than embarrassment.”\nIf I confessed my love, she might just bolt out of the classroom.\nI decided to hold off for a moment and assessed the situation.\n“So, should I try making you blush?”\n“Yep, I’m not easily embarrassed now.”\n“Quite confident. You think you know what I’ll say?”\n“Whatever you say, I won’t be embarrassed.”\n“With Eun-ha talking like that, I feel challenged.”\n“Think you can do it?”\nI started off lightly.\n“Eun-ha, you’re beautiful.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Eun-ha, you’re cute.”\n“I appreciate that too.”\nRather than looking embarrassed, Eun-ha adjusted her posture and stared directly into my eyes.\n“Seems more like Han-gyeol’s the one who’s embarrassed, no?”\nFor some reason, I felt like I was being cornered.\n“When did you become so bold?”\n“With Han-gyeol, it’s special. I want to treat you differently than others.”\n“How do you treat me differently?”\n“I just want to be honest with Han-gyeol.”\n“And you can’t be honest with others?”\n“Yeah. I feel most comfortable with Han-gyeol. That’s why I want to be more transparent and expressive.”\n“Then show it when I’m awake.”\n“Yep, express it when you are... wait, what?”\n‘Ah- I shouldn’t have said it like that.’\n“Han-gyeol? What did you just mean by that?”\n“What did I just say?”\n“You said to show it when you’re awake.”\n“Yes, exactly as it sounds.”\n“So, why did you think of that?”\nI clamped my mouth shut tight at Eun-ha’s question.\nEun-ha’s expression quickly hardened.\n“...You were awake?”\nI cautiously nodded in confirmation.\n“Since when...?”\n“Since Eun-ha poked my cheek.”\n“I see...”\nSurprisingly, Eun-ha turned her gaze away calmly.\n“You heard everything?”\n“Yes.”\n“Just to confirm, you know what I’m talking about right now, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’s the probability that what you’re thinking and what I’m thinking differ?”\n“At most, around 1%.”\nAt my response, Eun-ha wordlessly stood up from her seat and exhaled a deep sigh.\n“Eun-ha? Why are you standing up?”\n“Han-gyeol...”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m sorry!”\nEun-ha dashed out of the classroom like a bullet.\nI instinctively chased after her.\n“Eun-ha! Where are you going?”\n“Don’t follow me!”\n“You said you weren’t embarrassed!”\n“How can I not be embarrassed about that!”\n“But you said it yourself!”\n“That’s why it’s even more embarrassing!”\n“It’s dangerous, don’t run!”\n“Then don’t chase me!”\nI was worried watching Eun-ha rush down the stairs three at a time.\nIf she were to misstep, it would be a major accident.\nIn the end, just as Eun-ha had said, I stopped my pursuit and let her go.\nAnd honestly, I felt even with a full-on sprint, I couldn’t catch her.\n“How is she so fast?”\nAfter slowly descending the stairs and stepping outside the building, I began my search for Eun-ha.\nI was certain she couldn’t have gone far, but she wasn’t easy to locate.\nI checked both the athletic field and the cafeteria, but there was no sign of her anywhere.\nAfter lingering outside for a while, the recycling area caught my eye.\nTreading softly and carefully toward the recycling spot, I faintly sensed a presence.\n“Eun-ha, come out while I’m still being nice.”\nI gave her a chance, but Eun-ha resolutely stayed hidden.\n“There won’t be a scene like in movies or dramas where a cat suddenly jumps out. Just give up and come out.”\nUpon hearing this, Eun-ha cautiously revealed herself.\nDespite the time that had passed, her face was still unmistakably red. She puffed out her cheeks in what seemed like annoyance, glaring at me.\n“That was mean-!”\nShe seemed quite peeved.\nHowever, it appeared she had no intentions of running away again.\nConsidering how she had sprinted with all her might earlier, she likely didn’t have the energy to run much more.\n“You said it yourself while I was asleep.”\n“But, still...! Even if you heard...! You didn’t even respond...!”\nI knew exactly how to appease the slightly upset Eun-ha.\nAlthough I had a surefire way, the thought of actually executing it made my cheeks flush with embarrassment.\nStill, I truly wanted to express my feelings to Eun-ha.\n“I also...”\n“Hm?”\n“I love you too.”\nAfter struggling to get the words out, my face felt hot.\nIn the end, I too had to exhale a long sigh.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes?”\n“I’m sorry too!”\nOvercome by embarrassment, I turned and fled.\nAs I took off, Eun-ha immediately chased after me.\n“Han-gyeol, where are you going! Stop right there!”\n“No way!”\n“You’ll get hurt if you run like that!”\n“Then don’t chase me!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It was the first day of midterm exams.\nI had scored quite satisfactorily.\nAbove all, I felt very pleased because I made only one mistake on the English exam. As for the world history subject, hmm... it felt a bit challenging, but the outcome wasn’t too bad.\nI walked straight over to Han-gyeol.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol. Did you do well on the exam?”\n“Yeah, I think I did okay. Eun-ha, you seem happy too. Did you do well?”\n“Mhm. I think I did well today.”\n“Tomorrow is social culture and statistics, right?”\n“Yep. The first period is self-study.”\n“Right. Wanna grab some food?”\n“Sure. Let’s go quickly.”\nWas it impolite to ask how many points he scored?\nHe didn’t seem like he did poorly.\n“Going straight home after lunch?”\n“Yeah. we have a statistics test tomorrow, so I’m going to study with Hyun-joo unnie. ”\n“Then, after dropping off Eun-ha, I should head straight home too.”\nI wanted to suggest to Han-gyeol that we should study at my place, but my home might not be the most comfortable spot. Given that it was exam season, and Han-gyeol should study where he was most at ease.\nUpon reaching the cafeteria, we lined up in a long queue.\nHan-gyeol twisted his neck this way and that, as if it was sore. There was a series of cracking sounds coming from his joints.\n“You’re gonna break your neck doing that.”\n“I didn’t get enough sleep, so my neck feels stiff.”\n“It’s better to get enough sleep even during exams. What time did you sleep last night?”\n“Uhm- around four in the morning? Definitely later than usual.”\n“4 AM?!”\nI looked up at Han-gyeol in surprise.\n“Just during the exam period, so don’t worry too much.”\n“We still have three more days of exams. Are you going to keep this up?”\n“Hmm, we need to go on a date on the last day, so I’ll sleep early then.”\n“So, Han-gyeol’s a night owl? I didn’t realize since you always come to school early.”\n“It’s easier that way. But I do study better at night.”\n“I see.”\nEveryone has their own rhythm, so I didn’t insist he sleep early. Still, I was a bit worried.\n“Speaking of which, what’s on the menu today?”\n“I think it was meat noodles?”\n“Oh- really?”\nWe got our meals from the cafeteria line and sat down. Without hesitation, I shifted all the meat from my plate onto Han-gyeol’s.\n“Eat up, Han-gyeol. You need the meat.”\n“I appreciate the sentiment. But Eun-ha should eat too.”\nHan-gyeol tried to shift the meat back onto my plate.\n“No way. I’ve had plenty of rest and am healthy. You, the tired one, should eat.”\n“I feel bad, like I’m taking food away from my girlfriend.”\n“Agh- just seeing you eat heartily makes me full.”\n“That sounds like something a mother would say. Okay, just for today, I’ll gratefully eat.”\n“Yep. If there’s anything else you want, just let me know.”\n“I want beef.”\n“Should we eat it after the exams?”\n“Are you buying? I eat a lot.”\n“If we grill it at home, it’ll be cheaper, right?”\n“...”\n“Alright. I’ll grill it for you.”\nHan-gyeol finally ate the meat I gave him.\nSeeing Han-gyeol eat well made me genuinely happy.\nAfter finishing our school meals, we headed straight home.\n“Ah, Han-gyeol. Let me drop you off today.”\n“Huh? Won’t it be a hassle for Eun-ha?”\n“You drop me off every day, right? Was it a bother?”\n“Not at all. I enjoyed it.”\n“Same here. So, let me do it today.”\n“What about your tutoring with Hyun-joo noona?”\n“I still have some time.”\nHan-gyeol hesitated for a moment.\nFeeling he might decline, I added a few more words.\n“It’s the exam period, school ends early, and you haven’t been sleeping well. I want to drop you off. Let me, okay?”\nHan-gyeol glanced at me briefly before nodding.\n“Alright. Today, Eun-ha can drop me off.”\n“Come to think of it, I only know you live in Blue Town, but I don’t know the exact address.”\n“Maybe I didn’t tell you because I thought you might visit every day.”\n“Now that you mention it, I really do want to visit daily.”\n“That’s too cute. But not every day.”\n“So, occasionally is okay?”\n“Yes, occasionally is okay.”\nHan-gyeol flashed a playful smile.\n“I wish the exam period would end soon. What should we do the day after exams? What does Eun-ha want to do?”\n“I... um, I’ve only hung out in the neighborhood, so after exams, I’d like to go somewhere further.”\n“How far are you thinking?”\n“An amusement park?”\n“Alright. Let’s go to the amusement park the day after exams.”\n“Yes! Sounds fun. Ah, I’m so excited!”\nI would have to take photos with Han-gyeol.\nI was a bit worried about the June mock exams, but one day should be fine.\nIt was a fitting reward for finishing the exams.\n“Eun-ha, we need to go this way.”\n“Huh? Isn’t the other way faster if we’re heading to Blue Town?”\n“I know.”\nHan-gyeol replied, looking a little embarrassed.\nSeeing him like that was so cute that I took his hand.\n“Did you want to spend more time with me?”\n“Is it so bad? It only adds an extra 5 minutes.”\n“Then let’s walk a bit slower. My legs hurt.”\n“Alright, alright. Let’s take it slow.”\nWe took a slight detour and arrived in front of Han-gyeol’s house.\nHowever, Han-gyeol seemed reluctant to go inside right away.\n“Aren’t you going in?”\n“I should’ve taken a longer detour. We got here sooner than I thought.”\n“What are you saying~ We can go on a date after exams. Go inside now and get some rest.”\n“Yeah. I’m thinking of taking a short nap. Can you wake me up with a call in two hours?”\n“Of course! Sleep without worries.”\n“I’ll go in then. Eun-ha, leave me a message when you get home. I’ll be awake until then.”\n“Alright~”\nWe waved goodbye, and Han-gyeol went into his house.\nDropping off my boyfriend felt even more rewarding than I had imagined.\nWith a broad smile on my face, I headed back home.\n***\n“I’m back~ Oh? Unnie, you’re home early?”\nHyun-joo Unnie was already sitting on the living room sofa, even though it wasn’t our meeting time yet.\n“I didn’t have any work this morning. Did your exam go well?”\n“I think I did well on today’s test. Let me change my clothes real quick, okay?”\n“Sure, go ahead.”\nAs soon as I entered my room, I sent a message to Han-gyeol.\n[I got home safe. I’ll wake you up in two hours.]\nAs I set my phone down and changed my clothes, it buzzed with a notification. Han-gyeol had responded almost immediately.\n[A message from ㄱHan-gyeol.]\n[ㄱHan-gyeol: Thanks. Study hard.]\n[Will do. I’ll call you later. Sleep well.]\nI put my phone away and went to the living room.\n“Did Han-gyeol say he did well on his exam?”\n“He probably did, right? He’s always been good at studying.”\n“Oh my- At this rate, you two will go to the same university.”\n“That would be nice, even if we’re in different departments.”\n“Shall we start the lesson now? Are you up for it?”\n“Yeah. I’m feeling good right now.”\nI spread out my study materials in the living room and fetched my reference book.\n“Your exam is calculus tomorrow, right?”\n“Yeah, but I’m pretty good at calculus, aren’t I?”\n“You shouldn’t be too worried then. The issue is integral, right? And that’s on the last day?”\n“Yeah. It’s on the same day as ‘Language and Media,’ so it’s a bit packed. And there’s also biology.”\n“It can’t be helped. Let’s start. We’ll go over the concepts and review the mistakes you made.”\n“Okay~”\nI began taking unnie’s lesson. The thought of the upcoming exam and the idea of going on a date with Han-gyeol motivated me to study joyfully.\nI worked on problems I’d gotten wrong in the past and solved past test questions from the assessment institute. Reviewing the problems I’d mistakenly answered wrong allowed me to understand where I’d made errors. The two hours, which felt both long and short, flew by.\n“Whew- We’re done. Are you leaving right away, unnie?”\n“I should, shouldn’t I? Eun-ha, don’t you have other subjects to study?”\n“It’s just ‘Sociology.’ I’m good at the exploratory subjects.”\n“Alright then. Let me know how your exam goes tomorrow.”\n“I will. Don’t worry too much.”\n“If you say you’ll do well and then don’t, you’re in trouble, okay?”\n“I apologize in advance.”\nUnnie left the house, leaving me with a mix of encouragement and tension.\nIt seemed like my brother had gone out somewhere too. Being alone at home felt a bit odd.\nThere have undoubtedly been many days like this, but the emptiness I felt was probably because of Han-gyeol. How wonderful it would be if we could be together every day.\n“Oh right. I should call him.”\nI hurriedly went back to my room and picked up my phone, dialing with anticipation.\nAfter several rings, I heard Han-gyeol’s drowsy voice.\n-Hello...?\n“Han-gyeol, it’s been two hours. You need to wake up.”\n-Ah, right. Thanks for waking me.\n“Do you want to sleep a bit more? Should I call you again in about thirty minutes?”\n-No, this is good enough. Did you finish studying?\n“Mhm. I’m planning to study sociology in a bit. Are you fully awake now?”\n-Not really. Let’s talk a bit more.\n“I wanted to as well.”\nI moved to my bed to continue our conversation.\n-After our exams, we’re going straight to the amusement park without stopping at home, right?\n“Sounds good, doesn’t it? I don’t want to waste any time.”\n-Then we should wear our gym clothes that day.\n“Gym clothes? I wanted to wear our school uniforms and take pictures.”\n-Wouldn’t it be uncomfortable on the rides?\n“Don’t worry about it.”\n-Okay. Let’s do that.\n“Oh, and let’s wear headbands.”\n-What kind of headband do you want, Eun-ha?\n“You choose for me, Han-gyeol.”\n-Eun-ha can have cat ears. What about me?\n“You get pink bunny ears.”\n-Okay, if that’s what Eun-ha wants.\n“You promise not to change your mind later?”\n-Of course. Let’s have fun when we go.\nJust hearing Han-gyeol’s voice made the earlier emptiness vanish. His voice alone made me so happy.\n‘What should I do? I don’t want to hang up.’\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The midterms will be over by tomorrow.\nStudying after such a long time had been quite enjoyable.\nThe exams on the first day and yesterday went well, but not all subjects yielded good results.\nI was able to score well in the elective courses without much trouble, but the Korean language was a different story.\nContrary to what I had expected, the passages didn’t read smoothly, and the choices didn’t seem clear. I kept going back and forth between the given text and the options, which made me feel pressed for time.\nSomehow, I managed to answer all the questions, but expecting a high score seemed unrealistic.\nBut, what can I do?\nIt was my lack of preparation, after all. Who else was there to blame?\nThe bell signaling the end of the exam rang just as I finished marking the answer sheet.\n“Okay, everyone, hands on your heads!”\nFollowing the teacher’s instructions, everyone placed their hands on their heads. From behind, the OMR answer sheets and essay answer sheets were collected. The teacher checked the sheets and acknowledged everyone’s hard work.\n“Alright, hang in there, everyone. Tomorrow is the last day of midterms. That’s it.”\nThe moment the teacher left, there was an audible collective relief among the students.\n“Hey, wasn’t this paper super tough?”\n“Yup. I feel it was harder than the mock exam in March.”\n“With this, the top-tier cut-off might be below 90, right?”\n“Yeah, they really made this exam challenging.”\nIt seemed I wasn’t the only one who found it difficult.\nBut in order to attend the same university as Eun-ha, it was best to achieve high scores in all subjects. While there were other admission methods, if the basic grades were solid, one didn’t even need to consider them.\nMaybe I should really start looking for tutoring or a private academy... I was lost in thought for a moment.\n“Han-gyeol, what are you thinking about?”\nSuddenly, I heard Eun-ha’s voice from behind.\n“Huh! When did you come next to me?”\n“As soon as the teacher left. Anyway, were you lost in thought? How was your exam?”\n“Yeah, the time was a bit tight for me. I don’t think I scored very high.”\nEun-ha looked genuinely surprised, her eyes widening.\n“Oh...! I see. Don’t be too disheartened, you know? Korean language is a subject where grades don’t just suddenly shoot up.”\n“I’m not that upset, really. Planning to check your answers? Let’s go have lunch afterward.”\n“How about we skip that and grab your favorite pork cutlet instead?”\nWas she trying to cheer me up? But I wasn’t even that upset in the first place.\n“Eun-ha, you don’t have to worry. I’m really fine.”\n“I just felt like having pork cutlet, that’s all.”\n“Hmm, what’s for lunch today?”\n“Mini rice balls and udon.”\n‘Not particularly enticing.’\n“Let’s go for the pork cutlet.”\n“Let’s check our answers first since the class president will bring the answer key. Then we can head out.”\n“Sounds good. See you in a bit.”\n“Sure.”\nAs soon as Eun-ha returned to her spot, the class president brought the answer sheet.\n“Hey guys, I’ll stick the answers on the blackboard. Check yours out~”\nGlancing at the paper pinned to the board, I was curious about my scores, but anticipated that they wouldn’t be great, so I looked away. If I did worse than expected, the disappointment might affect tomorrow’s test too.\n-Ugh, I totally messed up.\n-Wait, this is the answer for number 3? Why?\n-Yeah, that’s right for number 3. But the choices were so confusing.\n-Wow, this was seriously the hardest test ever...\nBut as sighs and exasperated comments filled the room, my anxiety grew. Eventually, unable to resist my curiosity, I pulled out my test paper from my bag and started marking.\nSince everyone said it was tough, the grade cutoffs might be a bit lenient.\nTaking that into account, I marked my answers. To my dismay, I got two more questions wrong than I’d thought. Based on my score, third grade seemed close enough.\n“This is not good. It’s lower than I thought.”\nI shouldn’t have marked it. I should’ve just ignored it. Seemed like humans were bound to repeat their mistakes.\n“Han-gyeol, did you finish checking your answers?”\n“Yeah... but I think it was a mistake.”\n“Why...?! Did you get a lot wrong?”\n“I think I got one or two more questions wrong than I thought. This is tricky... but I hope I at least get a third grade...”\nAh, that was careless of me.\nI inadvertently let out a defeated sigh in front of Eun-ha.\nSeeing my dejection, Eun-ha looked utterly baffled. While her concerned glances were endearing, I felt bad for making her worry.\n“Han-gyeol! Let’s just go eat that pork cutlet!”\n“I’m not really upset, so don’t worry about it, Eun-ha. It was just a passing comment.”\n“Alright, let’s go, hurry.”\nI felt like I’d made Eun-ha unnecessarily anxious. There was another test tomorrow, and here I was, making a verbal blunder.\nI decided to show her a more spirited side before she went home.\n***\nUpon reaching the pork cutlet restaurant near the school, we ordered two servings of large pork cutlets.\nThe moment the sizeable cutlets were placed on the table, Eun-ha diligently began to cut the one in front of me.\nI found Eun-ha’s somewhat aggressive approach puzzling, but it didn’t take long for my curiosity to be satisfied.\nBefore I realized it, she had swiftly switched our plates.\n“Huh? Were you cutting it for me?”\n“Mhm. Enjoy. Now say ‘ah’.”\nEun-ha was making a genuine effort to lift my spirits.\nI wasn’t even that upset to begin with. Fearing any refusal might be misunderstood, I opened my mouth. Watching Eun-ha gently feed me, her expression was truly endearing.\n“How is it? Good?”\n“Yeah. Want me to feed you?”\nEun-ha energetically nodded and leaned slightly forward.\n“Say ‘ah’.”\n“Ah~”\nI, too, placed a piece of cutlet into Eun-ha’s mouth. Her face lit up with a contented smile as she continued to enjoy her meal.\nJust the act of eating with Eun-ha was enough to make the corners of my mouth twitch upwards. Thinking about her gestures to cheer me up, it all felt so cute. Ultimately, I found myself chuckling.\n“Han-gyeol laughed.”\nEun-ha pointedly noted the inadvertent chuckle that escaped me.\n“Huh?”\n“You haven’t laughed since we checked our tests earlier. This is the first time.”\n“I did?”\n“Yeah. Even when I suggested we eat pork cutlets, you didn’t smile.”\n“Do I usually burst into laughter when someone suggests pork cutlets?”\n“Not exactly. But you seemed slightly down.”\n“I see.”\nTo be honest, I was surprised.\nIt felt like she had seen right through me.\n“It’s a little astonishing. Quite intriguing.”\n“Do you feel better now?”\nIn response to Eun-ha’s question, I silently nodded.\n“Yeah, I feel better.”\n“That’s good. Let’s eat the pork cutlet with a happy heart. Do you want more? Should I buy some cold buckwheat noodles?”\n“No, I’m good. Thanks for cheering me up.”\n“It’s okay. You always lift my spirits whenever I’m down.”\n“Do I? Lately, you always seemed happy.”\n“That’s because of you, Han-gyeol. There’s always another test, so don’t get too down. Got it?”\nI was grateful for Eun-ha’s words of encouragement.\n“Yeah, I can ace the test tomorrow.”\n“Mhm. You look handsome when you smile.”\n“You’re quite generous with compliments today, aren’t you?”\n“It’s from the heart.”\n“You’re pretty too, Eun-ha. So cute.”\nAt that, Eun-ha burst into bright laughter.\n“Look how happy our Eun-ha gets when she’s complimented.”\n“How can I not like it when it’s from Han-gyeol?”\n“Really? Then I should do it more. You’re drop-dead gorgeous, Eun-ha. So beautiful.”\n“Don’t do it too often...!”\n“Why? Does it seem less genuine if I do it often?”\nUpon hearing that, Eun-ha shook her head vigorously.\n“It’s not that...”\n“Then why tell me not to do it frequently?”\n“Because if you do it too often... my face will turn red...”\nBefore Eun-ha could finish her sentence, I showered her with even more praises.\n“You’re so beautiful. The most beautiful in the world. I could just die from how cute you are.”\nEun-ha’s face started to slowly turn red with my constant praise.\nI seized the opportunity and continued to shower Eun-ha with compliments.\n“Eun-ha is pretty, cute, kind, considerate, and always does the sweetest things.”\n“Ah! Seriously...! Stop it, it’s embarrassing. Let’s just eat our pork cutlets. Pork cutlets!”\n“Even eating pork cutlets is cute. Eun-ha, say ’ah~’. I’ll feed you.”\nI picked up a piece of pork cutlet with a fork and brought it to Eun-ha’s mouth.\n“I can eat on my own.”\n“Your arm hurts.”\n“Oh, come on...!”\nHearing my excuse, Eun-ha quickly bit into the pork cutlet. Watching her chew with a pouting expression was just too endearing.\n“So cute.”\nAfter swallowing the pork cutlet with a gulp, Eun-ha still glared at me.\n“Just as you start to feel better, you tease me. So mischievous.”\n“You said you like seeing me smile.”\n“Yeah. I love seeing Han-gyeol smile.”\nEven though she might have refuted my claims in such a situation, Eun-ha continued to honestly express her feelings.\n“You’re seriously so adorable.”\n“Enough with the compliments! Let’s eat our pork cutlets.”\n“So cute.”\n“Didn’t I say let’s eat our pork cutlets?”\n“The cutest in the world.”\n“Ugh...! So embarrassing...!”\nFinally, Eun-ha put down her fork and covered her face with her hands.\n“Even covering your face is cute.”\n“Stop it-!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Alright, everyone has worked hard for the midterms. But don’t let your guard down too much, and prepare for the June mock exams intermittently~ That’s all. You can head home.”\nFinally, the midterms were over.\nI thought I did fairly well on the last exam.\nAbove all, my calculus score had improved significantly.\n“Eun-ha, now that exams are over, what will you do?”\nHarim, who was sitting next to me, asked.\nI answered while packing my bag.\n“I’m going to the amusement park with Han-gyeol.”\n“What, the amusement park?”\n“Yeah, why?”\n“Which amusement park are you headed to? Jamsil?”\n“Yes, it’s the closest one. Why?”\n“Nothing, just asking. Have fun!”\n“Thanks, Harim. You’ve worked hard too. See you tomorrow!”\nI slung my bag over my shoulder and headed straight to Han-gyeol’s seat.\nHan-gyeol was also packing up and waiting for me.\n“Should we eat in the cafeteria before going?”\n“We might buy snacks there, so let’s just head straight.”\n“Alright then, let’s go.”\n“Okay.”\nHan-gyeol and I left the school immediately.\nWe took the bus and arrived at the subway station.\nGoing to the amusement park with Han-gyeol.\nI couldn’t help but keep smiling.\n“You seem so happy?”\n“Yes. Exams are over and now we can fully enjoy our date.”\n“I’m happy too. But Eun-ha, are you good with rides?”\n“I handle all of them pretty well. What about you, Han-gyeol? Any you can’t take?”\n“I’m a bit scared of the Gyro Drop.”\n“Really?”\n“When it drops, it feels like my heart stops.”\n“Exactly! It feels like your heart will stop right before you hit the ground?”\n“That sense of not knowing when you’ll drop... it’s terrifying.”\n“Right, it gives you chills. But that’s the thrill. I’ve loved it since I was young.”\nHan-gyeol widened his eyes, staring at me intently.\n“Eun-ha, you’re scarier.”\n“Huh? Why?”\nI had a hard time grasping what he found so frightening.\nWe had booked our tickets online, so upon exiting at Jamsil Station, we headed straight for the entrance.\n“I hope it’s not crowded.”\n“True. Other schools have finished their exams too.”\nWe fervently hoped for fewer people as we took the escalator up.\n“Oh- Han-gyeol! It seems pretty empty, right?”\n“Indeed. We’ve hit the jackpot.”\nThe inside of the amusement park was quieter than expected. More people might arrive later, but for now, it was nearly vacant. This was no time to leisurely soak in the emptiness.\n“Han-gyeol! Let’s go on the flume ride, quick!”\n“Seems like we can take it slow, though?”\n“No way. We need to enjoy all the fun rides while it’s empty.”\n“You’re really in combat mode.”\n“Come on, let’s go. Hand!”\nI extended my hand, and Han-gyeol held it tightly. We made our way straight to the flume ride queue. Thankfully, the line wasn’t long. It looked like a 15-minute wait at most.\n“I’ve never seen it this empty before.”\n“After this, which ride should we try next?”\n“Let’s start indoors with the ‘French Revolution’ and ‘Pharaoh’s Wrath’. Afterward, we’ll head outside for ‘Atlantis’, ‘Gyro Drop’, and ‘Gyro Swing’. Then, back inside to grab some food.”\n“You seem super excited. Is it that fun?”\n“Yes, super fun. And it’s even better with you, Han-gyeol.”\nI hadn’t realized how exhilarating it would be to visit the amusement park with Han-gyeol. As we chatted and waited our turn, we soon found ourselves next in line.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll sit at the front, okay?”\n“You’ll get all wet. Eun-ha, you should sit at the back.”\n“The water will splash inside the boat anyway, right?”\n“I just don’t want my girlfriend to get wet.”\n“I don’t want my boyfriend to get wet either.”\n“Let’s be fair and decide with rock-paper-scissors.”\n“Ugh... fine. Let’s do it. Rock-paper-scissors!”\nI had scissors, and Han-gyeol had paper.\n“Yes! Han-gyeol, I’m taking the front, okay?”\n“Isn’t the winner supposed to sit at the back?”\n“Come on, accept your loss gracefully.”\nHan-gyeol nodded in understanding.\n“Next passengers, please board!”\n“Okay~”\nAs per the result, I took the front seat. There was still water inside the boat, but it was better than Han-gyeol getting wet.\n“Eun-ha, want to switch seats now?”\n“It’s fine. It’ll dry soon.”\nI couldn’t let Han-gyeol get wet again, especially after he got soaked because of me last time.\n“Please hold onto the handlebars. We’re starting~”\nWith the attendant’s announcement, the boat began to move forward. We slowly ascended the first incline.\n“Han-gyeol, I think we’re about to descend.”\n“No need to state the obvious.”\nAs Han-gyeol finished his sentence, the boat plummeted downwards. The drop was thrilling, but the first descent felt a tad underwhelming.\n“Shorter than expected, huh?”\n“The real thrill in the flume ride is the second drop. Here we go again.”\nNow, we ascended the second incline. The boat wobbled and then started tilting. In a flash, we were plummeting again. I shut my eyes tightly, enjoying the moment, but water splashed inside, soaking everything below my knees.\n“Eun-ha, did you get very wet?”\n“Yeah, but it’s okay. It’ll dry up quickly.”\nAfter exiting the flume ride, Han-gyeol handed me some tissues.\n“Thanks.”\n“Should’ve saved this ride for last.”\n“No way! It was super fun. Let’s go ride the French Revolution now.”\n“Alright, alright. Let’s do everything you want, Eun-ha. When was the last time you visited an amusement park?”\n“I can’t really remember... I think I was in the fifth grade of elementary school. Came with my family.”\n“Been 7 years, huh?”\n“Yeah. That’s why it’s so exciting.”\n“Alright then, let’s enjoy all the fun rides. Let’s hurry.”\nHan-gyeol quickly grasped my hand and led me to the next ride.\nToday, it felt like Han-gyeol was holding onto my hand a bit tighter than usual.\nMaybe he was relieved because the exams were over? Regardless, it made me feel good.\n***\nAfter riding the French Revolution and Pharaoh’s Wrath, we headed to a souvenir shop.\nThere were various headbands displayed, and I pondered over which one would suit Han-gyeol.\nUnlike me, without hesitation, Han-gyeol placed a white cat headband on my head.\n“You look cute.”\n“Ah- Then let’s get a black one for you.”\nI put a black cat headband on Han-gyeol. It complemented his expressionless face perfectly.\n“Han-gyeol, you look super cute.”\n“Eun-ha looks adorable too. Should we buy these?”\n“Mhm. We can wear them around.”\nAfter purchasing the headbands, we took several pictures in front of a full-length mirror. In the images, we both looked incredibly happy, enjoying the moment with bright smiles.\n“Can I use this as my profile picture?”\n“Yes, it came out really nice.”\n“Should we head out now?”\n“Eun-ha, are you hungry? Should we eat something?”\n“Hmm- Let’s ride the Gyro Drop, Gyro Swing, and Atlantis first, then eat.”\n“That sounds wise. It might be risky to eat and then go on the rides immediately.”\n“Just trust me. If Han-gyeol falls off in the middle, I’ll catch you!”\n“Very reassuring. Let’s go.”\nWe went outside and rode the Gyro Swing and Atlantis. Now, we planned to ride the Gyro Drop next, but Han-gyeol seemed a bit apprehensive.\n-Ahhhhhh Aaaaaaaaaa-\nHearing the screams of people and seeing the rapid descent of the ride made him freeze in place.\nI was grateful that he was doing this for me, but I didn’t want Han-gyeol to push himself because of me.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s ride the Gyro Drop some other time.”\n“There is no next time. It’s okay, let’s ride.”\n“Didn’t you say it seemed a bit scary earlier?”\n“I’d hate to see you ride alone more.”\n“We can come back and ride it next time!”\n“It’s been 7 years, right? Let’s ride together.”\nI was led by Han-gyeol’s hand onto the Gyro Drop.\nAs the safety bar lowered, the ride began its slow ascent into the sky.\nHan-gyeol, visibly tense, gripped my hand tightly.\n“Eun-ha, do you know how to perform CPR?”\n“I think I can, but why?”\n“You never know, I might need it...”\n“Don’t worry too much! You won’t die~. I’ll grip your hand even tighter.”\nI squeezed his hand reassuringly.\nThe brave effort Han-gyeol was making endeared him to me even more.\nSoon after, with a slight jolt, we reached the very top.\n“Ugh...”\n“Han-gyeol, don’t worry.”\n“Sorry, Eun-ha, can you not talk for now? I need to mentally prepare.”\n“Ugh- how can I time that? This ride is meant to drop suddenly.”\n“Sorry, I’m just curious when it will drop-!!!”\nBefore Han-gyeol could finish his sentence, the ride plummeted.\nMy hair shot up towards the sky while Han-gyeol’s grip on my hand tightened even more.\nSoon, our feet touched the ground, and a gust of wind spread in all directions.\n“Han-gyeol, are you alive?”\nI looked over at him, and he seemed utterly out of it.\nIt looked as if something white was gently escaping from Han-gyeol’s mouth.\n“Han-gyeol?!”\n“I can’t ride this again...”\n“Is your heart okay? Do you need CPR?”\n“I think I’m okay.”\n“Let’s go eat now.”\n“Let’s...”\nExiting the Gyro Drop, we made our way indoors.\nThere were numerous couples taking photos with a magical castle backdrop.\nCome to think of it, I have seen a lot of pictures taken here on social media.\nMy gaze inadvertently caught a couple capturing a photo with their lips locked.\nFor a moment, I sharply turned my gaze away.\nI had seen many photos of couples kissing...\nWould we... today?\nHolding hands had become somewhat natural for us, but hugging was still a bit shy and challenging.\nOf course, as students, we were clear about our boundaries. But I felt we hadn’t progressed beyond the initial stages of our relationship.\nWhile everyone’s comfort with physical intimacy varies, I thought a light peck would be acceptable for us at this stage.\nCurious if Han-gyeol felt the same, I sneakily glanced up at him.\nBut Han-gyeol still seemed to be recovering from the Gyro Drop’s adrenaline rush.\nStill, his lips came into my view.\nThey looked soft, incredibly soft.\n‘Oh no.’\nSuddenly, all I could see were Han-gyeol’s lips.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "We’d ridden every exciting ride at the amusement park.\nWithout any breaks, we had been on rides until hunger set in.\n“Should we get something to eat now, Eun-ha?”\n“What time is it? Are you very hungry, Han-gyeol?”\n“We skipped lunch, didn’t we? I’m kind of hungry.”\n“By the way, there must be a lot of people around when we eat and go home. Maybe we should just leave now?”\n“Now? That might be more comfortable, but are you okay, Eun-ha? You haven’t eaten anything.”\n“Yeah, I’m fine. I’d actually prefer to just eat at home.”\nJust imagining commuting during rush hour, especially on Line 2, sent shivers down my spine.\nIf we left now, we might not get to sit, but we could at least head back comfortably.\n“Let’s do that then. I am hungry, but it’s not like I need to eat right this second.”\n“Did I drag you around too much? Is there anything else you’d like to do?”\n“Not at all? I enjoyed the rides. In fact, I prefer going home after just the right amount of fun.”\n“Then let’s head home. You’re really okay with that?”\n“Let’s go.”\nIt was an extremely efficient date.\n“Then let’s go to my place. What should we have for dinner?”\n“What would you like, Eun-ha? I’ll make it for you.”\n“Really? Well... We both walked quite a bit, so let’s just order something.”\n“Since Eunwoo Hyung will be there, shall we ask him?”\n“Hmm... We can do that?”\nEun-ha’s response was noncommittal.\nCouldn’t we just call and ask?\n“Isn’t he home?”\n“I’m not sure. Let’s just take the subway.”\nI was slightly skeptical, but we left the amusement park and immediately boarded the subway.\nAfter riding the subway for about an hour, we found ourselves waiting at a bus stop.\nThere, we eagerly made up for all the conversations we couldn’t have while on the subway car.\n“Today was so much fun, Han-gyeol. It was short, but we really rode everything there was to ride.”\n“Right? There weren’t many people around. It seems like everything just goes smoothly when I’m with you, Eun-ha.”\n“Really? Then stick with me every day, and you might even win the lottery.”\n“Want to try picking six numbers from 1 to 45?”\n“Aren’t we too young to buy lottery tickets?”\n“Oh, right.”\nI used to buy one every week in my old life.\n“What would you do if you won the lottery, Eun-ha?”\n“Me? Hmm... I’ve never really thought about it. How much are we talking about?”\n“Maybe about 1.5 billion won after taxes?”\nEun-ha seemed to ponder my question for a moment.\n“Then I’d buy a house and save the rest.”\n“Where would you buy a house?”\n“I don’t need to be in Seoul. I like our neighborhood just fine.”\n“Don’t you want to do anything else?”\n“It’d be nice to travel all over the place with Han-gyeol, wouldn’t it?”\n“Will you be sponsoring our travel expenses?”\n“Just trust your Noona.”\nAt Eun-ha’s words, I burst out laughing with a snicker.\n“What about you, Han-gyeol? What do you want to do?”\n“Me? Well, I think I’d do the same as Eun-ha, buy a house. Our neighborhood is nice, but I’d prefer if my work was close to home. And to be honest, I’d like to buy a car. Not a Porsche or Ferrari, but just a new car. And the rest, I’d probably save, like Eun-ha. Or maybe invest in a small commercial building or studio apartment for retirement? Though that might not be enough, right?”\nAs I rambled on, Eun-ha couldn’t help but laugh.\n“Why so specific?”\n“Dreams need to be specific to come true.”\n“That’s true. Oh- Han-gyeol, you’ve chapped lips.”\nEun-ha, exchanging gazes with me, let her eyes fall to my lips.\n“Really? Hold on, I have lip balm in my bag.”\n“Wait. I also have it. Let me apply it for you. Come here.”\nSuddenly, Eun-ha grabbed my head and applied her lip balm to my lips. Her face came so unexpectedly close that I was momentarily startled, but she calmly went on applying it as if it was nothing.\nThis was practically an indirect kiss... but she seemed unfazed by the implication.\n“Han-gyeol, that should do it.”\n“Thanks. Was it that bad?”\n“A little? Ah- but this one’s tinted.”\n“Eh? So my lips are red now?”\n“Not red, more like a subtle cherry color?”\n“Oh, right.”\nWhat was going on? It felt like something huge just happened.\nWas I overthinking a simple act of applying lip balm?\nProbably, right?\n“Ah! The bus is here. Let’s get on.”\nEun-ha stood up from the bus stop bench.\nShe casually waved her hand a few times towards the road.\nEven after we got on the bus, I couldn’t help but ponder over Eun-ha’s actions.\nWas that flirting?\nOr was I just reading too much into it?\nThese nagging questions, I wanted to leave them on the bus, but instead, I dragged them all the way to Eun-ha’s house.\nNo one was home when we took off our shoes and entered.\n“Nobody’s here?”\n“I texted my brother on the bus; he said he’d be home in about an hour.”\nThis was awkward. Memories of the last time just Eun-ha and I were alone in her house flashed in my mind.\n“Han-gyeol, what do you want to order? Chicken? Pizza?”\n“I’m actually feeling more like pizza than chicken.”\n“Any particular pizza you’re craving?”\nEun-ha’s behavior was the same as always.\nEven the act of applying lip balm to my lips probably didn’t carry any special meaning.\nConsidering Eun-ha’s thoughtfulness, it was likely just a kind gesture.\nBut what had changed was my own feelings.\nEver since that moment, my gaze kept drifting to Eun-ha’s lips.\nA kiss? The thought hadn’t crossed my mind would be a lie.\nIf one asked if I wanted to, I’d nod vigorously without hesitation.\nYet, the reason I hadn’t done it was all about ‘the atmosphere’.\nThey say the atmosphere is important for a first kiss, but I couldn’t quite grasp what that atmosphere should be.\nThe first kiss with Eun-ha would surely be a memory to recall until my dying day.\nSurely, she would feel the same.\nThat was why I didn’t want it to be just a clumsy memory.\nI wanted it to happen at the right moment, with the right atmosphere.\n“Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah, personally, I like potato pizza.”\n“Got it, potato pizza it is.”\n“Ah, and is it okay to ask Eunwoo Hyung if he could bring it as a takeout?”\n“Um, that might be better. I’ll change clothes and call him. Just relax on the couch for a bit.”\nEun-ha went into her room, and I flopped down onto the sofa with a sigh.\nIt was a big trouble.\nA house where I was alone with my girlfriend.\nIt couldn’t be more perfect as a place for a first kiss.\nNo, wait.\nI shouldn’t be thinking like this.\nI tried to quiet the turmoil in my head as I waited for Eun-ha.\n“Han-gyeol, you should change into something comfortable too.”\n“Uh? I always feel bad borrowing clothes from Eunwoo Hyung.”\n“Why don’t you just leave some comfortable clothes here from now on?”\n“Doesn’t it seem like I come over to your place too often?”\n“Hmm... Maybe? But my family likes having you over.”\n“Aren’t they worried about us being alone?”\n“Not at all. Mom says she feels relieved when you’re here with me instead of me being alone.”\n...To think they trust me that much.\nI should live up to that trust, yet my gaze still drifts to Eun-ha’s lips.\nThis was really a problem.\nI wished Eunwoo Hyung would hurry up.\n“When did you say Eunwoo Hyung is coming?”\n“He said about an hour. He’ll bring the pizza too, so it won’t take much longer.”\n“I see.”\n‘Can’t he get here a bit faster?’\n“Ah, while we’re on the subject, let’s just keep a toothbrush for you in the bathroom.”\n“No, it’s fine. I’ll just carry a portable toothbrush set.”\n“You can’t always bring your bag with you. Hang on to the clothes...!”\nEun-ha brought me a tracksuit set from Eunwoo Hyung’s room.\n“Change into this.”\n“Okay. Sorry for the trouble every time.”\n“Don’t be. My brother was even considering buying a tracksuit for you.”\n“Really? That’s very kind of him.”\n“It’s because you’ve been so good to me and my family, Han-gyeol. Don’t feel burdened.”\n“Alright. I’ll be back in a flash.”\nI quickly changed and, as I came out, I bumped into Eun-ha heading to the bathroom.\n“Wow- you changed fast. Come and see. This is your toothbrush.”\nNext to her family’s toothbrushes, a new pink one had been added.\n“A pink toothbrush?”\n“That was the only spare one we had.”\n“It’s fine. I don’t mind at all. I’ll use it well.”\nAs I was about to check out my toothbrush, I realized Eun-ha hadn’t left the bathroom.\n“I’m going to brush my teeth.”\n“Brushing? We didn’t eat anything, did we?”\n“Just feel a bit stale in the mouth. You wanna brush too?”\n“Brush my teeth?”\n“Yeah, brush.”\nIt was a bit odd, but carried by the momentum, we stood side by side and brushed our teeth.\nWe each squeezed toothpaste onto our brushes and brushed in a somewhat awkward silence.\nKeep it together.\nWhat’s there to be embarrassed about brushing teeth together?\nAfter three short minutes of brushing, I was the first to rinse my mouth.\nEun-ha followed, lightly holding the back of her hair as she rinsed, her neckline revealed in the process was subtly seductive, and I had to look away.\nI hung up my toothbrush without a word, puzzled by the unexpected shift in the atmosphere.\nUnable to bear the awkward silence any longer, I broke it.\n“I’ll need to reapply lip balm after brushing.”\n“What kind of lip balm do you use, Han-gyeol?”\n“Me? Just the most common type... the sky-blue one.”\n“Doesn’t that have any color?”\n“Nope. It doesn’t.”\n“I want to try yours.”\n“Okay? Take a seat on the sofa.”\nI pulled out the sky-blue lip balm from my bag.\nEun-ha sat obediently on the sofa, slightly pursing her lips.\n“I’ll apply it.”\n“Okay.”\nI twisted off the cap and carefully brought my lip balm to Eun-ha’s lips.\nWith extreme caution, I stroked her lips with the balm, back and forth.\nI never realized it before, but applying lip balm to someone else’s lips was an intensely shy endeavor.\nEun-ha must have felt the same.\nFor a brief moment, my hand trembled with a thrill intense enough to form beads of sweat.\nMy heart started to pound faster, and Eun-ha’s cheeks were slowly turning rosy.\nIn this space where only the two of us existed, our breathing was the only sound.\nOur faces were so close, that our breaths touched each other’s skin. My gaze kept drifting back to Eun-ha’s lips, which seemed irresistibly soft.\nEven after I had finished applying it, Eun-ha kept her eyes closed.\nIt was a sensation I had never experienced before, unlearned and undefined.\nBut I was certain.\nThe atmosphere for a first kiss was now.\nSo I just put my lips on Eun-ha’s.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The moment Han-gyeol’s lips touched mine, I froze in place.\nBut as I felt the softness of Han-gyeol’s lips, my stiff body began to relax gradually.\nWhen Han-gyeol gently grasped my chin, I found myself lightly holding his waist in return.\nKissing the one you love was an incredibly joyous act.\nDespite it being an improbable thought, it felt as if I could feel Han-gyeol’s warmth even more now than when we hugged.\nEventually, our lips parted.\n“Eun-ha, aren’t you going to open your eyes?”\nDespite Han-gyeol’s gentle voice, I kept my eyes shut.\nI was too embarrassed, and my heart was pounding too hard for me to look directly into Han-gyeol’s eyes.\n“Does it feel lacking?”\n“No! It’s more than enough...!”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I snapped my eyes open.\nIf we kissed any longer, I feared my heart might literally burst – ‘bang!’\nBut Han-gyeol’s lips were already so close, almost upon me again.\nIn a panic, I jerked my head back and tumbled down beneath the sofa.\n“Argh!”\n“Are you okay?”\n“Ouch... That hurts...”\nHan-gyeol grabbed my fallen arm and pulled with all his might.\nBack on the sofa, I stared intently into Han-gyeol’s face.\nHe grinned broadly and gave me another quick kiss on the cheek.\n“I love you.”\nI fiddled with my cheek where Han-gyeol’s lips had been.\nI didn’t want to lose this vivid sensation that lingered.\nI slowly narrowed the gap between us, still on the sofa.\n“I love you too.”\n“Yeah. I know.”\n“So this time, I want to be the one who goes first.”\n“Huh...?! But you just said it was enough-!”\n“That was a lie.”\nI quickly pressed my lips against Han-gyeol’s.\nAfter winding my arms around his neck, I kissed him, longer than before, enveloping myself in the scent of his shampoo. When I grew accustomed to the fragrance, I slowly pulled away.\n“Eun-ha, if we keep this up, my heart might just burst.”\n“Me too. It’s incredibly embarrassing.”\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah?”\n“No, I mean... I just really like you.”\nHan-gyeol, seemingly bashful, scratched the back of his neck as he spoke. I wanted to hear more of his awkward love confession. So, I threw a cheesy, all-too-common question his way.\n“How much do you like me?”\n“Just wait. I’ll come up with a creative answer.”\n“Really? I’ll be looking forward to it.”\n“Isn’t ‘as much as the sky and the ground’ just too cliché?”\n“Yeah, skip that one. Try something else.”\n“Um... How about twice as much as you like me?”\n“What-?! That’s more cliché!”\nAlthough I put on a dissatisfied face, Han-gyeol countered.\n“So how much do you like me, Eun-ha?”\n“Half as much as you like me, why-!”\nAt my shout, Han-gyeol smiled and quickly kissed my forehead.\n“I like you enough to want to kiss you all day.”\nMy face heated up at Han-gyeol’s words.\n“Eun-ha, I want to see your childhood photos. Can you show me?”\n“Childhood photos? I was so chubby back then, it’s a bit embarrassing.”\n“The more you say that, the more I want to see them.”\n“Just wait. I’ll go get the album from my room.”\nI returned to the living room, album in hand, from the bookshelf in my room.\nI hesitated to hand it over to Han-gyeol, who looked eagerly expectant.\n“Promise you won’t laugh?”\n“Yeah, I won’t laugh. Show me already.”\n“You’re lying. You’ll definitely laugh, Han-gyeol.”\n“I’ll try my best to hold it in. Come on, show me. I’m curious about the young Eun-ha.”\n“Fine...”\nAs I handed over the album, Han-gyeol began flipping through it, one page at a time, gazing at the photos of my childhood with such fondness.\n“How old were you here?”\n“Ah- this was when I was in kindergarten.”\n“You look cute in the yellow kindergarten uniform, like a little chick.”\n“Don’t my cheeks look weird though? They’re so puffy. My brother used to tease me, calling me a steamed bun.”\n“It’s nothing but cute. So cute, I almost want to bite them.”\nHan-gyeol kept his gaze fixed on the younger me in the album.\nAt some point, he became silent, just looking at the pictures.\n“Really, it’s just too cute.”\n“Which picture is that cute? Let me see.”\n“This one. You’re clutching a doll and sitting on the floor crying.”\n“Eek-! Give it back now! That’s such an embarrassing photo-!”\nAs I tried to snatch the album away, Han-gyeol quickly lifted it out of my reach.\n“No way, no way. I have to see Eun-ha’s childhood like this.”\n“Argh-! No! There might be more weird photos.”\n“Eun-ha is adorable no matter what she’s doing, it’s all good.”\n“Give it here-! Hand it over-!”\nAs Han-gyeol tried to snatch away the album, I leaned forward, and my body tipped.\nI ended up falling right into Han-gyeol’s chest, my face buried in it.\n“If you wanted a hug, you could’ve just said so. You didn’t need to stage an accident—I would’ve hugged you anyway.”\n“Ugh... an accident, huh.”\n“Are you not going to get up?”\nDespite his words, I didn’t rise from Han-gyeol’s embrace. Instead, I pressed my ear against his heart.\n“Yeah. I want to take this chance to listen to Han-gyeol’s heartbeat.”\n“Uh-uh-?! That’s really embarrassing.”\n“Stay still. I won’t listen for long...”\nThump-thump-thump—Han-gyeol’s heart was beating wildly. It felt like his heartbeat was telling me how much he loved me.\n“Is your heart going to burst?”\n“When I’m holding you, Eun-ha, it’s always like this.”\n“Hehe... that’s nice.”\nHis heart was thumping even louder than the time I had accidentally hugged him before.\n“What’s so nice?”\n“I really like you, Han-gyeol. Look at me.”\nI slowly lifted my head to meet Han-gyeol’s gaze. Seeing his face turn a deep shade of red, I subtly shifted my position.\nI propped myself next to Han-gyeol, who was lying on the sofa, supporting my upper body with my hand. My long hair curtained us off from the world, leaving Han-gyeol with no view but into my eyes.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\nStill gazing at Han-gyeol’s lips, which looked so soft and inviting, I asked,\n“...Can we kiss just one more time?”\nIn response to my question, Han-gyeol said nothing.\nTaking his silence as consent, I cautiously leaned in toward Han-gyeol’s lips. Just as I was pushing my hair back to kiss him...\nBeep-beep-beep-beep-!\nThe untimely sound of the door lock interrupted us, and I quickly pulled away from Han-gyeol. He too sat up hurriedly from the couch. In a fluster, we both got up and headed to the front door.\n“Did you come out all this way to greet me?”\nMy brother was standing there, taking off his shoes, with two pizza boxes in his hand.\n“You got here faster than I thought.”\n“I couldn’t let our Han-gyeol wait too long for pizza.”\n‘This annoying bastard.’\n‘Why does he have to show up so fast just at times like this?’\n‘I was having such a good moment with Han-gyeol-!’\nI felt a twinge of irritation.\n“Ah, Hyung. Give me the pizza.”\n“As expected Han-gyeol is the only one constant. But what’s wrong? Are you sick?”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“Your face is all red.”\n“Oh, it’s just a bit warm inside the house.”\n“Is it? Hey, Shin Eun-ha. Han-gyeol’s feeling hot. Don’t you manage the temperature?”\nI felt like punching the smug look off my brother’s face.\n“You look after yourself.”\n“Eh? Now that I look at you, you’re pretty red too. Did you and Han-gyeol kiss or something?”\nHis words were flippant, but Han-gyeol and I froze on the spot.\nDuring that brief silence, my brother seemed to catch on to something and irritatingly curled his lips upward.\n“Ahwahaha-! Just kidding! A joke! Anyone would think you two actually kissed!”\nAt my brother’s words, Han-gyeol hurriedly objected.\n“No, not at all-! It was just a surprise because of what you suddenly said.”\n“Right~? Even though you clearly knew I was coming, it wouldn’t happen, right~?”\n“Ye-yes, of course-! Kissing while alone at home? That’s absurd. The pizza smells great, though!”\n“Alright. I’ll go change my clothes and come out, so Eun-ha, you set the table, okay?”\n“Okay.”\n“I’ll take my time changing.”\n“Hyung-!”\nMy brother then went straight to his room and closed the door behind him.\n“We’re definitely caught...”\nI approached Han-gyeol, who was looking a bit disheartened.\n“It doesn’t really matter. We’re a couple after all. It’s my brother who’s oblivious.”\nThen, I pulled Han-gyeol’s head down and planted a quick peck on his lips.\n“I’ll set the pizza, so you just sit on the sofa, Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah... Okay.”\nJust as I was about to take the pizza from Han-gyeol, my brother came out of his room.\n“I said I’d be slow, but came out quickly instead!”\n“Be quiet...!”\n“Ah~ I thought I’d witness an interesting sight~ What a pity.”\nMy brother raised his eyebrows as he passed by Han-gyeol and me. He headed straight to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and grabbed a bottle of water to drink. But then, his gaze suddenly dropped to beneath the table, and he let out a shocking statement.\n“Mom. What are you doing hiding there?”\nHan-gyeol and my eyes widened, and we rushed to the kitchen.\n“Mom’s here?!”\n“Was Aunty actually here?!”\nI hurried to check under the table, but Mom wasn’t there.\n“Puhahahahaha-! Mom’s at work! You two really did something while I was gone, huh?!”\n“You... you crazy jerk-!”\nI threw a punch right into my brother’s gut.\n“Die! Just die quickly!”\n“Ouch-! Hey, it really hurts! I think you hit a bone! Seriously, it’s painful! Han-gyeol-! Save me!”\nIf it were the usual Han-gyeol, he might have helped my brother, but today he was completely on my side.\n“Eun-ha! Hit more! Hit the same spot again!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It was the day midterm exam report cards were distributed.\nFor that reason, Eun-ha had scheduled a consultation with Hyun-joo Noona after school today.\n“Han-gyeol, could you come with me to see Hyun-joo unnie? I’m a bit scared of her.”\nEun-ha seemed slightly anxious about the meeting with Hyun-joo Noona.\n“Really? I thought Hyun-joo Noona was your kindest cousin.”\n“She’s also a strict tutor... My math scores have gone up, but not by much, so I’m a bit nervous.”\n“If Hyun-joo Noona is okay with it, I’ll come, but if she’s even a little uncomfortable, it might be better for you to go alone.”\n“…You’re right, aren’t you? Just a moment? I need to call her.”\nEun-ha quickly took out her phone and called Hyun-joo Noona.\nHonestly, I wanted to accompany her if Eun-ha wished for it, but I thought that might be a bit presumptuous.\nIf it was a meeting between a tutor and her student, it was proper for me not to intrude.\n“Unnie, can I come with Han-gyeol? Yes, yes. Oh- it’s okay? Then I’ll come with Han-gyeol. We’ll be there in about 10 minutes. Okay. We’ll hurry!”\nClick-\nEun-ha hung up the phone with a flush of relief on her face.\nIt seemed Hyun-joo Noona had given her permission.\n“Han-gyeol, Unnie said it’s okay-! Let’s go together.”\n“But will anything change just because I come along?”\n“Just having Han-gyeol by my side makes me feel calmer.”\n“Then I’m glad. Let’s go. Where are we meeting?”\n“We agreed to meet at a cafe. It won’t take long.”\nWalking a bit further with Eun-ha, we arrived at the cafe where Hyun-joo Noona was.\nHyun-joo Noona was engrossed in something on her laptop at a corner table.\n“Unnie-! We’re here.”\n“Ah, you’ve arrived? What would you like to drink? I’ll buy it for you. Han-gyeol, you choose too.”\n“Thank you so much. I’ll have an orange ade, please.”\n“I’ll have the same as Han-gyeol.”\n“I’ll give you my card, so go ahead. I was working on an assignment.”\n“Okay.”\nI received the card from Hyun-joo Noona and headed to the counter.\nI could have gone alone, but Eun-ha followed behind me.\n“Han-gyeol, doesn’t Hyun-joo Unnie seem a bit angry?”\n“Did she? She seemed the same as usual to me.”\n“Maybe it’s just my imagination? Ugh- It’s a bit scary.”\n“Don’t worry too much. It’s not like your grades dropped or anything.”\nI patted Eun-ha’s head to reassure her.\nWe returned with our drinks and sat down, and Hyun-joo Noona closed her laptop. She then started speaking with a bright smile.\n“Now, let’s take a look at our lovely Eun-ha’s report card, shall we?”\n“That... Well, my math grades have improved! Including calculus!”\n“Wow, really? Did you get an A?”\n“That... I got an A in probability and statistics...”\n“Is that so? If you’re better at statistics, why don’t you just choose that for the CSAT* instead of calculus?”\n“When I said I’d study the full range of statistics, I thought calculus might be better.”\n“Really? Well, we should look at the other subjects too, so can you show me the report card?”\n“The other subjects too...?”\n“Of course.”\nEun-ha cautiously handed over her report card.\nHyun-joo Noona unfolded it and read through the details with her eyes.\n“Eun-ha always gets an A in Korean. As you said, your math has improved significantly...but let’s aim for A’s in both subjects in the final exams.”\n“Yes...!”\n“Your social studies subjects are okay too, but especially work harder on the ones that overlap with the CSAT subjects. Got it?”\n“Yes~”\nHyun-joo Noona returned the report card to Eun-ha, who happily stashed it in her bag, clearly relieved to have gotten through the ordeal. She was adorably triumphant.\n“Now, shall we take a look at Han-gyeol’s grades as well?”\n“Mine? I just came along with Eun-ha.”\n“Oh, I’m not forcing you. It’s just pure curiosity. If it makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to show me.”\n“Ah! I didn’t mean to say I minded. Just a moment, please. I’ll show you right away.”\n“Oh~ Looks like you did well on your tests?”\n“Not really, but...!”\nI showed my report card to Hyun-joo Noona, just like Eun-ha did. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even shown it to Eun-ha before.\n“Well, let’s see. Hmm- Korean is a B?”\n“You’ve hit the sore spot...”\n“What?! Wait...! Aside from Korean, you’ve nearly got all A’s?!”\n“What-?! Really? Han-gyeol has almost all A’s except for Korean?”\n“Well, it’s not final yet, there are still performance evaluations and finals to go.”\n“But for now, it’s A’s, isn’t it?”\n“Well, for now, yes.”\nBoth Hyun-joo Noona and Eun-ha gaped at me with their mouths agape.\n“How did Han-gyeol do on the March mock exam?”\n“Ah, the March mock exam? I got a B in Korean and A’s in Math and English. But I didn’t study much for the Social Studies... they’re pretty low. Embarrassingly so.”\nIt wasn’t long since I’d entered this novel’s world, so Social Studies were around C’s and D’s.\nTherefore, my goal for the June mock exam was a B in Korean and A’s in Social Studies.\nHonestly, I was confident in Social Studies, but not so much in Korean.\n“Even with these internal grades, you seem set to do well on the June mock exam. Even your math scores are perfect...”\n“What-?! Perfect? I heard that was rare!”\n“Ah, Math has always been my strong suit. This time the scope was narrow, and I got lucky.”\n“Still... This isn’t just about being confident... Could it be that you’re aiming for the Social Studies?”\n“No. I am decidedly in favor of the liberal arts.”\n“But with a B in Korean...?”\n“Indeed, it’s a painful irony.”\nHyun-joo Noona handed the report card back to me.\n“If you just get a grip on Korean, you could really be perfect. Could aim for straight A’s, couldn’t you?”\n“I don’t think I’m quite there yet. Still, I plan to look into tutoring or a cram school for Korean. I thought I worked hard, but a B seems to be my limit.”\n“Now that I think about it, Han-gyeol, you studied on your own, right? To achieve this much alone is impressive.”\n“Ah- Noona. Can’t you tutor Han-gyeol in Korean?”\n“That’s not possible. I majored in Math, remember? I’m not confident in Korean myself. It’s been a while since I studied it.”\n“Then, do you know anyone who could tutor Han-gyeol in Korean?”\n“Hmm- there might be someone, but I’m not sure if they have a spot available.”\n“Can’t you ask for me?”\nEun-ha was actively trying to find me a tutor.\n“Eun-ha, it’s okay. I can look for one myself.”\n“But you know it’s better to get a recommendation from someone you know. And you might not have much time to look around.”\n“That’s true. But I feel like I’m imposing too much.”\n“Don’t worry about it. It’s no trouble at all. I’ll ask around like Eun-ha suggested. But really, I’m surprised. I didn’t know you were doing this well. You studied incredibly hard, huh?”\nBack when I was working outside of this novel world, as someone in the liberal arts, I would often have to perform Newton-Raphson methods or statistical calculations.\nI also kept up with my English studies consistently, not neglecting it for reasons like TOEIC or business trips.\nI never knew that life outside would be so helpful here.\n“Thank you for the compliment.”\n“Anyway, I’ll look into it and get back to you soon.”\n“Thank you so much for your concern.”\n“Don’t mention it~ You’re Eun-ha’s boyfriend, after all. I ought to do this much. So, do you have any departments in mind you’re aiming for?”\nIn my previous life, I worked in valuation.\nBut contrary to what I had thought, there was no great sense of achievement.\nIt was incredibly busy, and it was hard to call it a life of my own.\nIt was a repetitive daily grind, almost mechanical.\nThat was why, in this life, I wanted to live a little differently.\n“I haven’t thought of anything definite yet.”\nAfter all, even in my previous life, I only needed a stable job; it wasn’t the career I truly wanted.\n“Really? That’s unexpected.”\n“But I’d like to go to the same university as Eun-ha.”\n“Huh?”\n“It might sound too childish to others, but I think spending four years at the same school as Eun-ha would make for lasting memories. I want to stick with her throughout university just like now. Ah- but I’ll have to serve in the military at some point, so campus life together would be about two years. Anyway, I really want to go to the same university as Eun-ha.”\nHearing my words, Hyun-joo Noona smiled warmly.\n“I hope it turns out exactly that way. You two haven’t eaten yet, have you? I’ll buy you dinner. What do you want to eat?”\n“What do you feel like eating, Eun-ha?”\nI asked Eun-ha about the menu, but she seemed lost in thought.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Ah- Yes! Sorry. What did you say?”\n“Hyun-joo Noona is offering to buy us dinner. What shall we eat?”\n“Oh- Really? I’m good with anything. What do you want to eat, Han-gyeol?”\n“Hmm- I feel like pasta today.”\n“I like pasta too.”\nThinking about it, I realized we hadn’t often eaten Western food together.\nI wanted to take this opportunity to find out which Western dishes Eun-ha liked.\nBesides, pasta wasn’t too expensive, so there was no need to burden Hyun-joo Noona.\n“Alright. Then let’s go for Western food. I know a place.”\n“I’ll gratefully accept.”\n“Don’t mention it~ You did well on your exams, so I should at least do this. Let’s finish our drinks and head out.”\n“Ah- Okay.”\n“Yes.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: CSAT: The CSAT in South Korea is a major test for high school students.

Oh, it’s nothing.”\nThis was a moment to celebrate and be proud of.\nI should have been cheering for better success.\nHowever, I couldn’t forget the emotion that had briefly flared up in my heart.\nJust harboring that feeling made me despise myself.\nI found relief in the fact that Han-gyeol was weak in Korean.\nThe idea that Han-gyeol might not soar high brought peace to my heart.\nI couldn’t be honest with Han-gyeol about these feelings.\nEven to me, they were contemptible emotions.\nEven the kind-hearted Han-gyeol wouldn’t be able to accept these feelings of mine.\nHe might find it creepy if his girlfriend had such thoughts.\nIf the situation were reversed, Han-gyeol would have genuinely congratulated me.\nHe would have supported me to soar even higher.\nKnowing this made me dislike myself even more.\nI also loathed myself for testing Han-gyeol’s feelings in this way.\n“Han-gyeol, what would you do if I went to study abroad?”\nAs we walked down the corridor, Han-gyeol’s steps halted.\nHe turned to me in shock and said,\n“You’re studying abroad?! Where? When are you going and coming back?!”\n“No, no! I’m just asking what you’d think if I did.”\n“I’d like to follow you... but realistically, that would be impossible, right?”\n“Yeah, yeah. What if I went abroad alone?”\nTesting waters like this...\nI really hated this side of me.\n“How long will you be gone?”\n“About a year...?”\n“Hmm - you should go.”\n“Really? If Han-gyeol told me not to go, I might not go.”\n“It’s for your studies. How could I stop you?”\nAs expected, Han-gyeol replied without a moment’s hesitation.\nHis kindness stood in stark contrast to my own thoughts.\n‘I guess I’m still just a child at heart.’\n“I see. Just thought I’d ask.”\n“That’s not like you, Eun-ha. Is something up?”\n“No, no. I’m just nervous about a meeting with the teacher.”\n“Ah, right, today’s your day? Then mine must be tomorrow. I’m a bit nervous too.”\nThe consultations were happening during lunchtime, based on the March mock exam and midterm grades.\nI was number 17, scheduled for today, and Han-gyeol, number 18, was for tomorrow.\n“Yeah, yeah. I should go now.”\n“Okay. I’ll head back to the classroom. Have a good session.”\n“Okay. See you later~”\nI parted ways with Han-gyeol in the hallway and headed to the staff room.\n“Ah, Eun-ha, you’re here? Take a seat here.”\nThe teacher pushed a small stool chair towards me.\nAs I sat down, the teacher reviewed my March mock exam and midterm grades.\n“Eun-ha... Right. You’ve been managing your grades since the first year, but you said you made some mistakes in the March mock exam?”\n“Yes... I got a bit mentally shaken after the math test, and it affected my performance in other subjects.”\n“Hmm - I see. In the real exam, even if you do poorly in one subject, you need to quickly forget about it and regain your composure. Got it?”\n“Yes, yes.”\nThe teacher didn’t have much to say about my grades.\n“Eun-ha, are you planning to apply to universities mostly through the holistic admissions process?”\n“I’m thinking of splitting it half and half between holistic and academic admissions.”\n“It looks like you could meet the minimum grade requirements. Have you considered essay-based admissions?”\n“Ah... I had initially planned for holistic and academic, so I haven’t really looked into essay-based admissions.”\n“I see. Your student record management seems fine so far. It’s a pity you’re not in the broadcasting club for a film studies application...”\n“I... did apply, but I didn’t get in.”\n“Oh - I see. Sorry about that. Still, you’ve done a lot related to film through the library. Good job. Let’s talk again after the June mock exam. Any other questions?”\nI wasn’t sure if it was okay to ask this, but I cautiously broached the subject.\n“Um... Do you think I could get into the same university as Han-gyeol?”\n“Hm? Han-gyeol? You want to go to the same university as your boyfriend?”\n“Ah...! No, I... I was just wondering...! What do you think?”\nThe teacher smiled at my question.\n“Hm - I can’t give specifics, but it seems like a bit of a reach for you, Eun-ha.”\n“Is that so? Ah, no more questions then.”\n“We’re done a bit early. I might as well do Han-gyeol’s consultation today too. Could you call him for me?”\n“Ah, yes, of course. Thank you.”\n“Alright~”\nI bowed and left the staff room.\nEntering the classroom, I found Han-gyeol studying at his desk, diligently working amidst the noisy room.\nI felt increasingly sorry for Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Huh? You’re back early. Did it go well?”\n“Yeah, it was fine. We finished early, so the teacher said you could have your consultation today. You should go to the staff room now.”\n“Oh, really? Then I’ll be back soon. Just relax here.”\n“Okay. See you soon.”\nHan-gyeol got up and headed towards the staff room.\nGlancing at his desk, I noticed he had been studying Korean even in these short moments.\nWatching Han-gyeol relentlessly advance was impressive, but it made me feel like he was drifting away from me.\nI knew I had to work hard too, but why did these negative thoughts keep surfacing?\nInstead of dwelling on this, I should have been studying hard like Han-gyeol, but I just couldn’t focus on my studies.\n***\nI desperately wanted to shake off the tangled feelings inside me.\nBut I had no idea how to let them go.\n“Eun-ha, I’ll study at home today.”\nTo my dismay, Han-gyeol said he would study separately today.\nIt seemed harder to shake these thoughts alone, but I couldn’t interfere.\nIt was right to focus on rational and objective decisions over my emotions.\n“Ah- okay. Got it.”\n“Let’s at least go home together.”\n“Yeah, sure. Let’s take it slow. I want to spend more time with you.”\n“Alright. Let’s walk slowly.”\nHan-gyeol smiled and took my hand.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes?”\n“Just wanted to call you.”\nHan-gyeol just smiled in response.\nHe must have noticed that my mood was off.\nBut he patiently waited without questioning, even though I didn’t want to reveal these feelings to him.\nI feared they might make him despise me.\nI decided to quickly sort it out on my own.\nWhen we reached in front of my house, I said goodbye to Han-gyeol.\n“Thanks for walking me home every time.”\n“Be careful going inside.”\n“Yeah, I will. I’ll text you once I’m home~”\nI watched Han-gyeol’s retreating figure for a moment before going inside.\nI didn’t go to my room but slumped on the sofa instead.\nStaring at the ceiling, I let out a deep sigh.\n“Haah-”\n“What, was there an earthquake?”\n“...Not in the mood to deal with you, brother.”\n“Since when have you ever dealt with me?”\n“Can you not nitpick?”\nMy brother was eating pizza in the kitchen.\n“Why do you look like the world has ended?”\n“Like you said, maybe I’m not a kind human being.”\nI continued staring at the ceiling.\n“You just realized that?”\nThat brat... but he was right.\n“Why this sudden deep introspection?”\n“Brother, what would you do if your girlfriend was really successful?”\n“Ha! As if I’d find a woman like that. Don’t you know their standards? But of course, I deserve a pretty girlfriend.\nI frowned in annoyance.\n“So annoying. Shouldn’t have asked.”\n“Haah~ A really successful girlfriend... I’ve never met one, but it’d be a bit unsettling?”\n“Why unsettling? She would really like you.”\n“That’s how people are. If someone is too successful, you fear they might drift away.”\nMy brother casually said this while watching a movie on his phone.\nHis words struck a chord with me.\n“You’re just like me.”\n“What? People are all the same.”\n“But it doesn’t mean it’s not petty.”\n“You want to discuss philosophy now? What’s your point?”\n“Never mind. Sorry for the random talk. Enjoy your pizza.”\n“Leaving any for you?”\n“It’s all yours.”\nAfter a few minutes of gathering my thoughts, I got up from the sofa.\nThat was when the intercom lit up and the doorbell rang.\n“Who could it be? Huh?!”\nI hurried to the door after checking the intercom screen.\n“Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah...! Hi?”\n“Why are you here and not at home?”\n“Well, I thought Eun-ha seemed a bit down.”\n“Yeah, a bit down?”\n“I brought this for you.”\nHan-gyeol, his face flushed, cautiously brought out a bouquet of flowers from behind him.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“I’ve seen a lot of students dating. But you two seem exceptionally sweet together, don’t you think?”\n“Ah, that’s embarrassing. Anyway, thank you for the counseling. Can I leave now?”\n“Sure, go meet your girlfriend. Oh, right. Han-gyeol, do you also want to go to the same university as Eun-ha?”\n“Yes, I’d like to go to the same university.”\n“But you do know, if you set your sights on Eun-ha’s university, it might be a bit of a step down for you?”\n“Really? I hadn’t thought there was much of a difference.”\nHearing my question, the teacher offered sincere advice.\n“It’s great to want to attend the same university, but not at the expense of not going to one that matches your capabilities.”\n“I understand. But did Eun-ha say during her counseling session that she wants to go to the same university as me?”\n“Yes. She seemed a bit worried. Maybe because your grades are so high? She seemed a bit intimidated. Make sure to comfort her.”\n“I will, thank you.”\nAfter finishing the counseling session, I left the teacher’s office.\nI hadn’t realized Eun-ha felt that way.\nWas her slightly low mood today because of that?\nReturning to the classroom with these thoughts, I saw Eun-ha studying at her desk. Yet, she seemed to be frowning slightly as she worked on a problem.\nI thought about going over and talking directly, but decided against it.\nIf this makes Eun-ha study harder, then that was not necessarily a bad thing.\nAh, but was that too calculative of me?\nFrom a results-oriented view, maybe, but I did want to cheer Eun-ha up.\nHowever, I didn’t want to nag someone who was already working hard to do more, nor did it feel right to irresponsibly tell her to just keep doing as she was.\nBeing a student preparing for university entrance exams, things seemed more complicated than I expected.\nEven while dating, thoughts of the exams lingered in my mind.\nI was sure wanting to date more and have fun wasn’t something only I felt.\nBut how could I cheer Eun-ha up?\nI couldn’t just go and kiss her...\nNo matter how much I think about it, I couldn’t come up with a good idea.\nEven after the afternoon classes were over, Eun-ha was unusually quiet on the way home.\nShould I try a witty joke, or suggest going somewhere fun to change her mood?\nWhile pondering ways to make Eun-ha smile, a flower shop caught my eye. It seemed like the most sensible option for the situation, so I told Eun-ha I’d go home to study today. Seeing her slightly gloomy face hurt, but I planned to quickly buy flowers and head straight to her house.\n“Take care on your way home.”\n“Yeah, I will. I’ll text you once I’m home~”\nAfter waving goodbye to Eun-ha, I hurried to the flower shop. Entering the fragrant store, I was greeted by an unexpected sight.\n“What can I help you with?”\nThe man who approached me had a deep, robust voice, his bulging biceps showcasing his masculinity.\n“Uh... I came to buy some flowers.”\n“My dear! People come to a flower shop to buy flowers, of course.”\nHis question was answered by a woman who rushed over with a kind smile.\n“Sorry about that. My husband’s not great with words. What kind of flowers are you looking for?”\n“Uh, I don’t really know much about flowers. I want to get something for my girlfriend. What do you recommend?”\n“Ah, I see. How about some baby’s breath for a safe choice?”\nMaybe I should ask about the meaning of the flowers.\nBut that felt embarrassingly cliché.\nStill, I didn’t want to buy just anything. After browsing a bit, I pointed to some blue roses.\n“Would these blue roses be a good gift?”\n“Ah, they might be okay, but their meaning might not suit the occasion.”\n“What’s their meaning?”\nI was glad the conversation had turned to the meanings of flowers.\n“Originally, blue roses didn’t exist in nature, so they meant ‘impossibility’. But after they were developed, they came to symbolize ‘unyielding love’. Oh, and they also mean ‘miracle’. Does that fit your situation?”\n“No, I think I’ll choose something else. Sorry.”\n“No problem at all. Would you like me to introduce you to some other flowers with different meanings?”\n“Really? I’d appreciate that, though it’s a bit embarrassing.”\n“Alright, let’s start from here, and I’ll explain them one by one.”\nAfter listening to all the florist’s suggestions, I chose what seemed best.\nWith a small bouquet in hand, I hurried to Eun-ha’s house. Was it my imagination, or were people glancing at me a bit?\nBreathless from the run, I soon reached Eun-ha’s place.\n“Haa...”\nI took a deep breath in front of her house and pressed the doorbell, hiding the bouquet behind my back as I waited in silence. Soon, the door opened, and there was Eun-ha, still in her school uniform.\n“Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah, hi.”\n“Why are you here and not at home?”\nWhy did gifting flowers feel so embarrassingly significant?\n“No, it’s just... You seemed a bit down.”\n“Yeah, a bit down?”\n“I brought this for you.”\nCautiously, I presented the bouquet from behind my back. Eun-ha took the flowers and looked straight at me.\n“Please, don’t stare too much; it’s embarrassing.”\nI averted my gaze slightly as I spoke.\n“Ah... Han-gyeol...!”\nBut then, Eun-ha’s voice trembled, startling me.\n“Huh?! What? Eun-ha?!”\nEun-ha, holding my bouquet, was in tears. They say girls always love receiving flowers, but Eun-ha seemed to be the exception. Could it be a pollen allergy? While I was fretting, Eun-ha spoke.\n“I’m sorry... so sorry, Han-gyeol.”\nSuddenly, she hugged me tightly and began to cry. The situation was baffling, but I focused on calming Eun-ha down. Gently, I stroked her hair and comforted her.\n“It’s okay.”\nEun-ha cried in my arms for quite some time. After about three minutes, she gently pulled away and looked intently into my face.\nThough I wished she would say something, Eun-ha just continued to hold back tears. Then, a sudden thought crossed my mind.\n“Eun-ha, don’t tell me...”\nIt couldn’t be.\nCould it really be that?\nI was afraid to ask, but I had to voice my heavy thoughts.\n“Eun-ha, are you really going abroad? When is it? Did you say a year? Since when?”\nI asked, gripping her shoulders.\n“No, it’s not that! I’m not going abroad...”\n“Then why are you crying? What’s wrong? Are you hurt?”\n“No, not hurt... Should we go out and talk?”\n“That sounds like something you’d say before going abroad. Are you sure you’re not going?”\n“Yes...! I’m really not. It’s not that, let’s just go out...”\n“Okay, then...”\nWe took the elevator down and sat on a bench in the nearby park. Eun-ha, sticking close to me, spoke with her head bowed.\n“I have a confession to make...”\n“What kind of confession? It’s not about you going abroad, is it?”\n“NO, it’s not about going abroad.”\n“Then what is it?”\nI was relieved, at least for the moment. I had thought Eun-ha was suddenly going to be far away.\n“It’s just that...”\n“Take your time and tell me.”\nThis seemed serious enough for a heart-to-heart. Eun-ha continued, her head still bowed as if she were a guilty sinner.\n“I’ve been feeling a bit anxious because you’re good at studying...”\n“Huh?”\n“I always believed we would go to the same university, but... it’s not like that. You can’t choose a lower-ranking university because of me... The thought that we couldn’t always be together made me anxious.”\nEun-ha began to calmly explain her feelings.\n“I could understand that much. But then, I felt a little relieved that you’re not good at Korean. I think I was even happy about it. Instead of being proud and happy about my boyfriend being good at his studies, I felt annoyed and hated myself for feeling relieved in such a selfish way...”\nHer guilt was deep, and tears started to flow again. They fell to the ground with a soft ‘thud’.\n“Is that what it was all about?”\nGently, I turned her head towards me and wiped her tears, reassuring her.\n“It’s okay, Eun-ha. That’s a completely natural feeling.”\n“How can it be natural? Who would feel relieved to see their loved one fail at something?”\n“No, it’s true. Everyone feels that way when they’re in love. I would’ve been anxious if you were too perfect. I’m just an ordinary guy, and Eun-ha, you’re like a shining star. I always worry, what if you hate me? What if you fly away somewhere - ”\n“No... Han-gyeol, you are the shining one to me. I could never hate you.”\n“But it’s a ‘what if.’”\n“Even as a ‘what if,’ that could never happen. Han-gyeol, you always shine in my eyes. You’re the one I always want to be close to. So there’s no way I would fly away and leave you.”\nEven as tears streamed down her face, Eun-ha spoke with unwavering certainty.\n“Even if it’s just a ‘what if,’ such a thing will never happen.”\nI was left speechless by Eun-ha’s emphatic words.\nWhat could I say to Eun-ha, who was determined to affirm everything about me?\nHer resolute attitude warmed a corner of my heart. More than anything, I was touched that Eun-ha, always so altruistic, showed a hint of selfishness for my sake.\n“I feel the same. To me, Eun-ha always shines. You’re the one I want by my side every day. So, don’t worry. And don’t feel guilty about those feelings. I’m actually happy knowing you like me that much.”\nAfter all, the emotion of love is often mixed with selfish desires.\nI wished she would love only me.\nI hoped she looked only at me.\nI wanted her to care for me alone.\nThese feelings, which could be seen as possessiveness, might very well be at the heart of love.\n“So let’s not worry too much about things that haven’t happened yet, okay? Don’t worry. In my eyes, Eun-ha is the most beautiful and adorable in the world. Even when you cry, it’s beautiful.”\n“That’s not true... It’s not beautiful at all.”\nEun-ha’s mood seemed to lighten slightly, the corners of her mouth turning up.\n“You are beautiful. Now, let’s stop crying and go eat something tasty. How about we go for some spicy tteokbokki that you like?”\nMy playful suggestion had Eun-ha staring intently at my face before she grabbed my head.\n“Huh? Eun-ha?”\n“I love you... really... more than anyone in the world.”\n“Ah, you’re making me blush. I also love Eun-ha the most in the world—”\nBefore I could finish, Eun-ha’s lips pressed against mine. I hadn’t expected her to initiate the kiss... But feeling elated, I wrapped my arms around her waist in response.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“You are beautiful. Now, let’s stop crying and go eat something tasty. How about we go for some spicy tteokbokki that you like?”\nIt was Han-gyeol who wiped my tears and gave me a warm smile. My heart fluttered because Han-gyeol said even my crying face was pretty.\nThe emotions inside me kept overflowing, and I had to somehow release them. My face was flushed, and my heart was pounding, but that wasn’t enough to release these feelings. I cautiously grabbed Han-gyeol’s face.\n“Huh? Eun-ha?”\nIt felt a bit embarrassing to kiss in such a place, but there was no time to think.\n“I love you... really... more than anyone in the world.”\n“Ah, you’re making me blush. I also love Eun-ha the most in the world—”\nI went ahead and kissed Han-gyeol’s lips. How much more could my love for Han-gyeol grow?\nI kept thinking I couldn’t love him more each day, but I ended up loving him even more.\nThe more we talked, the more time we spent together, the more uncontrollable my feelings became.\nI wanted to be with him every single day. I loved him so much that I couldn’t control my feelings.\nHan-gyeol was all over my mind and heart. I loved and adored him so much that it felt like my rationality was crumbling.\nWith those emotions, I pressed my lips against his more firmly. But then, our teeth accidentally clashed with a ‘clack.’\n“Ah-”\n“Ah-! I’m sorry...! Did it hurt a lot?”\nI quickly pulled back and looked at Han-gyeol. It wasn’t a hard enough hit to break anything, but my front teeth felt slightly sensitive.\n“Eun-ha, at this rate, you might devour me.”\n“Sorry. Right now, I feel like I could devour you.”\n“That’s scary. Are you a beast?”\n“What kind of beast is a girlfriend...! There are so many cute little animals.”\n“Right. You look like a cute little animal, but your actions are like a beast.”\n“Then, can I continue to ‘devour’ you?”\n“If this keeps up, I really will be devoured. Save me, please.”\nIt still wasn’t enough. My emotions were still in turmoil.\n“Han-gyeol, do you know this?”\n“What?”\n“A beast never lets go of its prey once it bites.”\n“Sounds like you’re telling me to let myself be devoured.”\n“Right. Let yourself be devoured.”\n“I don’t want to.”\nHan-gyeol chuckled softly and then kissed me. I closed my eyes, lost in the intensity of the kiss, which was deeper than usual.\nI loved the kisses I initiated, but those given by Han-gyeol were just as wonderful.\nPhysical affection... It was embarrassing, but it seemed incredibly wonderful. It felt like the easiest way to affirm our love for each other.\nAfter our deep kiss, we just looked into each other’s eyes and laughed.\n“Are you satisfied now?”\n“Only a little... but remember, this is a public place, even if there’s no one around.”\n“That’s a shame... If we were alone, we could have kissed more.”\n“Uh, Eun-ha, you’re being too explicit. It’s embarrassing.”\n“Yep! But with Han-gyeol, I have nothing left to hide.”\nBecause Han-gyeol always accepted even the emotions I didn’t want to show. And I, too, could accept all of his emotions.\n“Eun-ha, how about we go on a short date before heading back?”\n“Sure. What shall we do?”\n“We can’t go too far right now. How about watching a movie?”\n“Sounds good. Ah- I’ll go home to grab my phone and wallet. And I’ll put the flowers in a vase.”\n“Okay. Let’s hurry then.”\nWe stood up from the bench and held hands. Excitedly, I swung our joined hands back and forth with great enthusiasm.\n“Eun-ha, my arm is going to fall off.”\n“It won’t fall off just from this.”\n“Shall we watch a movie and then have dinner?”\n“Let’s check the movie timings and decide.”\n“Alright. While you’re at your house, I’ll book the tickets.”\n“Don’t do that. Sit on the living room sofa at my place. It will take some time to put the flowers in the vase.”\n“Okay. Let’s do that.”\nWe arrived at the front of my house and took the elevator up. Inside, we continued to hold hands tightly, not letting go.\nI wished we could hold hands like this all day long. I wanted to glue them together.\n“Han-gyeol, just sit in the living room.”\n“Alright, I will.”\nWe entered the house after punching in the door lock code. But I had completely forgotten that my brother was home.\n“Ah? The crybaby’s back?”\n“Crybaby?!”\n“Seriously. I was trying to ignore it, but I couldn’t help noticing you two hugging as you opened the door.”\n“You saw that?! Why did my brother have to see us hugging!”\nI felt my face heat up at the thought of my brother witnessing that scene.\n“Han-gyeol. Please take good care of my little sister, even though she’s a crybaby.”\n“Don’t worry. Even her crying face is incredibly pretty.”\n“What-?! What exactly has enchanted you about this girl?”\n“Her beauty played a big part.”\nHan-gyeol’s compliments made my face grow even hotter. In the end, I let go of Han-gyeol’s hand and ran into my room.\n“Hey~ crybaby! If you’re embarrassed, just say it!”\n“Shut up!”\n***\n“Really... teasing me about being crybaby.”\nGrumbling, I walked with Han-gyeol toward the cinema. With about twenty minutes left before the movie started, we decided to have a drink at the cafe next to the ticket booth.\n“Your crying face was pretty, too. Look, there’s Hallabong Ade.”\nHan-gyeol handed me a Hallabong Ade after picking up our drinks from the counter.\nWithout even having to say it, he knew what I liked... I really adored Han-gyeol to death.\nI was worried my heart might literally burst from all these feelings.\n“I’ll enjoy it... But please forget about me crying earlier.”\n“It seems like your tears left a mark on my clothes.”\n“Leave it at my place then. I’ll wash it for you.”\n“You don’t have to go that far.”\nEmbarrassed, I just drank my Hallabong Ade. I couldn’t even remember the last time I cried in front of someone.\n“Ugh, it’s still so embarrassing. I always wanted to show only my prettiest side to Han-gyeol.”\n“I told you, even your crying face was pretty. It was so pretty, I might want to make you cry sometimes.”\n“I want to see Han-gyeol cry too. When was the last time you cried?”\nHan-gyeol sipped his coffee, seemingly trying to recall. After finishing his reflection, he set his coffee down on the table.\n“I can’t really remember? It must have been a long time ago since I last cried.”\n“If you ever feel like crying again, make sure it’s in front of me, okay?”\n“As a boyfriend, that’s not really a scene I want to show.”\n“I didn’t mean to pressure you. But if you cry in front of me, I’ll do my best to comfort you.”\n“Alright. Next time I cry, I’ll make sure it’s beside Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah. I’m always on Han-gyeol’s side, you know?”\n“That’s reassuring.”\n“I want to be someone Han-gyeol can rely on too!”\nI didn’t want to be just a weak girlfriend who only depended on him. Just like Han-gyeol gave me comfort and stability, I wanted to give the same to him.\nI wanted to be someone who could be his strength when he was down or sad.\n“Thanks for saying that. Shall we slowly head to watch the movie now?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I’m so excited to watch a movie with Han-gyeol.”\n“Did you feel this excited when you first went to a movie with me?”\n“First time going to a movie with Han-gyeol?”\nI tried hard to recall the memories of that day.\nThe movie might have been somewhat boring for high school boys and girls. Maybe that was why... all I could remember was Han-gyeol, intently watching the movie.\nThe image of him, mature and calm, facing the screen, came naturally to my mind.\n“What the...?”\n“Huh?”\n“Did I only watch Han-gyeol that day too?”\nI couldn’t recall anything about the movie; only Han-gyeol’s profile remained in my mind.\n“What-? Eun-ha, you were the one who wanted to see that movie.”\n“Right~? But now that I think about it, watching Han-gyeol was better than watching the movie.”\nI grinned sheepishly and linked arms with Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol, back then we were just friends. But today, we’re lovers?”\n“Yeah. Being here as lovers feels so much better.”\n“Yeah, yeah. I also like it unbelievably much.”\n“We don’t need cola and popcorn, do we?”\n“Right. We’ll have dinner after the movie.”\nWe took the escalator up to the cinema. After showing our tickets to the attendant, we entered the theater and took our seats.\nBut the armrest between Han-gyeol and me was really bothersome. Without it, I felt like we could watch the movie much closer together.\nQuickly, I lifted the armrest up.\n“Huh?”\nAs I lifted the armrest, Han-gyeol looked at me.\n“Now that we’re a couple, we don’t need this, right? I want to be closer.”\n“That’s true. We don’t need the armrest anymore.”\n“Yep, yep. It’s just an obstacle now.”\nI linked my arm with Han-gyeol’s again and snuggled up to him.\nNow, we didn’t need anything else between us.\nAll I wanted was to be closely embraced.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Alright, time to switch seats, don’t you think? Let’s make some progress and just shuffle seats randomly with the program.”\nAt the teacher’s words, I sneaked a glance at Eun-ha, who had her eyes closed, and hands clasped together. I couldn’t help but let out a small chuckle at her sight.\n“How many clicks should I make? Three?”\n“Teacher, since it’s May, let’s do it five times~”\n“Alright, I’ll click five times~ No complaints later, okay?”\n“Yes~”\nI silently watch the laptop screen projected onto the classroom display. As the teacher clicks the mouse, the students’ names shuffle around.\nWhen the seating arrangement was finally settled, the students eagerly searched for their names. Some groan in dismay, while others beamed with joy.\n“Ah, Teacher, please click it one more time!”\n“Didn’t I say no take-backs?”\nI too look for my name on the screen. I found it in the center of the third row. Naturally, I check who’s sitting next to me.\n“Huh?”\nI blinked in disbelief at the clear writing ‘Shin Eun-ha’. Rubbing my eyes and checking again, I confirmed that Eun-ha was indeed my partner. It was a moment of secret joy at such a coincidence.\n“Wow! Yes!”\nWith the sound of a chair dragging, someone stands up. It was Eun-ha, clenching her fist in excitement, seemingly thrilled.\nI turned my head away, biting my lip to suppress my laughter. She was just so cute and lovely.\n“Eun-ha, it’s okay to be happy, but try to keep it in your heart, okay?”\n“S-sorry!”\nImmediately, the homeroom teacher’s warning flied at her, and Eun-Ha sat back down, her face flushing.\n“Ah... so cute.”\n“Are you talking about me?”\nYujin, sitting beside me, teased.\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n“Would it be? Obviously, it’s about Eun-ha.”\n“Ah, it was fun being Han-gyeol’s partner. Too bad.”\n“If anyone sees it, they would think we were parting ways forever. Let’s just move to our new seats.”\n“Such a Cold-hearted person...”\n“I enjoyed it too.”\nOne by one, the students began to rise and move to their new seats.\nI bid farewell to Yujin and quickly moved to sit next to Eun-ha.\nOur eyes met as she approached with a beaming smile, carrying her belongings.\n“Are you that happy about being partners?”\n“I-it’s embarrassing... but yes, I’m really happy.”\n“It shows.”\n“Do you not like it?”\n“I like it too.”\nAfter I sat down, Eun-ha followed suit. For a moment, we just looked at each other, exchanging silent glances.\n“Let’s get along well.”\n“I’m counting on you too, Han-gyeol.”\n“Alright, everyone, enough chatting. Shall we start the lesson?”\nHiding our fluttering hearts, we focused on the lesson. Eun-ha looked beautiful, quietly listening and flipping through the textbook. Whenever our eyes met, she would give a bright smile.\nJust having Eun-ha beside me made the class more enjoyable.\nI wanted to playfully interact with her, but I couldn’t during class, nor did I want to disrupt her studies. However, as soon as the class ended, Eun-ha quickly turned towards me.\n“Han-gyeol, Han-gyeol. Wanna go to the canteen?”\n“Isn’t it lunchtime after the next period?”\n“Just thought we could celebrate being partners again with a drink or something.”\n“A celebration drink? That’s fun. Let’s go.”\nWe left the classroom and headed to the canteen.\n“I hope we don’t have to change seats again.”\n“Me too. But I keep wanting to be playful with you during class.”\n“Same here. Still, we have to focus on our studies, so let’s just hold back a bit.”\n“I enjoyed sharing notes with you at the beginning of the semester.”\n“Yeah, that was fun for me too.”\nSharing these light-hearted moments, we soon arrived at the canteen.\nEun-ha got orange juice, and I chose apple juice, then we headed back to the classroom.\n“Ah- By the way, what is in our 4th period?”\n“Calculus, I think? The math teacher will probably ask you to solve a problem again.”\n“Because of Yujin, I’m always the one getting picked on.”\n“But you solve every problem without a single mistake.”\n“It’d be embarrassing if I didn’t.”\n“It’s cool how you solve them so easily.”\n“Really? I’ll do my best then.”\n“Get it wrong sometimes, okay?”\n“Why?”\n“It might make you look cool to other girls too.”\nEun-ha’s cute jealousy almost made me spit out my apple juice with a chuckle.\n“You’re jealous in such a cute way?”\n“How great would it be if you were cool and handsome just for me?”\n“Actually, I think I only look cool and handsome to Eun-ha.”\n“That’s not true. Han-gyeol, you’re objectively handsome and cool.”\n“Thanks for the compliment. But you know, Eun-ha, you’re objectively pretty and cute too.”\n“No, well... you don’t need to compliment me too.”\nHer bashful reaction was incredibly adorable. We arrived at the classroom and took our seats just as the bell rang.\nRight on time, the math teacher entered.\nHe glanced at the seating chart attached to the podium, looking puzzled.\n“Did you guys change seats?”\n“Yes. During the third period.”\n“Where’s Newton?”\n“Here, I am.”\n“Oh, really? What’s this? Are you two partners now?”\n“Yes. We were lucky.”\nThe math teacher then turned to Eun-ha.\n“Newton’s girlfriend, are you happy about this?”\n“Me?! Yes, I’m really happy.”\n“Oh...?! That’s...”\nEun-Ha’s candid response seemed to slightly fluster the teacher.\n“Haa...! Let’s just get on with the lesson. Everyone, open your books.”\n***\nAfter math class and lunch, we returned to the classroom.\n“Han-gyeol, I got a text from Hyun-joo unnie. You know about the Korean tutoring you wanted...”\n“Oh, right. She said she’d ask for me.”\n“What should we do? The tutor said they don’t have any openings, so it might be difficult for you to get a spot.”\n“Then it can’t be helped. Tell Hyun-joo Noona I’m thankful she looked into it for me.”\nIt seemed like I would have to find a Korean tutor or a language academy myself.\nI wanted to find one before the June mock exams, but it looked like I should start searching now. Tutoring seemed difficult, so an academy might be the better option.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, what’s up?”\n“If it’s okay with you, maybe I could teach you Korean?”\n“Eun-ha? No, I don’t want to take away from your study time.”\nI firmly declined Eun-ha’s offer.\n“Think of it as a date. Just until the June mock exams!”\n“I appreciate the thought, Eun-ha, but I can’t. I’ve been focusing more on Korean since the midterms, so I’ll do well in the mock exams.”\n“I just want to be of some help to you.”\n“You already are. Just helping me out with the questions I don’t know is enough.”\nI felt bad for continuously rejecting Eun-ha’s kindness, but it just wasn’t feasible. However, Eun-ha didn’t seem to give up easily.\n“Then let’s make a bet.”\n“A bet? What kind of bet?”\n“We have about three weeks until the June mock exams, right?”\n“Yeah, that’s right. Are you suggesting we bet on our grades?”\nIt wasn’t a bet I was eager to accept.\n“Yeah. For the next three weeks, I’ll help Han-gyeol with his Korean studies.”\n“Ah, Eun-ha, I’ve already said I don’t want to take away from your study time.”\n“You’re worried about my grades dropping, aren’t you?”\n“It’s not just about grades dropping; I’m also worried about your grades not improving as much as they could.”\n“Then let’s do this.”\nEun-ha firmly grasped my hand and proposed.\n“For the remaining three weeks until the June mock exams, I’ll help you with Korean twice a week. If your Korean grades don’t improve, then you’ll have to look for a tutor or join a language academy. But, there’s one condition.”\n“What’s that?”\n“If your Korean grades improve, but my grades drop or don’t improve, then you’ll still look for a tutor or a language academy. In other words, if it’s not a win-win situation, I lose. But if it is a win-win, then you’ll continue learning Korean from me.”\nIt was a tempting offer, but I still didn’t want to take away Eun-ha’s time.\nOf course, it would be great if both our grades improved, but I didn’t want to overburden her.\n“Still not keen on it?”\n“Han-gyeol, I know you don’t want to take away my time, and I really appreciate that. But as your girlfriend, I want to help you. It’s not about being stubborn. I promise not to neglect my studies or overdo it. So please, trust me, and let me help you for these three weeks.”\nIt was hard to refuse Eun-ha’s earnest request. As I hesitated, Eun-ha continued to press on.\n“What if our roles were reversed, Han-gyeol? What would you have done?”\n“Huh? If the roles were reversed...?”\nI might have insisted on helping Eun-ha in any way I could.\n“You would have helped me, right?”\nI nodded silently.\n“Han-gyeol’s feelings for me aren’t much different from mine for him. That’s why I want to help. If it were me, Han-gyeol would have definitely helped. So now, in this situation, the first thing I want to do is to help Han-gyeol. I’ll ask one last time. I’m not forcing you. Can I help you for just these three weeks?”\nIt was hard to refuse when she put it like that... But I couldn’t just accept her condition as it was.\n“I have a condition too.”\n“What is it? Tell me.”\n“The criterion for ‘improvement in Korean’ is based on my Korean grade reaching 1st grade. And it’s the same for Eun-Ha; your math grade also needs to be 1st grade. If either of us fails to achieve this, I’ll look for a tutor or an academy instead of relying on Eun-ha.”\nEun-ha looked into my eyes for a moment and then nodded.\n“Okay. Han-gyeol’s Korean at 1st grade, and my math at 1st grade. I accept.”\nSo much for dates for the next three weeks.\nWait, could tutoring be considered a date?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I’ve agreed to tutor Han-gyeol in Korean until the June mock exams.\nSince Han-gyeol was having some difficulties with the non-fiction passages, I planned to focus on that.\nIt was easy to see why Han-gyeol spent so much time on non-fiction texts.\n“Do you look at the question and try to find the basis for the answer directly in the passage, Han-gyeol?”\n“Isn’t that what you usually do? The passage should have the answer.”\nHan-gyeol raised his head and looked at me.\nMy heart fluttered every time we made eye contact, but I decided to hold back now.\nAfter all, it wasn’t just about talking through the studies.\n“Right, fundamentally, you’re correct. But blindly searching the passage without knowing what the question demands won’t work. The options are essentially asking, ‘Han-gyeol, do you really understand this?’ So, if you grasp what’s being asked, you don’t need to go through the whole passage, just quickly catch what the question wants.”\n“I get what you’re saying, but I’m not quite feeling it yet.”\n“It’ll become more intuitive to see the flow between paragraphs with practice. The only way is to keep at it.”\n“Let me give it a try.”\n“Sure. Let’s tackle the next passage.”\n“Okay.”\nHan-gyeol diligently worked on interpreting the text, referencing my advice.\nHe occasionally frowned, but it was always tough at first.\nWatching his expressions was quite enjoyable for me.\n“It’s still tough, but I think I get what you mean, Eun-ha.”\n“Really? You’re quick to understand, Han-gyeol~”\nI said, stroking Han-gyeol’s hair.\nI really wanted to hug him tightly.\n“Why does it feel so strange when Eun-ha stroke my hair?”\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n“Is it? Stroking Han-gyeol’s hair feels really nice.”\n“It’s a bit embarrassing, though?”\nAs I stroked Han-gyeol’s hair, I playfully swept his bangs to the side.\n“You look handsome even without bangs.”\n“Eun-ha is pretty even without her bangs, too.”\n“Shall we get back to studying now?”\n“Too bad. Weren’t we just getting into a flirtatious mood?”\n“Ah-ah, no way. Just one more hour of study, then we can be flirtatious. Okay?”\n“Are you always this Spartan as a teacher?”\n“Let’s look at the next problem~”\n“Okay.”\nAfter about an hour more of studying, we closed the workbook.\nHan-gyeol stretched lazily as if slightly stiff, and I seized the moment to hug him tightly.\n“What’s this? Hugging as soon as studying ends.”\n“I can’t hug you while we’re studying, can I? I’ve been holding back.”\n“Really? Then, me too.”\nHan-gyeol wrapped his arms around me, embracing me tightly.\nHis strong grip made it a bit hard to breathe, but it felt good.\n“Han-gyeol, I can’t breathe.”\n“Just bear with it a bit. I wanted to hug you, too.”\n“Then, me too.”\nWe hugged each other as if competing in a show of strength.\nI wanted to savor the pleasant scent of Han-gyeol’s shampoo a little longer.\nI felt incredibly happy, as if time could stop just like this.\n“I want to be with Han-gyeol like this every day.”\n“Me too. I want to be with Eun-ha every day.”\n“Let’s really hang out every day next year.”\n“Yeah. I promise. Let’s hang out together every day.”\nHan-gyeol’s response made me very happy.\nSoon, I would be able to hang out with Han-gyeol every day.\nI wanted to go skiing together, and take a long train journey somewhere.\n“Kids, if you’re done studying, come out and have some snacks~”\nHyun-joo Unnie voice called from outside the room.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s go out and eat some snacks.”\n“Yeah.”\nAfter ending our brief embrace, we went out to the living room.\n“Did you study well?”\n“Yes, yes. What’s the snack?”\n“Cake. Han-gyeol, could you get some plates?”\n“Sure.”\nHan-gyeol headed straight to the kitchen.\n“Now he has completely blended into our house.”\n“Right? Ah, I want to make a room for Han-gyeol in our house.”\n“Oh my, oh my. You can just share a room, right?”\n“Ah-ah! I didn’t say that much.”\n“Han-gyeol~ Eun-ha wants to share a room with you~”\n“Aack-! No, no! I didn’t say that!”\nI quickly intervened to stop Hyun-joo Unnie from teasing any further and turned to Han-gyeol.\nBut Han-gyeol just played along with Hyun-joo Unnie’s joke.\n“Eun-ha is like a wild animal these days, so we can’t share a room~”\nAh, really... It feels like everyone in our house just teases me.\n***\nAfter having snacks and chatting, it was time for Han-gyeol to leave.\nI wished he could stay for dinner, but that seemed a bit much.\n“Well, I should be going now.”\n“Okay. Take care on your way.”\n“I’ll walk Han-gyeol out a bit.”\nWe left the house together.\n“You don’t have to see me off.”\n“I just want to spend a bit more time with Han-gyeol.”\n“How about we don’t go straight home and take a walk in the park?”\n“Really? Can we? That would be awesome.”\n“Of course. But you could have just said if you wanted to stay longer. I always want to be with Eun-ha, too.”\n“I feel a bit guilty taking time away during the mock exam period~”\n“But can’t I find time for a short walk in the park with my girlfriend?”\n“Then let’s stay a bit longer before I go.”\nWe took the elevator down and slowly headed towards the park.\n“The weather’s nice.”\n“It’s sunny.”\nWhile walking hand in hand with Han-gyeol in the park, we noticed a basketball court.\nSomeone had left a basketball lying in the center of the court.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s go play basketball.”\n“Basketball?”\nI led Han-gyeol straight to the basketball court.\nPicking up the large basketball, I tried bouncing it just like Han-gyeol.\n-Thump-thump.\n“Wow, you look pretty good at this~”\n“Really? Do I have a talent for basketball?”\n“Try shooting a basket.”\n“Watch this.”\nI threw the basketball with all my might using both hands.\nBut it fell to the court floor before even reaching the hoop.\nHan-gyeol quickly picked up the ball and handed it back to me.\n“Try throwing it with a bit more force.”\n“How about you show me how it’s done instead?”\n“Me? Ah, I need to look cool and make it in at a time like this. I’m feeling the pressure.”\n“I’m looking forward to it.”\n“Don’t fall for me after watching this.”\n“No promises there~”\n“Watch closely.”\nHan-gyeol bounced the basketball and then jumped, shooting the ball.\nThe basketball traced a beautiful arc and swooshed into the hoop.\n“Wow, you got it in one go.”\n“See? Want to try this time, Eun-ha?”\n“Yes, yes. Show me how.”\n“Alright, hold the basketball like this. Then, think of pushing the ball up as you jump and throw it.”\n“Okay, okay. I’ll try it just like Han-gyeol said...!”\nFollowing Han-gyeol’s advice, I adjusted my grip on the ball and jumped.\nExtending my arm, I threw the ball, and it hit the backboard, then went straight into the hoop.\n“Wow! Han-gyeol, I made it!”\n“You made it... Maybe you really have a talent.”\n“I want to try from further away.”\n“How about a three-pointer?”\n“Yes, yes. This is fun.”\n“Alright. Let’s do it.”\nI picked up the basketball again and stood outside the three-point line.\n“Han-gyeol, I just throw it harder than before, right?”\n“Yeah. Try aiming for the backboard.”\n“Okay!”\nI took a deep breath and threw the basketball with all my strength.\nBut it hit the backboard and bounced off.\n“Too bad. Want to try again?”\n“I’d like to try dunking, but that might be too much, right?”\n“Dunking?”\n“Yeah. It seems like it would be fun.”\nHan-gyeol seemed to ponder for a moment, then suggested,\n“Want me to give you a boost?”\n“A boost? No, Han-gyeol, you might get hurt. I’m heavy.”\n“Come on, Eun-ha’s light for me. I’ll boost you. Try dunking.”\nI wanted to say it was okay, but the idea sounded really fun.\n“So, if it doesn’t seem to work, we stop right away, okay?”\n“Yep, yep. Now, grab the basketball and climb onto my shoulders.”\nHan-gyeol sat down under the basketball hoop.\nI was a bit worried, but carefully climbed onto Han-gyeol’s shoulders.\n“Han-gyeol, how is it? Can you stand up?”\n“Ready to go up? Hold onto the basketball tightly.”\n“Okay, okay.”\nAs I responded, Han-gyeol slowly stood up.\nMy view gradually elevated, unveiling a world I had never seen before.\nStill, it wasn’t high enough to dunk the ball into the hoop.\n“...It’s so high.”\n“How is it, Eun-ha? Think you can dunk?”\n“Uh... I don’t think so? It’s dangerous, let’s get down.”\n“Really? Just a moment...!”\nHan-gyeol then slowly lowered himself and knelt on the court floor.\nI stepped onto the floor and climbed down from Han-gyeol’s shoulders.\n“Han-gyeol, was I heavy?”\n“No, not at all heavy.”\n“Really?”\nHan-gyeol stood back up and looked at me.\n“But I can’t do it a second time.”\n“You, come here right now.”\nHan-gyeol backed away a few steps, laughing.\n“Just kidding, just kidding.”\n“That didn’t look like a joking face. Come here.”\nHan-gyeol slowly retreated and then suddenly started to run.\n“Ah, why~ You were light as a feather!”\n“Then why are you running away?”\n“Your eyes looked fierce like a wild animal.”\n“Hey~ Calling your girlfriend a wild animal. Come here, don’t run away.”\nHan-gyeol hesitated for a moment before dashing off.\n“Han-gyeol, you-!”\nI chased after Han-gyeol with all my might.\n“Eun-ha, it was a joke~!”\n“Come here and talk to me-!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The June mock exam was just next week.\nAs much as Eun-ha made time for me, I studied harder than usual.\nI was just beginning to see what Eun-ha had been talking about... but I was confident my grades would improve.\n“Eun-ha, I’m not sure if this is the right way to think about it-”\nI was about to ask Eun-ha if my approach was correct.\nBut she, who had been nodding off for a while, was now fast asleep, her head drooped down.\nIf she kept sleeping like this, she’d surely wake up with a stiff neck tomorrow.\n“She looks so peaceful when she sleeps.”\nGently pulling Eun-ha’s head towards me, it lightly touched my shoulder.\nI wanted to briefly kiss her forehead as she slept, soundly leaning on my shoulder.\nBut I didn’t want to wake her, and the idea of touching her while she slept was a bit embarrassing, so I let it be.\nI took a short break, browsing on my phone.\nMaybe ten minutes had passed?\nEun-ha slowly opened her eyes.\n“Ah...!”\n“You’re awake? You must be really tired these days.”\n“No, I’m not tired at all...”\n“Your sleepy voice doesn’t sound very convincing.”\nEun-ha ran her fingers through her hair and shook her head.\nAwakened from her nap, Eun-ha looked straight into my eyes, her eyes wide.\nThen she smiled broadly and said softly,\n“Waking up to find Han-gyeol here makes me so happy.”\nPhoenix Among Men Chapter 64\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\nI quickly pressed my lips to Eun-ha’s smiling ones.\nWith a soft ‘pop’ as our lips met, Eun-ha’s eyes widened even more.\n“Su-Suddenly...!”\n“Eun-ha, that was to help you wake up.”\n“That was too short.”\n“What-?! Ahh!”\nEun-ha suddenly pulled me towards her with a fierce grip and kissed me passionately.\nShe was no longer holding back in expressing her affection.\n“You’re like a wild animal now.”\n“How far did you get with your studies?”\n“I finished today’s portion.”\n“Wow, really? That was quick.”\n“It’s all thanks to Eun-ha’s good teaching.”\n“Really~? It makes me happy to hear Han-gyeol say that.”\n“I’m happy when Eun-ha’s happy.”\nI didn’t know what to say.\nBeyond words like cute, pretty, and lovely, there was something else.\nI wanted to express my feelings for Eun-ha more accurately, but it was so hard.\nNo matter what I said, it felt inadequate, and in my frustration, I wanted to express my feelings in their rawest form.\n“Whoa-! It’s already ten o’clock?!”\n“Yeah, it’s gotten quite late.”\n“Ah, I shouldn’t have slept. I should have spent more time awake with Han-gyeol.”\n“We can go on a date after the mock exam.”\n“Then we’ll have to start preparing for the finals.”\n“Now that you mention it, yeah.”\nEun-ha collapsed onto the desk, seemingly quite disappointed.\n“Ah, I wish I had met Han-gyeol sooner.”\n“Me too. How great it would have been if I had met Eun-ha earlier.”\n“But still, Han-gyeol said he’d be with me every day from next year, so I’ll wait~”\n“We’ll have to set up a home~ Better get permission from our parents first.”\n“I really want to do that...! Every day would be so much fun.”\n“Me too. I think I’ll be happy every day living with Eun-ha.”\nEun-ha’s happiness seemed to be my happiness, and my happiness seemed to be Eun-ha’s too.\n“Do you think you’ll be happy living with me?”\n“Yeah. I think I’ll be happy every day.”\nEun-ha seemed satisfied with my answer and beamed brightly.\n“Han-gyeol, should we start heading out? Let’s go.”\n“Are you going to walk me out? Just to the front door is fine.”\n“Can’t we walk around the park once? I don’t want to part just yet.”\n“I came on my bike. Want me to give you a ride?”\n“But you teased me last time for being heavy.”\n“Hey, I didn’t directly say that.”\n“You said it indirectly-!”\nEun-ha seemed slightly miffed about that incident.\nI had no choice. I had to completely make it up to her today.\n“It was just to be safe in case you fell. It would have been a big accident. Eun-ha is incredibly light.”\n“I didn’t get that feeling. It seemed like you were struggling a bit.”\n“Eun-ha is as light as a feather, I’m telling you. If we were at my home, I could lift you easily.”\n“Then lift me.”\n“I had a feeling it would come to this, but really?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Hurry up.”\nI slowly got up from my seat.\nEun-ha looked at me with eyes full of anticipation.\n“Even if you get scared, you won’t put me down?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I won’t put you down.”\nI gently placed my arms behind Eun-ha’s calves.\nAs Eun-ha naturally wrapped her arms around my neck, I lifted her up.\n“Wow-! This is fun.”\n“Told you, you’re as light as a feather. Should I not put you down now?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Keep holding me like this.”\n“Okay.”\nAs I swung Eun-ha gently from side to side, her hair whipped around energetically.\n“Ahh-! Han-gyeol, I’m getting dizzy-!”\n“I told you I wouldn’t put you down.”\nI played with Eun-ha until my arms tired, then carefully placed her on the bed.\nIf I ever marry Eun-ha and we have a child, would it feel like this?\nEun-ha looked happily at me for having held her like a princess, although her hair was a complete mess.\n“Your hair is so funny right now.”\n“It’s all because of you, Han-gyeol. But it was fun.”\n“Should we start heading out now?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Going for a walk, right?”\n“Yeah. I wanted to go for a walk with Eun-ha.”\n“Okay.”\nEun-ha hopped off the bed with a bounce.\n“A bunny now?”\n“You said I’m a wild animal now.”\nWe left the room together, Eun-ha donning her outerwear.\n“Brother, I’m going to take a short walk with Han-gyeol and then come back.”\n“Okay. Be careful, both of you.”\n“Yes, yes. See you next week.”\nAfter a brief greeting to Eunwoo Hyung, we stepped outside.\nI unlocked the bicycle as we breathed in the cool night air.\n“Eun-ha, hop on the back.”\n“Where are we going?”\n“How about a lap around the lake park?”\n“Sounds good.”\nEun-ha climbed onto the back of the bicycle and hugged my waist tightly.\n“Eun-ha, if you hold on too tight, I can’t start.”\n“It means to go slowly. Got it?”\n“Okay. I’ll drive safely.”\nEun-ha held onto my waist more firmly than before. When we stopped at the crosswalk, she hugged me even tighter.\nShe had been giving me a lot more physical affection lately. It was a bit embarrassing, but mostly nice.\nAfter reaching the lake park, I secured the bicycle in the bike rack.\n“I wish I could give Han-gyeol a ride too. What a pity.”\n“It’s okay. Let’s take a slow lap around.”\nI held out my hand, and Eun-ha grabbed it eagerly.\n“I remember coming to the lake park late at night with Han-gyeol. It was the day of the March mock exam, and now it’s already the June mock exam.”\n“Yeah, I remember Eun-ha calling me that night. It was really nice.”\n“I felt sorry for calling you so late, but I couldn’t think of anyone but Han-gyeol.”\n“Really? That makes me really happy. Call me anytime when things get tough, like that day.”\nAfter pondering my words for a moment, Eun-ha responded.\n“Okay, I will. But ever since I started dating Han-gyeol, I haven’t had many tough times.”\n“Really? Am I doing that well? I’m glad you think so.”\n“Just being with Han-gyeol... I’ve changed. Before, I guess I couldn’t express my feelings honestly? It’s not that I was always gloomy, but I was clumsy at expressing myself, whether it was with family or friends. I couldn’t just pour out my feelings, but now it’s different.”\nEun-ha continued speaking.\n“Expressing my feelings to others isn’t difficult anymore. It’s definitely because of Han-gyeol. You always ask about my feelings, accept them, and understand them. Feeling completely understood by someone is so great. That’s why I’ve changed. And I like myself now, changed thanks to Han-gyeol, much more than before.”\nEun-ha glanced up at me, her face illuminated and made brighter by the moonlight.\n“That’s why I like Han-gyeol so~ much. Crazy much.”\n“I also really like that Eun-ha likes me. You’re so cute and lovable, I really want to bite you.”\n“That much? Han-gyeol can bite me if he wants.”\n“Really? Weren’t you the wild animal?”\n“Han-gyeol can be quite the beast too.”\n“So, should I really bite?”\n“Go ahead, try?”\nNo sooner had Eun-ha finished speaking, I playfully bit her head.\n“Ahh-! You really bit me!”\nEun-ha jumped in surprise and covered her head.\n“I did it because Eun-ha is too cute.”\n“Come here. I want to bite Han-gyeol too.”\n“No way, Eun-ha. I didn’t give you permission.”\n“Oh, why-!”\nI walked ahead, leaving Eun-ha behind.\n“Han-gyeol, why are you running away again?”\n“If you catch me, you’ll bite me.”\n“That’s right. I want to bite Han-gyeol too.”\n“Who would willingly let a wild animal bite them?”\n“I’ll only bite lightly, so come here quickly.”\nInstead of running away like last time, I approached Eun-ha, who grabbed my arm tightly. She then stood on her toes and gently pressed her lips against my cheek.\n“I told you not to bite.”\n“Ah, now I might have to bite a bit harder.”\n“Then give me another kiss.”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, Eun-ha pressed her lips to mine more intensely. We had planned to make just one lap around that day, but we ended up walking for an hour before finally heading home.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As I recalled the mock exams in March, my enthusiasm burned even brighter.\nToday, I was determined to showcase my true abilities.\nNo more mistakes in my life.\nBut I wondered, was that too much?\n“Eun-ha, it looks like there are flames in your eyes.”\n“Of course. Today, I will take the test with all my might.”\n“Cool down a bit. You should approach the test calmly and steadily.”\n“Han-gyeol, on the other hand...”\nHan-gyeol had been incessantly eating chocolate since earlier.\nThe chocolate wrappers strewn across the desk seemed to number over ten.\n“Aren’t you eating too much chocolate?”\n“Eating chocolate helps me concentrate. If I eat about twenty, I’ll become a god of concentration.”\n“Maybe you should stop. What if you can’t solve the problems because you’re too full?”\n“Should I run a lap around the playground outside?”\nHan-gyeol seemed just as nervous.\n“You weren’t nervous at all during the March mock exams.”\n“That was the beginning of the semester. I didn’t have high expectations then.”\n“You need to take the test calmly and steadily, too. Let’s give ourselves some positive affirmations. I’ll help.”\nTrying to ease the tension, I subtly took Han-gyeol’s hand.\nIt was a plausible excuse, but I had to admit there was a bit of selfishness in it.\nMaybe about forty-five percent?\n“Does holding hands help you relax a bit?”\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book Lovers: Literary Love Lines\n“No. It actually feels like my nervousness has increased.”\n“Do you still get nervous when I hold your hand? Why?”\nWe held hands whenever we could, yet Han-gyeol still seemed fluttered by it.\n“A prey animal caught by a predator, perhaps?”\n“If you keep calling me that, I might really bite you hard.”\nIt seems that ‘predator’ had become my nickname before I knew it.\nBut considering my recent behavior, I couldn’t outright deny it.\n“This isn’t the savanna forest, Eun-ha. It’s a school.”\n“Anyway, don’t be too nervous today. It’s not even the real college entrance exam.”\nI gently stroked Han-gyeol’s head.\n“I’ll do my best.”\n“Still feeling nervous?”\n“A little bit of tension is not bad, you know.”\n“Your hand seems a bit shaky, Han-gyeol.”\n“It’s because I’m holding hands with Eun-ha.”\nHis words were so sweet that I held his hand a bit tighter.\n“It’s okay. You’ll do well, Han-gyeol. You’ve worked hard so far.”\n“Thanks for believing in me. You’ll do great too, Eun-ha. We’ve worked hard together.”\n“Yeah. We’ll both do well.”\nWe eased our nervousness by supporting each other.\nSoon, the other students started entering the classroom early.\nThen the homeroom teacher came in and changed our seating arrangements.\n“Everyone, I know you’re nervous, but don’t be too stressed. Take the test with the mindset of not making mistakes, okay?”\n“Yes~”\nAfter a brief morning assembly, the supervising teacher entered.\nSeeing the teacher bustling about made me a bit nervous.\nTime passed, and soon the OMR answer sheets and questionnaires were placed in front of us.\nThe teacher announced the start of the exam, and I opened the questionnaire.\nKorean was a subject I was confident in, but I solved the problems more carefully than usual.\nI read the passages in detail and carefully considered each option before confidently moving on to the next question.\nThe difficulty seemed similar to the March mock exam, so it wasn’t too hard.\nAfter solving all the questions, I reviewed my answers and the questionnaire alternately.\nWith about three minutes left until the end of the exam, I reopened the questionnaire.\nI marked with a star the questions that Han-gyeol might have found difficult.\n“Alright, everyone, hands on your heads.”\nAs the bell rang, all the students in the class raised their hands over their heads.\nWhile the answer sheets and questionnaires were being collected, I immediately glanced at Han-gyeol’s expression.\nLike me, Han-gyeol had his hands raised, staring blankly at the blackboard.\nIt was impossible to tell from his expression whether he had done well or not in the test.\n“Alright, do well in the next exam too~”\nAs soon as the teacher left, I headed straight to where Han-gyeol was.\n“Han-gyeol, how was it? Did you do well in the Korean exam?”\n“Huh? I think I did well. Seems like I’ll get a good score.”\n“Wow-?! Really? That’s great. You’ve worked so hard.”\n“Yeah. And you, Eun-ha? Did you do well?”\n“I always ace Korean~”\nMy boastful remark made Han-gyeol laugh heartily.\n“You did well. You’ve worked hard.”\n“You too, Han-gyeol. I’ve been pushing you too hard, haven’t I?”\n“What are you talking about? You’ve helped me so much. Any improvement in my grades is all thanks to you, Eun-ha.”\n“Really? Ah~ Hearing Han-gyeol say that makes it all worthwhile.”\n“Let’s do our best in the math exam too. I’m going to step out to the restroom for a bit.”\n“Okay~ See you after the math exam.”\nI returned to my seat and revisited the problem that had stumped me during the March mock exams.\nNow, I could solve it even with my eyes closed, I had reviewed it so much. I was no longer afraid.\nHan-gyeol returned from the restroom, and soon after, the next supervising teacher entered the classroom.\nThen the math exam, which I had feared and prepared for the most, began.\nDon’t be nervous.\nDon’t get anxious.\nI kept telling myself these affirmations as I carefully worked through the questions, starting from number one.\nIf I couldn’t solve a question after dedicating a certain amount of time, I bravely moved on.\nAfter completing all the problems, I returned to the beginning to work through them again.\nI should have done this sooner.\nDoing it this way left me with quite a bit of time to spare.\nThe 100 minutes felt long, but I managed to complete the review.\nAfter thoroughly checking my calculations, I even revisited the last problem, which I had given up on halfway through. Compared to the situation in March, there was an undeniable sense of stability now.\nRight after the math exam ended and lunchtime began, I rushed to Han-gyeol’s seat.\n“Han-gyeol~!”\n“Yeah, Eun-ha?”\n“I think I did really well in math...! It feels like I scored my best ever. I only guessed on two questions.”\n“I knew you would do well. You’ve been working incredibly hard. It’s only natural you did great.”\n“Still, actually feeling it firsthand is so reassuring and makes me incredibly happy.”\n“You have such a beautiful smile. Shall we go have lunch now?”\n“Sounds great. I’m even hungrier today after the exam.”\n“Let’s not eat too much though, or we might get sleepy.”\n“Yeah, yeah. Let’s hurry. There’s probably going to be a line.”\nWe headed straight to the cafeteria.\n“I know it’s an obvious question, but did you do well in math, Han-gyeol?”\n“Yeah, it went as usual.”\n“Wow- As usual? That’s really cool.”\n“Wasn’t it annoying?”\n“Not at all~ I’m so proud of you.”\nI playfully ruffled Han-gyeol’s hair.\n“Eun-ha, you did great too.”\nHan-gyeol then gently stroked my hair.\nWith the warmth and happiness, I felt like I could do well in the remaining exams too.\n***\nAfter lunch, it was straight to the English exam.\nWith my ears perked up, I completed the listening assessment and quickly moved on to solving the problems.\nI felt I had finished both the Korean and elective subjects without any mistakes, true to my usual performance.\n“Alright, everyone, hands on your heads. You’ve all worked hard taking this mock exam.”\nFinally, the last subject was over.\nI felt great having completed all the subjects without any errors.\nThough I didn’t expect to rank first in every subject, the results were satisfying enough.\nA sense of accomplishment kept making the corners of my mouth rise.\nAfter the supervising teacher left, everyone in the class just collapsed onto their desks.\n“Ugh~ Finally, it’s over.”\n“Ah, my whole body aches now that the tension is gone.”\n“I was so tense during the exam, I thought I was going to get a cramp in my calf.”\n“Still, the difficulty didn’t seem much different from March, did it?”\n“It did seem similar. But the March mock exam was a bit tougher, wasn’t it?”\n“Ah, so the grade boundaries will probably be similar to March’s.”\n“Probably. I guess we’ll see the predicted grade boundaries by tomorrow.”\nWhile the students were chatting, the homeroom teacher entered the classroom with a bag of cell phones.\n“Alright, you all worked really hard on the June mock exam. For those who did well, don’t get complacent, and for those who made mistakes, don’t be disheartened. Got it? With less than half a year left until the college entrance exam, some of you might start to slack off. This is the time to stay focused and keep pushing. Everyone, go home and rest well today. This concludes the homeroom session. Head home.”\nI hurriedly gathered my things and rushed over to Han-gyeol’s seat.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s go home now.”\n“Yeah. Just a moment, let me gather my things.”\n“Sure, take your time.”\nWe packed our bags and left the classroom.\nBut as we stepped out of the school, I noticed something subtle in Han-gyeol’s expression.\nHalfway down the road home, Han-gyeol stopped walking.\n“Hey, Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“I have something to tell you.”\n“What is it?”\nHan-gyeol hesitated, then looked at me weakly.\nThen, uncharacteristically hesitating, he spoke to me with difficulty.\n“I don’t think I’ll get a grade 1 in Korean. I’m sorry for lying.”\n“Huh...?”\n“When I checked, I scored 85. It seems that score won’t be enough for a grade 1. I lied because I didn’t want to affect your remaining exams if I said I did poorly in Korean. I’m sorry... I’m sorry I let you down after all your help...”\nHan-gyeol’s voice trailed off weakly.\nHearing his dejected voice made my heart ache.\nI regretted perhaps having put too much pressure on Han-gyeol.\nI felt sorry, thinking I might have made things harder for him with my stubbornness.\nBut what I needed to offer Han-gyeol now was not an apology.\nI thought about what comforting words I could offer to Han-gyeol, who looked so troubled.\nWords a girlfriend can offer to her boyfriend when he’s struggling.\nWords to say when someone is pushing themselves over the edge with guilt.\nJust saying ‘it’s okay’? That seemed like something anyone could say.\n‘Next time will be better’? That too felt too cliché.\nAs numerous thoughts raced through my mind, one particular thought settled in.\nI embraced Han-gyeol, who was lost in his gloom.\nHoping my sincerity would reach him, that these words would comfort him, I said:\n“Don’t be sorry. And don’t force yourself to be so strong.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Don’t be sorry. And don’t force yourself to be so strong.”\nWith just one sentence from Eun-ha, my heart sank with a heavy thud.\nA part of my heart began to ache incessantly.\nIt was probably just a word of comfort for not being able to achieve the target...\nJust that, and yet, my heart was in constant turmoil.\nAt the same time, it was hard to suppress the whirlwind of emotions swirling inside.\nI bit my teeth hard, trying to endure, but it wasn’t easy.\nI struggled to escape the words Eun-ha had spoken, but the more I tried, the deeper I seemed to be drawn in.\nI knew my current emotions were utterly unexpected.\nBut it felt like I’d longed to hear these words from someone for a very long time.\n“You worked hard. Let’s take a break.”\nEun-ha snuggled into my embrace and said.\nI hugged her tighter, wanting to feel more of Eun-ha’s warmth.\n“Thank you for saying that.”\n“Han-gyeol seems a bit tired, should I carry you home?”\n“How could Eun-ha carry me? It’s not okay, you’ll get hurt.”\n“Ah- you never know until you try. I’ll carry you!”\nEun-ha stepped out of my arms and swung her bag to the front.\nThen, showing me her small back, she told me to get on.\n“Han-gyeol, hop on.”\n“It seems like you will collapse immediately.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ve gotten stronger lately.”\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book Lovers: Literary Love Lines\nEun-ha was so confident that I cautiously wrapped my arms around her neck.\nDue to the height difference, she couldn’t fully carry me, but Eun-ha struggled forward, grunting.\nI was dragged along but we collapsed without even making it a meter.\n“Ugh- it’s indeed too much.”\n“I told you so.”\n“Ah- I wish I could carry Han-gyeol around like this too. Should I start doing strength training?”\n“Why go to such lengths.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha adjusted her bag again and said to me.\n“But still, I want to be able to give Han-gyeol a ride on my bicycle when he’s tired, or carry him like this.”\n“Huh? Just hugging me like now is enough. That’s plenty of strength for me.”\n“Still, I want to do for Han-gyeol what he does for me.”\n“Really? Then don’t carry me, just do something else.”\n“Just say it. I’ll even pluck the stars from the sky for you!”\nI couldn’t help but laugh at Eun-ha’s spirited behavior.\n“Let’s go out and have fun, considering we’ve been buried in studies lately.”\n“Where do you want to go? The movies? Karaoke? A PC room?”\n“I want to hang out at Eun-ha’s place, eating delicious food till late.”\n“Really? What do you want to eat? Chicken? Pizza? Pork? Bossam? Spicy pork? Tonkatsu?”\n“Hmm- I want both chicken and pizza.”\n“Okay. Let’s have a party today since the June mock exams are over. Party.”\nEun-ha was trying her best to lighten my mood.\nNormally, I would have said it was okay, but today, I decided to just go with it.\n“Right. Let’s party today.”\n“Let’s go quickly, not to waste time. We’ll order food when we get home.”\nEun-ha and I headed straight for her house.\nAs we got on the elevator, I suddenly wondered if someone was at home.\n“But is anyone at your place?”\n“My brother might be. He hasn’t been going out lately.”\n“I see. We can order various foods and share.”\n“Yeah, let’s do that. But we’re claiming the chicken legs.”\nWe got off the elevator and pressed the door lock code.\nWhen we opened the door and entered, there were no shoes to be seen.\n“What? Looks like he’s out, seeing there are no shoes.”\n“Just change clothes and then call to check.”\n“Yeah, yeah. Han-gyeol, your clothes are in my brother’s room, right? Change and come out.”\n“Okay. Eun-ha, no peeking~”\n“Who, who’s peeking-!”\n“Just kidding~”\nI teased Eun-ha and headed towards Eunwoo Hyung’s room.\nThe moment I opened the door and stepped in, something startled me.\n“Wow!”\nWhen someone suddenly screamed, my first thought amidst the shock was to protect Eun-ha.\nOvercoming the stiffness that gripped my body, I immediately grabbed the unidentified assailant by the chest.\nI placed my foot in front of the assailant’s and used my right foot as a pivot to rotate my left foot.\nAs I pulled the assailant’s arm, their feet lifted off the ground.\n“Uh-?”\nThe assailant uttered briefly, suspended in mid-air.\nThen with a loud bang, I threw them onto the floor.\nThe noise must have been loud, as Eun-ha quickly burst out of the room.\n“Han-gyeol-! What was that noise?!”\n“Eun-ha! Call the police...! The police...!”\n“Ugh...”\nDespite feeling scared and anxious, I held onto the assailant’s arm tightly.\n“Dad! What are you doing over there?!”\n“Where?! Where is your father-?!”\nI couldn’t comprehend the situation and looked around.\nBut other than me, Eun-ha, and the assailant, there was no one else.\n“Han-gyeol...! That, that man is my dad-!”\n“Excuse me?!”\nOh no. This is bad.\n“Is that your father...?”\n“Could you, could you let go of him first...?”\n***\nEun-ha was applying a plaster to her father’s back as he lay on the sofa.\n“Ow! What the! Dad, why were you scaring Han-gyeol like that?!”\n“I was just curious to see how strong your boyfriend’s heart is. Didn’t expect him to be this strong.”\n“I’m so sorry-! I didn’t realize and...! Are you hurt badly?”\nI apologized sincerely from the center of the living room, bowing deeply.\n“Your name is Han-gyeol, right? Do you know what my dream was when I was young?”\n“No. What was your childhood dream...?”\n“You see, ever since I was young, I used to look up at the sky whenever things got tough.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n“Looking at the vast sky, it felt like my mind was clearing up. It was comforting.”\n“I see.”\n“So, as a child, I dreamed of being a pilot, soaring in the sky. But my parents insisted that a pilot was out of the question and sent me to engineering. Nevertheless, I always kept the unfulfilled dream of being a pilot hidden in a corner of my heart.”\nSuddenly, what is he talking about?\n“Thanks to Han-gyeol, I finally fulfilled that dream today. Even if it was just for a moment, I flew.”\n“I’m so sorryyy!”\nIt was a buildup.\n“Don’t say things that would trouble Han-gyeol! Don’t mind it, Han-gyeol. My dad’s childhood dream changes every day.”\n“But still, I’m worried if you’re seriously hurt.”\n“Hahahaha! It’s okay! It’s okay! I’m actually happy that my daughter’s boyfriend is a strong man! Isn’t this what young people these days call a huge win?”\n“Huge win, what? I’m dying here-! How did you know we were coming and why were you hiding there?!”\n“I casually asked my son about the return time~ But you came later than I thought? Emptied the shoe rack and waited.”\n“Dad. Why go to such lengths?”\n“Just for fun~”\nHe had the same personality as Eunwoo Hyung...\n“I’m still sorry, though.”\n“Don’t be. If anyone should apologize, it’s me. Sorry for the mischievous prank. So, how is it dating my daughter?”\n“Ah, it’s incredibly happy! I receive a lot of help from Eun-ha. We spend every day laughing.”\n“Oh~ My daughter is that good?”\n“Yes. She’s very kind and gentle.”\n“Eh? We don’t have such a person at home- Aaack! Daughter! Dad is hurting!”\nEun-ha pinched her father’s waist.\n“Just say nice things...”\n“I see you were right. My daughter is kind and gentle. Although she mercilessly pinches her father’s waist.”\n“Yes. I’m learning a lot while dating her.”\n“That’s good to hear. Ah, you haven’t eaten dinner, right? Buy something with this.”\nEun-ha’s father laboriously took out a card from his trouser pocket.\n“We’ll gratefully have it.”\n“But when did you come, Dad?”\n“Came this afternoon. I’ll be here for a few days.”\n“Is the project you were working on finished?”\n“Well, it’s finished for now.”\nI was simply listening to the father-daughter conversation.\nEun-ha kindly explained for my benefit.\n“Ah, my dad’s a developer.”\n“How about it? Want to work under me, my daughter’s boyfriend? I’ll treat you well.”\n“Thank you for the offer, but programming doesn’t seem to be my calling.”\n“Is that so? That’s a pity. Well, spending all day with your father-in-law can be a bit much, right?! Hahaha! But it’s the son-in-law who should feel uncomfortable, not me, right?”\n“You’re getting ahead of yourself...! We haven’t even been dating for a year. We’re still students.”\n“So what? Love either ends in marriage or break-up. If you’re going to do it, better do it early.”\nThe tension was so high, it wasn’t easy to keep up.\nBut then, Eun-ha looked at me with a slightly expectant look.\nShould I respond? What if she thought I was presumptuous?\n“If you give your permission... I’d like to.”\n“Wow, straightforward, I like that. How many kids are you thinking?”\nThat far?\nEven Eun-ha seemed to think this question was a bit too soon.\nShe pressed her father’s waist with her finger.\n“What are you talking about?!”\n“Ouch! Daughter. You’ll break your dad’s back.”\n“Don’t say things like that to Han-gyeol. Children...! We’re still high school students.”\n“Just asking, that’s all.”\nHer father chuckled.\nStill, if Eun-ha and I were to marry soon...\n“How about one daughter and one son?”\nAt my remark, Eun-ha and her father just looked at me silently.\nMaybe that was too much. But then her father burst into laughter.\n“Hahahaha! Yes! Have a daughter and a son! Will the first be a girl?”\n“What are you saying, Han-gyeol?!”\nEun-ha’s exasperated reaction echoed alongside her father’s laughter.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“May I call you my son-in-law?”\n“Then, can I call you father?”\nI felt a bit of a connection with the father, just like I did with Eunwoo Hyung.\nI was relieved. I had worried he might not like me and asked us to break up.\nEven if he had said that, we would have continued our relationship in secret.\n“Hahaha! Yes! That’s great! It’s refreshing to see such heartiness.”\n“Aren’t we disturbing you on your rare day off?”\n“Not at all. Don’t worry about it. Honestly, it’s my first time seeing my daughter’s boyfriend, so it’s quite fascinating. I should take a good look.”\nFather looked at me intently.\nI straightened my back and smiled slightly, looking up at him.\nI tried to look as respectful and dignified as possible, meeting his gaze.\n“Well, what kind of questions should I ask my daughter’s boyfriend?”\n“Feel free to ask. I won’t lie.”\n“What if I ask something difficult?”\n“Then I’ll honestly say it’s hard to answer.”\n“Ha! I like your honesty. Then, I’ll start with what I’m most curious about.”\n“Sure. Please ask.”\nI wonder if he’s going to ask about my parents?\nNo, it’s probably too early for that kind of question.\nWhat is my dream? That’s a bit hard to answer.\nI haven’t decided on a career yet.\n“How far have you and my daughter progressed-”\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book Lovers: Literary Love Lines\n“Daaad!”\nEun-ha, who was sitting next to me, quickly covered Father’s mouth.\n“Why would you ask that-! Really-!”\n“Daughter! As a father, don’t you think that’s a reasonable question?!”\n“We haven’t crossed any student boundaries, so don’t worry! We’re dating properly, like students should!”\n“If that’s the case, I’m relieved. But still, as a father, I’d advise you to date properly like students should.”\n“We’ll keep that in mind. You don’t need to worry.”\nHe didn’t say it gravely, but I chose to take it seriously.\nBut when he said to date like students, he must be referring to how it is in high school, right?\n“Hahaha! Don’t take it too seriously. But do keep it in your heart.”\nIt seemed right to take it seriously after all.\nHe wasn’t frightening but spoke kindly, a clear indication he was Eun-ha’s father.\nHis gentleness and consideration were palpable.\n“Are you hungry? Let’s order some food. Don’t worry about the price.”\n“Yes, I understand. Eun-ha, let’s order.”\n“Oh, the flatfish sashimi from the restaurant near our place is really good. I’d like to have it after so long.”\n“Then, I’ll go out and get it to-go.”\n“Eh? No, let Eun-ha go.”\n“Okay. Han-gyeol, let’s go together.”\n“No need for both of you to go. Eun-ha can go alone.”\nI felt a bit nervous at his words.\nEven so, it might be a bit awkward to be alone together.\nI looked at Eun-ha, sending a signal for help.\n“It’s boring to go alone. I’ll go with Han-gyeol.”\n“Don’t trouble the guest. Go on now.”\n“Ah-”\nEun-ha glanced at me slyly.\nWith him saying that, there was nothing I could do.\nI had to give up.\n“Be careful. The flatfish sashimi will be delicious.”\n“I’ll be back soon, so Dad, don’t say anything weird to Han-gyeol, okay?”\n“Daughter, I really like Han-gyeol. I won’t say anything strange, so don’t worry and go.”\n“Really, don’t say anything weird to Han-gyeol... Got it?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Go on now.”\nEun-ha stood up from her seat.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll be back quickly. Just wait a moment.”\n“Take your time and be careful. You might trip if you rush.”\n“I’ll be back quickly-!”\nAs soon as Eun-ha hurried out the front door, an awkward atmosphere set in.\nI constantly thought about what to talk about, but nothing seemed right.\nIf only I knew what Eun-ha’s father liked, I could keep the conversation going.\nBut as I was thinking, her father initiated the conversation.\n“So, you’re a student preparing for exams. Any difficulties? It must be hard balancing love and studies.”\n“I can’t say there are none, but I’m not giving up on either. Eun-ha helps me a lot, too.”\n“Is that so? That’s good to hear. Where do you usually go on dates?”\n“We mostly spend time studying together at Eun-ha’s house. When we go out, it’s just ordinary stuff like eating delicious food, watching movies, or going to karaoke. Sometimes, when we have more time, we venture out of the neighborhood, but not too often.”\nIt seemed he was curious about how his daughter was spending her time.\nDid I sound too report-like in my response? I hope it was okay.\n“Where do you go when you leave the neighborhood?”\n“Ah, we went to the amusement park after the midterms were over. Eun-ha wanted to go.”\n“Oh? Eun-ha suggested going to the amusement park?”\n“Yes. She’s really good at riding scary rides... We were lucky it wasn’t crowded, so we rode almost everything.”\nThere was a moment of silence from her father after my response.\nThen, with a slightly puzzled tone, he asked,\n“Eun-ha wanted to go to the amusement park?”\n“Yes. She really enjoyed herself there.”\n“I see... You went to the amusement park. Must have been fun.”\nFather smiled wistfully.\nDid I say something wrong?\n“We went to the amusement park with the family once.”\n“Yes, Eun-ha told me about a family trip to the amusement park when she was in elementary school.”\n“Right, around that time. But we haven’t gone since then.”\n“Oh, were you very busy?”\n“It was Eun-ha’s birthday then, and my wife and I were extremely busy. We managed to make time, but we were so tired that day, we couldn’t enjoy ourselves. Our kind daughter saw us and didn’t insist on going on many rides, suggesting we go home instead.”\n“Oh, I see...”\nI recalled Eun-ha’s particularly joyful face that day.\nIf I had known earlier, I would have made it even more fun for her.\n“It’s bittersweet and admirable, a fifth grader asking to go home because her parents looked tired. We thought we’d go back another time and just went home. But since then, whenever I suggested going to the amusement park, she refused. She didn’t want to disturb our rare moments of rest.”\nEun-ha’s kindness and thoughtfulness had been there since she was young.\nIt was a part of her charm, but somehow, it also felt a bit sad.\n“Since then, she would say it’s okay even if she wanted something or wanted to do something as a family. She would say it’s okay to speak her mind, but how could she, raised by parents like us? She would just nod her head, saying it was all right. And you’re telling me she suggested going to the amusement park? That really makes me happy. Thank you for indulging my daughter’s whims, for showing me this new side of her.”\nI felt a bit shy at his words, but it was a good feeling.\n“I don’t think I’m just indulging Eun-ha’s whims. It might be me who is being indulged. Whenever I’m even slightly down, Eun-ha goes all out to cheer me up. I’m just returning what I’ve received to Eun-ha. It’s not her whims; it’s the kindness and consideration she learned from her wonderful parents.”\nAt my words, father just stared into my eyes, speechless.\n“Is that so? I appreciate you saying that.”\n“No, I’m the one who should be grateful for being accepted to date a person like Eun-ha.”\n“Hahaha! Is that so?! Well then, keep up the good relationship.”\n“Yes, don’t worry. I’ll make sure she’s happy and take responsibility.”\nAs I smiled contentedly, the sound of the door lock’s keypad being pressed came from the entrance.\nWith a click, the door opened and Eun-ha rushed in.\n“Dad! There was no flatfish, so I bought flounder!”\nEun-ha, who dashed into the living room and sat next to me, immediately checked on my well-being.\n“Han-gyeol, did Dad say anything weird?”\n“Daughter, does your dad look that unreliable?”\n“Brother always says weird things to Han-gyeol.”\n“Is your brother the same as Dad?”\n“Exactly the same...”\n“Daughter?”\nDespite her father’s questioning look, Eun-ha stared intently into my eyes.\n“He only said nice things.”\n“Really? He didn’t make it difficult for you?”\n“Yeah, you came back really fast.”\n“I told you I’d be quick~”\nEun-ha beamed a bright smile.\n“Since Eun-ha bought it, I’ll set the table.”\n“No, let’s do it together.”\n“No, it’s rare for you to be home. It’s nice to spend time together.”\n“Right, right. Daughter, how far have you two progressed- Uh!”\nEun-ha sprang up like a spring and covered her father’s mouth.\n“Why would you ask that-! We’ll handle it ourselves, okay?”\n“Now that you mention it, daughter, what are your plans for children?”\n“Ugh, don’t ask that! That’s still a long way off-!”\n“You’ve thought about it?”\nEun-ha’s face looked like it was about to explode at her father’s counter-question.\nFinding her so adorable, I playfully chimed in.\n“Eun-ha~ I’d be happy with just the two~”\nAt my words, Eun-ha puffed up her cheeks and looked at me.\nThen she whispered softly.\n“For me, that’s not enough.”\nAt Eun-ha’s words, I froze.\nWhat?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After enjoying a variety of foods including sashimi, we turned on the gaming console.\nHan-gyeol and I played a few rounds before passing the controller to Dad.\n“Ah, we should make this interesting with a bet. Hey, son-in-law, how about a little wager?”\n“Sure. What kind of bet?”\n“How about a simple favor?”\n“Alright. I won’t go easy on you.”\n“Haha, my daughter, Han-gyeol is challenging me?”\n“Han-gyeol, do well! Dad might lose, you know?”\n“Don’t underestimate experience.”\nEventually, the match between Dad and Han-gyeol began.\nThough I felt sorry for Dad, I eagerly cheered for Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol, Dad doesn’t know the combo moves well. Just corner him and keep hitting low.”\n“Daughter…? Even if it’s just a game, aren’t you too biased towards Han-gyeol? I feel left out.”\n“Dad, I think you’ll ask Han-gyeol for a difficult favor.”\n“You caught me. Ah! He really is just hitting low!”\nI watched Dad and Han-gyeol play intensely from behind.\nDad was gritting his teeth and fervently pressing the controller, and Han-gyeol was equally focused.\nEver since Han-gyeol started visiting our house, it seems to have become more lively and warm.\nI don’t dislike quiet, but I wish our home was always bustling.\nA home where someone is always there to welcome you back and see you off.\nThinking of such a future with Han-gyeol made me incredibly happy.\nI think it will be very blissful.\n5-Star Small Town Romance Books To ...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n5-Star Small Town Romance Books To Read [BOOK REC]\n“You’re better than I thought. I didn’t think you’d be good at games.”\n“I practiced to play with Eun-ha. You’re good too, sir.”\n“I can’t keep hearing from my daughter that I don’t know the combos.”\nI’m extremely happy now, too.\nAs time passed, the bet ended with Han-gyeol’s victory.\nHe looked at me joyfully.\n“Eun-ha, I won.”\n“Yeah, you did great! What will you ask for your favor?”\n“What should I ask for? Will you really do anything?”\nHan-gyeol immediately looked at Dad as if he had something in mind.\n“A man should be decisive. I won’t hesitate.”\n“Wow, that’s so cool. Then, I’ll say it.”\nI was incredibly curious about what Han-gyeol was about to ask for.\nI couldn’t even guess what it might be.\n“So, what do you want?”\n“I’d like to go on a 1-night, 2-day trip with Eun-ha after the college entrance exams.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, both Dad and I were stunned.\nWe never imagined Han-gyeol would ask for something like that.\n“A trip for 1 night and 2 days with Eun-ha?”\n“Yes. Of course, it will be after the exams and once we both turn twenty.”\n“So, you mean to say you want to go on a trip just the two of you?”\n“Yes, that’s right.”\nDad was hesitant to respond to Han-gyeol’s proposal.\nBut just moments ago, he boasted about being decisive like a man.\n“Alright. I’ll allow it.”\n“Wow, really? Thank you so much.”\n“But it has to be next year. There is no such thing as premature timing.”\n“Understood. Thank you for permitting it.”\nHan-gyeol smiled contentedly and then looked at me.\nI never knew Han-gyeol could be so direct in asking for permission from Dad.\n“Eun-ha, you should thank your father too.”\n“Oh- Uh, thanks, Dad, for allowing it.”\nStill, Dad seemed slightly worried.\nI’m not usually a doting daughter, but I tried to ease Dad’s concerns.\n“Dad, you’re the best.”\n“Hmm-!”\n“Right. Father, you are the best.”\n“Hmm-!”\nWhen Han-gyeol joined in, the corners of Dad’s mouth lifted slightly.\n“Did Dad just smile? Han-gyeol, you saw it too, right?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I definitely saw it.”\n“Are you kids teasing an adult now?”\n“But you’re smiling, aren’t you?”\n“What can I do? It’s funny. Indeed, it’s better to go with permission than sneak away.”\n“Thank you.”\nOnce Dad seemed convinced, Han-gyeol and I burst into laughter.\n“Eun-ha, should we start cleaning up?”\n“Yeah, let’s tidy up. Dad, you rest.”\n“Ah, how can I? I should help too.”\n“No, it’s okay. I want to do it with Eun-ha.”\n“Alright. I want to clean up with Han-gyeol too.”\nHan-gyeol was tactful, making sure Dad didn’t feel burdened.\nI also pitched in, and Dad nodded silently.\n“I’m all for relaxing~!”\n“Yes. Please take a rest~”\nHan-gyeol started clearing the dishes and headed to the kitchen.\n“Dad. What do you think about Han-gyeol?”\n“I already heard from your mom that he’s a good kid.”\n“Really? What do you think now that you’ve met him?”\n“Now that I see him, he’s even better.”\n“Right? I’ll go help Han-gyeol too~”\nI got up from my seat with a smile. But then Dad asked me.\n“Daughter, are you happy now?”\n“Yes. Incredibly happy.”\n“Then that’s all that matters.”\nAs Dad smiled, I smiled back at him.\nAfter finishing the cleanup with Han-gyeol, we prepared to leave.\nHan-gyeol, with his bag on, greeted at the shoe rack.\n“Father, I had a great time today. I hope to see you again when the opportunity arises.”\n“Sure. Come visit often. I was glad to meet you too.”\n“Yes. I’ll see you next time.”\n“Dad, I’ll walk Han-gyeol out a bit.”\n“Okay. Go ahead.”\nHan-gyeol bowed to Dad one last time before stepping out of the house with me.\n“Han-gyeol, you weren’t uncomfortable because of Dad today, were you?”\n“It was only enjoyable. I’m grateful he thought well of me.”\n“Really? That’s a relief.”\nI quietly interlocked my hand with Han-gyeol’s.\n“Oh right. Where should we go for our trip?”\n“What do you think, Han-gyeol? Maybe a ski resort since it’s winter?”\n“I like that idea.”\nWe took the elevator down and, as usual, strolled around our complex.\n“Han-gyeol, how about we take a walk around the lake park before heading home?”\n“We always say ‘just one round’ and end up walking for an hour.”\n“True. So, shall we walk for an hour then?”\n“No way. Your dad might get bored. Let’s just head in today, as much as I hate to.”\nHan-gyeol gently wrapped his arms around me.\nWhen he does this, I just don’t want to let him go.\n“Let’s go home and tell your dad all about us. He seemed really curious.”\n“My dad? What did he say when I went to buy the sashimi earlier?”\n“Hm? Just asked how we’re getting along and how you’ve been lately. I think I gave him a vague answer. You should tell him more details.”\n“Was there anything else he said?”\n“Man-to-man loyalty, I guess. Can’t quite spill everything~”\nIt seemed like Han-gyeol was hiding something.\n“...”\n“What? That’s intriguing! I know, But if you’re curious, let’s go in and ask. Your dad might feel left out if you’re just with your boyfriend. Today, let’s tell him how we met and what we’ve been up to. You know, since he hasn’t been home much, he hasn’t had many chances to talk.”\nHan-gyeol was right.\nDefinitely... Dad’s been busy and hasn’t been home much, so we haven’t had many opportunities to talk.\nI decided to have a bit of a conversation with Dad, now that I no longer just keep my feelings to myself.\n“Okay. Shall I head in now?”\n“Yeah. Tell me later how it went.”\n“If we talk all day, can I call you even at dawn?”\n“Of course. I’m going. Be careful going in, Eun-ha.”\n“Take care. See you at school tomorrow. Sorry, I can’t walk you further.”\n“No worries. Just go in. I’ll watch you enter.”\n“Okay. Going now~ Bye~”\nAfter receiving a handshake from Han-gyeol, I entered the house.\n“Did Han-gyeol leave okay?”\n“Yes. He left fine.”\nDad was lying on the sofa, just watching television.\n“What are you watching, Dad?”\n“Billiards. Amazing how they make those shots.”\n“Dad, do you like billiards?”\n“Huh? Just watching it out of curiosity.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nI leaned back against the sofa.\nTalking to Dad about Han-gyeol and me was a bit embarrassing.\nBut since Dad seemed curious, I mustered up some courage.\n“Han-gyeol has been my classmate since senior year.”\n“Huh? Why bring that up suddenly?”\nTalking about this while facing Dad was still a bit difficult.\n“At first, I just thought he was a nice guy. He’d help carry heavy things and explain things I didn’t understand. He even came over to help my brother build his computer and was nice to Mom and my brother. For White Day, he made chocolates for me and comforted me when I did poorly on the March mock exam. I was really grateful for that.”\nSince Dad didn’t respond, I continued.\n“He’s mature, kind, and caring. We study hard together, go to karaoke, and eat a lot of tasty food. We even went to an amusement park during the last midterm.”\n“Really? Did you enjoy it?”\n“Yes. It reminded me of when we all went to the amusement park together.”\nDad looked intently at my face.\n“We didn’t have that much fun that day, did we?”\n“Really? I only remember it being super fun.”\n“Ah… really?”\n“Yes. Why?”\n“Nothing. It’s nice to see you dating so sweetly.”\n“Right? I think so too.”\nI smiled, and Dad responded with a smile that looked just like mine.\n“Ah, right. Han-gyeol thinks a ski resort would be nice.”\n“Sweetie, you don’t ski or snowboard, do you?”\n“That’s true. Dad, do you have any ideas? Somewhere with beautiful snow?”\n“Daegwallyeong Snow Festival is nice, but it’s definitely cold.”\n“Then let’s skip it. Can’t have Han-gyeol catching a cold.”\nAfter that, I forgot to reply to Han-gyeol’s messages and talked more with Dad.\n“But why are you telling me all this suddenly, sweetheart? Need some allowance?”\n“No, just Han-gyeol said you were really curious about us.”\n“Oh, is that so? Then you don’t need money?”\n“Well, if you’re offering, I won’t say no…”\n“Hahaha! Alright! I’ll transfer it to your account. Buy something tasty with Han-gyeol.”\n“Okay! Thanks, Dad.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Even after the June mock exams ended, time flew by quickly.\nHan-gyeol started private tutoring, and we had to immediately face our final exams.\nAs these were practically our last school exams, we gave it our all.\nAs a result, both Han-gyeol and I achieved good results, and before we knew it, the summer vacation ceremony was just around the corner.\nMaybe because the vacation ceremony was so imminent, I felt myself relaxing a bit too.\n“Would be nice if the heat eases up a bit... Did you hear when they’ll turn on the air conditioning in our class?”\n“I think they’re turning it on next period. Are you feeling very hot, Han-gyeol? Should I give you my portable fan?”\n“You’re hot too, Eun-ha. I can’t let my girlfriend suffer in the heat.”\n“I feel the same~ Didn’t you bring your portable fan?”\n“I forgot to charge it.”\n“Geez – come here. Let’s share it.”\nIt had been hot since June, but in July, it was clear that living without air conditioning and ice water was difficult.\nWe used to always have orange-flavored candies in our mouths, but we found ourselves biting into popsicles more frequently.\nStill, eating ice cream with Han-gyeol and walking home together was incredibly enjoyable and happy.\nAs time passed, my feelings for Han-gyeol only grew stronger.\nI missed him even when he was there, and even more when he wasn’t. Just thinking of him brought a smile to my face.\nIt seemed like all the thoughts I couldn’t entertain during the exam period were bursting out now.\nEven with summer vacation approaching, it meant I could spend more time with Han-gyeol.\nHe was already a regular at my house, but now we’d have even more time together.\n“Ah, right. Han-gyeol, let’s buy some shaved ice on the way home today.”\n“Sure. Eun-ha, you pick the flavor this time. What do you like?”\n“Hmm, I like melon. But if Han-gyeol wants strawberry, we can have that.”\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book L...\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\n20 Charming Pickup Lines for Book Lovers: Literary Love Lines\n“I want what you want. Lately, it’s been all about my choices.”\n“Then, can we also have injeolmi toast?”\n“Of course. Eun-ha should have whatever she wants.”\nHan-gyeol gently pinched my cheeks, pulling them playfully.\n“Keep eating like that, and I’ll gain weight.”\n“Eun-ha is light as a feather, so it’s okay.”\n“It feels good to hear you say that.”\n“What if I had paused for like 3 seconds just now? What would you have done?”\n“Try it next time~ see what happens.”\n“Wow~ that’s scary.”\nI responded with a big smile, and Han-gyeol laughed heartily too.\nHan-gyeol’s compliments still embarrassed me, but joking around like this felt much better.\nI could feel Han-gyeol and me getting closer.\n“Han-gyeol, what should we do this weekend?”\n“Right? We can’t just play all the time, but we can’t not play either.”\n“How about we go shopping for summer clothes? Join me.”\nI usually buy one or two pieces of clothing every summer, so I was planning to go this weekend.\nBut I wanted to make it a date and show Han-gyeol a pretty side of me.\n“Summer clothes? Where do you usually shop?”\n“I shop online, but I also go to outlets or underground malls. Will you come with me?”\n“Yeah. I want to see Eun-ha in her new clothes. It’ll be pretty.”\n“I want to show Han-gyeol first.”\n“Let’s go together. Ah- the teacher is here. Let’s be quiet now.”\nDuring class, we would always quiet down when it was time to study, but with the exams over, I found myself a bit distracted and not fully focused on the lesson.\nCarefully, I scribbled a note in the corner of Han-gyeol’s textbook.\nIt had been a long while since we last passed notes.\n-Han-gyeol, let’s play a word chain game.\n-Sure. Should I start? Jasu (*Embroidery).\n-Susa (*Investigation).\n-Sasim (*Selfishness).\n-Simsa (*Judge).\n-Sayeog (*Employment).\n-Yeogsa (*History).\n-Eun-ha, why do you keep ending with words that lead to ‘sa’?\n-There’s something I want to hear from Han-gyeol~\nRealizing my intention, Han-gyeol quickly wrote a response.\n-Salanghae (*I love you).\n-Hae jil nyeok (*At sunset).\nI swiftly countered, and Han-gyeol glanced at me with a slight smile.\nI avoided his gaze, finding joy in our playful exchange.\nHan-gyeol then returned his focus to the textbook and wrote another message.\n-Eun-ha?\n-Han-gyeol. Let’s listen to the class now.\n-Like this?\n-Yeah. Like this.\nI had started playing these kinds of jokes on Han-gyeol more often.\nHe gave a small, amused smile, seemingly finding it cute, and then turned his attention back to the blackboard.\nI felt a bit sorry for playing the prank, so I added one more note to Han-gyeol’s textbook.\n- Nado salanghae (*I love you too).\nI wanted to write it a hundred times more, but restrained myself since we were in class.\nAh, if we were alone, I’d tell Han-gyeol right now that I love him.\nAnd I longed to hear those words in his soft voice.\nI couldn’t wait for the class to end.\n***\nAfter school, we bought shaved ice and headed home.\nNow, it was a natural routine for us to place the food on the dining table and then go to our separate rooms to change clothes.\nNot wanting to show Han-gyeol too casual a look, I chose a white t-shirt and banding pants before coming out of my room.\nHan-gyeol, who was already preparing the food, asked me.\n“Eun-ha, could you bring two spoons from the kitchen?”\n“Sure. Do you need anything else?”\n“Um, maybe a couple of plates too.”\n“Okay, I’ll bring them.”\nI brought the utensils from the kitchen and set them on the living room table.\n“Han-gyeol, do you think we’ll catch a cold if we eat shaved ice with the air conditioner on?”\n“Let’s just turn it on very low.”\n“I’ll set it to 22 degrees.”\n“Good idea. Ah, I forgot to wash my hands.”\n“Me too.”\nWe hurried to the bathroom to wash our hands together and then returned to the living room.\nEating snacks with Han-gyeol like this had become a daily routine.\nI had cut down on dinner portions to avoid gaining weight, but it seemed I might need to exercise a bit during the vacation.\nHowever, making my concerns seem trivial, Han-gyeol started feeding me shaved ice.\n“Let me feed you, Eun-ha. Say ‘ah’.”\n“Ah~”\nAfter I ate a spoonful of melon shaved ice, I fed Han-gyeol some toast.\nWatching him chew was incredibly cute and lovely. I couldn’t help but suddenly hug him tightly.\n“Hey, we’ve only just started eating.”\n“Sorry, but I’ve been wanting to hug you since school.”\nWhen I hugged him tighter, Han-gyeol gently stroked my head.\n“You might break my back at this rate.”\n“It won’t break.”\n“At this rate, I’ll end up eating everything.”\n“I’ll stay like this, so Han-gyeol can feed me.”\n“I doubt we can eat properly in this position.”\n“Should I lie on Han-gyeol’s lap then?”\n“That’s fine, but my thighs might tickle.”\n“Just bear with it.”\nI quickly laid down with my head on Han-gyeol’s legs. His slightly twitching expression, possibly tickled by my hair, was adorable.\n“Eun-ha, haven’t we been quite touchy-feely lately?”\n“I just want to be closer to Han-gyeol. Is it too much?”\n“Not at all. To be honest, it feels really good. I wish we could do this every day.”\n“Then, as Han-gyeol wishes, I’ll do it every day.”\nNow, being close to Han-gyeol felt much better than any embarrassment.\nI wanted to cling to him more, hold his hand, and hug him just like a moment ago.\n“Lying like this, you look just like a content cat.”\n“Yeah. I like it when Han-gyeol is my knee pillow. Do it often.”\n“It tickles too much to do it often.”\n“Is it that ticklish? Are you very ticklish, Han-gyeol?”\n“A bit? Want to try being my knee pillow?”\n“Sure!”\nI quickly got up and tapped my thighs.\n“Come on, lie down.”\n“Are you serious?”\n“Yes. Hurry up.”\nI enjoyed both giving and receiving this kind of affection.\nCarefully, Han-gyeol placed his head on my legs, and I brushed his bangs to the sides.\n“Han-gyeol has such a handsome forehead.”\n“And Eun-ha is pretty in every way.”\n“Why does it feel so good to be called pretty by Han-gyeol?”\n“Really? I’ll say it more often. You’re so beautiful.”\n“Han-gyeol is handsome too.”\nInitially, we were just strangers who didn’t even know each other’s names. But now, it feels like I can’t live without Han-gyeol.\nI find myself deeply in love with him, beyond control.\n“Han-gyeol, do you remember the first time you came to my house?”\n“Of course. I’m grateful to Eunwoo Hyung.”\n“Why? Because he calls you to fix his computer?”\n“Yeah. After I started visiting your house, I felt like you began to like me. Didn’t you?”\n“That’s true. I was really happy and glad to get close to Han-gyeol quickly. After that, I naturally started to like you.”\n“See? You should be a little grateful to Eunwoo Hyung too.”\n“No, I don’t need to be.”\n“Why?”\nAt Han-gyeol’s question, I stroked his hair and replied.\n“Even if that had never happened, I would have liked Han-gyeol. I would have confessed my feelings as I gradually discovered his good qualities. It’s just a matter of pace; we would have ended up together like we are now, wouldn’t we?”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol suddenly got up.\n“Ah! Where are you going, Han-gyeol?”\n“You know, Eun-ha, you’ve been quite assertive lately, haven’t you? In your words and actions!”\n“I don’t see it at all?”\n“That’s a big deal...”\nIt’s so enjoyable now; I wonder how much more fun it will be when we’re adults.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I went to a boutique in the outlet mall with Eun-ha to buy clothes.\nIt was the beginning of summer, and many people were busy choosing outfits.\nEun-ha carefully examined each piece of clothing on display.\nAnd I, too, was not immune to this deliberation.\n“How do they look to you, Han-gyeol? Is white better? Or is sky blue better?”\nIs there really a better answer than ‘both are pretty’?\nIf it’s something worn by the girl I like, naturally, everything looks pretty.\nI was worried that if I chose white, she might think sky blue doesn’t suit her.\n“Han-gyeol?”\nI couldn’t delay my response forever, so I came up with a wise answer.\nI slightly tweaked the phrase ‘both are pretty’.\n“White looks pretty, and sky blue looks cute.”\nThough I couldn’t escape the option that both suited her, Eun-ha’s face surprisingly lit up.\n“Really? Then I should buy both.”\n“You’re going to buy both? Wouldn’t it be better to just get one? They’re just different colors.”\n“But I want to look pretty and cute to Han-gyeol, so I have no choice. I’ll buy both.”\nEun-ha smiled happily as she placed the clothes in her shopping basket.\n“You’re smiling a lot today, aren’t you?”\n“Yes. I’m really happy that Han-gyeol helped me decide.”\n“I’m glad you’re happy, Eun-ha. Have you bought everything?”\n“Just one more top to go. Oh - should I buy a gift for Han-gyeol too?”\nEun-ha looked up at me with sparkling eyes.\nSecond Chance Chapter 38\nPlease enable JavaScript Please enable JavaScript\nSecond Chance Chapter 38\nHer gaze was practically insisting, even if I said it was okay, she’d buy it for me anyway.\n“You really look like you want to buy it for me, Eun-ha?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I really want to gift you clothes. What do you like?”\nI appreciated the thought, but I was a bit concerned about Eun-ha’s spending.\nIf she bought clothes for me too, she would end up spending a lot today.\nKnowing I couldn’t dissuade Eun-ha, I suggested an alternative plan.\n“How about this? I’ll buy the top you were going to get for yourself, and you can buy one for me.”\n“Huh? Wouldn’t that just be like we’re exchanging, not gifting?”\n“What matters is the thought. Come on, I’ll buy one, so you choose.”\n“Hmm, can’t you choose for me?”\n“Me? I have no sense of fashion. What if you don’t like it?”\n“That won’t happen. And I want to wear something you think looks pretty.”\n“Alright. I’ll try my best to choose something.”\n“Yeah, yeah!”\nBut as I wandered around the boutique, nothing particularly caught my eye.\nHaving never really picked out women’s clothes before, I was unsure what would be good.\nAfter making a full round, I still hadn’t found the perfect gift for Eun-ha.\n“This is hard. Eun-ha, do you have something in mind you want?”\n“Me? Anything you think is pretty is fine. Don’t worry too much.”\n“But I want to consider your taste too. Can you give me a hint?”\n“Then... since it’s summer, I was thinking of getting a dress. Shall we go with that?”\n“Yes. I’d like to see you in a dress too.”\n“I saw some over there earlier. Let’s go look.”\n“Alright, let’s go.”\nLed by Eun-ha, I entered the section where dresses were displayed.\nBut here too, there were so many dresses that it seemed it would take time to choose.\nFrom what I’d seen of Eun-ha’s clothing choices so far, she didn’t seem to prefer tight or short clothes.\nWhile I usually picked my clothes without much thought to the material, I wanted to be more careful since it was for Eun-ha.\nI was willing to spend a bit more for a nice dress.\n“What kind of dress do you like, Han-gyeol?”\n“To be honest, I think everything would look good on you, but- ah, that style seems to suit you. What do you think, Eun-ha?”\nI pointed to a dress on a mannequin, different from the ones hanging on the hangers.\nIt was a typical dress, neither too flashy nor too plain.\nA sky-blue dress that matched Eun-ha’s pure and elegant vibe.\nIt was lovely to think of Eun-ha wearing it, not the mannequin.\n“Are you talking about that sky-blue dress over there?”\n“Yes. It’s pretty.”\n“Do you like that style? Kind of pure and neat?”\n“Yes. I think it’ll suit you really well.”\n“Then, shall I try it on?”\n“Are you going to? Where’s the fitting room?”\n“Next to the cash register. So, shall I try it on? You can’t say anything if it looks weird, okay?”\n“It won’t look weird. Give me your bag and basket. I’ll hold them.”\nEun-ha handed me her crossbody bag and the shopping basket.\nThen she went to the clerk and said she wanted to try on the dress.\n“I’d like to try on the dress the mannequin is wearing over there.”\n“Sure. Please come this way. If you wait in front of the fitting room, I’ll bring it to you.”\n“Okay. Thank you. Han-gyeol? Let’s go wait over there.”\nEun-ha and I waited in front of the fitting room for the clerk.\nAfter a short while, the clerk came with the dress.\n“I brought a size that should fit you. Please feel free to try it on.”\n“Thank you. Han-gyeol, I’ll go change and come back. Wait for me here, okay?”\nEun-ha received a dress from the clerk, but the color of the dress wasn’t sky blue.\n“Did I see it wrong?” I wondered, just as Eun-ha entered the changing room.\nThe clerk, after handing over the dress to Eun-ha, had gone off somewhere.\n“That’s strange... I was sure it was sky blue... Did I see it wrong?”\nMuttering to myself, I looked back towards the mannequin.\nThere it was, the sky-blue dress still on the mannequin.\nBut at that moment, I noticed the mannequin right next to it.\nThe dress on this mannequin was the polar opposite of the pure and elegant one.\nIt was a black dress with spaghetti straps and a slightly plunging neckline.\nTo anyone, it would appear more sensual than pure and elegant.\n“Han-gyeol... are you there?”\n“Ah- Yeah, I am. Why?”\n“I think the clerk gave me the wrong dress.”\n“Really? Wait a moment. I’ll talk to the clerk.”\n“No, since I have it now, I’ll try it on. Can you wait a bit?”\n“Sure. Go ahead and finish changing.”\n“Yeah, almost done. I’m coming out now...”\nThe changing room door slowly opened, and Eun-ha’s figure came into view.\nShe looked so stunning in the dress that it erased all my prior thoughts, and I couldn’t help but be in awe.\n“Wow-”\n“But, this dress seems a bit too revealing…”\nEun-ha, usually so pure and elegant, suited this provocative dress too.\nHer straight shoulders and the somewhat provocative collarbone line caught my eye.\nHer beauty was so evident, it was hard to look away.\n“Han-gyeol. Does it look strange?”\n“No, it suits you incredibly well... but it’s a bit too provocative, so let’s pass on this one.”\n“Right? I’ll change back quickly and come out!”\nEun-ha hurriedly closed the door and changed her clothes inside.\nI shook my head vigorously from side to side, trying to rid my mind of the turmoil.\nBut the image of Eun-ha just now was too vividly etched in my memory, making it impossible to forget.\nWith a click, the door opened, and Eun-ha stood beside me.\n“Han-gyeol, I guess those kinds of clothes don’t really suit me.”\n“No-! You looked amazing. Until now, Eun-ha, you’ve always had this pure, elegant, cute, and lovely vibe, but, how should I say this, you looked incredibly mature. That maturity, mixed with your youthful side, created a harmoniously noble look, and there was a dangerously charming feel to it.”\n“No need to compliment me that much-! There are other people around... shh!”\nEun-ha gestured for me to be quiet, but I had already crossed a point of no return.\nI grabbed Eun-ha’s shoulder, looking her straight in the eye.\n“I mean it, it wasn’t because it didn’t suit you. But it was embarrassing for both of us, and above all, it was too provocative for me to handle. You get what I’m saying, right? You were incredibly beautiful. So beautiful that I’d want to see you like that every day, but I’m just not ready for that yet...!”\n“Okay, I get it...! Thanks for the compliment...! Shh-! Look around.”\nIt was only after I had lavishly praised Eun-ha that I became aware of our surroundings.\nEveryone, both those waiting and those changing clothes, was looking at me.\n“Oh no-”\n“Let’s get out of here...!”\nEun-ha took my hand, leading me away from the gaze of the people.\nOnce we were far from the changing rooms, Eun-ha looked at me with a small laugh.\n“What was that about earlier? I didn’t expect you to compliment me that much.”\n“No, I just couldn’t help it... you were that pretty.”\n“But still, I think I’d be too shy to wear such clothes.”\n“Yeah. Let’s tell the clerk and try on the dress you originally picked.”\nAs I was about to look for the clerk, Eun-ha grabbed the lapel of my shirt.\n“Huh? Eun-ha, why?”\n“Well... since I tried it on, should I buy this one...?”\n“Huh?”\n“This is also a dress you said was pretty. I’m okay with this one too.”\n“But you said you’d be too shy to wear this kind of dress...”\n“If it’s just for Han-gyeol to see, it doesn’t really matter, does it?”\nWhat? She’s getting bolder by the minute...\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was willing to wear it even though it was a bit revealing because Han-gyeol would be happy.\nIt might be too much to wear outside, but when it’s just the two of us, it shouldn’t really matter, right?\nWait a minute.\nClothes that are only shown when we’re alone...?\nNow that I think about it, that was a dangerously bold statement.\nOnly then did I come to my senses and checked Han-gyeol’s expression.\nHe seemed to have had a similar thought.\n“Showing it only when we’re alone...?”\n“Ah, no-! I didn’t mean I’d wear this to seduce Han-gyeol or anything like that-!”\n“Right? If it’s something you wear only when we’re alone, it wouldn’t be a dress, would it-ah?”\n“Eh?”\nOur faces turned red at the same time.\nHan-gyeol frantically tried to explain, but it was too late.\n“It’s not lingerie I was talking about! So, what I mean is-!”\n“Yeah, yeah! I get it, so you don’t need to explain! Let’s buy this outfit another time. Let’s do that!”\n“Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. We can buy it next time.”\nEventually, I handed back the dress to the clerk and received the one we originally intended to buy.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll go change into this and come out.”\n“Okay. Take your time changing.”\n“Yeah.”\nEntering the dressing room, I just sat down.\nMy heart was still racing from the bold move I had made.\nWhen I think about it, the only thing that comes to mind for a couple to wear when alone is lingerie.\nMy head was filled with impure thoughts for a long time, and I had to cool down my face.”\nStill, the way Han-gyeol looked when I wore that dress made my face flush repeatedly.\nI wanted to see that expression again, the one where he was embarrassed and blushing, but his eyes were fixed only on me.\nBut I decided that today was not the day to see that expression again, and instead, I changed into a pure and elegant sky-blue dress.\nIt seemed better to continue a high school-like romance for now.\nNext year, when we’re adults, it might be difficult to have such a youthful romance.\nI decided to save showing a more provocative side for after becoming an adult.\n“Han-gyeol, I’m all changed. How do I look?”\nThe earlier embarrassment was gone, replaced by Han-gyeol’s pleased smile.\nSeeing Han-gyeol look at me with those loving eyes made me incredibly happy.\n“You look really beautiful.”\n“Aren’t you going to compliment me as long as before?”\n“You’re incredibly pretty and lovely. It’s just like a dress made for Eun-ha.”\n“Really? Then, should we go with this one without looking at others?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Come out after you change.”\n“Okay. Wait for me.”\nAfter happily changing clothes, Han-gyeol paid for the dress.\nThe awkwardness from before was set aside, and now it was my turn to choose clothes for Han-gyeol.\n“Alright, let’s pick something for Han-gyeol. You don’t seem to wear bright colors much. Don’t you like them?”\n“It’s not that I dislike them. They’re just a bit hard to manage, so I don’t wear them often.”\nHan-gyeol, having fairly pale skin for a guy, seemed like he would look great in bright clothes.\nI gently touched his cheek, and his skin was incredibly soft.\n“How about trying a bright-colored outfit for a change?”\n“If Eun-ha picks it out, I’ll like anything.”\n“I should consider Han-gyeol’s preferences properly.”\n“I like bright colors too. Don’t worry, just choose whatever you think is best.”\n“Then, how about trying this on?”\nI handed Han-gyeol a sky-blue shirt that I thought would suit him.\nIt seemed like it would match well with the black cotton pants he was wearing.\n“I like the style. I’ll change in the dressing room and come out.”\n“Okay, okay. I’ll wait for you outside.”\nI remembered our first date.\nHan-gyeol looked so handsome that day, wearing a light blue jacket.\nI wondered how Han-gyeol would look in a coat during winter.\nIt seemed like his maturity would shine through even more.\nWinter was still a long way off, but I was already imagining Han-gyeol on that day.\nYet, just picturing Han-gyeol in my mind naturally brought a smile to my face.\n“Eun-ha.”\nHan-gyeol called my name as he came out.\nI was momentarily lost for words at the sight of him, radiant and charming.\nThe perfect length of the shirt and his broad shoulders enhanced the look of the garment.\nIf there weren’t other people around, I would’ve jumped into his arms right then. Such a pity.\n“Han-gyeol, sky blue suits you incredibly well.”\n“Oh, really? Feels good to hear that. Should I buy this one?”\n“Yes, yes. Let’s buy that one. No, it has to be that one.”\n“Then I’ll change back and come out.”\n“Okay, okay. Take your time changing.”\nI happily paid for the sky-blue shirt Han-gyeol had tried on.\n“Eun-ha, thank you. I’ll wear it well.”\n“It’s nothing. You bought me the dress, after all. Where should we go now?”\n“Since we’re out, let’s go to a café and have something cool to drink.”\n“Ah, there’s a place nearby with delicious ice cake. Let’s go there.”\n“Sounds good.”\n***\nAt the café, we sat down with our cake and fruit juice.\n“Eun-ha, ah~”\n“Ah~”\nI eagerly ate the cake Han-gyeol fed me, and then I fed him in return.\nThe sweetness and coolness spreading in my mouth instantly brightened my mood.\n“How is it? It’s good here, right?”\n“Yeah. It tastes even better because Eun-ha is feeding me.”\n“Han-gyeol, you always say such sweet things.”\n“Oh, right. Eun-ha, is there anywhere you want to go this summer?”\n“Me? As long as I’m with Han-gyeol, I don’t mind where.”\nThe cake tasted exceptionally sweet after walking around so much.\nI couldn’t stop scooping up more and more cake.\nThis café’s cake was definitely on another level.\nI just couldn’t put my fork down.\n“I was thinking, since it’s vacation, maybe we could go swimming.”\n“Really? I’d love that. I don’t mind whether it’s a stream or the sea.”\nHonestly, I too had been thinking about where to go out with Han-gyeol.\nBut with the college entrance exam so close, I found it hard to bring it up first. Fortunately, Han-gyeol mentioned it himself.\nThe thought of splashing around in a creek or sea with Han-gyeol sounded incredibly fun...\n“How about the big indoor swimming pool near the park?”\nOh, right. I realized there was another option I hadn’t considered.\nAside from when I was very young, I’d never been to a swimming pool, so I hadn’t thought of it.\nIt’s such a common and obvious date idea with a boyfriend, yet it hadn’t crossed my mind.\nBut it’s the holidays, and I’ve definitely gained a bit of weight from eating so much.\nIn a swimsuit, the fat hidden by clothes would be visible to Han-gyeol – I absolutely couldn’t let that happen.\nUgh – I just ate so much cake, why did I do that!\nI hurriedly put down the fork I was holding.\n“I enjoyed the cake…”\n“Huh-? You hardly ate any. Finish it.”\n“No, no. Maybe it’s too sweet, but I feel full already, haha.”\n“Is it because of the swimsuit? Eun-ha, you’re so slim, it doesn’t matter, right?”\n“No, no, that’s not it! You don’t know, Han-gyeol. I’ve been eating a lot lately.”\n“So, it was because of the swimsuit?”\n“Ugh... Why didn’t I think about the swimming pool...”\nI felt too complacent.\nBut the best time to start is when you realize it’s late.\nIf I eat less and exercise more for the next two weeks, I’m sure I’ll lose weight.\nBut isn’t two weeks too short?\n“Han-gyeol…”\n“Yes? What’s up?”\n“Can we go in a month instead?”\n“Near the end of the vacation? Wouldn’t that be a bit much? It might be hard to focus on studying, feeling all excited.”\nHan-gyeol was right.\nBut...\n“Then I’ll diet for two weeks.”\n“You don’t need to do that. Eun-ha should eat more, you know? Here – eat some cake.”\n“No! I want to show Han-gyeol how pretty I can look in a swimsuit.”\n“You’d look pretty in a swimsuit right now. Here – ah~ I’ll kindly feed you.”\nHan-gyeol tried to feed me the cake, but I firmly closed my mouth and shook my head.\n“How about we go to a stream where we don’t need swimsuits?”\n“No! Han-gyeol mentioned the swimming pool first, so we’re going to the pool.”\n“That wasn’t my intention.”\nI was determined to show Han-gyeol my best self.\nFor the next two weeks, I decided to eat only salads and avoid carbohydrates.\nAnd there was one more important thing to consider.\n“What kind of swimsuit do you like, Han-gyeol?”\nI hurriedly asked about Han-gyeol’s preferences.\n“Me? I like any swimsuit that Eun-ha-“\n“No! I’ve heard enough in my life. It’s a bikini, right?!”\nHan-gyeol hesitated slightly in his response, which was all the answer I needed.\n“You’ve already given your answer.”\n“No, no, I think rash guards are-“\n“No. I’ll definitely wear the bikini you’re imagining!”\nAs his girlfriend, I didn’t want to show him a half-hearted first swimsuit look.\nFor the next two weeks, there will be no rice in my diet!\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "No matter what, Eun-ha was determined to wear a bikini, and nothing could sway her resolve.\nShe insisted on running every evening, and I decided to join her.\nIt had been ten days since we started running in the park.\n“Haa- Haa- Han-gyeol. I can’t run anymore... I feel like I’m going to die.”\nEun-ha, breathless yet still looking beautiful, stopped in her tracks.\n“I told you, we should’ve just run five laps like usual. Only two more laps to reach ten – want to finish them?”\n“Somehow, I felt like I could run ten laps today… But I guess it was too much. I’m exhausted.”\n“You’ve worked hard. Here’s some water.”\n“Sorry. I’ll drink in a bit…! Han-gyeol, you’re really good at running. You don’t even look tired.”\n“Well, I do work out regularly. Let’s rest on the bench before we go home.”\nI led an utterly drained Eun-ha to a bench.\nAfter I opened the water bottle and handed it to her, she gulped it down.\n“Ahh- That’s refreshing. Thanks.”\nI was truly grateful to Eun-ha for exercising to look good for me.\nBut at the same time, I was worried she might be overdoing it.\n“Eun-ha, don’t push yourself too hard. You can show me the bikini some other time.”\n“No way. It’s our first time going to the pool together – I have to wear a bikini.”\n“If you insist that much, I won’t try to stop you, but I’m just worried you might hurt yourself.”\n“Don’t worry. I’m not just starving myself. I’m dieting healthily.”\nHearing her say that, I decided not to press further.\n“That’s good to hear. It’s getting late. Let’s go home.”\n“Okay! Han-gyeol, help me up. My legs hurt from all the running.”\nEun-ha reached out her hand while sitting on the bench, so I firmly pulled her up.\nShe rose gracefully, looking at me with a mischievous smile.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re so strong.”\n“You’re just too light, Eun-ha.”\n“Hearing you say that makes me happy. But I’m still going to run for the next three days.”\n“Then shall we run home like we did just now?”\n“That would be too much...”\nEun-ha, shyly smiling as she spoke, was just too adorable.\n“Why are you so cute?”\n“Really? I must look a mess from all the sweating. Don’t stare too much, okay?”\n“No, I want to see your face up close.”\n“No, no, let’s just go home~”\nEun-ha’s playful words were a delight to hear.\n“Isn’t it tough, studying during the day and exercising at night?”\n“There’s nothing tough about doing things with Han-gyeol. I love every bit of it.”\n“Really? Then, how about we start working out together at dawn starting tomorrow?”\n“Th-that might be a bit too much. My legs might break.”\n“That won’t do.”\nPerhaps it was the conversation with Eun-ha that made it seem like we arrived home sooner than expected. Every day, we had these little squabbles in front of the apartment.\n“We’re already here. Go inside safely.”\n“Ah- It’s such a pity. I can’t even hug you because we’re sweaty. Can’t we stay a bit longer?”\n“No, I need to shower and sleep too, I’m sweaty.”\n“I wish Han-gyeol lived next door.”\n“What would you do if I lived next door?”\n“I could see you anytime. I’d probably go to you as soon as I wake up every day.”\nWhen did Eun-ha become so assertive?\nThe shy Eun-ha I first met was hard to find now. As time passed, she expressed her affection more actively, which was both cute and lovely.\n“I want to be with Eun-ha every day too.”\n“That’s exactly what I wanted to hear. I won’t hold you back anymore. Message me when you get home, okay?”\nWith a beaming smile, I waved goodbye to Eun-ha and headed home. Even on the way back, her words kept bringing a smile to my face. I eventually stopped in my tracks and let out a silent scream.\n“She’s just... too cute.”\nEun-ha always made my heart flutter every day.\nAfter getting home, I sent a message to Eun-ha saying I arrived and was going to shower, and then I took a shower.\nOnce I finished showering, I immediately checked my phone and saw a reply from Eun-ha.\nWithout even checking the message, I called Eun-ha right away. Our phone calls had become a routine.\n- “Hey, Han-gyeol. Are you done showering?”\n“Yeah. Just finished. How about you, Eun-ha?”\n- “I just finished showering too. Just turn off the lights and lie down.”\n“Yes. I was just about to lie down too. Aren’t you hungry?”\n- “I miss Han-gyeol.”\n“Are you a rapper? That rhyme was perfect.”\n- “I was being serious.”\n“We’ll see each other tomorrow, won’t we?”\n- “I’m sleepy, I keep closing my eyes. Guess we ran a lot today.”\n“I want to hear your voice a little longer before I sleep.”\nEun-ha didn’t respond for a moment.\n- “I want to hear your voice more too…”\nI wished I could see the expression Eun-ha had while saying this.\n“You must be blushing right now.”\n- “You said something heart-fluttering, Han-gyeol. I can’t help it...”\n“You’re so cute, it’s killing me.”\n- “Stop, it’s embarrassing.”\n“Are you going to get shy every time I say you’re cute?”\n- “What can I do if I get excited every time you call me cute?”\nI couldn’t help but burst into laughter in bed at Eun-ha’s response.\n“Why do you make me miss you like this?”\n- “Exactly. I miss Han-gyeol.”\n“We just parted ways a while ago.”\n- “Still, I miss you. I really wish Han-gyeol lived next door.”\n“Do you wish we lived in the same house?”\nEun-ha was silent for a moment after my question. Then I heard some rustling, followed by her soft voice.\n- “Maybe that... for later...”\nEun-ha’s response was as expected, but I couldn’t help blushing myself.\nI closed my eyes tightly, trying to contain the cuteness.\n“We’re going to see each other tomorrow anyway.”\n- “Right. We’ll meet tomorrow, and the day after, and keep meeting...”\nEun-ha said she wanted to hear more of my voice, but as we talked, her words started to trail off. After a brief silence on my part, I could hear Eun-ha’s breathing.\nSoftly, Eun-ha’s breathing, smooth and gentle, reached my ears, and I quietly said,\n“I love you. Sleep well.”\nAs I was about to gently end the call, a rustling noise came through the receiver, followed by a mumbled,\n- “Mmm...”\nI wasn’t sure if she heard me or if it was just sleep talk, but Eun-ha was endearing to the end.\nI pressed the end call button, placed my phone beside my pillow, and closed my eyes.\nThanks to Eun-ha, I went to bed smiling again.\n“Ah, I miss her.”\n***\n-BEEP BEEP BEEP!\nI turned off the noisy alarm clock and tidied up the bedding.\nEven though it was vacation, I woke up around the same time I would for school.\nAfter drinking a glass of lukewarm water, I quickly prepared breakfast.\nBeing of adult age, I couldn’t just eat meals prepared for me. I took out some side dishes, fried an egg, and had a simple breakfast.\nAfter finishing the dishes, I returned to my room.\nI sent a message to Eun-ha that I was up and immediately started studying.\nMeeting Eun-ha would be after lunch since this was a crucial time. We dedicated our mornings entirely to studying for our futures.\nWhile we sometimes studied together, we had fixed times for studying alone.\nAbout an hour later, my phone vibrated with a message.\n[Eun-ha: I’m up too! Let’s meet for lunch.]\nWe didn’t specify a time or place, but I replied with an acknowledgment.\nHappy, I finished my studies and left for lunch before heading to Eun-ha’s place.\nHowever, as soon as I arrived at Eun-ha’s house, I was greeted by her visibly exhausted expression.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re here?”\nEun-ha stood there, leaning against the wall, her legs trembling weakly.\n“Are you hurt?”\n“Ugh- I think I overdid it yesterday. My muscles are sore. I can’t walk.”\nSeeing Eun-ha’s state, I couldn’t help but let out a snicker.\n“Ah! Han-gyeol, you laughed. How can you laugh when your girlfriend is in pain from overworked muscles?”\n“Sorry. It’s just that the energetic Eun-ha from yesterday and the Eun-ha now are so different...!”\nI took off my shoes and went in, grabbing Eun-ha’s cheeks.\n“You’re really too cute.”\nEun-ha, unable to protest due to her sore legs, just groaned in response.\n“Ouch- Ah, it hurts.”\n“Can’t help it, you’re too adorable. Is Eunwoo Hyung around?”\n“He’s asleep in his room. I was planning to run today too... but that’s probably not a good idea, huh?”\n“It’s definitely not a good idea in this condition. Did you eat lunch?”\n“Yeah, I had a chicken salad.”\n“Is that enough? Shouldn’t you have a proper meal at least once?”\n“One day like this is fine. I’m not going to exercise today, so just salad for me.”\n“A muscle strain like this won’t heal in just a day.”\n“I’ll massage it; it’ll loosen up quickly.”\nI sat on the sofa and lightly tapped Eun-ha’s calf.\n“Does it hurt?”\n“Not really. Han-gyeol, could you massage it a bit?”\n“Me? It might hurt a lot.”\n“Wouldn’t it loosen faster if you do it harder?”\n“Hmm, maybe? Want to lift your leg up?”\nI cautiously lifted Eun-ha’s leg onto mine.\nAh, wait. Isn’t this a bit embarrassing?\nWell, it’s just a massage, nothing to worry about. Keep it professional.\n“Should I start?”\n“Be, be gentle, okay? Don’t start too strong.”\n“Okay, don’t worry.”\nI carefully massaged Eun-ha’s calf. As I did, she twitched slightly.\nI continued massaging, thinking it was natural for the tense muscles to react.\nHer calf muscles were surprisingly firm, probably from the overexertion yesterday.\n“You definitely overdid it yesterday. Maybe we should stop exercising until we go to the swimming pool.”\n“Maybe…!”\n“Your enthusiasm is great, Eun-ha, but don’t overdo it next time, okay?”\n“Mmm…!”\nHuh? Was there a hint of playfulness in Eun-ha’s voice?\nFeeling a bit uneasy, I looked at her face. Seeing her flushed face, covering her mouth, I stopped my hand.\n“Why is your face all red-!”\n“No, it’s not-! It’s because it feels good! Keep going!”\n“I can’t! It sounds dangerous!”\n“Just a little more massage...!”\n“Your words sound weird-!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It was the day Eun-ha had been eagerly waiting for: the day to visit the swimming pool.\nIn other words, it was the day to see Eun-ha in her swimsuit. Despite trying not to, I couldn’t help but feel excited.\nAfter all, who wouldn’t be? My beautiful girlfriend even went on a diet to show off her bikini.\nWith my bag packed with a swimsuit and a tube, I arrived at Eun-ha’s house, feeling joyful.\nAs I rang the doorbell and waited, today, it was Eunwoo Hyung, her brother, who opened the door.\n“Ah, Han-gyeol is here?”\n“Yes. Is Eun-ha around?”\n“She’s in the middle of a final training, or whatever it’s called... Come see for yourself. It’s quite a sight.”\n“Huh?”\nFollowing Eunwoo Hyung into the living room, I saw Eun-ha busily doing sit-ups.\n“Hi, Han-gyeol~”\nEun-ha and Hyun-joo Noona, greeted me cheerfully, as Hyun-joo Noona held onto Eun-ha’s calves.\n“Hello. How are you, Eun-ha?”\n“Han-gyeol-! Just a moment...! I’m almost done...!”\n“Eun-ha, you have ten more to go!”\n“That many?! Ugh...! Okay!”\nEun-ha finished her sit-ups and collapsed on the living room floor.\n“Hi, Han-gyeol.”\n“Hey. Aren’t you going to be too tired for the swimming pool?”\n“It’s, it’s just a final one...”\nAt Eun-ha’s words, Hyun-joo Noona burst into laughter.\nHer laughter filled the living room.\n“Hey, Unnie! Don’t laugh!”\n“Sorry...! It’s just too cute...! Doing sit-ups on the day you’re going to the swimming pool to show your boyfriend your bikini...! It’s just adorable. What do you think, Han-gyeol?”\n“I think it’s adorably cute. You must be tired from exercising since the morning. Did you have lunch?”\n“I had a salad~ Let’s rest a bit before we leave!”\nEun-ha looked up at me, beaming with joy.\n“Did Han-gyeol see which swimsuit Eun-ha picked out?”\n“No. Eun-ha said she would show it at the swimming pool.”\n“Oho~ So Eun-ha said that? She’d reveal it at the swimming pool?”\n“It has to be at the swimming pool, or else it loses its meaning!”\n“You must be really looking forward to it, huh? Excited to see your girlfriend in her swimsuit?”\nHyun-joo Noona looked at me with a sly grin.\nI averted my gaze slightly and mumbled.\n“Of course...”\n“Hahaha! Why are you two so adorable?”\n“Unnie! Don’t tease Han-gyeol! Han-gyeol, let’s leave now!”\n“Okay. We’ll be going then.”\n“Have fun and make sure to compliment Eun-ha~”\n“Will do~”\nTogether with Eun-ha, I left the house and headed for the bus stop.\n“How are your legs, Eun-ha? Are they okay?”\n“Yeah, they’re fine. They loosened up after resting a bit.”\n“Still, don’t overdo it, okay? It would be bad if you got a cramp while playing in the water.”\n“I’ll be sticking with Han-gyeol the whole time, so it should be fine. Oh? Here comes the bus. Let’s get on.”\nEun-ha seemed even more excited about the swimming pool today, smiling brightly as she boarded the bus.\nWe sat next to each other at the back of the quiet bus, holding hands.\n“Are you that excited?”\n“Yeah. I’ve been waiting for this day for two weeks~ I’m so thrilled. Can’t wait to splash around with Han-gyeol.”\n“Alright. Let’s have a great time there.”\nUpon arriving, we immediately entered the water park.\n“There should be a central meeting plaza. Let’s meet up in front of there.”\n“Okay. I won’t be long. See you in a bit~”\nI watched Eun-ha enter the changing room, and then I went in myself.\nAfter showering and changing into my swimsuit, I headed straight to our meeting spot.\nI had thought it would be less crowded on a weekday, but there were more people than I expected. There were families and quite a few couples.\nIt wasn’t long before I heard Eun-ha’s voice beside me.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah, you’re here?”\nExcited at the prospect of finally seeing Eun-ha, I quickly turned my head. The sight of her standing there, shy and hesitant, left me completely frozen.\nEun-ha was clad in a white bikini, with a sheer white beach cardigan draped over it. Her fair skin was on full display, and her damp hair added a touch of allure. She looked even more beautiful and lovely than I had imagined, leaving me speechless. All I could do was cover my agape mouth with my hand.\n“How... how does it look? Say something, please.”\nEun-ha couldn’t look me straight in the eyes, seemingly embarrassed. I struggled to find words to express my feelings but managed to convey my emotions as best as I could.\n“You’re really... beyond words beautiful. It suits you incredibly well. You’re just so pretty...”\n“Really? It doesn’t look weird or anything?”\n“No. Not at all. Absolutely not. It suits you perfectly. You’re so pretty that I can hardly look at you.”\n“No, don’t... I wore it because I wanted you to see it! It’s meaningless if you don’t look.”\nEun-ha’s words were endearingly sweet. Seeing her smile happily, my heart kept fluttering.\n“I’ll try. Shall we start with the lazy river?”\n“Yeah, let’s go. I really want to get into the water.”\nEun-ha came to my side.\nI knew it already, but Eun-ha’s skin is incredibly fair...\nMy eyes kept drifting to Eun-ha in her swimsuit.\nEven after we entered the lazy river, I couldn’t help but keep looking at Eun-ha.\n“Do you know how to swim, Han-gyeol?”\n“Me? Not really. Barely manage to float. What about Eun-ha?”\n“I think I learned to swim in kindergarten, but I’ve forgotten it all. Did you wait long?”\n“Not really? I didn’t wait much, and you came quicker than I thought.”\n“What were you doing while waiting?”\n“Just looking around the pool. Why?”\n“When I came earlier, I saw there were many pretty girls here... Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha looked at me with a slightly annoyed expression.\n“Yeah. Why?”\n“Only look at me... okay?”\nWow - she’s just too adorable.\nHearing Eun-ha’s words, my mind went blank.\nHer expression and tone were so endearing that my heart beat even faster than before.\nDespite being in the pool, I felt a warmth spreading through my body, and my face flushed.\n“I will... only look at Han-gyeol too.”\n“Eun-ha...! If you say more, my heart might really burst.”\n“That would be troublesome... I can’t live without Han-gyeol now.”\nEun-ha’s continuous words made my head spin.\nSo this is what it feels like to be so happy you could die.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes?”\n“I really love you. The most in the world. I’ll love you until I die.”\n“I love you too. So, so much.”\n“I’m burning up. I need to cool my face.”\n“Your face is really red right now, Han-gyeol.”\n“It’s all because of Eun-ha.”\n“Is it? I didn’t know~”\nEun-ha and I giggled as we made our way around the lazy river.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s go on the water slide. The one for two people over there. It’s not too crowded.”\n“Yeah. Let’s try everything here.”\n“We have to ride everything we can together~”\n“Right. I want to ride everything with Eun-ha too.”\nThere weren’t many people waiting, so our turn came quicker than expected.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll sit in front.”\n“Okay. I’ll be right behind you.”\nEun-ha climbed onto the tube first, and I followed. But as soon as I saw Eun-ha’s pale back, I quickly looked up at the ceiling. It was just too much...\n“Here we go~”\nAs the staff member pushed the tube, we were sucked into the slide.\nEun-ha screamed with excitement as we zoomed down the dark tunnel of the water slide.\n“Ahahaha-! It’s so fast-!”\nAfter the thrilling ride, Eun-ha took off her cap and fixed her hair.\n“Ugh, my hair is a mess.”\nWatching Eun-ha tidy her bangs and re-tie her hair, I fell for her all over again. I couldn’t take my eyes off her delicate, pale neckline and shoulders.\n“You’re really... beautiful. Like a goddess.”\n“Really? You’re so generous with compliments today.”\nResponding to my words, Eun-ha approached me with a smile.\n“Your cap is crooked too, Han-gyeol. Let me fix it for you.”\nAs Eun-ha closed the distance between us, I instinctively raised my arms slightly. Eun-ha, seemingly unaware of the meaning behind my action, tidied up my hair and adjusted my cap for me.\n“Han-gyeol, shall we go around the lazy river again?”\n“Yeah. Let’s take another round and then go for hotdogs. I’m getting a bit hungry.”\n“Sounds good. Come on, let’s hurry.”\nEun-ha grabbed my hand and led me straight back to the lazy river. We were floating leisurely in the flowing water when suddenly Eun-ha let out a short gasp and looked at me.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“Ah! Han-gyeol...!”\n“Yes? What is it?”\n“I think I have a cramp in my leg. It hurts...!”\n“Which leg? Come closer.”\nAs I approached Eun-ha, she placed her arm over my shoulder.\n“Which leg is it? I’ll massage it for you.”\nJust as I was about to massage Eun-ha’s leg, she leaned close to my ear and whispered in a very soft voice.\n“It was a lie.”\nThen she embraced me.\n“What, what-?”\n“Shh- People will think it’s a cramp, so let’s just hug for a moment.”\nI couldn’t help but swallow hard at Eun-ha’s bold move.\n“You’re really daring...”\n“You wanted to hug earlier, didn’t you?”\n“I thought you hadn’t noticed...”\n“Actually, I wanted to be hugged too. So, I caught on.”\n“I admit defeat...”\nI carefully embraced Eun-ha in return.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "We stepped out of the water for a moment and arrived at the food court.\nThe food court was lined with countless dishes I hadn’t eaten in the last two weeks.\nI was still in my swimsuit, so I figured I shouldn’t eat too much, but a hotdog seemed... acceptable.\n“I’ll have a hotdog.”\n“Aren’t you hungry? Why not eat more?”\n“I think this will be enough~”\n“Alright. Grab a table and sit. I’ll go get it.”\n“Okay, okay. Be right back.”\nSitting at the table, I watched Han-gyeol’s retreating figure.\nI wanted to run up to Han-gyeol’s broad back and hug him, but with so many people around, it just wasn’t possible.\nHan-gyeol seemed to have broad shoulders and quite a bit of muscle. I wonder if he works out separately.\nBut whenever our eyes met, Han-gyeol always greeted me with a bright smile.\nJust seeing it lifted my spirits.\n“Here. This is for Eun-ha.”\n“Thanks~”\nWe ate hotdogs facing each other, having returned to the table.\nJust moments ago, all I could think about was hotdogs, but now my gaze naturally drifted to Han-gyeol’s body.\n“Do you work out or something, Han-gyeol?”\n“Me? Not really. Why?”\n“You seem to have quite a lot of muscle.”\n“Maybe it’s just because I have big bones.”\nI shouldn’t say I want to touch them, right?\nBut perhaps a quick poke would be okay?\nIsn’t that a natural curiosity for a girlfriend?\nAh, I should have hugged Han-gyeol when I had the chance...!\nNo, that doesn’t feel right.\n“Do you like guys with lots of muscles, Eun-ha?”\n“Uh-oh?! No. I like your body the best.”\nHan-gyeol looked at me with slightly surprised eyes.\n“That sounded a bit weird...”\n“I meant, you look best right now.”\n“Is that so?”\nHan-gyeol smirked and was about to take a sip of his drink.\nWouldn’t it be okay to speak casually as if it’s nothing?\nWithout even verifying the thought that popped into my head, I blurted out.\n“Can I touch it just once?”\nHan-gyeol burst out laughing, spewing his drink everywhere.\nI thought speaking plainly wouldn’t startle him, but I was mistaken.\n“S-sorry! I didn’t mean to surprise you...!”\n“That was quite a bold statement, don’t you think...?”\n“No, not like a caress! Just a quick poke?!”\n“It’s even more embarrassing to ask permission like that...”\nI looked earnestly at Han-gyeol.\n“J-just the arm...!”\nHan-gyeol chuckled and then placed his arm on the table. I could see the veins slightly protruding as I poked his shoulder. Unlike the softness of Han-gyeol’s cheeks, there was a firmness to it.\n“Fascinating...”\nJust as I was about to explore more, Han-gyeol swiftly withdrew his arm.\n“Ah-”\n“Let’s eat the hotdogs now.”\nI looked at Han-gyeol with a slightly disappointed expression.\n“No use looking disappointed.”\n“That’s mean... I was just getting started.”\nI puffed my cheeks and looked at Han-gyeol. I hadn’t even properly touched him yet.\n“No matter how much you pout, it can’t be helped.”\n“Tsk-”\nI sipped my drink, feeling a bit frustrated.\n“We have to restrain ourselves since we’re still students.”\nPfft-!\nThis time, I was the one who spat out my drink. I coughed, and Han-gyeol handed me a tissue.\n“I... I didn’t mean it like that!”\n“Eun-ha, sometimes you’re like a bulldozer... just now, you were like a fierce beast. Like a rabbit in front of a lion.”\n“No, not at all! I just wanted to feel Han-gyeol’s muscles, purely!”\n“Your eyes and touch seemed pretty sly for ‘pure intentions.’ It’s okay. We just need to be more patient.”\n“No! I just wanted to touch you-!”\nDespite my vehement protests, Han-gyeol continued to enjoy his hotdog.\n“Okay~”\n“No! Look! I’ll let you touch my arm too...! Go ahead!”\n“What? How did we get to this topic?!”\n“You keep teasing me, Han-gyeol! It’s only fair if you touch my arm too...! Please...!”\n“If you put it that way, I definitely can’t touch it-!”\nOur voices must have been loud because people around our table started looking at us. We quickly grabbed our hotdogs and drinks and fled to a distant spot.\nAs we ran, a smile involuntarily crept onto my face. The situation was somehow amusing. It’s not like we said anything worth running away from.\n“But why are we running away?”\n“Exactly. But the atmosphere demanded an escape, right?”\n“It’s because of Han-gyeol-”\n“What?! It’s because Eun-ha told me to touch her arm-!”\n“Hmm, let’s call it mutual fault. Let’s eat quickly and go back to swimming.”\n“Sounds good. Ah- I want to try a bite of your hotdog.”\n“Here-”\nAs I held out my hotdog to Han-gyeol, he opened his mouth wide. Fearing that half of my hotdog would vanish, I swiftly pulled it back to my chest. With a snap, Han-gyeol’s mouth closed.\n“Ah-”\n“Just a little bit! It’s a delicious meal I haven’t had in two weeks.”\n“Okay, okay, just a little.”\n“A little bit, right...?”\nWhen I brought the hotdog to Han-gyeol’s mouth again, he took a bite. But...\n“Hey-! What...?! Hey-! My hotdog-!”\nHan-gyeol bit off half of my hotdog. Chewing contentedly, he swallowed and then looked at me with a satisfied expression.\n“That was delicious~”\nWith that, Han-gyeol dashed away.\n“You, you-! Come back here-!”\n***\nHan-gyeol and I spent the rest of the evening frolicking in the pool before we headed out.\nWe boarded the bus home from the swimming pool. It seemed to be the last stop because, aside from the bus driver, there was nobody else.\n“It feels like we’ve chartered the whole bus.”\n“Indeed. Let’s sit in the back.”\n“Okay.”\n“Ah, my legs are sore.”\nWe sat down side by side, hugging our belongings.\n“Han-gyeol, we really had a great time today.”\n“Next year, let’s go to an even bigger pool.”\n“Yeah~ Or maybe go see the ocean. I’d like that.”\n“We could also go to a stream you like and just dip our feet in.”\n“But if we go to a stream or the ocean, we won’t need swimsuits, right?”\n“I think I prefer the pool.”\n“Why? Want to see me in a bikini again?”\n“Yes. Eun-ha, you looked incredibly pretty today.”\nHan-gyeol’s words made me extremely happy.\nThe two weeks of diligent dieting had paid off.\nIt was a bit embarrassing, but the happiness outweighed that.\n“I want to become even prettier.”\n“Prettier than this? You’re quite greedy.”\n“I want to be more beautiful for Han-gyeol.”\nEvery time Han-gyeol showed his love and admiration, my heart overflowed with joy.\nI should be content by now, but it almost feels addictive; I keep wanting more of his love. Wait a minute... am I being too much?\n“Han-gyeol, am I being too excessive?”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\n“Like, am I being too demanding of your love? Tell me honestly.”\n“Demanding? No, not at all. I’ve never thought that.”\n“If I ever do, you must tell me, okay? If you do, I’ll change! But just so you know, I feel incredibly loved by you right now. What I said earlier was just my own desire. You understand, right?”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol just gazed at me, a blank expression on his face.\n“Eun-ha is lovely, no matter how many times I look at her.”\n“Suddenly? I didn’t mean it in that way.”\n“It’s really lovely how honest you are. And thank you for that.”\nHan-gyeol looked at me with a wide smile. Now I can truly explain.\nWhy I can only be this honest about my feelings with Han-gyeol.\n“I find Han-gyeol lovely too.”\nEvery time I express my honest feelings, Han-gyeol looks at me with such love.\nHe looks at me warmly, as if saying ‘thank you’.\nAnd in his gaze, I can clearly feel the love he has for me.\nI can’t help but be honest with Han-gyeol. I want to see those eyes until the day I die.\n“Really? But Eun-ha, if you ever find my actions or words burdensome or unpleasant, you have to tell me. Okay?”\n“Yeah, yeah. I will...! But I don’t think that will ever happen. Whatever Han-gyeol does, I think I’ll like it.”\nI gently placed my hands on Han-gyeol’s cheeks.\n“Can I kiss you?”\n“Here, in a public place?”\n“There’s no one around. I’ve been good my whole life, so I think this is okay.”\n“What-?!”\n“I love you.”\nJust as I was about to kiss Han-gyeol, a sudden thud! of footsteps was heard.\nWe both swiftly turned our heads away... but it was incredibly disappointing.\nIn the end, the bus started, and as we headed home, only the feeling of disappointment lingered in my heart.\n“You’re staying for dinner at my place, right?”\nAfter getting off the bus, we headed straight home.\n“Yeah, I’m hungry. I wonder if Hyun-joo Noona and Eunwoo Hyung are at home?”\n“They didn’t seem like they were going out when I saw them this morning. I think Unnie might wait for us to come.”\n“Let’s hurry then.”\nEven in the elevator, I couldn’t stop thinking about the kiss we missed on the bus. But by now, I half-gave up, thinking it’s better to let it go.\nAs we got off the elevator and were about to enter the door code, Han-gyeol suddenly grabbed my wrist.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hm?”\n“Can we do what we couldn’t on the bus, now?”\nMy heart fluttered at Han-gyeol’s words. It wasn’t just me feeling the loss.\nThere was no reason to refuse. I nodded slightly, and Han-gyeol slowly moved closer to me. With anticipation, I pursed my lips.\nAs Han-gyeol’s and my breaths began to intermingle, Han-gyeol set down his belongings.\n“Hmm...”\nIt was a kiss a bit different from before, a bit... more intense than usual. I found myself wanting Han-gyeol more fiercely than ever.\nGently wrapping my arms around Han-gyeol’s neck, I dropped what I was holding. The thud of our belongings hitting the ground rang out, but we did not stop.\nI pulled Han-gyeol’s face closer, wanting his lips even more, and Han-gyeol deepened the kiss, longing for me through the parting of my lips. I wished for this entwining of our love to continue unseparated.\nHoping this moment would last forever.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I hadn’t intended to share such a deep kiss from the outset.\nYet, the kiss we missed on the bus lingered regretfully, and even upon reaching Eun-ha’s house, the feeling of loss didn’t fade.\nAs Eun-ha reached for the door lock, I took her hand and spoke frankly, prompting her head to tilt slightly upwards.\nGently holding Eun-ha’s face, I slowly enveloped her lips with mine.\nThe moment her soft lips touched mine, I set down what I was holding.\nThe sounds escaping our lips as we continued to kiss felt provocatively stirring.\nMoreover, Eun-ha’s embrace felt more intense than usual.\nAs Eun-ha’s lips parted slightly, my tongue cautiously slipped into her mouth.\nThe kiss felt entirely different from usual, which worried me a bit, but then Eun-ha pulled me in closer.\nAfter a somewhat sticky kiss, we slowly separated.\n“Haah...”\nEun-ha, with a slightly dazed look, snuggled into my arms.\nEun-ha, holding onto my clothes tightly, seemed too embarrassed to leave my embrace easily.\n“Eun-ha, should we head in now?”\n“Mmm... Just a bit longer... Just a bit longer... I want to stay like this.”\nWith a voice laced with affection, I hugged Eun-ha tighter.\nReflecting on it, that kiss was certainly a bit dangerous.\nI’ll have to be more cautious next time.\nEspecially when it’s just the two of us at home.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol...”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\nEun-ha gently lifted her head from my embrace.\n“Did my lipstick tint smudge?”\n“No, it didn’t smudge.”\n“Really? Then we can continue a bit more.”\n“What?”\n“It’s still not enough. Just a little more...!”\nEun-ha grabbed the collar of my shirt and stood on her tiptoes.\nShe enveloped my lips again, wrapping her arms around my neck.\nLeaning into me slowly, she resumed the kiss we had shared moments before.\nThough her movements were clumsy, they were endearing and filled with love.\nI too closed my eyes and pulled Eun-ha into an embrace.\nAs our tongues intertwined, the feeling of growing love was palpable.\nThinking we should head inside soon, I slowly pulled back.\n“Ah...”\nEun-ha opened her eyes slowly, still looking unsatisfied.\nHer expression was adorable and lovable, but we couldn’t stand in front of the house forever.\n“Shall we go in now?”\n“Um... Yeah. Did my lipstick tint smudge?”\n“If I say it didn’t, are you going to kiss me again?”\n“You caught me... Then, let’s just hold each other a bit longer before we go in.”\nHer arms, previously around my neck, now clung to my waist.\nI held Eun-ha tightly in my embrace.\nGently stroking her hair, we waited until the lingering feelings faded.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Let’s go inside now.”\n“Okay.”\nAs I picked up the items that had fallen to the ground, Eun-ha turned around and pressed the door lock.\nEntering the house, we found Hyun-joo Noona sitting on the living room sofa.\n“We’re back~”\n“Did you have a good time?”\n“Yes, we had a lot of fun. It looks like Eunwoo Hyung went out?”\n“Yeah, he said he was going to meet some friends. I’m also planning to head out after dinner. Are you guys hungry?”\n“Yes, we didn’t eat much at the pool.”\n“Is that so? Are you hungry now, Eun-ha?”\nAfter pondering Hyun-joo Noona’s question for a moment, Eun-ha looked at me and replied.\n“Um- I think I ate a lot. I’m full.”\n“Really?”\n“Han-gyeol, I’m going to change clothes.”\n“Ah- okay.”\nEun-ha gracefully walked into her room.\nWhat was that? Why did she glance at my lips and say she was full?\n“Han-gyeol, how was Eun-ha in her bikini~?”\n“She was incredibly beautiful... Beyond what words can describe.”\n“Really? Then you should have seen it; Eun-ha must have tried on about twenty swimsuits with me~”\nHyun-joo Noona’s voice must have carried to Eun-ha’s room because she quickly opened the door.\n“Ah, Unnie-! Don’t say that-!”\n“What’s the harm~ You even picked out such bold swimsuits~”\n“No, it’s not like that-! It just happened to be the prettiest one-!”\n“Phahaha-! Let’s just say that’s the case~”\n“Unnie-!”\nEun-ha’s efforts to please me were endearing.\n“I, I also really liked that swimsuit-!”\nMy attempt to support Eun-ha backfired, making her more embarrassed.\n“Hmm~ So you liked the bold swimsuit, huh?”\n“Ah-! That’s not what I meant...!”\n“Ahahaha-! Alright! Let’s just say that’s the case for Han-gyeol too~”\n“Unnie-!”\n***\nAfter dinner with Eun-ha and Hyun-joo Noona, I was heading home.\nEun-ha naturally followed behind me as we strolled around the park.\n“Han-gyeol, today was so much fun. Ah, if only we weren’t a student preparing for exams, I’d travel all over the place with you. It’s a pity.”\n“I feel the same. I’d love to go places with Eun-ha too. But for me-”\n“You mean it’s already good as it is, right? Of course, I love it now too.”\n“How did you know what I was going to say?”\n“I guess I can read your mind a little now, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha smiled brightly and held my hand tightly.\n“Really?”\n“Yeah, yeah! You know, when I look at other couples, it all seems pretty much the same. In spring, they go see cherry blossoms, in summer, they go for a swim, in autumn, it’s leaf peeping, and in winter, playing in the snow. These are all places you could go with family or friends, not just with a partner, right?”\n“That’s true.”\n“But for me, going to the pool with family or friends doesn’t compare to the joy of going out with you, Han-gyeol. It might be rude to my family and friends, but I can’t deny feeling this way.”\nIndeed, if we look closely at couples, their dating patterns are largely similar.\n“I’m just happiest when I’m with you, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha swung our clasped hands back and forth, clearly delighted.\nIt was embarrassing, but I felt truly loved.\nHow could I not feel this way when she smiles so brightly and is so happy?\n“Really? You’d be happy with the same kind of dates every day?”\n“Of course! I do want to explore different places with you, Han-gyeol, but ultimately, what I really want is just to have you by my side.”\n“What would you want to do then if I’m always by your side?”\n“I think that’s enough for me. What more could I ask for? If I had to choose, maybe just holding hands and walking like this?”\n“I’ll make sure it can always be like this.”\n“You don’t have to try so hard. You’re already doing enough.”\n“Still, I want to treat you even better, Eun-ha.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha beamed a wide smile and said,\n“You want to treat me well?”\n“Of course.”\n“Good. Then I’ll tell you the perfect way to do that!”\n“Did you have something in mind? You should have said so sooner.”\nLetting go of my hand and placing her hands behind her back, Eun-ha shyly said,\n“Meet with me again tomorrow.”\n“Eh? That’s a given.”\n“Then meet with me the day after tomorrow, too.”\n“Isn’t that also a given?”\n“And the day after that as well.”\n“What’s that~? Tell me what you really want.”\nI urged her to speak her true desire, but Eun-ha kept repeating similar requests.\n“Meet with me the day after that, and the day after that, and five days later too. Let’s meet every day. Got it?”\n“Really? Is that all you want?”\n“Yeah, yeah. That’s all I need. I want to see Han-gyeol every day. Even if it’s just for a brief moment, meet with me every day. Got it?”\n“Seriously? That’s all?”\n“If it’s something I want from Han-gyeol, that’s all there is to it.”\nLooking into Eun-ha’s eyes, I could feel the sincerity in her words.\nSuddenly, my face heated up with a rush of embarrassment.\n“Aw-?! Is Han-gyeol getting shy?”\n“Say something more difficult...”\n“Something more difficult?”\n“Yeah. Like asking me to bring you a star.”\n“Got it. I’ll think of something more difficult.”\nEun-ha closed her eyes, seemingly pondering for a moment before her eyes suddenly sparkled with an idea.\n“I’ve got it!”\n“Let’s hear it.”\n“Hug me tomorrow, and the day after too.”\n“Come on, not the easy stuff~ Something else.”\nSeeing Eun-ha’s charming smile naturally brought one to my face as well.\n“And kiss me tomorrow, and the day after too.”\nHer adorable request had me bursting into laughter, despite us being in the park. Passersby glanced our way, but I couldn’t help myself.\n“Stop laughing~ Will you do it?”\n“Yes, I promise. I’ll hug and kiss you tomorrow, and the day after too.”\n“You’re making a promise, Han-gyeol? You better keep it.”\n“I’m all aflutter. What if I break my promise?”\n“I’ll have to show you how scary a beast can be.”\n“Eun-ha, you’re already quite the beast.”\n“Stop teasing me about being a beast. What animal do you think suits me, Han-gyeol?”\n“Eun-ha? Let me think...”\n“Choose your words wisely, Han-gyeol.”\nEven her warning was endearing.\nI wanted to tease her, despite knowing it would betray her expectations.\n“A lion. Ahh!”\nNo sooner had I spoken than Eun-ha bit my shoulder.\n“Ouch! That hurts, Eun-ha!”\n“Grrr...”\nDespite feeling like I was bitten by a tiger, I couldn’t stop laughing.\n“Okay, okay, I’ll speak properly. Just let go for a moment.”\n“This is your last chance-”\nEun-ha issued a warning, but my playful spirit remained.\n“A cute small animal-”\n“Right, which cute small animal?”\n“-that’s hunted by a lion-”\n“-Come here. I’m taking you home.”\n“It’s a joke, a joke! Let’s go with a rabbit-!”\n“It’s too late now!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "With the new term fast approaching, I wanted to spend more time with Eun-ha.\nI had planned to study with Eun-ha today as well, but then a problem arose.\n“…37.6 degrees?”\nI had woken up with a throbbing headache and a chilly sensation, so I checked my temperature, and it was 37.6 degrees.\nTo think I’d catch a cold in this sweltering heat, melting away… It’s been quite an eventful time.\nIt seemed likely that sleeping with the air conditioner on recently was the cause.\nMy mother had gone to see my father in Busan and said she wouldn’t be back until tomorrow evening.\nWell, it’s not like I haven’t been sick on my own before, no need to worry unnecessarily.\nI hurriedly changed my clothes and headed to the local ENT clinic.\nI waited quietly in line with my mask on until a nurse called my name.\n“Lee Han-gyeol, please come into the consultation room.”\n“Yes…”\nMaybe it was because I moved around.\nI felt heavier than when I had woken up from sleep.\nBut it was definitely not to the point of collapsing.\n“Yes, how can I assist you today?”\n“Ah, I think I’ve caught a cold. I seem to have a fever too. It was 37.6 degrees this morning.”\n“Since when have you been feeling this way?”\n“Since I woke up this morning.”\n“Let me check your temperature again. Just a moment, please.”\nAfter measuring with the thermometer, the doctor said,\n“It’s 37.8 degrees now. Do you have a cough or a runny nose?”\n“I have a bit of a cough... and no runny nose, but could you prescribe something just in case?”\n“Yes, of course. I’ll prescribe medicine for three days. It’s uncomfortable in the summer, but make sure to cover yourself with a blanket when you sleep.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Get plenty of rest. You know what to do, right?”\n“Yes.”\nI settled the medical bill and picked up my medication.\nI considered eating something but, feeling both lazy and exhausted, I ended up taking the medicine on an empty stomach.\nAh, I forgot to buy porridge on the way home. I’ll just order delivery later. I’m too tired right now.\nAfter a quick wash in the bathroom, I went straight to bed.\n“Ah, I need to tell Eun-ha I can’t make it today...”\nI searched for my phone beside the bed and turned on the screen.\nKnowing Eun-ha, if I told her I was home alone, she’d definitely come over to take care of me.\nWith the college entrance exams just about 100 days away, I didn’t want to risk her catching a cold from me... So, I decided not to mention that I’d be alone until tomorrow.\n“Ahem...! Hm...! Ah- Aaaaah-”\nClearing my throat, I called Eun-ha. After a few rings, she picked up immediately, her voice filled with affection.\n-“Hello~ Han-gyeol, why~? Wanted to hear my voice first thing in the morning?”\n“Were you studying?”\n-“No, I was just thinking about Han-gyeol~”\n“Ah, Eun-ha. I don’t think I can come over this afternoon, so I wanted to call you.”\nEun-ha’s playful tone disappeared from her voice.\n-“Oh? Why? What happened?”\n“I think I’ve caught a cold. It’s nothing serious, so don’t worry too much.”\n-“Really? Do you have a fever?”\n“Just a slight one. But it’s nothing to be concerned about.”\n-“Did you go to the hospital? Do you have medication? Is anyone home with you?”\n“I went to the hospital this morning and got some medicine. At home... Mom’s here.”\n-“Ah... She’s not going out, is she? You’re not alone, right?”\nI felt a twinge of guilt but had no other choice.\n“Yeah. Mom’s at home.”\n-“Okay, got it. Did you have breakfast and take your medicine?”\n“I just took my medicine and lay down after a quick shower.”\n-“Alright, got it. Just rest for now. Can you send me a message after you wake up from a nap? It’s okay if you can’t, though.”\n“Why would that be difficult? I’ll send you a message when I wake up.”\n-“Okay. Sleep well-! And if you need anything, just call me anytime, okay?”\n“Yeah~ Sorry to worry you.”\n-“No worries! Just get some rest. Should I hang up? Go rest.”\n“Okay~”\nAfter hanging up the phone with Eun-ha, I placed it back beside my pillow.\nBut my head kept throbbing, making it difficult to fall back asleep.\nAs I closed my eyes slowly, the thumping of my heart became audible, beating steadily.\nI tried to use the rhythmic sound as a lullaby, but it was in vain.\nWith my eyes open, all I saw was the stark white ceiling, and with them closed, all I could hear was the sound of my heart.\nIt felt similar to an experience I had before... the emotions weren’t much different.\n“Being sick really does hurt...”\nAs time passed and the medicine began to take effect, sleepiness gradually crept up on me.\nMy eyelids felt heavy, and soon, I was on the verge of falling asleep.\nI hoped to wake up feeling better.\n***\n—Ding-dong!\nI wasn’t sure how long I had slept, but someone rang the doorbell.\nCould it be a delivery? Still, I just wanted to pull the blanket up and sleep more.\nAfter about 5 minutes of silence, the doorbell rang again.\n—Ding-dong!\n“Is it something urgent...?”\nI reluctantly pushed off the blanket and sat up in bed, though I really didn’t want to get up. But considering it might be something important, I forced myself out of bed and headed to the front door.\n“Who is it..?”\nMy voice was hoarse, probably because I had just woken up. When I managed to open the door, a beautiful girl was waiting outside.\nI locked eyes with the loveliest person in the world, Eun-ha.\n“Uh...? Were you sleeping?”\n“Eun-ha...? Why are you here...?”\n“Sorry for coming unannounced. I heard Han-gyeol was sick, so I brought some fever patches and a few other things. I didn’t expect you to answer the door...! Is your mom not home?”\n“Ah, well...”\nShould I say she stepped out for a moment?\nI didn’t really want to lie to Eun-ha to that extent. But if I told her the truth, Eun-ha might get really upset...\nAs I hesitated, Eun-ha glanced inside the house.\n“No one’s home? Did they step out for a bit?”\n“Ah, well, do you want to come in for now?”\n“Is that okay? I’ll just stay for a bit then. Han-gyeol, you should go lie down.”\nI opened the front door wide and let Eun-ha into the house.\n“Where’s your room, Han-gyeol?”\n“Ah, this way. I haven’t tidied up.”\n“It’s fine. You look really pale. You should lie down right away.”\nAs we entered my room, Eun-ha immediately made me lie down on the bed.\n“I’ll stay until your mom comes back. Do you want an electrolyte drink? Or should I put a fever patch on you?”\nEun-ha started pulling various items out of a plastic bag.\nEverything she had brought was because I was sick. At this point, continuing to lie to Eun-ha seemed impossible.\n“Eun-ha, actually, my mom went to Busan.”\n“Huh? But you said she was at home earlier.”\n“Sorry. I didn’t want to worry you unnecessarily. My mom went to see my dad in Busan and will be back tomorrow...”\n“What-? So you’ve been to the hospital and stayed home alone all this time?”\nI should have kept quiet. But then again, since she said she’d stay until my mom returned, this lie was bound to be uncovered eventually.\nAs I remained silent, Eun-ha looked at me with a slightly annoyed expression. I expected her to be angry, but at that moment, I was at a loss for words.\n“Sorry.”\n“Hmm- Have you eaten anything?”\n“Huh? Ah, no, not yet.”\n“Then just lie down for now. I’ll make some porridge.”\n“No, it’s okay. We can just order something.”\n“That won’t do. Stay put, alright? I won’t ask you twice, okay?”\n“Okay.”\n“Lie down then. I’m going to use the kitchen. Can I open the fridge and take out what I need?”\n“Yeah, that’s fine.”\n“Rest up.”\nEun-ha gently pushed me down onto the bed, making sure I was lying down, and then headed to the kitchen.\n“I’ll leave the door open, so if you need anything, just call me, okay?”\n“Okay.”\nEun-ha started making porridge in the kitchen.\nThe clattering of utensils and the chopping of ingredients reached my ears.\nSoon, the delicious aroma began to waft into the room. Watching Eun-ha cook from behind, I felt a sense of appreciation for her beauty and kindness. Yet, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was still slightly upset.\n“Here, say ‘ah.’ I let it cool down a bit in the kitchen, so it should be okay to eat now.”\nEun-ha had made egg porridge and was feeding it to me herself. It was a tad hot, but she continued to feed me little by little.\n“Is the seasoning okay?”\n“Yeah. It’s really good.”\n“Is there anything else you’d like to eat?”\nWhen I shook my head, Eun-ha brought another spoonful of porridge to my mouth.\n“I’ll eat by myself from now on.”\n“You sure? Here.”\nEun-ha handed me the tray. I silently finished the porridge she had made.\n“Give me the tray. I’ll take it to the sink.”\n“No, I’ll do it. I’m not that sick.”\n“I want to do it for you. Where’s the medicine?”\nI was fine, really... But Eun-ha’s gaze was too determined.\n“It’s on the dining table.”\n“I’ll go get it.”\nSince confessing that my mom wasn’t home, Eun-ha hadn’t smiled even once.\nAlthough she was caring for me with such devotion, it was clear she was still a bit angry.\n“Here’s your medicine and some water.”\nAfter bringing water and medicine from the kitchen, Eun-ha sat down beside the bed again.\n“Eun-ha...”\n“Yeah, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m sorry for lying earlier.”\nI apologized, but Eun-ha, still not smiling, responded.\n“Let’s take the medicine first. We can talk about that later.”\nWhat to do... She’s kind of intimidating.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I can’t say I don’t understand Han-gyeol’s feelings at all.\nHe’s not one to lie without reason, after all.\nPerhaps he lied to avoid worrying me or because he was concerned I might come looking for him like this. While I understand that might be the case, I can’t deny feeling a bit hurt by it.\nBut it seems wrong to burden a sick person with feelings of being let down.\nYet, I didn’t want to force a smile and pretend everything was fine with Han-gyeol.\nI’ve always wanted to be honest with him.\nWhat’s the right way to act here?\nShould I confront him about why he lied? Or should I just accept it as is?\nI definitely can’t just accept it.\nJust like Han-gyeol did for me, I want to do the same for him. I wanted to return the favor, to be there for him when he’s suffering alone.\nThinking about it made me feel even more upset.\nI chopped the green onions on the cutting board a bit faster.\nAfter finishing the porridge and letting it cool for a bit, I headed to Han-gyeol’s room.\nI fed him the porridge myself before handing him the tray.\nWithout any conversation, Han-gyeol quietly ate the porridge, and then I gave him his medicine.\n“Hey, Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m sorry for lying earlier.”\nAlthough Han-gyeol apologized, that couldn’t be the end of it.\nI wanted to talk about it in more detail.\n“Let’s have your medicine first. We can talk about this later.”\nI decided to wait until Han-gyeol was feeling a bit better before bringing up the conversation.\nAfter taking his medicine and water, Han-gyeol placed the cup on the bedside table.\n“Where’s the thermometer? Let’s check your temperature.”\nI asked Han-gyeol after he had taken his medicine.\n“It’s on the desk, but I think my fever might have gone down now.”\n“Let’s check to be sure. Just a moment- oh, here it is.”\nI found the thermometer on Han-gyeol’s neatly organized desk.\nWhen I took his temperature, it read 36.9°C.\n“What was it this morning?”\n“It was 37.6°C. What’s it now?”\n“36.9°C. It’s definitely lower than this morning.”\n“Maybe it’s because of the porridge Eun-ha made for me.”\nHan-gyeol managed a weak smile, but I didn’t respond.\nHis smile and voice were fading.\n“Sorry...”\nHearing Han-gyeol’s apology, I cautiously started the conversation.\n“I’m not mad. But I am hurt. Why didn’t you tell me?”\nI had a rough idea why Han-gyeol did what he did, but I wanted to hear it from him.\n“The college entrance exam is only about a hundred days away, and I didn’t want to worry you. More than anything, I thought you might come to take care of me if I said I was alone. And I was worried I might pass the cold on to you.”\nIt was just as I had expected.\n“I understand. I can see why you’d think that. But how do you think you would have felt if I were sick and alone at home and didn’t tell you anything? Be honest with me.”\nFaced with my question, Han-gyeol pondered for a moment before speaking softly.\n“I would have felt a bit hurt.”\n“Right. I feel the same way. I’m hurt by you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah.”\nI organized my thoughts before speaking.\n“I don’t intend to force you to talk about something you’re uncomfortable with. As your girlfriend, there might be issues I can’t solve, and even if I knew about them, I might not be able to help. If you’re dealing with something, I won’t ask what it is and will just quietly stand by your side until it’s resolved. You’re wise and capable of handling things on your own.”\nI continued, looking Han-gyeol directly in the eyes.\n“But this time is different. You were sick and alone at home. It might seem like an overstatement, but what if your fever had spiked or you’d needed to rush to the emergency room before your mom got back? At the very least, you should have reached out for help when you needed it.”\nMy disappointment began to show.\n“Just as you want to be there for me, I want to do the same for you. I could have helped. Why did you suffer alone? I understand your feelings to some extent, but it still hurts. Just like you were there for me, I want to hold your hand, take care of you, and be by your side when you’re sick. I don’t want to be someone who only takes from you. I want to give back and take care of you too. It’s not just you who feels this way.”\nHan-gyeol seemed a bit surprised by my words.\n“Will you do this again...? Suffer alone because you’re worried about me?”\n“No, I’m sorry. I think I was too selfish.”\n“Right. Don’t do it again. You understand? I’ll be really hurt if it happens again.”\n“Yeah... I’m sorry.”\n“Enough with the apologies... can you thank me for taking care of you instead?”\n“Thank you.”\n“Good. Is that a promise?”\n“Yes.”\nOnly after hearing Han-gyeol’s response did I feel somewhat relieved. I sighed deeply and looked at him.\n“Are you in a lot of pain?”\n“No, not much. Eun-ha, can you smile now? I’ve been a bit scared up till now.”\n“I won’t smile. I’m still hurt.”\n“I’m really thankful you came. I’ll recover faster thanks to my girlfriend.”\nHan-gyeol’s words made the corners of my mouth rise slightly.\nI have to resist. I can’t just start smiling all of a sudden.\n“It’s so nice to see Eun-ha.”\n“...”\nMy lips kept curling upwards.\n‘Come on, go down. Please go down!’\n“Being with Eun-ha makes all the pain fly away.”\n“Hehe...”\nI ended up smiling without realizing it.\n“You’re finally smiling.”\n“Ah, really-! Stop with the compliments and go to sleep.”\n“I want to enjoy the rare occasion of Eun-ha being here a bit longer.”\n“What’s a patient doing talking about enjoying? You’ve taken your medicine, so go to sleep.”\n“I’m not even sleepy.”\n“I’ll hold your hand, so just go to sleep.”\nI carefully took Han-gyeol’s hand in mine.\n“But I want to spend time with Eun-ha.”\n“No, you need to get better. Close your eyes and sleep.”\n“Who can sleep with a beast beside them?”\n“I won’t bite, so just go to sleep, will you?”\n“It’s because I’m thankful.”\n“Just close your eyes for 10 minutes.”\n“Can I get up after 10 minutes?”\n“Yes. So keep them closed.”\n“Okay.”\nHan-gyeol closed his eyes.\nI took in the sight of him, his handsome face.\n“Eun-ha, have you eaten?”\n“I was so worried about Han-gyeol that I couldn’t eat.”\n“Really? You must be hungry.”\n“I managed to force something down. The side dish was meat.”\n“That doesn’t mean you ate it all, does it...?”\n“It was just hard to swallow.”\nHan-gyeol chuckled at my words.\n“What will Eun-ha do if I fall asleep?”\n“Watch over Han-gyeol while he sleeps?”\n“That’s embarrassing.”\n“Just stop talking and fall asleep already.”\n“It feels like I’m making myself vulnerable to being devoured.”\nHan-gyeol seemed to have no intention of falling asleep anytime soon.\nEventually, I quietly got up and lay down beside him.\n“Eun-ha? It feels like someone’s lying next to me.”\n“Yes, that’s right. Since Han-gyeol isn’t falling asleep, I thought I’d join you for a nap.”\n“My heart is racing too much to fall asleep.”\n“Just endure it. I want to sleep.”\nDespite feeling shy, I snuggled into Han-gyeol’s arms.\nHe kept scooting towards the wall, but I kept burrowing in closer.\nFinally, Han-gyeol’s back hit the wall, and I was fully enveloped in his embrace.\n“Eun-ha, sharing a bed... and covering with the same blanket for a nap is a bit-!”\n“We’ll just hold hands and sleep.”\n“Isn’t that an incredibly dangerous statement that’s been around for ages? And we’re already in an embrace. We’re already past the point of no return.”\n“Since Han-gyeol lied today, isn’t it fair to receive this much of a punishment? Even if it’s uncomfortable, endure it. It’s a punishment.”\n“Isn’t that a reward?”\n“Nope. It’s a punishment.”\nI closed my eyes and tried to sleep.\nReluctantly, Han-gyeol held me in his arms.\n“I don’t think I can sleep like this.”\n“Then Han-gyeol can provide an arm pillow.”\n“Can I move it if it gets numb?”\n“No.”\nI slipped out from Han-gyeol’s arm and placed it under my head.\n“Eun-ha, it feels like 10 minutes have passed. Can I open my eyes now?”\n“Yeah~ You can open them now.”\nHan-gyeol opened his eyes and looked at my face.\n“Why are you staring like that?”\n“Because I like lying here with you.”\n“It’s just for today since Han-gyeol is sick.”\n“Did you use that as an excuse to climb into bed?”\nHan-gyeol is really quick-witted, isn’t he? Or is it that he knows me too well?\n“...Was it that obvious?”\n“Extremely.”\n“But I wanted to try napping together with Han-gyeol.”\n“Truth be told, me too. Shall we sleep for just three hours?”\n“That sounds amazing.”\n“But cuddling while sleeping is too much.”\n“No, I’ll just cuddle.”\n“I thought we were just going to hold hands.”\n“That was a lie.”\nI burrowed into Han-gyeol’s arms with a smile. Eventually, he gave in and wrapped his arms around me.\n“I give up..”\n“Thanks for letting me win~”\n“Sleep well, Eun-ha.”\n“Sleep well, Han-gyeol.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was the first to wake up.\nFeeling immensely happy to have dozed off and woken up in Han-gyeol’s arms.\nThe first thing I saw after opening my eyes was Han-gyeol’s face…\nI snuggled closer into Han-gyeol’s embrace, savoring the moment even more.\nThe faint sound of Han-gyeol’s breathing was so delightful.\nJust sharing a bed and a blanket made me so happy.\nI wonder if we ever get married, will I wake up feeling this happiness every day.\nWill there come a time for us to start and end each day together like this.\nGently, I poked Han-gyeol’s cheek with a finger.\nHan-gyeol made a cute noise, ’Hmm-’, which I found absolutely adorable.\nI spent my time closely examining each of Han-gyeol’s facial features.\nAfter a while, Han-gyeol’s arm began to move slightly.\nHan-gyeol stealthily hugged me, not letting me go from the bed.\n“Han-gyeol..! You’re awake, aren’t you?!”\n“Not really. I was asleep.”\n“How long have you been awake…”\n“Let’s stay like this a bit longer. It feels so good.”\nI blushed at Han-gyeol’s words and nodded my head.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Just wanted to call you.”\n“What’s that about? Tell me the rest quickly.”\nI tickled Han-gyeol’s side.\nHan-gyeol’s eyes widened, and his body twisted significantly.\n“Ah-!”\nI was slightly surprised at Han-gyeol’s big reaction.\nBut that feeling quickly turned into joy.\n“Han-gyeol. So, your sides are your weak spot?”\n“Eun-ha. You shouldn’t make that face. It’s trouble when you find a weak spot- Ah-!”\nBefore Han-gyeol could finish speaking, I was already tickling his sides.\nHan-gyeol tried to resist, but I didn’t stop, relentlessly targeting his sides.\nTwisting and turning, Han-gyeol ended up on the other side of the bed.\n“Ahaha-! Stop-! Stop-! I can’t take it anymore..!”\nIt seemed Han-gyeol couldn’t bear it any longer and grabbed my wrists, pushing me down.\nHan-gyeol was on top of me, pressing down on my wrists.\nIt was like a scene straight out of a movie.\n“I told you to stop, didn’t I?”\nThe moment I looked up at Han-gyeol’s bright smile, my heart skipped a beat.\nBlinking my eyes, Han-gyeol seemed to realize how strange our position was.\nSlowly relaxing his grip, Han-gyeol freed my wrists.\n“Sorry.”\n“No, it’s my fault for tickling you.”\nThat was close. I almost lost control of my feelings.\nAnd I was hoping for at least a small kiss!\n“Eun-ha, shall we start getting up now?”\n“I want to lie down a bit more.”\n“I’ll check the time and start preparing dinner. You stay lying down.”\nAs Han-gyeol tried to get out of bed, I quickly grabbed the hem of his clothes.\n“I meant I wanted to lie down with you..”\n“Let me just check the time. Just a moment.”\nHan-gyeol reached for his phone to check the time.\nI hugged Han-gyeol tightly, pushing him to the corner of the bed.\n“No~”\n“Why not? Let’s just check the time.”\n“If it’s late, you’ll escape from bed. I’m so happy right now. Let’s stay like this until I’m satisfied.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol chuckled and hugged me.\nThe gentle stroke of Han-gyeol’s hand through my hair felt incredibly nice.\n“Ah...this is nice.”\n“I really like being with you like this too, Eun-ha.”\n“I want to sleep in the same bed with you like this every day.”\n“Me too. I want to be with you like this every day.”\n“Should we just live together when we’re adults?”\n“Would our parents allow it?”\n“Hmm- I’m not sure.”\nIt doesn’t seem like they’d easily agree.\nBut if it’s Han-gyeol, maybe they would.\nThinking about it now, it’s hard to come up with a definitive answer.\nThe future is important, but we decided to enjoy the happy present even more.\nI drew a heart on Han-gyeol’s stomach with my finger.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Guess what I drew~”\n“Draw it again.”\n“Feel it carefully and guess.”\nAfter I drew the heart again, Han-gyeol said,\n“Heart.”\n“Correct~ Now guess this one.”\nThis time, I wrote the word ‘fool’ swiftly.\n“Calling your boyfriend a fool.”\n“You’re really good at guessing. This isn’t fun.”\n“Let’s stop playing and really get up now. I’m hungry.”\n“Okay. How’s your body feeling, Han-gyeol? Any fever?”\nI carefully pressed my forehead against Han-gyeol’s.\nIt didn’t seem like there was a significant temperature difference.\n“Hmm- I think it’s okay now.”\nHan-gyeol definitely seemed better than this morning.\n“Your face is too close...”\n“Shouldn’t we have kissed? Want me to do it again?”\n“No way. What if you catch my cold?”\n“Then, should I save up today’s kiss for later?”\n“Is it a deposit system?”\n“Yes, a deposit system. It has to be intense.”\n“Alright. I promise.”\n“Ah-! Han-gyeol, I lost my hair tie.”\n“Just a moment. I’ll find it for you.”\nHan-gyeol searched every corner of the bed and found my hair tie.\n“Ah- here it is.”\n“Thanks. I’m going to tie my hair up~”\nAs I gathered my hair to tie it, Han-gyeol stared at me intently.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“No... it’s just that Eun-ha tying her hair is... pretty attractive.”\n“Huh? It’s just tying my hair...?!”\n“Maybe it’s the way it adds allure, or how it draws attention to the neckline…”\nI felt a bit shy, but Han-gyeol was staring intently at me.\n“Am I that pretty?”\n“Yes. Incredibly so.”\nFeeling bashful about exposing my neckline but if Han-gyeol finds it beautiful…\nI whispered carefully into Han-gyeol’s ear.\n“Then I guess I should only tie my hair up in front of Han-gyeol…”\n“Aaaah-! What, what are you saying?”\nHan-gyeol covered his ears and fled towards the wall.\n“Why~? I just want to look pretty for Han-gyeol.”\n“That’s too stimulating… You’ve turned into a wild beast again.”\n“Should I let my hair down and tie it up again? Besides when I’m tying my hair, when else do I look pretty to you?”\n“You always look beautiful.”\n“Not that kind of answer~ Isn’t there a specific moment when I look particularly pretty? Huh? Isn’t there?”\nAs I pressed for an answer, Han-gyeol said,\n“You look the prettiest and cutest when you’re embarrassed.”\n“What’s that~? Be more specific.”\n“For example? When do you think I look the coolest?”\n“Han-gyeol? You look-”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol’s expression right after a kiss popped into my mind. The way he looked at me dreamily, with slightly unfocused eyes, was vivid in my thoughts. Perhaps it was the sexy and somewhat desirous manly gaze...\nBut I could never say it was ‘right after a kiss when your eyes soften.’\n“You’re always cool…?”\n“That’s strange. You definitely had a ‘something came to mind’ look.”\n“No, no-! I wasn’t thinking anything!”\n“Why are you blushing? Tell me. When do I look the coolest?”\nPressed by Han-gyeol’s questioning, I spoke in a small voice.\n“...When you’ve just kissed.”\n“Huh? What was that?”\n“When you look at me with your eyes softened after a kiss…”\nUpon hearing my words, Han-gyeol just looked at me without saying anything, then blushed a beat later.\n“Eun-ha, you are...!”\n“Ah, why-! I was just being honest-! I said your expression after kissing is really sexy-!”\n“Whoa-?! You’re too blunt?”\n“You should definitely kiss me today! No next time!”\n“No-!”\n“Ah, why-!”\n“Because of the cold-!”\n“Then pass it on!”\n“Really?!”\nI looked at Han-gyeol with a slightly dissatisfied expression.\n“This isn’t allowed, that isn’t allowed. Everything’s not allowed…”\n“It’s unavoidable because of the cold. I’ll hug you.”\n“That’s not enough. It’s lacking.”\nI turned my head away with a swish.\n“Lie down.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I jumped into Han-gyeol’s arms.\n“Ack-!”\n“That’s allowed~ Ah, I always want to be in Han-gyeol’s arms.”\n“Being in my arms might still transmit the cold…”\n“Let it then~ If it does, will you kiss me?”\n“We should hope you don’t catch!”\n“Then get well soon. You got it?”\n“Got it. Thanks to you, I’m feeling a lot better, so don’t worry.”\nI felt good hearing Han-gyeol say he was feeling better because of me.\n“Han-gyeol also took care of me when I was sick. I’m just returning the favor. Honestly, I was really grateful back then.”\nWhile in Han-gyeol’s arms, I shared my feelings.\n“Really? I’m glad I came then.”\n“I honestly don’t like being home alone? I understand because Mom and Dad are busy, and my brother was hardly ever home because of academy classes when he was a student. It felt a bit lonely.”\nHan-gyeol slowly stroked my head in response to my words.\nFeeling this warm touch, I continued to speak.\n“But it’s not like that now. With Han-gyeol by my side every day, I don’t feel lonely at all. Am I being too clingy?”\n“Is that so? I haven’t thought about it because it’s adorable. Let’s keep living like this.”\nHearing that it was okay to continue this way made me incredibly grateful.\nReally... Why is Han-gyeol so considerate?\nMy heart is fluttering so much I think I might die.\n“I really, really, really like Han-gyeol. Now, I feel like I can’t be without Han-gyeol. Is this obsession?”\n“Why so many questions? I’m happy with just Eun-ha.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes. Really.”\n“Then give me a kiss.”\n“That’s not possible.”\n“Ah, why~ After all this, just do it.”\n“No~”\n“Should I do it?”\n“It’s a no~”\nHan-gyeol’s continual refusals were slightly annoying.\n“Han-gyeol, do you know?”\n“What?”\n“The more you say no, the more I want to do it.”\nAs I kept pestering, Han-gyeol gave me a short kiss on the back of my hand.\n“Should we be satisfied with a kiss on the hand?”\n“Hmm... but you’ll give me all the missed kisses once you’re better?”\n“Okay~ Shall we eat now?”\n“What do you want to eat? I’ll make it.”\n“Kimchi fried rice?”\n“Sure! I’ll use the kitchen then.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Guys, there are only 90 days left until the CSAT. Everyone knows, right? Let’s hang in there a little longer. Let’s give it our all.”\nSummer break had ended, and the September mock exams were just around the corner.\nDespite the teacher’s encouragement, there was no significant change in the students’ expressions.\nIt’s September, so some kids are bound to be exhausted, and the worries about what lies ahead are far from trivial.\nAfter the September mock exams, it’ll be time to apply for early admission...\nHaving been a student preparing for exams myself, I was quite nervous.\nIt won’t be long before I have to submit my real college applications.\nStill, I’ve worked hard, so I believe there will be good results.\n“Ah, the CSAT is really coming up soon, isn’t it?”\n“Won’t it feel somewhat relieving when it’s all over?”\n“It might feel that way. But I don’t know why I keep doubting myself. I feel like I’ve worked hard...”\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself. Worrying too much doesn’t help anything. Does that sound too preachy?”\n“That’s part of your charm. Hey, Han-gyeol. What are you going to do when you turn twenty?”\n“Go on a date with Eun-ha.”\n“Predictable answer.”\nYujin chuckled as he spoke.\nBut it seemed he had been quite troubled lately.\nYujin sighed deeply and opened up about his worries.\n“To be honest, I don’t really have anything I want to do? I’m also clueless about how to make a living.”\n“That’s understandable. But somehow, life goes on. Even in the worst conditions, life goes on.”\nYujin stared at me intently after my comment.\n“What, are you on your second life or something?”\n“Ah, just trying to sound a bit wise.”\nI accidentally let slip without realizing.\n“What did you decide on for your major? Don’t tell me you’re going for the same major as Eun-ha?”\n“I mean, even I wouldn’t go that far. We might end up at the same university, but having the same major is a bit much.”\n“That’s surprising. I thought you’d follow her no matter what.”\n“Eun-ha wants to create beautiful films. But I don’t have that kind of talent. I just want to make a lot of money.”\n“Pretty ordinary.”\n“Exactly. But living an ordinary life can be so difficult...”\nThere’s only one thing I want.\nA house to live in with my family, and a car to drive them around.\nA life where I come home from work to be greeted by my wife and kids.\nEun-ha said two kids wouldn’t be enough, so our house is going to be quite lively.\nNothing’s set in stone yet, but that’s how I want to live.\nI longed for a life with just a bit of peace of mind and tranquility.\nSince my past life wasn’t filled with fond memories.\n“If ordinary is hard, then maybe it’s not so ordinary?”\n“Right? Maybe I’m just being greedy.”\n“Shin Eun-ha is studying even during breaks.”\n“Eun-ha has always been diligent. But with 100 days left, she’s pushing herself even harder. I’m worried she might overdo it.”\n“Funny, you seem to care more about her than yourself.”\n“She’s more important to me.”\n“What a charmer.”\nI couldn’t quite catch what Yujin said.\nIt sounded like he called me a hunter.\n“A hunter? Eun-ha is definitely a fierce one, but it’s not like I’m going to shoot her with a gun-”\n“Idiot, I said charmer. A charmer. Where did Hunter come from?”\n“I must have heard wrong, man.”\nJust a few more months and I’ll officially be an adult.\nI’ll be able to drive and stay out all night.\nI wonder if Eun-ha is good at drinking. I hope she can hold her liquor well.\n“Aren’t you studying?”\n“I was planning to, after watching Eun-ha concentrate for a bit.”\n“Man, that’s seriously an obsession at this point.”\n“Ah, why is she so adorable? Just looking at her is healing.”\n“Ha- Scratch what I said before. You’re incurably lovesick. No one can help you now.”\nYujin’s reaction was so amusing that I decided to tease him further.\n“Should I go to the nurse’s office? Wonder what medicine she’d give me?”\n“Be careful. She might just give you poison.”\nHe actually played along.\nWhat a good kid.\n“I should go talk to Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah. Hurry up and leave. And don’t come back.”\n“I’ll come back to tell you all about it.”\n“Are you insane?”\nI went straight to Eun-ha and placed an orange-flavored candy on her desk.\n“Eat this while you study.”\n“Okay. Thanks.”\n“You’ve been studying too much lately. You should take a break during breaks.”\n“I want to go to the same university as Han-gyeol.”\n“But you’re not planning on being in the same department, right?”\n“Right. But I still want to go to the same university.”\n“Why? Even if we go to different universities, I’d visit Eun-ha every day.”\n“But if we’re at the same university, we could attend some classes together, even if they’re not for our majors.”\n“You’ve thought that far ahead? What else have you thought about?”\n“What if there are girls who try to hit on Han-gyeol?”\nEun-ha said something so adorable again.\n“I only have eyes for Eun-ha.”\n“What if a girl is carrying something heavy and needs help? What would you do?”\n“I’d just quietly pass by while looking at my phone.”\n“But what if she asks Han-gyeol for help?”\n“How heavy are we talking?”\n“Come here right now. Since when does the weight matter?”\nEun-ha looked at me with a sharp gleam in her eyes.\nI was quite amused, as this was the reaction I had anticipated.\n“Ah, I’m just kidding, just kidding. Of course, I’d never just walk past.”\n“I guess I really do have to go to the same university as Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, let’s definitely go to the same one.”\n“Let’s drink alcohol there. I want to try drinking.”\n“Learn from your parents first, got it?”\n“Yep, yep. I want to drink beer with Han-gyeol at the lakeside park.”\nOur twenties hadn’t even started yet, but just talking about it made me happy.\n***\n“Have you decided which department you’re going to, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m thinking of going into business, tax, or accounting. That seems to suit me.”\nI was involved in that field in my past life too.\nBut accounting was a bit tough, so I was considering going into tax.\n“It sounds intellectual. It would suit you well, Han-gyeol. It’ll be cool.”\n“Really? If Eun-ha thinks it’s cool, maybe I should just go for it~”\n“I think Han-gyeol would be cool no matter what he does.”\n“And I find Eun-ha beautiful no matter what she does. How can you be so beautiful?”\nI pulled Eun-ha’s cheeks towards me.\n“Then adore me even more. Adore me without holding back.”\n“I’m already doing that~ Do you need more?”\n“No-! I’m satisfied! But give me more.”\n“Your words are contradictory?”\n“Give me more-!”\n“What are you, a robber? Here, take this.”\nI attempted to plant a brief kiss on Eun-ha’s cheek, expressing my wish to receive more of her love.\nBut the quick-witted Eun-ha turned her head, resulting in our lips meeting instead.\n“You’re incredibly fast?”\n“It’s nicer to do it on the lips.”\nHolding my hand, Eun-ha spoke.\n“Ah, why do I like Han-gyeol so much?”\n“Really? But you weren’t this cheerful in the beginning.”\n“That’s because I didn’t know what kind of person Han-gyeol was back then~ The more I got to know you, the more I liked you.”\n“When did you start feeling like you liked me?”\n“Hmm, when could it be? I can’t pinpoint the exact moment.”\n“Think about it. Was it when I was taking care of you?”\n“No. I liked Han-gyeol even before that.”\nEun-ha stated firmly.\n“Then, was it when we shared an umbrella on the way home?”\n“Ah! Actually, I lied to Han-gyeol back then.”\n“What-? What kind of lie?”\nI stopped walking and looked at Eun-ha.\n“I said I didn’t have an umbrella because I wanted to share one with Han-gyeol, even though I had one.”\n“What-?! I thought so! You answered too quickly when I asked if you had one!”\n“Sorry...! I just wanted to share it with Han-gyeol.”\n“Eun-ha, you’re quite cunning~? You wanted to go together that much?”\n“Yes. I really wanted to go together. Sorry for lying~”\n“No, I might have done the same thing. So, you started liking me from that moment?”\n“No, I liked Han-gyeol even before that.”\n“Then when exactly did you start liking me?”\nPondering my question for a moment, Eun-ha continued.\n“Now that you mention it... Remember when you comforted me during the March mock exam? I definitely felt sure about my feelings for you then. But I think I had feelings for you even before that. Was it when we went to see a movie? No, that’s not it... When Han-gyeol gave me chocolate? No, it’s not that either. I had been hoping Han-gyeol would give me chocolate even before that happened. So, it seems I’ve liked you even before all those times...”\nEun-ha clearly remembered the times even before we started dating.\n“Since when...?”\n“You don’t have to say it. It’s good that it happened naturally.”\nAlthough I said it was okay, Eun-ha continued to ponder.\nThen, with a bright smile, she shyly said in front of me.\n“I really can’t figure out when I started liking you. Should we just say it was love at first sight?”\n“Would that be okay?”\n“But no matter how much I think about it, I can’t pinpoint a moment. So, it must have been love at first sight~”\nWith those words, Eun-ha moved closer to me.\n“I really wish we had met sooner. We met too late, Han-gyeol. Where have you been all this time?”\n“I was in a faraway place.”\n“From now on, if you stay very close to me, I’ll forgive you.”\n“Alright. I’ll stick right by your side, so please forgive me.”\n“I’ll forgive you, just this once!”\n“Thank you.”\n“For what?”\nThere were so many things I wanted to say to Eun-ha.\nBut I couldn’t bring them all up.\n“Thank you for dating me.”\n“Thankful? If anything, I’m the one who’s more grateful~ I’ve been truly happy since meeting Han-gyeol.”\n“I wish I could make you even happier. Is there a way?”\n“Just keep doing what you’re doing. Got it?”\n“I’m confident in that.”\n“Then that’s settled~! Look, we’ve already arrived. Let’s go inside quickly.”\nEun-ha and I took the elevator up to our apartment.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah, what is it?”\n“Can I kiss you when we get off the elevator?”\n“Feel free to.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Lately, it felt like time was slipping by incredibly fast.\nPreparation for the September mock exams, the September mock exams themselves, early college admissions applications, and studying for the College Scholastic Ability Test.\nAs soon as one was over, another came crashing in.\nIn the midst of this relentless cycle, before we knew it, it was already mid-October.\nThe CSAT was now just about a month away.\nHonestly, I was feeling a bit drained, but just one glance at Han-gyeol beside me was enough to make me pick up my pen again.\nJust a little longer, and we would be twenty and together.\nOnce the CSAT is over, we’ll have fun to our heart’s content, as if the world belongs to me and Han-gyeol.\nFor that day, now is the time to grit our teeth and endure.\nToday, as always, we were studying at my house.\n“Han-gyeol...!”\n“Yeah? Lately, your gaze seems particularly fierce, Eun-ha.”\n“When we turn twenty, I’ll make you happy!”\n“I’ll make you happy too~”\n“No, I’ll make Han-gyeol happy! Because your happiness is my happiness!”\n“Alright~ I’m looking forward to it.”\n“Yeah! Look forward to it!”\nFuelled by Han-gyeol’s expectations, I studied hard.\nHan-gyeol, too, was silently solving problems beside me, pen in hand.\n‘Just you wait and see.’\nBecause when we turn twenty, I’ll devour everything.\nI’ll devour Han-gyeol, and Han-gyeol, and Han-gyeol.\nHan-gyeol always calls me a beast, so he’ll understand.\nHonestly, I’m not really interested in anything else but Han-gyeol.\nAh, I can’t wait to go on a trip with Han-gyeol.\nTo eat delicious food, see beautiful sights, and just be together...\nI’ve decided to stop my imagination here.\nAs I returned to the workbook, something fell from my nose with a plop.\nThe moment a red droplet hit the textbook, Han-gyeol looked over at me.\n“Eun-ha, you have a nosebleed!”\n“Huh?”\nAnd I wasn’t even having any dirty thoughts!\nAs I attempted to tilt my head back, Han-gyeol stopped me.\n“Let it bleed. I’ll grab you some tissue!”\n“Ah...! Okay..!”\nHan-gyeol hurriedly brought over some tissue and held it to my nose.\n“You’ve been pushing yourself too hard lately...!”\n“It’s fine. Nosebleeds can happen when you’re studying, right~”\n“Let’s call it a day and rest. And take it easy tomorrow too.”\n“Huh? But I still have more to do today...!”\n“No, you need to rest today.”\nHan-gyeol was firm.\n“Come here, let’s take care of that nosebleed first.”\n“No, it’s okay! I’ll handle it in the bathroom.”\nI stood up and headed straight for the bathroom.\nI couldn’t just sit in front of my boyfriend with tissue stuffed up my nose.\nIn the bathroom, I cleaned up the blood and stuffed my nose with tissue until the bleeding stopped.\nLuckily, the nosebleed stopped quickly, and I emerged from the bathroom.\n“Did it stop?”\n“Yeah!”\n“Let’s just relax for the rest of the day.”\n“Then, can I lie on Han-gyeol’s lap?”\n“You never miss an opportunity, do you? Come here.”\nI scurried over and laid down on Han-gyeol’s lap.\n“Ah~ this is comfy.”\n“Go to bed early today, okay? And sleep in tomorrow.”\n“Got it. Sorry for worrying you~”\n“Yeah. With the CSAT a month away, you need to take care of yourself. Make sure you eat well.”\n“Don’t worry~ I need to stay healthy to have fun with Han-gyeol after the CSAT.”\n“What’s the first thing you want to do after the CSAT?”\n“We’re like walking discount coupons, right? We can do anything.”\nI said with a smirk, and Han-gyeol laughed.\n“Walking discount coupons, what’s that? That’s funny.”\n“What do you want to do with me after the CSAT, Han-gyeol?”\n“Hmm~ There’s so much I want to do? I just want to dress up nicely and go on a date.”\n“Sounds good. I want to see you in a coat.”\n“A coat? I don’t think I’d look good in one.”\n“Being modest, as usual~ You look good in anything.”\n“You’re making me blush.”\n“Hehe. Cute.”\nI reached up and gently cupped Han-gyeol’s cheek in my hand.\n“Will you tell me I’m cool?”\n“How can I when you’re this cute?”\n“I’d rather hear that I’m cool than cute~”\n“It’s cute that you say that.”\nI grinned, and Han-gyeol laughed in response.\n“Is it just me?”\n“Do I seem that cute to Han-gyeol?”\n“Yes. So cute I want to carry you in my pocket.”\n“That’s a bit much~ But after the CSAT, I really will be by your side every single day.”\n“You’re not planning to sneak over at night, are you?”\n“Maybe I should kidnap Han-gyeol!”\n“You couldn’t lift me if you tried.”\n“With the power of love, anything is possible~ Or would you prefer to kidnap me? I’ll give you my house’s passcode and the perfect timing.”\n“That wouldn’t be kidnapping then, would it?”\n“Is that so?”\n“When will you tell me?”\n“I’ll call you when the time is right~”\nEven during this incredibly tense period, having Han-gyeol by my side meant I hardly felt it.\nI believe that no matter what happens in life, as long as Han-gyeol is with me, there won’t be much to worry about.\nTogether, we drew strength from each other, making it through to the day of the CSAT.\n***\n“Don’t be nervous. I’ll give you something good.”\n“If you flip me off, I’ll chop you off in an instant.”\n“I’ll give it to you after the CSAT, so just go and come back relaxed. You got your admission ticket, ID, watch? Everything’s packed?”\n“Yeah. I just checked everything in my bag a little while ago.”\n“Alright. Take care.”\nMy brother was unusually kind today.\nIt was so out of the ordinary that I had to ask my mom about his behavior.\n“Mom, what’s up with brother? Did he eat something strange this morning?”\n“You... If your brother is trying to encourage you, just say thank you.”\n“Really? Thanks. But I’m not nervous. I’ll be back.”\n“Tell Han-gyeol to do well too.”\n“Yeah. We’re meeting up after the CSAT. Don’t worry~ I’m off now?”\n“Go on, then.”\nI descended to the underground parking lot and got into Mom’s car.\n“Are you really not nervous?”\n“Nope. Just thinking about Han-gyeol makes me not nervous at all.”\n“Is Han-gyeol some kind of talisman?”\n“To me, Han-gyeol himself is a talisman. Ah, I can’t wait to see him after the CSAT is over.”\n“Really? Here’s my card, go out and have dinner together afterwards. Got it?”\n“Can I eat something expensive?”\n“Of course~”\n“Thanks.”\nI wanted to call Han-gyeol but held back. I wanted our next call to be filled with laughter after finishing the CSAT.\n“I’m off then.”\nUpon arriving at the exam site, I greeted my mom.\n“Sweetheart, take care. I’ll be waiting.”\n“Okay. I’ll be back~”\nI entered the examination hall with confidence.\nI walked into the unfamiliar classroom and took my seat.\nI laid out a few alphabet chocolates on my desk and quietly closed my eyes.\nIt was a brief yet long journey.\nReflecting on the past year, it feels like Han-gyeol was always by my side. And when I think about the time we’ll spend together in the future, this seems like just a fleeting moment.\nAs the exam began, I gathered all my focus and dove into the test.\nThe Korean language section, which I felt confident in, went smoothly, and the challenging math section, where I had received a lot of help from Han-gyeol, also passed quickly.\nThe atmosphere was much heavier than any mock exam, but thinking of Han-gyeol, I persevered steadfastly.\nAfter completing both the Korean and math sections, I let out a sigh of relief.\n“Phew...! Thank goodness.”\nI think I did well on both the Korean and math exams.\nI felt I could proudly share my scores with Hyun-joo Unnie and Han-gyeol.\nI ate the lunch Mom packed for me and sat quietly at my desk, thinking of Han-gyeol.\nI wonder how Han-gyeol did in his Korean section? He found it quite challenging. But I’m not worried about the math. Han-gyeol has always been good at math.\nAs each exam came to an end, the moments I would spend with Han-gyeol became increasingly vivid in my mind.\nIn just a few hours, we would no longer be students preparing for entrance exams but prospective college students.\nA sense of anticipation filled my heart.\nSoon after, the English exam began. When memorizing English words, Han-gyeol and I would call out words to each other and recite their meanings.\nEach time a word we had studied together appeared on the exam, a smile naturally crept onto my lips.\nNo, this isn’t the time to smile.\nI calmly and swiftly identified the correct answers.\nHolding onto my slightly waning concentration, I completed all the elective subjects, including Korean history. Although I hadn’t scored them yet, I felt incredibly positive.\nIt was done.\nI had succeeded.\nI felt a rush of reward for the past year’s efforts.\nAfter the CSAT was over, I slowly walked out of the examination room.\nExiting the building amidst a sea of examinees, I quickened my pace towards the main gate.\nParents were waiting for their children, and I looked for my mom as I reached the gate.\n“Eun-ha-!”\nI turned towards where I heard my mom’s voice.\n“Mom-! Give me my phone! I want to call Han-gyeol!”\nI dashed over and grabbed my phone from my mom.\n“How did the exam go?”\n“Great! I can go to the same college as Han-gyeol!”\n“Oh, that’s wonderful! Here’s your phone! Let’s head to the car first.”\nI hurriedly turned on my phone and climbed into my mom’s car.\nAs soon as it powered on, I called Han-gyeol, but his phone was still off.\n“Come on...! Pick up...! Pick up...!”\nHolding onto my phone and on our way home, my mom said,\n“Isn’t that Han-gyeol over there?”\n“Where? Where?”\nI quickly looked around, scanning the surroundings.\n“Isn’t that Han-gyeol, the one walking over there on the right?”\nAs I looked to the side, there was Han-gyeol indeed, walking while holding his phone.\n“Mom-! Pull over to the side!”\n“We can’t stop here~ We have to go further ahead to pull over.”\nI hurriedly rolled down the window and shouted out loud towards Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol-!!”\nHan-gyeol stopped in his tracks and looked at me, his eyes widening.\n“Eun-ha-?!”\n“Han-gyeol-! I think I can go to the same college as you!!”\n“How can you know that without scoring your exam?!”\n“I just have a feeling!! Let’s go to college and become campus couples~!”\n“But where are you going?! Can’t you stop?!”\n“We have to pull over ahead~! Hurry over-!”\nHan-gyeol quickened his pace and soon ran to the intersection.\n“Sweetie~ I know you’re happy, but close the window. Mom’s cold.”\n“Mom-! Han-gyeol must have done well on his exam too! I can be with Han-gyeol... with Han-gyeol..!”\nSuddenly, tears started pouring out.\nNow I can really meet Han-gyeol without any worries.\n“We can go to the same college...!”\n“Are you that happy?”\n“Yes-! I’m so happy...! Really... really so happy!”\n“Alright~ Hurry to your beloved Han-gyeol.”\nAs soon as Mom stopped the car at the intersection, I opened the door. I ran swiftly towards Han-gyeol, who was running towards me.\n“Han-gyeol-!”\nI immediately threw myself into Han-gyeol’s arms.\n“You did well, didn’t you~?”\n“Yeah! I did well! Thanks to Han-gyeol!”\n“How is it thanks to me~? It’s all because of Eun-ha’s hard work.”\n“No~ It’s all thanks to Han-gyeol.”\nHan-gyeol gently wiped away my tears.\n“But you haven’t even scored it yet?”\n“There’s something called a feeling~ What about Han-gyeol? Did you do well?”\n“I think I did well. You’ve worked hard too-umph!”\nUnable to hold back, I pressed my lips against Han-gyeol’s in a kiss. After the brief kiss, Han-gyeol said to me,\n“Isn’t, isn’t your mom behind us?”\n“She’ll pretend not to see. Do it for me too, Han-gyeol.”\n“I’m sure she’s watching, even so...”\n“Hurry~! Do it.”\nAs I jumped up and down in excitement, Han-gyeol reluctantly tilted his head.\nThe sight of Han-gyeol gently pressing his lips against mine was incredibly endearing.\n“Eun-ha, let’s have fun every day now.”\n“I’ve already made a list! We’re going to be super busy starting tomorrow!”\n“Alright, alright. Let’s do everything on the list.”\n“Yes! You’ve done well holding on!”\n“You too, Eun-ha~”\nAs Han-gyeol and I were embracing, my mom’s stern voice cut through.\n“Kids! You can’t do that in the street!”\n“Looks like she was watching after all...”\nI was so grateful to Han-gyeol for being with me through the long journey of our student life.\n“Han-gyeol!”\n“Yeah? What is it?”\n“I love you.”\n“I love you too.”\n“Thank you for coming to me~ I’m so grateful. Don’t go anywhere, stay by my side! I’ll make you happy!”\n“I’ll make you the happiest person in the world, Eun-ha.”\n“You already are! I’m so happy right now! The happiest in the world!”\nAnd just like that, our life as students preparing for exams came to a complete end.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was living a very peaceful life after completing the college entrance exam and entering the golden phase of my life.\nHowever, as Christmas with Eun-ha approached, I was troubled about what gift to give her.\nI wanted to give her a special gift this time, something I had never done before...\nI didn’t want to use my allowance for the gift.\nI wanted to buy it with the money I had earned myself.\n“Han-gyeol~ What are you doing~?”\nLately, whenever I sat in the living room, Eun-ha would suddenly hug me from behind and wouldn’t let go.\nBoth Eun-ha and I had smoothly gotten into college on our first try, so there wasn’t much to worry about anymore.\nAfter morning classes, I would invariably hang out at Eun-ha’s place.\n“Huh? I was looking for a part-time job.”\n“A part-time job? It’s only been a month since the exams ended! Can’t you look for it later and spend more time with me? You’ve been glued to that laptop.”\n“I was also wondering what gift to give you for Christmas.”\n“You don’t need to worry about a gift for me~ Han-gyeol is my gift. So, stop worrying and come hang out with me.”\nSince the exams ended, Eun-ha had become inseparable from me.\nDressed in a sky-blue knit, Eun-ha suddenly grabbed my cheeks and showered me with kisses.\nIt seemed like there was no limit to her affection lately... there was no brake on physical intimacy.\n“Eun-ha, is there something you want?”\n“I want Han-gyeol. I really want you. I want you right now.”\nI couldn’t help but burst into laughter.\n“But you already have me.”\n“That’s right. So, I don’t need any gifts. Just having Han-gyeol is gift enough for me.”\n“Come on, be honest for once. What do you really want?”\n“I want more moments like this.”\nAfter moving away from me, Eun-ha lay down on my lap.\n“Spending time like this with Han-gyeol is a gift for me.”\n“Can’t you suggest something material? It’s kind of hard to decide.”\n“Hmm~ I can’t think of anything right now. Anything from Han-gyeol would be wonderful.”\n“Alright. I’ll make sure to pick something out with care. Looking forward to it?”\n“Yes, yes! What about you, Han-gyeol? What do you want?”\n“Me? I want Eun-ha, too.”\nEun-ha sat up with a bright smile at my words.\n“But you already have me, don’t you?”\n“That’s the response I expected.”\nLooks like I’ll have to take up a part-time job over the weekend.\nFor short-term work, loading and unloading it is... Well, it can’t be helped.\n“Han-gyeol. Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes. What is it?”\n“Just wanted to call you. Ah, Han-gyeol, your name is so pretty.”\n“You like it that much?”\n“Of course~”\nEun-ha leaped into my arms, causing us both to tumble to the living room floor.\nLet’s just say, if it’s not on the bed, it’s barely safe.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Why, Eun-ha~”\n“Come closer.”\n“I’m already close.”\n“Closer~”\nAs I moved my face closer, Eun-ha gently caressed my cheek.\n“Why is your skin so nice, Han-gyeol?”\n“Is it? I don’t really take care of it.”\n“It’s soft and white... I’m a bit jealous. Your eyes are beautiful, your nose is sharp, your lips are soft... Even your ears are pretty.”\nEun-ha was touching each feature of my face.\nIt was slightly embarrassing and ticklish, and I wanted to ask her to stop, but she looked so happy.\nI couldn’t bring myself to say anything to stop her.\n“You’re handsome...! And you have such a nice personality... Is it even possible for someone to be like this?”\n“I’m not that handsome. Just average~ You’re the one who’s really beautiful and kind.”\n“I’m not kind at all~ You’re just seeing me too positively.”\n“If Eun-ha isn’t kind, then the rest of the world must be filled with bad people.”\n“You even speak beautifully...! I really can’t stand it.”\n“Thanks for the complime-mpf.”\nEun-ha pressed her lips against mine.\nThe peck was short but continued repeatedly.\nShe didn’t stop until her tint smeared onto my lips and cheeks.\n“Such a fervent display of affection?”\n“If I don’t do this, I can’t calm my heart.”\n“Is that so? Do as much as you want, then”\nI said it in jest, but Eun-ha’s expression turned seriously earnest.\nHuh? This is quite different from the reaction I was expecting.\n“Really?”\n“Hm?”\n“Can I really do as much as I want?”\n“Well, I mean, I really like it when Eun-ha shows affection, so of course...”\nI’m definitely happy about it, but why does saying it out loud feel like it might backfire?\nIs it some kind of animal instinct? But what could possibly go wrong?\n“Okay.”\n“...”\n“Han-gyeol definitely said it. I can do as much as I want.”\n“Yeah... Did I say that?”\n“Right? Then, Han-gyeol, you’re partly responsible now~”\nEun-ha then engulfed my lips with hers.\nWas I being devoured? Sucked in? The kiss was so intense it felt like one of those two.\nI was slightly taken aback, but I also wrapped my arms around Eun-ha’s waist.\nRight. There’s no need for either of us to hold back.\nWhy restrain myself?\nToday, too, I silently sang the national anthem in my heart to control myself.\n***\nFor Eun-ha’s Christmas gift, I decided to buy her a wallet.\nA nice wallet seemed fitting to commemorate her turning twenty.\nI didn’t want to use my allowance for the gift, so I worked in loading and unloading for a couple of days.\nDragging my tired body, I went to the department store to pick out a wallet.\nBut then, I was overwhelmed trying to figure out Eun-ha’s taste.\nHonestly, they all looked the same to me...\nStill, I painstakingly chose a wallet with a pretty design, but then the color became an issue.\n“Excuse me, may I ask you something?”\n“Of course, go ahead.”\nI wanted to take the female clerk’s opinion into consideration as well.\n“Between this white and black, which one is better? The white looks pretty, but I’m a bit worried about it getting dirty, while the black seems safer from stains, but it feels somewhat heavy. For a twenty-year-old university student, the bright and cheerful vibe of white would be better, right?”\nThe clerk seemed a bit flustered by my question before responding.\n“It seems like you’ve already analyzed it perfectly? Since you’ve thought about it so much, wouldn’t she be happy with anything you choose?”\n“I suppose so...? Then, I’ll go with the white color. Do you offer gift wrapping as well?”\n“Yes, we do. Would you like it prepared that way?”\n“Yes, please. Thank you.”\nI wonder if she’ll be happy to receive the gift. I’m eager to see her smile.\nSitting on a chair in the store, I turned on my phone.\nThe day after tomorrow is finally Christmas. And soon, we’ll both be turning twenty.\nI should start planning a trip with Eun-ha. But it looks like I’ll need to find a part-time job too.\nI wonder if there are any good ones out there. I’d prefer to avoid loading and unloading work.\nLost in thought, the clerk approached me.\n“Here’s the item you ordered.”\n“Ah, thank you!”\n“Have a great Christmas.”\n“You too, have a wonderful Christmas.”\nI took the gift box from the clerk and left the store.\nAfter returning home, I showered and changed my clothes.\n“I wonder what Eun-ha is doing.”\nLying on the bed, I immediately called Eun-ha.\nHer cheerful voice answered before the phone even rang a few times.\n-Han-gyeol! Did you come back from your part-time job? Aren’t you tired?\nI had told her I needed to go to work today to pick out a gift.\n“I’m not tired~ What were you up to?”\n-I was thinking about Han-gyeol~ I miss you so much.\n“I miss you too. We’ll see each other tomorrow, so let’s just hang in there a bit longer.”\n-Okay. Ah, Han-gyeol. I’m in the middle of something, so I’ll call you back- Oh?\nEun-ha’s voice hesitated mid-conversation.\n“What’s up? Is something wrong?”\n-No, it’s nothing. I ordered a package, but it seems like something went wrong.\n“Is it important?”\n-No~ I need to check with the delivery service, so I’ll call you back later~\n“If it’s something serious, I can help. Where do you need to inquire?”\n-It’s really okay-! I’ll call you back in 10 minutes, Han-gyeol~\n“Alright, get in touch.”\n-Yes, yes-!\n“It’s a shame. I wanted to talk more.”\nTo soothe my longing, I was browsing through the photos I had taken with Eun-ha.\nSuddenly, my mother’s voice boomed from the living room.\n“Son! Come to the living room, we need to talk!”\nPrompted by the resounding call, I immediately opened my room door and stepped out.\n“Yes? What’s it about?”\n“Sit down first. It’s an important matter.”\nA wave of anxiety washed over me... I’ve already been accepted into college, what kind of ordeal is this now?\nHesitantly, I sat down on the living room floor as my mother began.\n“Son, do you think you can live on your own?”\n“Suddenly? Why?”\n“Your mom... I’m planning to live where your dad is.”\n“What? You’ve never mentioned that before.”\n“Your dad was transferred, and we were planning to move, but I didn’t bring it up since you were taking your exams. Is that okay?”\nFor a moment, I thought I had misheard. Does this mean I can live by myself in Seoul?\n“So, you mean you’ll be staying in Busan?”\n“Yes. We can’t leave your dad to live alone forever. But I’m worried about leaving you alone...?”\n“I’m fine with it. But if I live alone, what about rent and living expenses?”\n“Of course, your mom and dad will take care of that. But it feels wrong, almost like abandoning our son who’s just turned twenty. If you’re not okay with it, I’ll stay here.”\nLiving alone at twenty?\nAnd with financial support from my parents?\nThis is an opportunity I absolutely cannot miss!\nGently, I grasped my mother’s hand.\n“Mom...!”\n“Why are you suddenly like this?”\n“Twenty years is enough, isn’t it? Why try to raise me more? I can manage on my own.”\nThough I said this, only one thought was spinning in my head.\nPlease, let me live on my own.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I bought a wallet as a Christmas gift for Han-gyeol.\nBut feeling something was missing, I decided to knit a scarf for him myself.\nNever having knitted before, I relied on my mom’s guidance as I worked on the scarf.\n“Mom, am I doing this right?”\n“Yes, yes. But with only a week left, are you sure you can finish?”\n“I’ll pull an all-nighter if I have to—it’s for Han-gyeol.”\nI hoped Han-gyeol would be happy with it. I couldn’t wait to give him the scarf, eager to see his bright, joyful smile.\n“My daughter is all smiles, isn’t she?”\n“Am I? Must be thinking about Han-gyeol.”\n“Oh, Han-gyeol would be so happy to see you like this.”\n“I hope so. I really want to give him his gift soon.”\n“Do you like Han-gyeol that much?”\n“Yes, incredibly so. I really, really like him.”\nMy mom seemed quite curious about me and Han-gyeol.\n“What’s so good about him?”\n“Well, he’s kind and considerate... How should I put it? It’s not just Han-gyeol I like, but also the time I spend with him. It’s always just fun. Mom, after meeting Han-gyeol, I realized I might have been lonelier than I thought.”\n“Is that so?”\nMy mom looked at me, slightly surprised.\n“But strangely, now I don’t feel as lonely, even when I’m alone.”\n“Why’s that?”\n“I wonder. Maybe it’s because I think about Han-gyeol when I’m alone, just like how you, dad, and Han-gyeol might be thinking about me. Is that too vague? I can’t quite express it clearly.”\nI shrugged as I replied.\n“You’re in love, that’s what.”\n“Exactly! Oh, I can’t wait to see Han-gyeol.”\n“What have you planned for Christmas?”\n“It might be crowded outside, so we’re thinking of staying in at first, then going out in the evening. Oh, and I ordered a Santa costume!”\n“A Santa costume?”\n“Yes, yes. I think Han-gyeol will like it. It’s a bit risky, but it should arrive just in time. Nothing weird! It’s a wholesome Santa costume.”\n“That’s good to hear. Have fun.”\n“Yes, I’m really looking forward to it.”\nMy first Christmas together with Han-gyeol.\nJust the thought made my heart flutter with excitement.\n***\nToday was my first Christmas together with Han-gyeol.\nHowever, there was a slight issue with the Santa costume that had arrived two days ago.\nI had envisioned a cute Santa costume outfit, but...\nDue to some mix-up in the delivery, what arrived was a rather suggestive Santa girl costume.\nI tried calling customer service, but it was clear there was no way to get a new delivery within two days.\nSo, I had no choice but to wear the Santa girl costume that had arrived, unable to return it.\nLuckily, the size was right, though it did have a slightly risqué feel.\n“There’s nothing I can do about it... It’s not overly provocative.”\nIt might be a bit stimulating for both me and Han-gyeol, but since it’s just for him to see, it didn’t matter.\nWho knows, Han-gyeol might even like this look more.\nConsidering how embarrassed he got when I wore a swimsuit... Will he show the same expression this time?\nIt’s a bold thought, but I wanted to see Han-gyeol’s shy expression.\nAnd I wanted to see him unable to take his eyes off me.\nDressed as a Santa girl, I waited on the couch for Han-gyeol to arrive.\nAbout thirty minutes must have passed when our doorbell rang.\nI hurried to the entrance, slinging the bag of gifts over my shoulder, and dashed to the door.\n“Who is it~?”\n“It’s me~”\nI continued to talk with Han-gyeol through the door without opening it immediately.\n“Who might you be~?”\n“It’s me, me. Lee Han-gyeol. Eun-ha’s boyfriend.”\nAh- this is fun.\nI opened the door with a bright smile.\n“Have you arrived?”\n“Me, Merry Christmas...haha..ha!”\n“Huh? What?!”\nAs soon as the door opened, there stood Han-gyeol, dressed as Santa Claus, his face already flushed with embarrassment.\nSeeing Han-gyeol like this, I couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Han-gyeol, shyly dressed as Santa, was incredibly cute.\n“You’re too cute!”\nWithout realizing it, I dropped the bag of gifts I was holding.\nHe was truly the cutest Santa in the world.\nHan-gyeol’s red cheeks only multiplied his cuteness several times over.\n“You’re a Santa girl too...”\n“Yeah! I wore it hoping Han-gyeol would be happy. How is it? Do you like it?”\nI spun around in place and asked.\n“You look incredibly beautiful... When did you even prepare something like this?”\n“You prepared the same thing, Han-gyeol. I’m so happy. Why do we match so well? We must be soulmates.”\nI threw myself into Han-gyeol’s arms.\nI couldn’t believe we had the same idea. I felt like I could fly with joy.\n“Did you wear this to make me happy too?”\n“Of course. I thought you’d be happy. But it’s embarrassing, I want to change.”\n“You can come in, but no changing clothes! Let’s have fun as we are. Come on in~”\nI led Han-gyeol inside the house.\nAs soon as we reached the living room, I showed him the elaborately decorated space.\n“Ta-da! How is it? Feels like Christmas, right?! I even prepared a cake.”\n“What? You prepared so much? There are balloons and a tree too.”\n“I mentioned spending Christmas at home with you, so my brother and unni helped out.”\n“Really? You’ve made it look so beautiful. You must have worked hard decorating.”\n“Not at all~ Thinking of spending time with Han-gyeol made it effortless.”\nAs Han-gyeol looked around the living room, I quickly dabbed some of the cake’s whipped cream onto his cheek.\n“Hey!”\n“Yikes! What’s the sudden attack for?”\n“Ahaha! I’ve always wanted to play a prank with a Christmas cake.”\n“Come here, you.”\n“No way~”\nHan-gyeol, too, got some cream on his finger and came after me.\nDarting around the living room, he eventually caught me from behind.\nDespite my struggles, he managed to smear cream on my lips.\n“If it’s on my lips, I can just eat it off!”\nHan-gyeol held my shoulders and took the cream off my lips. The sweet cream brushed against his lips and mine.\n“Right, just eat it off~”\nThis was a kind of intimacy we hadn’t shared before, and it made my face burn.\n“All of a sudden...!”\n“Why does it feel like it’s been a while since I’ve seen Eun-ha blush?”\n“Do it one more time... Please?”\n“Huh? How did the conversation turn this way?”\n“You said last time I could do anything I wanted, right?”\n“Whoa, Eun-ha’s gaze is quite fierce right now...”\n“No running away, okay?”\nI warned Han-gyeol, who just chuckled in response.\n“Of course, I’m all for it.”\n“Yay~ Then~!”\nI quickly captured his lips with mine.\nAs I slowly wrapped my arms around Han-gyeol’s neck, he pulled me closer.\nOur kiss intensified, filled with a competitive tension. Despite the risqué sounds, we didn’t stop.\nOh, this is just too good.\nSpending Christmas with Han-gyeol like this.\nKissing while dressed in Santa costumes at home.\nThe pleasure was so overwhelming, I deepened the kiss even more.\nHan-gyeol seemed a bit startled and pulled his head back slightly.\n“Are you trying to devour me?”\n“Grrr!”\nI raised my arms and said,\n“I guess you are a beast. But you know what, Eun-ha?”\n“What’s that? Not ready to be caught without a fight? No can do. No escaping.”\n“It’s not that. To be honest, I also want to devour you.”\n“Really now? Why haven’t you then? Go on, devour me!”\n“For real?”\n“Yes, for real~”\n“You won’t regret it?”\n“Nope~ If I can become nourishment for Han-gyeol, I’d gladly be devoured!”\nBefore I could even finish my sentence, Han-gyeol’s lips were on mine again.\nI’ve always welcomed his kisses with joy, but this time... it felt dangerously delightful.\nThe kiss, tender yet firm, made my consciousness drift away.\nSlowly... and gently, Han-gyeol’s kisses led me towards the wall, continuing without end. Without any resistance, I could only tightly grasp at Han-gyeol’s waist, unsure of what to do.\nBut the whirlwind of kisses scrambled my thoughts, and gradually, my strength ebbed away.\nEventually, my legs gave out, and I slid down the wall to the floor.\n“Haaah... Haaah...”\nI realized then that all the kisses we shared before were considerate.\nHe had always just been going with my flow... Han-gyeol had been considerate even in that moment...\nBut somehow, this kiss felt tens of times better than any we had shared before.\nJust a little more... just one more time.\n“Han-gyeol... just a bit more... hic!”\nHuh?\n“Hmm?”\n“Just one more kiss... hic!”\nI couldn’t stop hiccuping long enough to speak.\nI took a deep breath to try and speak again.\n“Just one- hic!”\n“Let’s stop the hiccups first.”\nAh, I wanted one more kiss!\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After Eun-ha’s hiccups had subsided, I handed her the gift I had brought.\n“Eun-ha, this is my Christmas present for you. I hope you like it, though I’m not sure if I have a good sense for gifts.”\n“What is it? Can I open it right now?”\n“Yes, go ahead.”\n“I wonder what’s inside~”\nEun-ha, brimming with anticipation, opened the paper bag and pulled out a box from inside.\nCarefully opening the box, she immediately looked into my eyes upon seeing the beautiful wallet.\nShe seemed utterly surprised, and I couldn’t tell what had shocked her so much.\n“A wallet..?”\nHer voice trailed off slightly, making me think this gift was a failure.\nBut then she flashed a joyful smile and lunged at me, expressing how much she loved it.\nEun-ha ended up on top of me as I fell backward. She joyfully squirmed and grabbed my face.\n“I love it so much, Han-gyeol...”\nTears fell from Eun-ha’s eyes that were covering me, trickling down my cheeks.\n“Are you that moved? It’s nothing special.”\n“I don’t know... I just love it. Han-gyeol, you’re my favorite in the world.”\n“You’re happy, aren’t you?”\n“Yes, so happy, that’s why I’m crying...”\nI lifted my arms to gently wipe away Eun-ha’s tears, but they kept falling onto my cheeks.\n“Eun-ha, you’ll get dehydrated if you keep this up.”\n“What’s that~ Why would I get dehydrated~”\nEun-ha smiled slightly at my joke.\n“Eun-ha, even your crying is beautiful.”\n“So is Han-gyeol...! So beautiful! Come here!”\nEun-ha then leaned down and showered my face with kisses. I was too happy to resist, and Eun-ha showed no sign of stopping even as time passed.\n“Eun-ha-? At this rate, there won’t be any of my face left.”\n“I’m going to mark it as mine with kisses.”\n“It already seems covered in Eun-ha’s lipstick.”\n“Exactly. Now no one will dare look at you. I’ve marked you.”\n“I can’t live like this. How does my face look now?”\n“Handsome...”\nEun-ha’s unequivocal response made me laugh.\n“No. How many lipstick marks are there?”\n“I feel like it’s still slightly lacking... Can I fill every nook and cranny?”\n“Of course not!”\n“Kyaaa!”\nAs I sat up, Eun-ha found herself comfortably seated on my thighs.\nIt was a somewhat awkward and embarrassing position, but I just wanted to tease her a little.\nGently wrapping my right arm around Eun-ha’s waist and cradling her head with my left, I laid her down on the couch.\nWithout any resistance, Eun-ha lay her head on the couch and silently gazed at my face.\nAfter giving her forehead a quick kiss, who was expecting what would come next, I got up from the couch.\nAs soon as I stepped away, Eun-ha quickly sat up and exclaimed,\n“Ah...! What’s that about!”\nLike an irritated cat, Eun-ha puffed up her cheeks and glared at me.\n“What did I do?”\n“Why didn’t you kiss me?! If you lay me down, you’re supposed to kiss me!”\n“You’re saying something dangerous. It’s risky to kiss after laying someone down.”\nI drew out my words playfully. However, Eun-ha still looked unsatisfied and merely muttered under her breath.\n“What’s risky about it... Tsk.”\n“Sorry? What was that?”\n“What’s risky about it?! I’ll be twenty in a week, so there’s nothing risky anymore! It’s time when what comes after a kiss doesn’t matter!”\n“What comes after?!”\n“Yes! What comes after!”\nEun-ha’s bombshell left me completely stunned. I even doubted if what she just said was accurate.\n“You... you can’t just blurt out things like that!”\n“Why not?! I’ll be an adult soon, so it’s fine!”\n“But you’re not an adult yet!”\n“Will you do it when I’m an adult?!”\nEun-ha’s words felt like a barrage to my head.\nIt was as if bells were ringing above me.\nBut... I guess I had to answer.\n“Yes...”\nAt my response, Eun-ha deflated her puffed cheeks and looked up at me.\nThe saying goes, ‘The quiet and well-behaved cat gets on the hearth first*’... Guess it wasn’t wrong after all.\n“Then, that’s settled...”\nEun-ha turned her head away in embarrassment, but the atmosphere had already crossed an irreversible river.\nI tried to think of something to change the mood, but nothing suitable came to mind.\nIt was Eun-ha who broke the silence.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah...”\nAlright. Let’s trust in my girlfriend’s wit this time.\n“But... when exactly should we do it...?”\nAnd there it goes, bursting like a bubble.\n“That’s not what I meant...! Let’s talk about something else for now, and we’ll go with the flow for that-!”\n“But, but-! For such a big step... shouldn’t we have some sort of plan?!”\n“You have a point, but...! Anyway, let’s leave that to me and focus on other topics for now...!”\n“No, no-! I don’t want to put all the pressure on Han-gyeol. Let’s do it together-! When would be a good time?!”\nAh- This calls for a definitive conclusion.\n“The first night of our trip.”\n“That night? Okay..! I’ll prepare..! I’ll do my best!”\nEun-ha clenched her fist, determined.\nAs whimsical as it was... I couldn’t help but laugh at Eun-ha’s strong spirit.\nThis side of her is also why I love Eun-ha, my girlfriend.\n“Really... you’re so unpredictable.”\n“Me? Why?”\n“Because I love you.”\n“Suddenly?!”\nYes. It’s good to have things decided.\n“Eun-ha, show me your present too. You said I should look forward to it.”\nI said, looking at the present bundle on the sofa.\nIt was the only thing that could divert the topic under the current circumstances.\n“Ah-! Okay-okay-! Come here and close your eyes.”\n“Alright~”\nI sat next to Eun-ha again and closed my eyes.\nI heard rustling sounds, then Eun-ha pulled something out.\n“Han-gyeol, you can open your eyes now.”\nAs I slowly opened my eyes, Eun-ha was holding a large gift box.\n“Why is it so big?”\n“Open it~! You’ll be surprised!”\n“Thank you~”\nUpon opening the gift box, I found a beautiful wallet and a scarf inside.\n“Wow...! Why did you prepare so much?”\n“How is it? Are you happy? Are you pleased?”\nEun-ha leaned in with a happy smile.\n“Wow-! It’s really pretty. Eun-ha, you gave me a wallet too? It’s nice to be on the same wavelength. I was actually planning to buy one when I became an adult...! The scarf is incredibly beautiful too! Wait, did you make this yourself...?!”\nEun-ha nodded in response to my question.\n“Wow-! Really?! I want to try it on right now.”\n“Really?! Come closer. I’ll tie it for you.”\nEun-ha spread out the scarf and wrapped it around my neck.\nEun-ha, who even tied a pretty knot, smiled at me.\n“It suits you really well, Han-gyeol.”\n“Really? Thank you so much. I should have done more for Eun-ha. I’m sorry.”\n“No-! I’m really happy and grateful for Han-gyeol’s gift too. I mean it-! I’m so happy!”\nGrateful, I planted a soft kiss on her cheek.\n“Han-gyeol, there’s a card inside too!”\n“Really? Can I read it now?”\n“It’s a bit embarrassing, but go ahead!”\n“Alright, then I’ll read it~”\nI pulled the letter out of the red Christmas envelope and began to read it slowly.\nEun-ha’s letter, written in beautiful handwriting, naturally brought a smile to my face.\n[ To my beloved Han-gyeol,\nHan-gyeol, this feels like the first time I’m writing a letter since we started dating. Honestly, it’s quite embarrassing, but since I’m expressing it through writing, I’ve tried to fully convey my feelings.\nWell… First off, I’m so thankful to you, Han-gyeol. There’s not just one or two reasons for my gratitude.\nFor comforting me when I was down.\nFor being there when I was sick.\nFor brightening up my home when you visit.\nFor enduring the tough times of exam preparations with me. I’m thankful for all of it.\nThere’s so much I’m grateful for that if I tried to write it all down, this letter would never end.\nHan-gyeol, you know, I’ve never really opened up about my feelings to anyone. To put it negatively, I guess I had trouble trusting people. I was honest, but I was afraid of being rejected.\nBut every time you accepted my feelings just as they were, I found myself falling deeper for you. Maybe you’re the one who changed the me who could have lived like that forever.\nI’m truly, truly grateful that you appeared in my life with a bang.\nEver since I met you, my life has been ceaselessly shining. Every moment of breathing is enjoyable, and being by your side makes me feel what happiness truly is. I can’t express how joyful I am to spend the end of my teens with you.\nPlease be with me on the last Christmas of my life too.\nI don’t think I can fully express my heart through words, speech, or actions.\nI love you so much, Han-gyeol. Every word and action I give to you is sincere.\nNow, a year from now, ten years from now, and even beyond that, I will always be sincere to you!\nJust know this, okay? That I will always love you.\nThank you for accepting my love, Han-gyeol.\nAnd thank you for loving someone as imperfect as me, Han-gyeol.\nPlease continue to love me with the same ‘constant’ heart.\nI, too, will love you with a ‘constant’ heart.\nMerry Christmas. Let’s enjoy the remaining time~\nFrom your girlfriend, Eun-ha. ]\nAs soon as I finished reading the letter, a tingling sensation pricked at my nose.\nI hadn’t done much, but I was deeply grateful to Eun-ha, who said she was happy because of me.\nEun-ha, who said every moment with me was joyful and promised it would be so in the future, made me feel like I was about to choke up, so I bit my lower lip to hold back the tears.\n“Thank you...”\n“Really? If you’re thankful, give me a deep kiss quickly.”\n“Come here.”\nEun-ha closed her eyes and moved closer at my words.\n“Come here.”\n“I love you, Eun-ha. I love you so much that words can’t express.”\n“Yeah! I love you tremendously too.”\nI gently captured Eun-ha’s lips with mine.\nNo matter how much I think about it, it seems there couldn’t be anything more blissful than this.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL:\nThe quiet and well-behaved cat gets on the hearth first\n- It’s a Korean saying that means even those who appear calm and dignified on the outside can sometimes act in cunning ways first, especially when tempted.\n…Please be with me on the last Christmas of my life too… Man... this is such a beautiful line.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After exchanging gifts, we spent the time playing games at home.\nHan-gyeol tried his hardest, mashing the controller, but he still couldn’t snatch a victory from me.\nHis slightly sullen face was just too adorable.\n“I definitely practiced at home...”\n“It’s okay. Han-gyeol, you’re good enough to brag about it elsewhere.”\n“How much do I need to train to beat Eun-ha... I just want to win once.”\n“Take it easy~ I’m always up for a challenge. Hey, Han-gyeol! Come here.”\nI grabbed Han-gyeol’s hand without a second thought and dragged him to the balcony.\n“Huh? Why all of a sudden?”\n“Look, it’s snowing outside!”\nSnow was pouring down outside the window. Spending our first Christmas together as a White Christmas... it feels like a dream.\n“It’s snowing a lot. Looks like it’s going to pile up.”\n“Han-gyeol, let’s go out and play!”\n“Outside? Wouldn’t it be cold?”\n“I want to have a snowball fight!”\n“Snowball fight?”\n“Yeah, yeah!”\nI nodded vigorously.\nIt might seem a bit childish, but we’re still young after all.\nWhen I looked at Han-gyeol with hopeful eyes, he eventually agreed.\n“Alright. The battle I lost in the game, I’ll win in a snowball fight in reality.”\n“Good. I won’t go easy on you. If it piles up a lot, let’s make a snowman too.”\n“Sure. But we need to change our clothes before going out. Can’t go out in Santa outfits.”\n“Yeah, yeah. Did you bring clothes, Han-gyeol?”\n“I have outerwear, but I was planning to change my Santa outfits into a tracksuit.”\n“Then let’s quickly change and go out! I’ll change and come out too~”\nI quickly changed my clothes in the room and came out.\n“Do you need gloves, Han-gyeol? Use these.”\n“Wow, you’re all geared up. Am I going to lose?”\n“I haven’t had a snowball fight in a long time. I might lose, you know?”\n“Same here, but let’s go.”\n“Yeah, yeah! I’m so excited!”\nArm in arm with Han-gyeol, I stepped outside the house.\nHuge snowflakes were pouring down from the sky.\nIt was snowing much more than what we saw from inside the house.\n“Isn’t this a blizzard?”\n“Who cares. Let’s go to the park and play.”\n“Eun-ha, look here.”\n“Huh? What— Ahh!”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol scooped up some snow and dumped it on my head.\nWith my hair covered in white snow, I looked at Han-gyeol.\nSeeing his beaming smile, I couldn’t help but smile brightly too.\n“You’re dead, Han-gyeol.”\n“What-?”\nI tried to scoop up snow to throw back at Han-gyeol, but he had already dashed off into the distance.\n“Hey! Where do you think you’re running off to? You’re dead if I catch you.”\nI threw the snow I had scooped up and sprinted after Han-gyeol with all my might.\nBefore we knew it, we had arrived at the park and were smiling at each other.\n“Han-gyeol, you didn’t seem to be enjoying yourself earlier, why the sudden joy now?”\n“Throwing snow at Eun-ha turned out to be more fun than I thought. But why so fierce, Eun-ha? Why turn into a wild beast all of a sudden?”\n“It’s because Han-gyeol started the snow fight by dumping snow on my head before it even began. Come on, Han-gyeol, come here. Let’s start after you get hit by snow once.”\n“No way~”\nHan-gyeol can be so innocently joyful at times. Though it’s always when he’s teasing me.\n“You’re really dead now...!”\nI scooped up snow from a bench, packing it tightly. Then, with all my might, I hurled it at Han-gyeol.\nThump-\nThe snowball hit Han-gyeol squarely in the torso.\n“Yesss- direct hit. Now you, Han-gy-ack!”\nThump-\nA snowball hit my leg.\n“Alright...! Han-gyeol, you’re asking for it now, aren’t you?”\n“Bring it on, anytime.”\nFrom then on, we threw snowballs at each other with all our might, not caring about the hits we took to our torsos, legs, and shoulders.\nIt was strangely fun, and we kept at it.\nI hadn’t had a snowball fight since I was really young, and I didn’t expect it to be this enjoyable.\nEven as our hair got covered with white snow and our clothes were completely drenched, it was still fun.\nWe weren’t at a fancy restaurant or a café with a beautiful view.\nSure, having a warm, heartfelt conversation indoors is great, but playing with Han-gyeol like this was truly delightful.\nWhy was throwing snow at each other and getting hit by it so amusing in this moment-\n“Ouch-!”\nA small snowball thrown by Han-gyeol hit me right on the chin.\nIt didn’t hurt, but sensing an opportunity, I dramatically collapsed to the ground.\nAs expected, a concerned Han-gyeol rushed over to me... just a bit closer.\nWith the heart of a predator eyeing a small animal, I waited for Han-gyeol to come closer.\n“Eun-ha, are you okay?”\n“...”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol sat down in front of me, I quickly grabbed some snow with my right hand. Then, I shoved it right inside his clothes.\n“Here-!”\n“Ah-! Eun-ha, you-!”\nTaking advantage of Han-gyeol falling backwards, I immediately sprang up and bolted.\nPlaying with Han-gyeol seems like the most fun thing in the world.\nI wonder how close he’s gotten? I sneaked a glance back.\n“Whoa-! Ha, Han-gyeol-?!”\n“Eun-ha. Come here-!”\nHan-gyeol was charging at me with a snowball clenched in his right hand.\nIf Han-gyeol made a full sprint, there was no escaping his grasp.\nI quickly stopped and extended both arms towards him.\n“Wait-! Han-gyeol. Let’s talk this out! Words, let’s use words-! Right? We’re a couple. We should be caring and embracing each other.”\n“There’s no such thing in a fight. Come here-!”\n“Yikes-!”\nHan-gyeol suddenly embraced me from the front. Thankfully, he didn’t shove snow down my clothes like I did to him.\n“Got you at last.”\n“What? If you wanted a hug, you could’ve just said so. I would’ve hugged you right away.”\n“Huh? I never thought about wanting a hug.”\n“Then, what’s this now?”\nThe corners of Han-gyeol’s mouth subtly rose.\n“Don’t tell me...”\n“Yeah. That ‘don’t tell me’.”\nWhile holding me tight, Han-gyeol stuffed snow down the back of my shirt.\n“Yikes-! Han-gyeol! I was wrong!”\n“Nope~ I’m going to make a snowman out of Eun-ha.”\n“It’s cold-!”\n***\nAfter a while of snowball fighting in the park, we came to a truce.\n“Ha, Han-gyeol-! Let’s stop fighting now!”\n“Really? No backstabbing? If you backstab me, I’m really going to roll Eun-ha into a snowman.”\n“Really, really, let’s stop the snowball fight now. We’re going to end up with hypothermia at this rate.”\n“Shall we head in now?”\n“Yeah! It was super fun! And now it’s getting a bit cold!”\nFeeling a slight shiver, we entered the house covered in snow.\nWe shook off the snow outside, but our clothes were still laden with it.\n“Han-gyeol. We’re going to catch a cold. Let’s take a shower.”\n“Yeah. We should. You go first, Eun-ha.”\n“No, it’s okay~ I can shower in the master bathroom.”\n“Alright. I’ll call Eunwoo Hyung and sort out some clothes to change into.”\n“Okay~ Let me know if you need anything~ Go wash up!”\n“You too, Eun-ha. Don’t catch a cold.”\n“See you in a bit~”\nI immediately went into the master bathroom and stripped off my clothes.\nThe warm water washed away the cold that lingered on my body.\n“It was really fun.”\nEven as I showered, my mind kept drifting back to the snowball fight with Han-gyeol.\nHis innocent laughter kept replaying in my head.\nI wanted to play and have snowball fights with Han-gyeol again.\nEvery year when it snowed, I wanted to be with him.\nThough it might be too soon to think about this, it would be fun to have snowball fights as a family if we ever had children.\n“That would be...enjoyable too.”\nAfter changing into fresh clothes and draping a towel around my neck, I stepped into the living room.\n“Are you done showering?”\nHan-gyeol had already showered and was boiling something in the kitchen.\nI quickly hugged him from behind and asked.\n“What are you doing, Han-gyeol?”\n“Making some hot cocoa for Eun-ha.”\n“Why are you so thoughtful? You’re making me fall for you all over again.”\n“Then keep falling. I fall for Eun-ha every day too. Hold on- stand back, it’s dangerous.”\n“Okay~”\nAs I stepped back, Han-gyeol poured the cocoa into two mugs.\n“Be careful, it’s hot.”\n“Okay. You be careful too, Han-gyeol.”\nWe turned on a movie and sat side by side on the sofa.\n“Eun-ha, should I dry your hair?”\n“Huh? Really~ You’d do that?”\n“I want to. You might catch a cold, so let’s dry your hair first.”\nFollowing his suggestion, I placed my cocoa on the table. Then, I turned around and sat on Han-gyeol’s lap.\n“Han-gyeol, stop being so nice to me.”\n“Stop being nice? But I want to be nicer, why?”\n“Just because~ I keep liking Han-gyeol more and more. I don’t want to be apart; I just want to stay close.”\nAs I nestled into his embrace, Han-gyeol wrapped his arms around my waist to prevent me from falling backwards.\n“Do you like it that much? To the point where you don’t want to be apart for even a moment?”\n“Yes! I want to be like this every day. I want to live every day like this.”\n“Ah! Right!

      "content": "“Does that mean we could live together?”\n“Huh? I didn’t think that far-”\n“It would be really great if that’s the case. Are Han-gyeol’s parents okay with it? Have they given their permission? Then, we just need my parents’ approval, right?”\n“Huh? No, my parents are fine with it, but I doubt if Eun-ha’s parents would allow-”\n“Don’t worry. My mom and dad are quite practical, they’ll surely agree! I’ll convince them before the graduation ceremony!”\nThough I said this on Christmas yesterday, I was anxious about bringing it up to my mom.\nI thought it might be best to tell her during dinner, but I just couldn’t bring myself to say it.\nMy mom isn’t exactly controlling, but she’s quite strict about certain things.\n“Eun-ha, do you have something to say?”\nMaybe because I kept glancing at my mom, she asked me first.\nRight. Now that it’s come up, it’s probably best to talk about it.\nI decided to lay the groundwork for the conversation, bit by bit.\n“Mom, what do you think of Han-gyeol?”\n“Oh, he’d make a perfect son-in-law. My daughter has a good eye for men~”\n“Right? You agree that Han-gyeol is really perfect son-in-law material?”\n“Of course. But why is my daughter asking this all of a sudden?”\nThe conversation was off to a good start.\n“Mom, Han-gyeol’s parents are moving to Busan next month.”\n“Oh? Really? Then Han-gyeol will have to live alone? Well, he’s responsible, he’ll manage.”\nMy mom took a bite of a strawberry on the table.\n“He’s planning to find a place near the university.”\n“Ah, is that so? Well, that does sound convenient.”\n“Right? You know I go to the same university as Han-gyeol, don’t you?”\n“Who doesn’t know that? But why does that matter?”\nThat’s when I finally spoke my mind.\n“I want to live with Han-gyeol too.”\n“That’s not happening.”\n“Huh? Why? Why not?”\nMy mom was unequivocal, without a moment’s hesitation.\n“Because you’re too young? I think it’s a bit premature for just-turned-twenty-year-olds to start living together. Cohabitation isn’t just about the excitement and good times. It comes with areas where you need to be more cautious around each other, and that can lead to friction.”\nI responded to my mom’s concerns.\n“I don’t think cohabitation is just about the good stuff either. But I believe if it’s with Han-gyeol, we can work things out through conversation. It’s not like Han-gyeol and I never had conflicts. Whenever we did, we would talk openly about our thoughts and resolve our issues. The concerns you have, mom, wouldn’t be an issue between me and Han-gyeol.”\nWhen I countered immediately, my mom opposed cohabitation with another argument.\n“Alright, I’ll give you that. But still, I think it’s too early for cohabitation. In my eyes, both Eun-ha and Han-gyeol are still kids. It’s not that I’m belittling you, but it seems too much to take on certain responsibilities at this stage. If you gain more knowledge and experience in society, then I’ll allow it. After you both graduate from university, I won’t say a word.”\nI had no argument against mom’s claim that we still had a lot to learn before taking on responsibilities.\nShe’s right. I’ve never really earned money and am far too young to take on any significant responsibility.\nI was about to give up, but it seemed like Han-gyeol would have pushed forward in this situation.\n“Mom, that’s too abstract. ‘Seems too overwhelmed to take on responsibilities’ is your subjective opinion, not proof that I ‘can’t take responsibilities.’ I don’t start something I can’t be responsible for. I can make that judgment.”\nDespite my words, my mom was firm.\n“No, to be precise, it’s your mom and dad who are taking responsibilities on behalf of our daughter. What about the living expenses? Tuition? Can our daughter take responsibility for these right now? I think it’s too much. So, until you graduate from university, it’s mom and dad who will take responsibility. Once our daughter graduates and gets settled a bit, I’ll allow it without any objections.”\nI couldn’t say anything to mom’s words.\nEven though I’m an adult, I still can’t live without my parents’ help.\nThere was nothing more to say.\n“I understand.”\n“Good. Don’t take it too hard. Mom isn’t completely against it, you understand?”\n“Yeah, I understand.”\n***\nIt was the last night of being nineteen.\nI wanted to welcome the New Year with Han-gyeol, so we went on a date.\nWe watched a movie, had delicious food, and were walking in the cool night air to end the evening.\n“What happened with what you mentioned before? Did your parents agree to let us live together?”\n“I’m sorry... I talked to mom, but it’s decided that it’s not going to happen. I thought they’d readily agree since it’s you...”\n“It’s okay. They probably want to keep their beautiful daughter at home a bit longer.”\nHan-gyeol pulled my cheek, comforting me in my disappointment.\n“But they said they’ll allow it after we graduate from college.”\n“That’s good to hear. But what was the reason they said it’s not possible now?”\n“Well... they said we’re still too young to take on many responsibilities. We’re not even a bit financially independent, so it’s hard to even bring it up... It’s disappointing, but let’s live together later, okay? It’s fine, right?”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol smiled broadly and hugged me.\n“Ah, I also wanted to live together now; it’s a pity. But we can live even better when we do eventually live together. Or maybe...”\n“Or maybe what?”\n“It’s nothing. Since they’re not completely opposed, I’ll be content with this for now.”\n“I really love how positive Han-gyeol is. Oh- Are both of Han-gyeol’s parents coming to the graduation ceremony next week?”\n“Yeah, both of them will be there. What about Eun-ha’s parents?”\n“My parents are coming too. I think my brother will come as well. Hyun-joo unnie has a prior engagement that day.”\n“I see. Ah- What time is it now?”\n“Just a moment.”\nI took out my phone to check the time.\nThere were about 4 minutes left until I turned twenty.\n“4 minutes left!”\n“Soon you’ll be an adult.”\n“Yeah! After learning about alcohol, I want to drink with Han-gyeol too.”\n“I think Eun-ha will be a real beast when drunk.”\n“I could be a cute little animal. Does Han-gyeol prefer a beast or a small animal?”\n“I like beasts.”\n“Rawr-!”\nHan-gyeol threw back his head and laughed loudly at my roar.\n“You’re really too cute...!”\n“A beast is supposed to be scary.”\n“But you’re too cute. Come here.”\nHan-gyeol pulled me in tightly and kissed my forehead.\n“Kiss me on the lips too. Now- Hurry.”\nI tiptoed and puckered my lips, and Han-gyeol pecked me softly on the lips.\n“Now kiss me on the cheek.”\n“If I kiss your cheek, you’ll want it somewhere else next, right?”\n“I have to get a lot in before I turn twenty. It’s the last kiss of my teens~”\n“When you put it like that, I get a bit greedy too.”\n“Right? Now- Hurry up. You have to keep kissing me until the New Year. Got it?”\n“We’ll end the teens and start the twenties with a kiss.”\nI slowly wrapped my arms around Han-gyeol’s neck as we talk.\n“That’s what I want~ Han-gyeol. Thank you for being with me this year. I’m counting on you for next year too!”\n“I should be the one saying that. I love you~”\n“I love Han-gyeol very very much too~”\nAs I slowly closed my eyes, Han-gyeol gently held my face.\nWith his tender touch, Han-gyeol’s lips met mine.\nWhy is a kiss with the one you truly love so sweet?\nMy greed growing, I pulled Han-gyeol closer with more strength.\nBy now, the New Year must have arrived, right?\nTo commemorate turning twenty, I became more assertive towards Han-gyeol.\nThough I couldn’t give him a kiss that would make his mind go blank like Han-gyeol does, I desired him more deeply.\n“Mmm...”\nHolding Han-gyeol’s face and standing on tiptoe, I deeply slid my tongue into his mouth.\nStartled, Han-gyeol tried to pull his head back, but I firmly held his face and didn’t let go.\nNow that I’m an adult...! I’m no longer a child.\nI wanted to experience the intense kiss we first shared on Christmas once again.\nCute and lovely kisses are great, but I also really enjoy passionate kisses like this.\nTo feel that this person desires me to this extent.\nTo know he loves me this much.\nThat feeling was fully conveyed.\nI wanted to communicate the same feelings to Han-gyeol.\nI desired more of him, continuously.\n“Eun-ha...?”\nStartled by my aggressive kissing, Han-gyeol pulled his head back with all his might.\nHan-gyeol, with his bewildered expression, looked incredibly adorable.\nBut I wanted more.\nTo be satisfied, I needed much more of Han-gyeol than this.\nI looked at Han-gyeol with a content smile.\n“Why stop~”\n“No, I just didn’t expect such an intense deep kiss.”\n“It doesn’t matter, come here quickly.”\nThe start of my twenties being a deep kiss with Han-gyeol…\nMy heart was already racing.\n“Shall we keep kissing?”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: The Korean age system counts individuals as one year old at birth and adds one year to their age on January 1st each year, irrespective of their actual birth date.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The new year had dawned, and it was time to prepare for college life.\nThe most pressing issue was finding my own place, which was a bit of a dilemma for me at the moment.\nI was torn between finding an apartment near Eun-ha’s house or close to the university.\nLogically, it made sense to find a place near the university, but then I wouldn’t be able to come home with Eun-ha.\nThe commute of roughly an hour and a half each way was a bit too much, and I knew it would be a burden for Eun-ha as well. So, I found myself gravitating towards finding a place near Eun-ha’s, though it pained me to forsake the convenience of living near the university for just that reason.\nTo be honest, cohabitation had never crossed my mind until it was brought up.\nHowever, after experiencing the bliss of waking up in the same bed last summer, the idea became more appealing.\nYet, at twenty, financial independence seemed a stretch.\nShould I just give up...?\nBeing young suddenly felt inconvenient.\nGraduation was still far off, and I didn’t want to wait that long.\n“Han-gyeol, what’s on your mind? You’re not eating much.”\n“Ah, no, it’s just... I’m starting to think about where to find an apartment.”\n“Already?! Can’t you wait until next month?! Can’t you hold off just a bit longer?!”\nIn the middle of eating jjimdak, Eun-ha abruptly stood up.\n“Huh? What’s wrong?”\n“There’s still time to convince Mom!”\n“Convince her of what?”\n“Of us living together, obviously.”\n“Hey, sit down for a second.”\nEun-ha quietly took her seat again.\n“I thought they were against cohabitation. Weren’t you convinced?”\n“Yeah, I was convinced. But I never said I’d give up.”\n“Isn’t that the same thing?”\n“No, it’s not. If we spend about a month convincing her, she might come around. But the problem is that Mom is rarely home...”\n“She’s busy with work, right? So we should just go to her workplace.”\n“Right! That was the plan, but... Mom is incredibly strict about work. Dad once worked with her, and he ended up not sleeping for two days straight. My brother also threw a tantrum about living on his own at twenty, and Mom made him work under her for a month.”\nI had a vague sense that she was a strict person.\n“Yeah, but then?”\n“He couldn’t even last a week before dropping out. My brother is a tough guy, but if even he couldn’t handle it, it must have been really tough. And then—”\nEun-ha spoke to me with a determined look in her eyes.\n“I’m tougher than my brother and dad...! Even if it breaks me, I’ll endure under Mom’s watch, so just trust me, Han-gyeol.”\n“You sound reliable. But will that be enough to get her permission?”\n“She’ll give it. What mom really meant was that she thinks I can’t take responsibility for anything. But if I can hold out for a month under her, she’ll surely give her permission.”\n“I appreciate your thoughts, Eun-ha, but do you really need to go that far...?”\n“No, it’s necessary. I’ll persuade Mom, and then we’ll live together, Han-gyeol. I want to live with you. I want to be with you every day!”\nEun-ha’s determination was unyielding.\nHonestly, having her say all this makes me kind of happy.\n“But what does she do that keeps her so busy?”\n“She used to work in finance, but I’m not sure what she’s doing now. It’s still related to finance, but it’s so complex that I can hardly understand it.”\nFinance, huh? Tax? Accounting?\nIt seems more up my alley than Eun-ha’s.\nI might detest finance, but it’s left me with a lot of knowledge.\n“Wouldn’t finance be difficult? It’s something you’ve never learned.”\n“My brother had no knowledge either, but he was able to assist. I can do at least that much.”\n“I’m worried you’ll be too exhausted, Eun-ha.”\n“Don’t worry! As long as I can live with Han-gyeol, what can’t I do?”\nEun-ha was confident, but I was a bit worried.\nHonestly, I don’t like the idea of Eun-ha having to struggle.\n“I’ll make you happy, Han-gyeol!”\n“Thanks~ I appreciate it.”\nMaybe it’s best to just watch for now.\n***\nBut, as expected, it’s come to this.\n“Why not?! I can do a good job too.”\n“There’s no work available right now, you see~ Han-gyeol, could you talk some sense into my daughter?”\n“You gave brother a job back then-! I’ll endure under you for a month too, so let me live with Han-gyeol if I make it!”\n“Well~ Back then, we were swamped with work, so we were desperate enough to give anything a shot. But now, we’re fine.”\nYeah, work isn’t something that just gets resolved so easily.\n“And we already said cohabitation was off the table. Didn’t Eun-ha come to terms with that?”\n“I did come to terms. But I never said I’d give up. I just have to show I’m responsible, right?”\n“Ah- my daughter’s throwing a fit, which is unlike her. Is it because of her boyfriend?”\nEun-ha’s mom looked at me while sitting on the sofa.\nWell, I too want to live with Eun-ha, after all.\n“From my point of view, it’s a joyous occasion. Haha... How about giving Eun-ha a chance, seeing how much she wants this?”\n“Right-! You gave brother a chance, didn’t you?! It’s unfair-!”\n“This child... She seemed so resigned back then...”\nEun-ha’s insistence seemed to put her mom in a bit of a dilemma.\nSeizing the moment, I also threw in a few words.\n“It might be tough for Eun-ha on her own, so I’ll help out too. Living together means double the responsibility.”\nAfter I added my piece, her mom let out a deep sigh.\n“Ah- kids. Why insist on hardship? Life in society isn’t that easy.”\nBelieve me... I know all too well.\n“It’s because I want to live with Han-gyeol-!”\n“Just give us a chance. If it doesn’t work out this time, we’ll give up cleanly.”\nAfter much deliberation while sitting on the sofa, her mom finally spoke.\n“Fine. Both of you try working for about a month. It wouldn’t be bad to experience working life at twenty. But remember, I’m not your guardian there, okay? You’ll be responsible for the titles and tasks given to you. Just a heads up, I’m not the kindest employer. Don’t hold a grudge against me if you get hurt. Are you sure you’re okay with that?”\nHer mom’s words carried weight.\n“Yes. So, do I start coming in from tomorrow?”\n“Yes. The dress code is casual. Wear whatever’s comfortable. Including me, there are nine employees. You’ll be divided into teams of four, and you two will be assigned to different teams. Just so you know, I won’t go easy on you. Got it?”\n“Of course! So, if we make it through the month, we can live together, right?”\n“Yes~ I promise.”\n“Great! No changing your mind later, okay?!”\nEun-ha smiled happily, but I was worried on the inside.\nIt didn’t seem like her mom would show any favoritism just because it was her daughter, and I was concerned Eun-ha might get hurt.\nHaving been through the wringer under a supervisor who’d pass off work and a deputy head who’d criticize at the drop of a hat, I had developed some resilience.\nStill, the thought of re-entering the workforce did make me a bit nervous.\n“What exactly will our duties involve?”\nThe most crucial part was the tasks I’d be assigned.\n“Well... strictly speaking, you’ll mainly be in a supportive role, so expect a lot of research and document preparation. It might not be difficult, but there will be a lot of it. The research methods will vary depending on the situation. Are you familiar with Excel?”\n“I know the basics.”\nI was actually quite proficient with Excel.\nBut declaring ‘I can confidently do it’ in a work context always felt a bit daring.\n“What about Eun-ha?”\n“I learn fast. I can do anything!”\n“Good~ At the company, you two will address me as ‘President,’ understand?”\n“Yes, President!”\n“Yes.”\nSuddenly, the stakes felt much higher.\nThough it was for the sake of living together, the cost seemed greater than anticipated.\nIs it really necessary to taste the bitterness of society right as we turn twenty?\nBut, what’s done is done, so we might as well make the most of it.\n***\nOn the first day of work, Eun-ha looked completely drained even before arriving, having endured the hellish weekday rush hour commute.\n“Eun-ha, are you okay...?”\n“Getting pushed around left and right... I thought I was going to die.”\n“Eun-ha, you go in first. It might not look good if we go in together.”\n“Eh? Why?”\n“Well, it’s the workplace. The staff might notice anyway, but let’s not make it obvious that we’re a couple. Got it? I’ll use honorifics with you at work, and you should do the same with me, okay?”\nIt feels like we’re navigating office romance... But it’s best to set clear boundaries.\n“Okay, got it. But then, how should I address you?”\n“Just call me Han-gyeol-ssi* comfortably. I’ll call you Eun-ha-ssi.”\n“That sounds so grown-up and nice. Hehe.”\nI flicked Eun-ha’s forehead lightly as she giggled.\n“Ow-”\n“You shouldn’t be pleased. Hurry up and go in.”\n“So, we can’t hold hands, hug, or even kiss once we’re inside?”\n“Isn’t that obvious?”\n“That’s a pity... But we’re keeping all these for later, right? You’ll have to make up for it all at once?”\n“As if~ Hurry up and go inside. See you up there.”\n“Okay! See you later~ Han-gyeol-ssi~”\nWaving at me, Eun-ha turned and entered the building first.\nI wonder if we’ll manage this well.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Ssi ‘씨’ - It is an honorific used after a person’s name, similar to ‘Mr.’ or ‘Ms.’ in English.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It’s been a week since I started working.\nReflecting deeply, I realized how naive I was to think I could easily navigate social life.\nCommuting by subway, being jostled by crowds left and right, the struggle was real. If Han-gyeol hadn’t been there to catch me, I might have fallen at least once.\nAnd what about the company?\nThere’s a mountain of things to memorize, and any mistake means someone has to redo my work.\nI tried desperately not to lose my focus, but mistakes were frequent, and I often found myself in a fluster, a sorry sight indeed.\nYet, I couldn’t afford the luxury of feeling overwhelmed.\n“Eun-ha, could you bring me the contract from the fourth quarter of last year?”\n“Yes! The one from the fourth quarter, right?”\n“That’s the one~ Please hurry~”\nI rushed to the drawer where the contract from the previous year was kept.\nBut what was the password again?\nShould I ask once more? But I’m sure I just asked a few days ago.\nWhat if I get scolded?\n02... what was it again... 0228, maybe?\nLet’s just try it.\nI carefully pressed the password, but it beeped loudly.\nWhy is it so loud, really..!\nI quickly pressed the four-digit code. However, the sound indicating a wrong password echoed through the office.\nIt must have been 0218!\nI pressed the password again, but it seems I got it wrong once more. After the second mistake, a colleague nearby told me the correct password.\n“Eun-ha, it’s 0217.”\n“Oh-! Th, thank you.”\nHa- I made another mistake.\nI took the contract out of the drawer and handed it to the colleague next to me.\n“Senior, here’s the contract for the fourth quarter.”\n“Ah- thank you. Just leave it there and get back to work. Huh?”\nWhenever someone says ‘huh?’ while I’m working, chills run down my spine.\nI was terribly worried about what mistake I might have made this time.\n“This is the contract for the first quarter. Could you bring the one for the fourth quarter, please?”\n“Ah- my apologies! I’ll bring it right away.”\nWhy am I always so scatterbrained?\nI hurriedly brought the contract back.\nIt was such a trivial task, yet I handled it so inefficiently.\nBut there’s no time to dwell on feeling down.\nI need to compile the market research data.\nI understand now why my brother quit.\nIs it too much to expect a twenty-year-old to excel at social life? Yet, looking at Han-gyeol, it doesn’t seem impossible.\n“Han-gyeol, did you finish what I asked for yesterday?”\n“Are you referring to organizing the Quarter 4 statistics or updating the weekly stats?”\n“The Quarter 4 statistics. How long will it take?”\n“I’ve already organized the Quarter 4 data and uploaded it to the cloud. The weekly stats update is currently under review and should take about thirty minutes.”\n“Is that so? Do I need to review it myself?”\n“No, there’s no need. I’ve double-checked everything.”\n“That’s impressive... Thank you for your hard work.”\n“Thank you.”\nHe’s my boyfriend, but how does Han-gyeol blend in so naturally?\nHan-gyeol from Team 2 and I from Team 1 do the same job, yet he’s never made a mistake.\nHe quietly sits at his desk, taking calls and handling tasks without any sign of panic.\n“Eun-ha, about the research you were working on yesterday, how much longer will it take?”\n“Oh! Yes, I planned to finish it by this morning.”\n“Thank you. Take your time, just make sure there are no mistakes, okay?”\n“Yes!”\nThe thought that I really couldn’t afford to make any mistakes hit me hard. I diligently organized and reviewed the data before uploading it to the cloud.\nI’ve reviewed everything, so why do I feel uneasy?\nI wanted to say with confidence that no further review was needed, but honestly, I wasn’t sure.\n“Eun-ha, shall we go for lunch? What do you like?”\n“Yes!”\nOur team went to lunch before Han-gyeol’s Team 2 did.\nEven though we were in the same space, I couldn’t stay close to him.\nI wanted to talk to Han-gyeol... but I should hold back.\n“What do you like?”\n“I’m not picky; I eat everything.”\n“That’s the hardest answer to work with~”\n“Ah! I, I like pork cutlet!”\nI couldn’t think of anything else, so I mentioned food Han-gyeol likes.\n“Then let’s go have pork cutlet.”\n“Should we? There’s a new place that opened up nearby; let’s try it out.”\n“They also serve cold buckwheat noodles there. I’ll have that.”\nI quietly followed the senior colleagues leading the way.\nI just want to go home!\n***\nAs soon as I sat down, I placed the spoon and chopsticks on the table.\nThe senior above me kindly poured water into cups and distributed them.\nShould I keep the utensil container next to me and pour water first from now on?\nIs it okay to let the senior pour the water?\nI really don’t know much about these things.\n“Eun-ha, how do you find work? Is it tough?”\n“It’s okay..! Haha... Everyone’s been really nice.”\nI answered with an awkward laugh.\nI miss Han-gyeol. I miss him terribly.\n“You’re going to university soon, right?”\n“Yes! I’m scheduled to start in March.”\nSurprisingly, they didn’t ask about my mother.\nProbably everyone knows that I’m the CEO’s daughter. That might be why they were curious about Han-gyeol, who is in the team next to mine.\n“Who did you come with? A friend?”\n“Ah- Yes. A friend-!”\nHan-gyeol and I decided to keep our relationship a secret for now.\n“Your friend is the same age as you, right?”\n“Yes, yes. We’re both twenty.”\n“Oh, I see. But I haven’t seen you two talking at the company?”\n“Yes. We’re close, but we thought it would be better to use honorifics at work... Yes. Something like that.”\nI said bashfully, and all the seniors smiled.\n“That’s wise? Both of you seem very mature.”\n“Th, thank you.”\nIn reality, I couldn’t talk to Han-gyeol at the company.\nEven when our eyes met in the hallway, Han-gyeol would just nod his head and pass by without even a slight smile.\nI knew it was the right thing to do, but I couldn’t help feeling a bit sulky.\nI decided it was just me being childish and let it go.\nI’ll just have to do everything at once in a month. I’ll wait until then.\nJust you try running away.\n***\nAfter lunch, I could finally take a brief break in the office. I headed to the pantry for a drink and bumped into Han-gyeol.\nI really wanted to hug him and snuggle right there and then but I held back.\n“Looks like you came for coffee...”\nI blurted out, awkwardly formal.\nThe situation seemed funny. I bit my lip hard and looked up at Han-gyeol.\n“Yes. Just passing by. Oh- you dropped this earlier.”\nHan-gyeol spoke in a matter-of-fact tone.\n“Huh? What did I drop? Oh-!”\nI accidentally slipped into informal speech, but Han-gyeol just put something in my pocket and moved on. I stared at his retreating figure as if trying to burn a hole in it.\nHe really won’t smile, not even once?! Just you wait, seriously-!\nI pulled an isotonic drink from the fridge in the pantry. Then, I took out what Han-gyeol had slipped into my pocket earlier. Seeing the orange-flavored candy made my spirits soar instantly.\nA smile naturally spread across my face.\nWhy is Han-gyeol so adorable? I decided to forgive him for not smiling since he gave me an orange candy.\nPopping the candy into my mouth felt like gaining strength to endure the afternoon.\n“Sweet.”\nAfter finishing the candy, I returned to my desk.\nAs soon as it was afternoon, I started working again and pushed through until the end of the day.\nJust 3 more weeks! In 3 weeks, I can live with Han-gyeol.\nBut today seems to be one of those days where nothing goes right.\n“Um, Eun-ha?”\n“Yes?”\n“About the research you did this morning.”\nMy heart sank.\n“Yes, yes...”\nI’m anxious.\n“It seems the VAT(Value-Added Tax) section is missing.”\n“Oh- the VAT? You just add 10% to the supply value later, don’t you-?! Oh-!”\n“For buildings, only the building part is subject to the 10% VAT, not the land. So, you can’t just apply 10% to the total selling price; you need to separate the building and land values. It looks like you’ve only noted the total selling price for the buildings.”\nThat was the part they mentioned before, but I completely forgot.\n“I’m so sorry. You had mentioned it before...! I just forgot. My apologies.”\n“It happens. Can you make the corrections tomorrow?”\n“I’ll stay and finish it today-! It was supposed to be completed by today anyway.”\n“Hm- you sure? Then, just do what you can without overdoing it. There’s still some time left, so don’t rush.”\n“Yes-!”\nDespite it being time to leave, I couldn’t head home.\nOne by one, the seniors left, and so did the team 2 members.\nHan-gyeol too, briefly said goodbye and left before me.\n“I’ll be heading out first.”\n“Ah- Yes!”\nIt’s my mistake, after all.\nI can’t rely on Han-gyeol for this.\nIt’s something I need to take responsibility for and finish.\nYet... it’s a bit tough.\nI wished I could handle things smoothly like Han-gyeol...\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Being a newcomer, I wasn’t assigned any difficult tasks.\nMy work mainly involved basic document preparation, updating statistical data, and PowerPoint presentations.\nThese were tasks I did every day, so I could handle them smoothly without any issues.\nBy now, I had even become proficient at handling work calls.\n“Yes, I’ll send the document within an hour as requested. We have double-checked it on our end, but the director suggested a cross-check. Should there be any corrections needed, please feel free to call this number. It’s alright to contact us even after hours. Yes, have a good day.”\nAfter hanging up the phone, I went back to typing on the keyboard.\n“Han-gyeol, after sending the email, could you try issuing the tax invoice based on this contract?”\n“Yes, sure. Should I issue it using the supply value mentioned in the contract? Is the client already registered?”\n“Ah...? Did I already tell you about this? I was just about to.”\n“I have experience issuing invoices. If the client is registered, I’ll issue the invoice using the contract’s supply value. But could you review it before issuance?”\n“Of course, I’d appreciate your help.”\n“Understood.”\nAs a newbie, it’s best to just do what you’re told. Trying to take initiative prematurely can sometimes lead to mistakes.\nAfter the final review, I sent off the email. Then, before issuing the tax invoice, I carefully read through the contract again.\n“Um, senior?”\n“Yes, what is it?”\n“Something seems off with this contract.”\n“What part?”\nThe senior colleague seated next to me came closer to look.\n“The total amount, down payment, and the balance don’t add up. The total is stated as 8 million won, but the down payment is 4 million won, and the balance is listed as only 2 million won.”\n“Whoa, that was a close call. Thank you for checking. You haven’t issued the invoice yet, right?”\n“No, should I hold off for now?”\n“Yes, I’ll call the client to redo the contract. Thanks for letting me know.”\n“Sure. Is there anything else you’d like me to do?”\n“Not at the moment. If you’re looking for something to do—”\nWhile the senior was speaking, a team leader from behind approached with their chair.\n“Ah, Han-gyeol, if you’re free, could you take a look at this?”\n“Ah- Yes, of course.”\n“Helping the team leader with their work seems like a good idea.”\nI moved to look at the team leader’s monitor.\n“Han-gyeol, do you know how to use Excel?”\n“I know the basics.”\n“Could you try to remake this form then?”\n“Sure. How much time can I invest in this?”\n“Well, it’s not urgent. You can work on it when you have nothing else to do.”\n“Got it. Is there anything in particular I should keep in mind?”\n“Hm, as long as it’s efficient, any method is fine. But it would be great if it could be a bit more intuitive.”\n“Understood.”\nAs soon as I returned to my seat, I opened the Excel form.\nIt was constructed with basic formulas, but I saw many areas for improvement. Coding could make it easier, but if any problems arose, there might be no one to fix it, so I decided against it. Instead, I started modifying the form using Excel functions, macros, and VBA I remembered.\nIt had been a while, and I wasn’t sure I’d remember, but as I got into it, it went well.\nBy the time it was quitting time, I had finished revising the form.\nIt was quite intuitive and easily modifiable if needed.\nAfter uploading the form to the cloud, I informed the team leader.\n“I’ve updated and uploaded the form you mentioned.”\n“Already? That was faster than I expected.”\n“There were only so many applicable changes. I think this is the best I could do.”\n“That’s fine. I’ll check it tomorrow morning. Start wrapping up for the day.”\n“Thank you.”\nA timely departure from work felt like a dream.\nIs Eun-ha’s work done?\nI glanced over at Eun-ha to see her expression was gloomy, seemingly faced with a problem at the last minute of work.\nSeeing Eun-ha so downcast made me want to rush over and help immediately... but not merely as a ‘colleague,’ but rather as a ‘boyfriend,’ so I held back. I wanted to take care of her work too, but that would be too much.\nEventually, after six o’clock, I left the building with other team members.\nEun-ha seemed to be preparing for overtime, busily organizing something.\n“I’ll head out first.”\n“Ah, sure!”\nI decided to wait outside.\n“Which way are you going, Han-gyeol?”\n“Oh, I have an appointment nearby.”\n“Is that so? See you tomorrow then. Take care~”\n“Yes, see you tomorrow.”\nAfter bowing in farewell, I headed to a café near the office.\nI ordered an iced americano and sent Eun-ha a message.\n[Let me know when you’re done.]\nUsually, she would reply immediately, but perhaps she was too engrossed in her work to respond right away.\nI hope she doesn’t stay until dawn, missing her terribly.\n***\nI had just finished watching a movie on my phone inside the café when I received a message from Eun-ha.\n[Eun-ha: I’m done now. Heading out~]\nAs soon as I saw Eun-ha’s message saying she was finished, I packed my bag.\nAfter clearing my empty coffee cup, I dashed towards the office building.\nFrom a distance, I saw Eun-ha trudging along, looking exhausted.\nI quickly passed by her side and lightly tapped her shoulder.\nShe turned her head in surprise, and our eyes met.\n“Whoa, Han-gyeol? You didn’t go home?”\n“Are you hungry? Let’s grab some food—ugh!”\nIn the middle of the street, Eun-ha suddenly jumped into my arms, hitting the pit of my stomach with her head, leaving me momentarily breathless.\n“Such a violent way to show affection...!”\n“It’s Han-gyeol. I missed you... and here you appear right away?”\n“Can you not hit my pit of the stomach if you want to see me longer?”\nI gently embraced Eun-ha.\nIs this okay, right in the middle of the street?\nWell, after a long day, let it slide. I couldn’t push her away when she was this happy in my arms.\n“Ah... it feels so good to be in Han-gyeol’s arms.”\n“You worked hard staying late. Let’s go eat.”\n“Can we stay like this a little longer? Ah, this is healing... I love it.”\n“Okay. Let’s stay like this for a bit longer.”\nI slowly stroked Eun-ha’s head. The more I did, the more she snuggled into my embrace and acted spoiled.\n“Stroke me more.”\n“I am, aren’t I?”\n“Touch me more.”\n“Your choice of words is weird, you know?”\n“Can’t you touch me?”\n“Should I?”\n“What a pity!”\nEun-ha looked up and smiled brightly.\nIt’s lethal... makes me want to touch her.\n“Han-gyeol, I’m hungry.”\n“I figured. What do you want to eat?”\n“Hm- I want sushi. Sushi.”\n“Okay. There’s a place nearby. Let’s have sushi.”\n“And cold soba too.”\n“Sure~ Let’s go.”\nEun-ha stepped out of my embrace and held my hand tightly.\n“Ah- Now I feel like I can live again.”\n“Happy to be off work?”\n“It’s not just that. I can hold hands with Han-gyeol like this. Can’t we secretly hold hands at the office? Just three times.”\n“Three times turns into thirty in a blink.”\n“Then, just one kiss.”\n“No. Let’s go have sushi.”\nI pulled Eun-ha’s hand closer and said,\n“Just you wait and see... give it 3 weeks.”\n“So, the chills down my spine recently were because of Eun-ha?”\n“Exactly. In 3 weeks, you’ll be eaten up quietly. Got it?”\n“Alright.”\nEntering the sushi restaurant, we ordered salmon and halibut sushi.\n“Han-gyeol! Let’s have some beer.”\n“We have work tomorrow, don’t we? How about we just stick to cola?”\n“No. I really feel like having a beer right now.”\nPerhaps it was a kind of romance that being twenty brings with it. Well, a bottle of beer shouldn’t be a problem.\n“Alright, let’s just have one bottle of beer.”\n“Yay! Excuse me, one bottle of beer, please.”\n“Sure. I’ll need to check your IDs first, though.”\n“Okay~”\nEun-ha showed her ID with a lively expression. After showing mine, we received a bottle of beer.\n“There’s no bottle opener...”\nMight as well just use a spoon.\n-Pop!\nThe beer was opened.\n“What? Did you just open that with a spoon?”\n“Yeah. There was no opener, so...”\nHmm, was that a bit too much?\n“Han-gyeol, have you... ever drunk beer before?”\n“No, no. I just saw it in dramas and tried it, and it worked?! Haha...! Hahaha..! Here, take your glass!”\n“Ah- Okay!”\nI poured beer into Eun-ha’s glass.\nAs I was about to pour some for myself, Eun-ha eagerly grabbed the bottle.\n“I’ll pour it for you!”\n“Would you? Then I’ll gratefully accept.”\nI handed her the bottle and lifted my glass. Eun-ha carefully poured the beer and then smiled broadly.\n“Let’s toast, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah~ You worked hard today.”\n“You too, Han-gyeol. Cheers~”\n“Cheers~”\nOur glasses clinked with a clear sound. Watching Eun-ha sip her beer cautiously was incredibly cute.\nThere wasn’t a single thing she did that wasn’t adorable.\nAfter gulping down her beer, Eun-ha slightly furrowed her brows and said,\n“This tastes bad...!”\nWhy is she so cute?\n“Eun-ha.”\n“What?”\n“I really love you. I love you so much~”\nEun-ha’s face slowly turned red at my declaration of love.\n“Your face is turning red already?”\n“It’s the, the alcohol-!”\n“Sure~ Let’s go with that~”\nI then downed the beer Eun-ha poured for me in one go.\nThe beer tasted sweet.\nDid someone sprinkle sugar in it?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I went to work early in the morning for a final review of the work I did yesterday.\nHowever, the subway ride without Han-gyeol felt particularly burdensome.\n“I thought I was going to die...”\nAfter emerging from the suffocating subway, I arrived at the office to find that several colleagues, including my mother, were already there.\nThe atmosphere was peculiar.\nEveryone was gathered around a monitor, engaged in conversation.\n“What’s this...? So, you’re saying this was made yesterday afternoon?”\n“Yes... To be honest, it’s incredibly intuitive and efficient. It’s good enough to use right away.”\n“Did you input the data? How did the results turn out?”\n“The old format we were using started showing errors from the sixth decimal place, but this one starts from the eighth. I’ve verified it several times, and the results are more accurate with the new format.”\n“What’s going on...?”\nIt seemed like a serious discussion, so I cautiously greeted them.\n“Hello...”\nMy greeting caught the attention of my superiors and my mother.\n“Oh, you’re here early? Where’s Han-gyeol? Hasn’t he arrived yet?”\n“Ah-?! Yes, I came in early to review the work I did yesterday.”\n“I see. Can you come here for a moment? Take a look at this.”\nI approached as my mother called me over. She pointed to the monitor screen and asked,\n“Did you work on this with Han-gyeol?”\n“No? I haven’t worked on anything with Han-gyeol, I mean, Han-gyeol-ssi, at the company.”\nHad Han-gyeol done something wrong?\n“I’m just curious, but do kids these days learn Excel and VBA in high school?”\n“Uh? I think we briefly went over it during information technology class, but I’ve never learned Excel or VBA.”\n“Hmm- Is that so? Okay, go back to your work.”\nMy mother’s expression was profoundly inscrutable.\n“Is there a reason for... this?”\nUnable to contain my curiosity, I asked.\nA colleague answered,\n“Ah- it’s nothing much. We had asked Han-gyeol to do something yesterday, and it turned out to be incredibly efficient. Honestly, it makes more sense to discard our old methods and proceed with this new approach. But it’s hard to believe that someone who has just graduated from high school could have created it...”\nThe response from the deputy manager was complemented by my mother’s instructions.\n“Yu, put a hold on your current task and input various data into this format. Then, compare it with the old format to see how different the results are, and report back by 10 o’clock.”\n“Should we ignore it if the difference in results is negligible?”\n“Yes. And when Han-gyeol arrives, ask him to briefly summarize the VBA code and Excel functions used in this format. Let’s have a meeting at 10:30.”\n“Should we ask Han-gyeol to prepare the materials for the meeting as well?”\n“If there’s time, start with that. But don’t overburden him. It’s hard to do in just an hour.”\n“Understood.”\nIt seems the scale of the task has grown somewhat.\nI returned to my desk, reviewed the work I did yesterday, and uploaded it to the cloud.\n“Good morning~”\nAfterwards, other colleagues, including Han-gyeol, also arrived.\nI caught a glimpse of Deputy Manager Yu speaking to Han-gyeol.\nHan-gyeol, startled as he set down his bag, quickly began typing away at his keyboard.\nJust after 10 o’clock, a message arrived via messenger.\n[CEO: Everyone to the conference room in thirty minutes.]\n“Was there a meeting today?”\nA senior colleague whispered to me.\nWe all quietly made our way to the conference room thirty minutes later.\nMy mother was the last to enter before the meeting started.\n“I’m sorry for calling a sudden meeting despite everyone’s busy schedules. It won’t take long, so could we take a look at this?”\nUnknown formulas and figures appeared on the screen.\n“You all know this, right?”\n“It’s an interest rate model.”\n“Right. How have we been obtaining this until now?”\n“Well, we input the data and run it through Excel, right?”\n“Yes. But how long did it take to process each one?”\n“Um... if it’s a lengthy period, it seemed to take about forty minutes.”\nIt was a conversation I couldn’t contribute to.\n“Right. But does anyone know how this works?”\n“Didn’t we outsource it three years ago? We gave the formulas and implementation method to the outsourcing company, so the exact operation...”\n“Right. But take a look at this.”\nMy mother opened an Excel file on her laptop.\nThat must be... the Excel file Han-gyeol created.\n“A new format?”\n“Yes. But-”\nAs my mother pressed a button, figures on the screen began to change rapidly.\nAfter about a minute, the results were displayed.\nHonestly, I didn’t understand what it was all about, but the employees’ eyes widened.\n“Why is it so fast?”\n“This data would take at least 10 minutes to process, right?”\n“Is this a new format? The results seem to be the same, too?”\nMy mother’s gaze shifted to Han-gyeol.\n“Did Han-gyeol make this yesterday?”\nAll eyes turned toward Han-gyeol, who answered with a slight tension.\n“Yes... I made it.”\nThough no one screamed, everyone’s mouth fell open in shock.\n“You did? By yourself?”\n“How could that be...? You can’t make this without accounting knowledge?”\n“Wait a minute. But hasn’t it only been a week since he joined?”\nThe atmosphere became momentarily chaotic until my mother calmed everyone down.\n“Everyone, please. Han-gyeol? Can you explain how you managed to drastically reduce the processing time?”\nHan-gyeol responded calmly to my mother’s question.\n“Well... The existing format had many unnecessary formulas. There were a lot that could be resolved without using formulas at all, which increased the file size and significantly slowed down the process. I simply removed the formulas that seemed unnecessary, modified the ones that could be improved, and handled the simple repetitive calculations through loops in VBA.”\nOther colleagues also bombarded Han-gyeol with questions.\n“Wait a minute. But is it possible to make this without any accounting knowledge?”\n“What I did was not to create formulas through accounting knowledge, but to improve upon the existing ones. It would have been impossible if I had to start from scratch.”\nThe questions continued to pour in for Han-gyeol.\n“So, you made this without any accounting knowledge?”\n“By looking at the existing formats, I could understand the flow. As I mentioned before, I simply made that flow more flexible.”\nAfter Han-gyeol answered, my mother turned to ask Deputy Manager Yu.\n“Yu. You said it’s impossible to use this right away. Can you explain why?”\n“I ran a few sets of data through Han-gyeol’s format, and all but one returned accurate figures. However, one set came back completely incorrect. I would like to use it right away, but... it’s impossible to use if even one calculation is wrong.”\nFollowing Deputy Manager Yu’s explanation, my mother pressed the presenter button. She pointed at the screen and asked Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol. There’s a problem when this data is inputted. Do you know why?”\n“Well... Based on this screen alone, I can’t tell. But, could it be a case where the interest rates are given over a period?”\n“Interest rates given over a period? What do you mean?”\n“It means the interest rates are the same from day 1 to day 365.”\nUpon Han-gyeol’s suggestion, Deputy Manager Yu rechecked the data.\n“You’re right. The interest rates from day 1 to day 365 are the same.”\n“Really? Why can’t it be used in this case then? All other conditions are the same, aren’t they?”\n“My format cannot assign interest rates over intervals. So, it... it only works with discrete probability variables.”\nDiscrete probability variables?\n“Can you explain that in simpler terms?”\n“For example, if we’re calculating the interest rate for a year, the variables would be for day 1, day 2, day 3... up to day 365, making a total of 365 variables. But if you input it as from day 1 ‘to’ day 365, the variable is given as an interval, making the number of variables infinite. That’s where the error comes from.”\n“What’s the solution?”\n“It’s simple. Just enter the same interest rate for each day. That fixes the number of variables at 365.”\nThe room fell silent at Han-gyeol’s explanation.\nIt felt like there was nothing more to question.\nSome people were gaping in amazement, while others looked at Han-gyeol as if they had seen something miraculous.\n“Hmm... Okay. Let’s end the meeting here. I have an afternoon schedule, so I need to leave now. We’ll continue this discussion later. Everyone, except for Eun-ha, you may leave.”\nHuh? Why me?\nAfter everyone else had left the conference room, my mother sat down in front of me.\n“Eun-ha...?”\n“Yes...Yes?”\n“Think of me as Mom right now.”\n“Okay. Why?”\nMy mother looked at me and said,\n“By any chance, are Han-gyeol’s parents accountants?”\n“Uh...? No, I don’t think so. Why?”\n“I see... Eun-ha.”\n“Yes.”\nMy mother placed her hand over mine.\n“Marry Han-gyeol. You mustn’t let him go.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It would normally be time to head to work, but today neither I nor Eun-ha went to the office.\nToday is the graduation day of my second high school life.\nAll my classmates were busy taking photos with smiles on their lips, chatting away loudly and animatedly.\n“Wow, we’re really graduating. Hey Han-gyeol, what do you think? Want to drink tonight?”\n“Can’t do it today. I’ve planned to drink just the two of us with Eun-ha to celebrate our graduation.”\n“So when are you free? We should at least drink together once.”\n“I’ll contact you over the weekend. This week might not work, how about next week?”\n“Ah, right, you mentioned you’re working now, didn’t you? Must be pretty busy, huh?”\n“Yeah, it’s been hectic. But I’m so happy right now~”\n“Are you an old man or what?”\nUgh- Eugene hit a sore spot.\n“Calling me an old man at twenty...”\n“Your actions and words are that of an old man, what can I do?”\nI couldn’t deny it entirely.\nI was feeling a bit bitter when the teacher walked into the classroom.\n“Alright, everyone quiet down and back to your seats~”\nAs the homeroom teacher entered, all the students made their way back to their places.\nThe graduation ceremony was conducted in each classroom via broadcast, not in the auditorium.\nPerhaps because it was the last time, everyone listened intently to the principal’s speech from the screen.\nAs the principal’s encouraging words and a junior’s congratulatory speech were coming to an end, the sound of parents’ footsteps echoed in the corridor.\nGlancing over, I saw parents holding bouquets, looking at their children.\n“Congratulations to everyone on your graduation. When your name is called, come up to receive your diploma. Now, let’s begin.”\nThe teacher said with a smile.\nOne by one, students went up to receive their diplomas.\nSome choked up a bit during the process, while others smiled broadly and hugged the teacher.\nEventually, it was Eun-ha’s and my turn.\n“Next, Shin Eun-ha.”\n“Here!”\nEun-ha briskly walked up, received her diploma, and returned to her seat.\n“Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“Here.”\nI, too, stood beside the podium and received my diploma.\n“You’ve worked hard this year. Have a beautiful relationship with Eun-ha. Congratulations on graduating.”\n“Thank you. It’s been a great year.”\nUpon receiving their diplomas and returning to their places, the students were filled with new emotions.\nOnce everyone had received their diplomas and settled back down, the teacher opened the classroom’s front door and announced.\n“Parents, please come in and congratulate your children~”\nAs soon as the teacher finished speaking, parents started entering through the front and back doors of the classroom.\nParents, carrying bouquets, stood next to their children to celebrate their graduation.\nMy parents also came and handed me a bouquet.\n“Son, congratulations on your graduation.”\n“Congratulations.”\n“Thank you.”\nAfter I briefly expressed my gratitude, my parents looked around the classroom curiously.\n“So, who’s your girlfriend?”\nThat must have been their curiosity.\nThe classroom was slightly chaotic, not the ideal situation to introduce Eun-ha. However, I momentarily forgot that Eun-ha always surpasses my expectations.\nI quickly looked around for Eun-ha, but she was nowhere to be seen.\n“Ah, hello! I’m Shin Eun-ha, dating Han-gyeol!”\nSuddenly, Eun-ha appeared next to my parents and bowed in greeting.\n“Oh my, it’s nice to meet you. You’re as pretty as my son said.”\n“Th-thank you!”\nEun-ha’s nervousness was palpable, and her parents approached from behind her. I also quickly stood up and greeted Eun-ha’s parents with respect.\n“Hello.”\nAlthough it was unexpected, this almost felt like a formal meeting.\nMy parents and Eun-ha’s parents bowed and greeted each other.\n“It’s nice to finally meet you. We heard our son often visits your home, sorry if he’s been a bother.”\n“Not at all. My husband and I are rarely home, so we’re actually grateful to Han-gyeol. Our daughter tends to get lonely, but she feels better thanks to him.”\n“Thank you for saying that~”\n“Ah, we heard you both are moving to Busan. When are you planning to go?”\n“We’re planning to move in the middle of next month. We’re currently sorting things out.”\n“It must be busy for you since the beginning of the year.”\n“It’s okay. It’s something we’ve been planning for.”\n“If it’s okay with you, how about we have a meal together before you leave for Busan? We have the kids’ story too~”\n“Oh, I was about to suggest the same. Let’s have a meal soon.”\nMy mother and Eun-ha’s mother warmly conversed.\nEun-ha and I quietly watched the scene from behind our mothers.\nAfter a brief chat, they promised to meet again.\n“See you then~ It’s a bit late, but Happy New Year.”\n“Thank you. Please go home safely~”\nIt was when Eun-ha’s family was about to leave the classroom.\n“Wait a moment~ Could you take just one photo of me with Han-gyeol?”\n“Oh my, I almost forgot. Come, stand here.”\n“Make sure it’s a pretty one~ Come here, Han-gyeol.”\nEach holding a bouquet, we took photos together.\nThen, Eun-ha waved at me and said,\n“Han-gyeol, see you tonight!”\n“Yeah, see you tonight~ Take care on your way home!”\n“Will do~ Let’s meet again next time. We’ll be heading out first.”\n“Alright. See you next time~”\nEun-ha’s family left the classroom.\nWatching them go, my mom whispered softly,\n“They seem like nice people. You have a good eye, don’t you?”\n“I think so too.”\n“Let’s also head out. How about we go eat some meat for lunch?”\n“Sure. Ah- I’ve made plans to drink with my girlfriend tonight.”\n“Just drink in moderation. Don’t make any mistakes.”\n“Don’t worry.”\nI left the school with my family as well.\nThere’s probably no reason to come back to high school now.\nLeaving a place filled with memories of Eun-ha made me feel a bit sad.\nBut it’s okay. We’ll live together and stick close in college anyway.\nWe just need to make more good memories.\n***\nIn the evening, I was waiting for Eun-ha at the agreed place.\n“Han-gyeol~!”\nHearing Eun-ha’s voice from afar, I turned around.\nEun-ha, with a bright smile, ran into my arms.\n“I thought a tiger was jumping at me.”\n“Want me to bite?”\n“I better stay alert.”\n“Let’s go drink quickly! I’ve always wanted to drink with Han-gyeol.”\n“Did you bring your ID?”\n“Of course~ Let’s go. It’s going to be crowded tonight!”\nEun-ha firmly grabbed my hand and pulled me into the bar.\nShe confidently showed her ID before we took our seats.\n“What should we have for snacks?”\n“Let’s eat spicy stir-fried pork, your favorite.”\n“Okay. If that’s not enough, we can order more. Should I order?”\n“Yes, please!”\nI pressed the order button and ordered snacks and soju.\n“One spicy stir-fried pork and a bottle of soju, please.”\n“Okay, got it.”\nSoon, the spicy stir-fried pork and soju were placed on our table.\nI opened the soju bottle and courteously poured Eun-ha a shot.\nAs I poured with both hands, Eun-ha also received it with both hands respectfully.\n“Why pour with both hands?”\n“It’s our first time, isn’t it?”\nJust as I was about to pour myself a shot, Eun-ha grabbed the soju bottle.\n“Ah-! I want to pour for Han-gyeol too.”\n“Alright. I’ll accept the first shot with grace.”\n“Okay! Congratulations on our graduation~”\n“Congratulations to you too, Eun-ha~”\nEun-ha filled my soju glass to the brim.\n“Isn’t that too much? It’s going to overflow.”\n“I poured as much as I love you~”\nI burst into laughter at Eun-ha’s witty remark.\n“What’s that~ Where did you learn something like that?”\n“I looked up what to do when drinking with a boyfriend~”\n“That’s funny. Alright, let’s toast~”\n“Sure-! Here-! Cheers~”\nOur glasses clinked, making a clear sound.\nWatching me down my soju in one go, Eun-ha did the same.\n“Eun-ha, sip it. You’ll get drunk at this rate.”\n“With my reliable boyfriend beside me, wouldn’t it be okay?”\n“Does your research give you lines like that?”\n“That was ad-lib. Did it make your heart flutter?”\n“Yeah. It did.”\n“Good- I’ll make you flutter more by feeding you some snacks.”\nEun-ha picked up a piece of the spicy pork and fed it to me directly.\nHer face, beaming with a pleased smile, never lost its joy.\nThus, we quickly finished one bottle of soju and ordered another.\n“How many bottles do you think it’ll take to get drunk?”\n“Really. Maybe being able to drink two bottles counts as being good at drinking?”\n“Am I red now?”\nIt was dark inside the bar, but she seemed fine.\n“Not at all. Aren’t you really good with alcohol, Eun-ha?”\n“I wish. I want to take care of Han-gyeol if he gets drunk.”\n“I can’t show weakness in front of a predator.”\n“Let’s see~ Here- Cheers~”\n“Drink slowly. You might get hit all at once.”\n“It’s fine~ I’m not drinking recklessly. I’m pacing myself.”\nEun-ha lifted her glass, and I clinked mine against it. After the second glass, since she was sipping, I wasn’t too worried.\n“Han-gyeol, if you think I’m getting drunk, tell me to stop. Okay?”\n“I will. But it seems like you’re good at controlling yourself?”\n“How about I don’t control it~?”\n“That’s not a good idea~”\nStill, after drinking about a bottle, I felt a bit of a buzz.\nMy cheeks were slightly flushed, but my speech wasn’t slurred.\nHonestly, I was a bit worried, but I felt relieved now.\nAfter another bottle, I started feeling the alcohol too.\nIt seems like it would be wise to limit ourselves to no more than two bottles.\n“Eun-ha, should we start heading home?”\n“Um... I still feel quite sober, and it’s a rare chance to test my limits, so how about we have just one more bottle each?”\nEun-ha’s cheeks were a bit red, but she didn’t seem drunk.\nI was a bit worried, but it seemed like we could handle another bottle.\n“Then let’s order a soup and have just one more bottle each. If we can’t drink it, we’ll stop.”\n“Yeah, that sounds good. Han-gyeol, you should also stop if you feel like you’re going to get drunk. Okay?”\n“Sure.”\nWill it be alright?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "My head feels like it’s going to split open...\nI woke up due to the severe headache.\nThe familiar ceiling of my room came into view.\nWhy am I here...?\n“Ugh...my head hurts...!”\nI grimaced and forced myself up.\nIt felt as though someone had placed a brick on my head and was smashing it with a hammer. On top of that, my stomach was in knots, making it incredibly hard to get up.\nI managed to get out of bed and walked into the living room.\nBut what was I doing before I fell asleep?\nWait. Wasn’t I drinking at a bar with Han-gyeol yesterday?I remember we ordered another bottle of soju... But from that point until the moment I opened my eyes, I have no memory.\n“Where did Han-gyeol go...? Ah, my head hurts...!”\nI was sitting on the living room couch, in agony.\nI tried to recall yesterday’s events, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t remember anything.\nFeeling anxious, I decided to call Han-gyeol in a hurry.\n“Where is my phone...?”\nI went back to my room to look for my phone and after finding it in the corner of my bed, I called Han-gyeol.\nNormally, he would pick up immediately, but today, the response was slow.\nAs the ringtone played, faint music could be heard from outside the room.\n“Huh?”\nHolding the phone, I stepped into the living room, where the music sound became clearer.\nWrapped in anxiety, I slowly moved toward the source of the music.\n-“The number you have dialed is not available. Please wait for the beep sound after the tone, you will be connected to voice mail, and the charges will apply.”\nThe failure to connect message played, and at the same time, the music stopped abruptly.\n“Could it be...?”\nStanding in front of my brother’s door, I swallowed nervously.\nCarefully, I turned the doorknob and entered, finding someone asleep on the bed.\nPlease let it be my brother... It has to be...\nI tiptoed closer and pulled back the blanket... and there was Han-gyeol, sound asleep.\nNext to Han-gyeol’s head, his phone lay with a missed call notification.\nA moment of panic washed over me, but then, Han-gyeol’s nape caught my eye.\n“Wha...?! What is this?!”\nHan-gyeol’s neck was covered in bruises.\n“Han-gyeol! Han-gyeol, wake up! What happened to your neck?!”\nStartled, I shook Han-gyeol awake.\n“Mmm...!”\nJolted by my shaking, Han-gyeol slowly opened his eyes.\nHe turned his head towards me as soon as he saw me.\n“Han-gyeol?! Are you okay?!”\n“Eun-ha...?!”\n“Yeah, it’s me. What happened yesterday-”\n“Whoa!”\nHan-gyeol, startled at the sight of me, quickly covered his neck.\n“Han-gyeol...?!”\n“Huh? It’s not there?”\nWhat on earth happened yesterday?!\n“Did we fight with someone yesterday?! Did we get into an argument after drinking?! Why is your neck like that?!”\nMy loud questions made Han-gyeol flinch and drop his hands from his neck.\n“What’s with my neck...?”\n“Doesn’t it hurt?! Wait, I’ll get a mirror!”\nI hurried to the living room and brought back a hand mirror.\nShowing Han-gyeol the condition of his neck, surprisingly, he remained calm.\n“Wow... it’s worse than I thought.”\n“That’s not the point-! Doesn’t it hurt?! Look at how bad the bruise is.”\n“Bruise...? Ah, Eun-ha. This isn’t a bruise. It doesn’t hurt.”\nHan-gyeol was calm, but I was far from it.\n“If it’s not a bruise, then what is it?! Be honest, who did you fight with?! Who the hell...did this to Han-gyeol’s neck?!”\nMy fury elicited, but Han-gyeol just chuckled and said,\n“What if Eun-ha did it?”\n“What?! What are you talking about?!”\n“Eun-ha. This isn’t a bruise. It’s a kiss mark you left on me yesterday.”\n“Kiss mark...?!”\nThe kind that’s made by sucking on someone’s skin?!\n“Wait... you mean I did this?! I sucked on Han-gyeol’s neck?!”\n“Seems like you don’t remember... Well, you were pretty drunk.”\n“I did this...?”\nI couldn’t believe it. But then, there was no reason for Han-gyeol to lie.\n“Yeah. Eun-ha did this. I thought I was going to be devoured.”\n“Wha...what?! For real?!”\n“Yeah. For real.”\n“There’s... there’s nothing else I did wrong, right?”\nI asked cautiously, but Han-gyeol avoided my gaze.\n“You’re better off not knowing...”\nI feel like dying. But I need to know before I do.\n“It’s okay, tell me. How did we get home yesterday?!”\n“Well... where should I start? What’s the last thing you remember?”\n“I don’t remember anything after ordering soup and soju at the bar with Han-gyeol.”\n“Ha... you completely blacked out.”\nI was fine until then!\n“So where do I even begin? You really don’t remember anything?”\n“Shamefully... it seems so. Did I make a huge mistake?”\n“Not a mistake, but... you really showed me what a wild animal is.”\nNo matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t recall any of my actions from yesterday.\n“I’m so sorry! Is your neck okay...?! Does it hurt?!”\n“No, it doesn’t hurt. But let’s try to restrain ourselves next time. It was a bit embarrassing.”\nHow much did I suck on it...\n“From what I’ve seen, Eun-ha’s tolerance is about one and a half bottles. Even if you drink a lot, never exceed two bottles.”\n“Okay...! But did you end up staying at my place because you were too drunk? Did you tell your parents?”\nAt my question, Han-gyeol hesitated before answering.\n“I was going to take Eun-ha home and then catch a taxi... but Eun-ha threw such a fit, begging me not to leave, that I couldn’t go. Every time I tried to leave, Eun-ha would run out and not let me go. I was afraid of getting in trouble with Eun-ha’s parents, so I just called Eunwoo Hyung, told him I’d put Eun-ha to bed and that I’d sleep in his room. I told my parents I was out drinking with other friends and ended up sleeping at a friend’s house.”\nDie, yesterday’s me. I was a complete nuisance.\n“Really sorry...”\n“It’s okay. It happens when you’re drunk. Don’t worry too much about it.”\nI couldn’t say anything because I didn’t remember anything. But... there was something I had to clarify.\n“Um, Han-gyeol...?”\n“Yeah. What?”\nI had to ask, even though I felt nothing of the sort.\n“Did we... do it?”\n“Do what...?”\n“You know... se-”\nAs I was about to say the word, Han-gyeol quickly cut me off.\n“-We didn’t do it! Nothing like that happened...! You were too drunk to even consider it. Though there was a dangerous moment-”\n“That’s, that’s enough! If we didn’t do it, then it’s fine. I didn’t say anything else, right...?”\nI hoped that was the end, but Han-gyeol seemed hesitant again.\nWhat else could there be? I couldn’t take it anymore.\n“Do you remember the last thing I said yesterday?”\n“Sorry! I don’t remember anything after ordering the drinks. I really don’t remember anything.”\n“Really? It was something Eun-ha asked, and I answered.”\n“What did I ask?!”\n“I don’t want to tell you. It might be interesting.”\n“No, you have to tell me!”\n“Nah~ But my answer was ’Saet-byul.’”\nHan-gyeol was making no sense.\n“Let’s start with the hangover cure. Are you not feeling sick?”\n“I am...! But it’s more like my spirit is hurting... Han-gyeol, you’re really not hurt, right?”\nI cautiously checked Han-gyeol’s nape. Seeing the still vivid kiss mark made my face flush.\n“Yeah. It doesn’t hurt. It was a bit risky, though...”\n“You could have stopped me...”\n“I did... but Eun-ha...”\n“What did I... say?”\n“Maybe it’s better not to know?”\nDespite my fear, I couldn’t contain my curiosity.\n“Go ahead and tell me...”\n“You said you were going to mark me as yours and told me to just let you do it. No matter how much I tried to stop you, you wouldn’t listen, so I just gave up.”\n“Me?! That’s a lie, right?! You’re lying because I don’t remember?!”\n“You were like a real beast. It was kind of scary, you know.”\n“Ugh...! I’m sorry...!”\nI wished for a mouse hole to crawl into and hide.\n“Let’s take care of the hangover first. Did you see the hangover cure I left on your desk?”\n“No. I haven’t seen it yet. Should we go out to get something for the hangover?”\n“It’s too much effort; let’s just order delivery.”\n“Okay...”\nI ended up in the kitchen without regaining any memory of yesterday.\nI wondered if banging my head against the wall would bring back memories.\nThat sounded painful, so I decided to wash my face with cold water instead.\nI was looking a bit haggard anyway...!\n“Han-gyeol, I’m going to take a shower in the master bathroom.”\n“Okay. I’ll place the delivery order and then take a shower.”\n“Thanks. See you in a bit.”\nI grabbed a towel from my room and headed to the master bathroom.\nAs I opened the bedroom door and was about to enter the bathroom, something started to form in my mind.\n‘I really like Han-gyeol...’\n‘Come here... We’re just talking...’\n‘How about Hanbyul and Eunbyul?’\nWhat... What are these memories?\nThe fragments of memory in my head began to piece together.\n“Wait. Han-byul and Eun-byul...?”\nI murmured to myself in a low voice. Hanbyul and Eunbyul...?\nThose were just names I had thought about. If Han-gyeol and I were to have children, a son would take ‘Han’ from Han-gyeol to be Hanbyul, and if it was a daughter, she would take ‘Eun’ from my name to be Eunbyul.\nBut those were thoughts I had never once voiced out loud.\n“What’s Saet-byul then...?”\nI remembered what Han-gyeol had said earlier. At the same time, I remembered the words I had said while hugging Han-gyeol tightly.\n‘The third one’s name will be chosen by Han-gyeol. I’ll keep kissing until you tell me...’\nAs all the memories flooded back, I slumped to the floor in despair.\n“Oh my goodness...”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After ordering the egg soup, I ended up drinking half a bottle more of soju.\nI was feeling the buzz too, and Eun-ha’s cheeks had been flushed red for a while.\n“I can’t drink anymore. Are you okay, Han-gyeol? Not drunk?”\nEun-ha didn’t pick up her drink after acknowledging her own drunkenness.\nShe just gazed at me with half-closed eyes.\n“I’m drunk too. Let’s slowly head home. Grab your bag.”\nI tried to get up from my seat, but Eun-ha rested her chin on the table and stared at me intensely.\n“Let’s stay a bit longer~ I want to see Han-gyeol’s face.”\n“Okay. Drink some water to sober up.”\n“No~ I’d rather spend that time looking at Han-gyeol’s face one more time... So handsome... Hehe.”\nI continued to memorize Eun-ha’s giggling figure.\nEun-ha, much more affectionate than usual, called me sweetly.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah. What?”\nEun-ha said, looking straight into my eyes.\n“I love you~ I like Han-gyeol the most in the world. Really like. So much~ Just thinking about Han-gyeol makes my heart race. Exciting. Comforting. I like... ”\n“I also like Eun-ha the most in the world. Really like~”\n“Hehe... If you like me that much, come here. Come- quickly, by my side. Han-gyeol~”\n“We should really be heading home now~”\nEun-ha’s cheeks puffed up, seemingly dissatisfied with my response.\nPressing her cheeks, the air escaped, making a sound.\n“You’re killing me with cuteness.”\n“Cute, then come here~? Hurry and come be cute with me~ No, I’ll just go! Cute me will go~”\nEun-ha pushed herself up from the table and wobbled over to sit next to me.\nShe nuzzled her face against my arm, acting spoiled.\n“Han-gyeol~ My Han-gyeol that I like so much~”\n“You’re really drunk. When did you get this drunk?”\n“Don’t know~ I just like Han-gyeol- hic! Quickly pat my head~”\nPretending to give in, I patted her head, and Eun-ha pressed her body closer to mine.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah. Eun-ha~”\n“Hehe... Ah, I love being called by my name by Han-gyeol. Call me more.”\n“Eun-ha~”\n“Yes~ I’m Shin Eun-ha~ Han-gyeol’s girlfriend Eun-ha~”\nEun-ha said, raising her arm high into the sky.\nDrunk Eun-ha was much cuter than I had imagined.\n“Being drunk makes you more affectionate~ But you have to act like that only with me. Got it?”\n“Yeah, yeah! Of course~ Happy? Huh? Are you happy~”\nEun-ha grabbed my collar and shook it.\n“Extremely happy~”\n“Good~ Then, I’ll give Han-gyeol a gift!”\n“A gift?”\n“I love you~”\nEun-ha briefly pressed her lips against my cheek.\nAfter the peck, she playfully fiddled with my cheek, giggling.\n“Han-gyeol~ Do you know how much I like you?”\n“Tell me. How much do you like me, Eun-ha?”\n“As much as ‘Eun-ha’ herself~”\nNot as much as the sky, nor as much as the earth, but as much as Eun-ha.\nHer witty play on words made me laugh out loud before I knew it.\n“All Han-gyeol needs to do is look at me with a ‘Han-gyeol-like’ heart. Got it?”\n“You worry about everything~ I’ll only have eyes for Eun-ha till I die.”\n“Really~? You’ll only look at me until you die?”\nEun-ha leaned in, locking eyes with me.\nI calmly told her, amidst her slightly seductive gaze.\n“In my eyes, there’s only truly Eun-ha.”\nEun-ha caressed my cheek with a joyful smile.\n“I’ll always remember these words~”\n“Do you think you’ll have a blackout by tomorrow, considering how much you’ve drunk?”\n“Hehe... Yeah. I guess I drank too much. Will I blackout tomorrow?”\n“Yeah. There’s a high chance that might happen.”\n“That shouldn’t happen... I want to remember our first time drinking together...! I want to remember everything we do for the first time... and never forget it till I die.”\nEun-ha’s eyes slowly began to close, as if she had reached her limit.\n“You’ll remember up to a point. Let’s go home now.”\n“I’m too sleepy to walk, Han-gyeol. Can you carry me?”\n“Sure. I’ll carry you. Eun-ha is so light~”\n“I love you~ But I’ll try to walk a bit since it might be hard on you!”\n“Thanks for being considerate~ Let’s walk up to the convenience store then. Go grab your bag first.”\n“Okay~”\nEun-ha and I left the place together.\nHolding my hand tightly, Eun-ha surprisingly did not stagger.\nAfter about 10 minutes of walking, we stopped by a convenience store.\n“Han-gyeol~ Why are we at the convenience store?”\n“To buy you a hangover drink for tomorrow~”\n“I’ll buy it~! Choose the most expensive one.”\n“At this rate, you might as well buy the convenience store.”\n“The convenience store? Do you want it?! Should I save up and buy it for you later? Huh?! Huh?! Do you want it?”\nEun-ha tilted her head, dripping with charm and playfulness.\n“Promise to buy it 20 years later~”\n“Okay. I’ll remember that~”\nI placed two bottles of hangover drink on the counter.\nAs I was about to take out my wallet, Eun-ha swiftly handed her card to the cashier.\n“Please, charge it on this-!”\n“Insert it at the front, please.”\n“Okay~”\n“All done. Have a good day~”\n“Thank you.”\nI put the hangover drinks in my pocket.\nBut then, Eun-ha, putting her card back in her wallet, asked the cashier a question.\n“Excuse me. Miss. Can I ask you one thing?”\n“Yes? What would you like to know?”\n“How much is the convenience store? Is installment payment an option?”\n“Well... It might be around 200 million won...?”\n“Thank you~”\n“Take care~”\n“Bye~”\nComing out of the convenience store, Eun-ha looked up at me with a smile.\n“Han-gyeol~ I’ll buy you a convenience store later~”\n“Yeah, yeah~ Make sure you do. Let’s go.”\n“My legs hurt, I can’t walk~ Han-gyeol. Carry me.”\n“Alright. Hop on.”\nAs I laughed and offered my back, Eun-ha climbed onto it.\nLifting her, Eun-ha hugged me tightly and said,\n“Yay~ I’m being carried by Han-gyeol. I love how broad Han-gyeol’s back is. It feels so reliable.”\nEun-ha swung her legs back and forth while perched on my back.\n“Hey, hey. Eun-ha. We’ll fall over if you do that.”\n“Sorry~ I was just too happy.”\n“There’s nothing to be sorry about.”\n“Ah, I have something else to be sorry about?”\n“What’s that?”\nI quietly began walking towards Eun-ha’s home.\n“Actually, my legs don’t hurt.”\n“I figured. You just wanted to be carried, didn’t you?”\n“Wow-! How did you know? Was it that obvious?”\nEun-ha peeked over to my right side.\n“If you had just told me honestly, I would have carried you.”\n“I know. But that’s hard to say.”\n“Is that so? Well, you’re drunk now, so you might as well say whatever you want. You’ll forget it by tomorrow anyway.”\n“I really like Han-gyeol...”\n“Isn’t that something you say often?”\n“Yeah. But no matter how much I say it, it doesn’t seem to fully express my feelings. I want to love you more, but it doesn’t always work out as I want.”\n“I feel the same. I probably like Eun-ha even more than she thinks.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha hugged me even tighter.\nWe’re going to fall over at this rate. I need to hold on tight.\n“That makes me so happy... I’m so happy right now. I like Han-gyeol so much that I can’t live without him.”\n“I’m glad. I’ll make you even happier.”\n“I want to marry Han-gyeol...”\n“After we graduate from college and get jobs, that will happen~”\n“I want to do it now. Han-gyeol is already my boyfriend, but I want him to be my husband legally too. I want to marry Han-gyeol, have lots of kids, and live a life filled with chatter. It feels like the future that’s definitely coming to us, but I’m getting impatient. Am I being too greedy?”\nTo Eun-ha’s question, I immediately responded.\n“Not at all? How is that greedy? I’m thinking the same thing. I want to marry Eun-ha soon, have kids, sometimes go on trips, drink like this, carry you... I think living like that would be incredibly happy. I want that life too. Talking like this, we’ve arrived quickly. Can you enter your house alone?”\nBefore we knew it, we had arrived in front of Eun-ha’s house.\nI had planned to drop her off at home and then take a taxi back to mine.\nHowever, Eun-ha hugged me even tighter and said,\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Can we talk a little more before I go?”\n“That’s not possible~ Eunwoo Hyung must be at home.”\n“Nobody’s home today. My parents aren’t coming, and my brother went to the ski resort with his friends.”\nI froze for a moment at Eun-ha’s words.\nWhy is she telling me this now?!\nNo, wait. There wasn’t necessarily a reason to tell me.\nBut still, entering an empty house after drinking feels a bit…\nAs I hesitated, Eun-ha whispered in my ear,\n“I don’t want to be alone at home.”\n“Let’s go.”\nI didn’t want to leave Eun-ha feeling lonely.\nSo, entering my girlfriend’s house late at night, I became fully alert.\n“Come on, lie down.”\nI intended to put Eun-ha to bed quickly and then head home.\nGently laying Eun-ha on the bed, I sat down on the chair at her desk.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah. I’m right here.”\n“I need to change my clothes, but I don’t have the strength...”\n“You should sober up a bit before changing. Just lie down for now.”\nI thought that if she fell asleep like this, I would just cover her with a blanket and return home.\nHowever, Eun-ha stubbornly sat up and looked in my direction.\n“I told you to stay lying down.”\n“Han-gyeol...”\nEun-ha extended her arms toward me and said,\n“It’s suffocating. Help me take it off...”\nHearing Eun-ha’s words, I bit my tongue slightly.\nIt seems like it’s going to be a night of endurance.\nThis is going to be tough.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“There’s nothing you won’t say…”\n“It’s so stifling… hurry up and take it off~”\nI wanted to make frustrated Eun-ha comfortable as soon as possible.\nBut removing her coat, and then her shirt underneath, would leave her in her undergarments...\nMy desires were boiling over; what if I ended up stripping off even that?\nRight now, the most dangerous thing isn’t the situation—it’s me.\n“It’s hot and uncomfortable~”\n“Got it. Let’s start with the coat.”\nI carefully approached Eun-ha and took off her coat.\nI hung the thick coat on the rack behind us and turned back to face her.Eun-ha, wearing a white shirt, looked up at me silently.\nDid she really want me to undress her? Honestly, I kind of wanted to.\n“Gyeol-ah~ hic This isn’t working.. hic”\nEun-ha seemed very uncomfortable, struggling to unbutton her shirt herself.\nUnable to undo even the first button, she looked at me with a face full of intoxication, silently asking for help.\n“Gyeol, please undo this.”\nEun-ha couldn’t manage the buttons herself.\nAlright. That much was clear, so I carefully knelt down on the floor.\nShe sat on the bed, looking at me as I gently grasped her shirt.\nI cautiously undid the first button.\nI tried to remain calm, but I swallowed hard.\nIt was impossible not to get excited while undressing my drunk girlfriend in the dark room.\nStill, I had to keep my composure.\nLet’s stay focused.\nI tightly closed my eyes and slowly continued with the buttons.\nEun-ha’s bare skin was gradually being revealed, almost reaching the final moment.\n“Gyeol-ah~”\nSuddenly, Eun-ha pulled me into an embrace, and I was helplessly drawn forward—\nWhether it was an accidental fall or my instinct turning my head towards her chest, I couldn’t tell.\nEither way, I found myself diving into the softness of Eun-ha’s chest... and I didn’t exactly resist.\nI bit my lower lip hard, trying to suppress my desires.\n“I love you~ Gyeol, I love you.”\nWhile still embracing me tightly, Eun-ha spoke.\nTesting my patience, Eun-ha refused to let me go.\nHer skin felt warm against mine, and her scent tickled my nose.\nThis was getting too much, so I gently pushed her away.\n“Ouch-“\n“It’s really dangerous...”\n“But you liked it~”\n“You smile so innocently...”\nEun-ha’s form sprawled on the bed was intensely provocative.\nIt was so beautiful that even my breathing became rough.\nI wanted her. To be honest, my patience had reached its limit the moment I started unbuttoning her shirt. But the reason I was holding back was because of the words Eun-ha had said to me.\nShe had said that she wanted to remember everything we do together for the first time.\nThose words made me hesitate again and again.\nThere’s no helping it. I have to endure. Just endure. I have no choice but to endure this.\n“Eun-ha, wake up.”\nBiting my tongue to restrain myself, I helped Eun-ha to sit up.\nI was so desperate to touch her that I immediately stripped off her shirt, and my eyes wandered to her white undergarments and the cleavage revealed.\nNot the breasts, no, not the breasts.\nIn my heart, while drawing on my patience, I managed to restrain my desire.\nI dressed her in the blue pajamas hanging on the hanger.\n“I managed it at last...”\nAfter quickly buttoning her up, I let out a heavy sigh.\nUnaware of how much restraint her boyfriend was practicing, Eun-ha immediately went on to say:\n“My pants are uncomfortable too~ Change them for me.”\nI should never forget today’s events. Truly, this is something I’ll tease her about for life.\nRight. Let’s think of it as a swimsuit.\nThe amount of skin shown when wearing undergarments and a swimsuit is the same, right?\nYes. Thinking this way, I might feel a bit more at ease dressing her. But fantasies that never usually crossed my mind kept surfacing in this situation.\nHow can being wet from outside be the same as being wet from inside?\nDamn it! Why am I having these thoughts now?\n“Gyeol, aren’t you going to strip them off...?”\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes.”\n“You really...!”\n“Why~? Do you like it that much? I like Han-gyeol too. Han-gyeol is my favorite in the whole world. I love you. I love you~”\nShe’s fatally adorable... I feel like biting her head off.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes yes! Why~?”\nEun-ha vigorously nodded her head twice.\n“I hope you remember today’s event too. You must remember it, understand?”\n“Yes yes! Of course. It’s the first time Han-gyeol changed my clothes~ I’ll definitely remember.”\n“Don’t you dare forget...”\n“I’ll remember. Since Gyeol did it~ Everything we do together, I’ll keep in my memory.”\n“Do you remember everything we’ve done so far?”\nAt my question, Eun-ha nodded vigorously.\n“Of course. I remember the first time we met in the classroom~ and when we went to the library~ and when you bravely blocked that basketball for me. I remember it all. I even remember the first movie we saw together and the first day you came to my house. I’ll remember everything, from one to a hundred.”\nIt seemed Eun-ha remembered everything as vividly as I did.\n“Then, out of all those memories, which was your favorite?”\nOur first day as a couple?\nThe day we went to see the cherry blossoms?\nThe day we first hugged?\nThe day of our first kiss?\n“The time when Han-gyeol said he loved me was the happiest!”\n“Really?”\n“When Han-gyeol first told me he loved me, that was the happiest moment.”\nI was totally off the mark.\n“Really? Why?”\n“I don’t know. I just really liked hearing those words. Every time Han-gyeol says he loves me, I just love it. The way Gyeol gets a little shy is so cute, and because those words are meant just for me, I love them even more. That’s why I like it~”\nEun-ha’s response surprised me a bit.\nI should tell her I love her more often.\n“Ah! But there were times I felt hurt too!”\n“Eh? Suddenly? When was that?”\n“When Han-gyeol was teaching another girl about her studies! Of course, it wasn’t when we were dating… but it bothered me.”\n“Ah, that time? Eun-ha, you brought that problem to me because you didn’t understand it, remember?”\nThinking about that time, I couldn’t help but laugh.\n“But... I wish Han-gyeol would only teach me. That’s what I thought.”\n“Were you jealous?”\n“Yes...! I mean, I wish Gyeol would only look at me, teach only me, and be kind only to me... I actually want to monopolize you... I want to mark you as mine.”\n“Do I need to get a tattoo or something?”\n“No. I have something else in mind.”\nEun-ha looked at me intently.\nThis feels uneasy.\nI shouldn’t have asked.\n“First, take off my pants... they’re uncomfortable... hurry...”\nBack to square one.\nStill, the conversation had dampened my desires quite a bit.\nI took a deep breath and quickly peeled off Eun-ha’s pants, changing her into pajamas even in the dim light.\n“Hehe... now I’m comfortable.”\n“My heart had a tough time though.”\n“It did?! Then let me give you some strength~”\nEun-ha slowly got off the bed.\nAnd approached me like a cat.\n“What are you going to do...?”\n“I said I’d mark you as mine. Don’t run away.”\nEun-ha, with her hair flowing, sat on my thighs.\nShe then caressed my head and slowly kissed my neck.\nMy whole body felt like it was electrified.\n“Eun-ha...! Wait..!”\n“No... I’m going to mark you... mark you as mine...”\n“Ugh...!”\nHonestly, it feels good.\nBut it feels like my rationality might snap.\nEun-ha’s hot breath on my neck continued as she intensely sucked at it.\nAfter marking my neck thoroughly, Eun-ha looked proudly at her work.\n“I’ve marked it... Now no one can look at you. Right..?”\nEun-ha, satisfied with the kiss mark she left on my neck, looked at me.\n“Is it done now?”\n“No. I’ll mark the other side too.”\nAs Eun-ha aimed for the other side of my neck, I grabbed her waist and stood up.\nThen I laid her back down on the bed.\n“Gyeol~ don’t move. It’s not enough yet.”\nBut Eun-ha wrapped her arms around my neck and wouldn’t let go.\n“You won’t even remember this tomorrow if you keep this up.”\n“I’ll remember when I see the kiss mark... so let me mark more.”\nI said firmly.\n“No.”\n“Then you mark me...”\n“What?”\nEun-ha coyly offered her own neck.\n“Mark it here as Han-gyeol’s...”\nHer beautiful neckline was tempting, almost begging to be bitten.\nBut any more would really be too much.\n“I’ll do it right before you shower and go to bed.”\n“Tch- stingy. Just do it now~ Han-gyeol~”\n“Throwing a tantrum won’t change anything. Go shower.”\n“Pff... stingy. But you better keep your promise~? I’ll be mad if you don’t.”\n“Okay. Hurry up and go!”\n“I’m going~!”\nEun-ha got up from the bed and headed towards the bathroom.\nI thought I was really going to be devoured. Should I just escape while I can?\nNo, it would be trouble if she ran out looking for me.\n“Ah... it’s really hard to resist. I should put her to sleep and then head home.”\nIt was now two in the morning.\nDrowsiness was beginning to overwhelm me.\nIt was the usual time to be comfortably asleep... naturally.\nI was nodding off when I noticed that even after some time, Eun-ha hadn’t returned to the room.\nIt must have been at least fifteen minutes... What if she had collapsed somewhere?\nWorried, I left the room to look for her. It was just as I reached out to open the door.\n“Whoosh-!!”\n“Aaaaah-!!”\nAs soon as I opened the door, a loud sound made me fall back.\nI thought my heart would drop, but there in front of me was a girl in blue pajamas, smiling happily.\n“It’s fun to scare Han-gyeol-!”\nReally... I will never forget today.\nJust you wait...\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Usually, when someone gets drunk, they pass out the moment they hit the bed.\nThat should be the normal scenario, but…\nWhy is my girlfriend wide-eyed, staring at me?\n“Eun-ha, aren’t you sleepy? Shouldn’t we go to sleep soon?”\n“Huh? I’m not sleepy. Go ahead and sleep~ I want to watch you sleep.”\n“I was planning on putting Eun-ha to sleep first...”\n“Stay with me just for tonight, okay? Don’t go~”\nEun-ha becomes quite clingy when she’s drunk.\nShe’s always considerate and suppresses her desires, so perhaps it’s a natural drunken habit.\nHer acting this spoiled must mean she feels really comfortable around me.It might be self-conceited, but I’ve lost any intention of leaving her tonight.\nShe’s too adorable.\n“Alright, I won’t go.”\n“Yay~”\nEun-ha smiled brightly; she was extremely beautiful.\nShe snuggled closer to me with a smile.\nSince I had already said I would stay the night, I decided to enjoy this moment a bit longer.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah?”\n“Why didn’t you keep your promise?”\nOh no... I thought she had forgotten.\n“Um...?”\n“You said you’d leave a mark here.”\nEun-ha tilted her shoulder, exposing her neck clearly.\nHer beautiful neckline and collarbone came into view.\nBut now I can definitely say,\nThe moment I kiss her there... there’s no end.\nAll my patience has already dissipated.\nEven a small provocation needed caution.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Why~? Should I do it?”\nEun-ha slowly placed her hand on my cheek.\nI needed to change the topic quickly.\nThough it seemed out of the blue, I threw out a topic that might interest her.\n“How many kids do you want to have, Eun-ha?”\n“Kids? I want a house full of them.”\nGood. I asked.\n“I want a son who looks like you and a daughter who looks like me. And a daughter who looks like you and a son who looks like me.”\n“Do you want four kids?”\n“Yes~ Four would be great. I’ve already thought of names for the first two.”\nFour, huh?\nThat’s going to require a lot of money…\nBut I too like the idea of a bustling household.\n“What are their names?”\n“Well, if it’s a son, he’ll take ‘Han’ from your name to be Hanbyeol, and if it’s a daughter, she’ll take ‘Eun’ from my name to be Eunbyeol.”\n“What about the third and fourth?”\n“That’s a bit difficult~”\n“Let’s decide tonight.”\n“Okay...”\nEun-ha’s voice trailed off slightly.\nI glanced at her face; her eyes, which had been bright, were struggling to keep the sleep at bay.\n“If you’re sleepy, just sleep~ Eun-ha.”\n“No. I want to decide on the kids’ names with Han-gyeol and then sleep.”\nShe was straining to stay awake, but when I didn’t respond, her eyes completely closed.\nI was about to feel a bit relieved when her eyes suddenly snapped open.\n“I’m not sleeping...!”\nShe has remarkable willpower...!\nShe is holding on through this?\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah...!”\n“I’ll think about it, so you just close your eyes. I’ll tell you when I’ve decided.”\n“Okay, but come a little closer.”\nI moved closer to Eun-ha.\nShe pressed herself against my neck and said,\n“You will decide the third child’s name. I’ll keep sucking until then...”\nEun-ha was about to press her lips to my neck, perhaps as her final effort.\nAfter issuing me this playful threat, she soon fell asleep.\n“You fell asleep before I could tell you.”\nShe didn’t respond to my voice, deeply asleep as she was.\nI stroked her hair and quietly decided on the name.\n“Let’s call it Saet-byul.”\nEven after I chose the name, Eun-ha breathed softly, still asleep.\nI continued to watch her face and then carefully got out of the bed.\n“Sleep well. Dream sweet dreams.”\nMaking sure not to wake Eun-ha, I slowly left the room.\n***\nTo recover from the hangover, I ordered bone soup.\nSitting on the couch, resting, Eun-ha came out of the bathroom looking completely different from the expression she had when she woke up this morning.\nShe must have remembered.\n“Eun-ha~ I ordered bone soup. It should take about 30 minutes.”\n“Ah- Yeah...! Thanks!”\nFrom her reaction, it was clear.\nShe fully remembered everything.\n“Ah- I’ll take the delivery, so why don’t you go shower?”\nNeed some time to think, is that it?\nI really want to tease her a lot, but that would be too cruel.\nStill, she did tease me, so I should get a little back.\n“Okay. I’ll take my time in the shower, so try to remember yesterday until I’m out~”\n“Ahh-! Okay, just take your time showering-!”\n“Hahaha-! Seems like you remembered everything?”\n“Uh-! Embarrassing, just go shower! I need to cool my head...!”\n“Alright~ I’ll take a long shower then~”\n“Hey-!”\nHearing Eun-ha’s voice, I headed straight for the bathroom.\nI’m not usually one for long showers, but I took my time, thinking of Eun-ha kicking the blankets outside.\nHer cries from outside the bathroom were amusing to hear.\nAfter finishing my shower and stepping out, Eun-ha was peeking from behind the wall.\n“Who is this? Aren’t you Hanbyeol and Eunbyeol’s mom?”\n“Uh...! Forget it... It was just drunk talk!”\n“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it~ But what about my neck you marked?”\n“Uh...! Sorry, I was really out of line last night.”\n“Don’t worry about it that much~ Did you remember everything?”\nYesterday, she was playfully teasing me.\nNow, the tables were completely turned.\nI walked up to Eun-ha, who was just nodding silently.\n“Do you have any idea how many times I had to hold back because of you last night?”\n“I, I’m sorry...”\n“What about this neck? I thought I was bitten by a wild beast last night.”\n“Maybe... Ice might help it heal faster. Should I ice it for you?”\n“Will that be enough?”\n“Probably not...?”\n“Let’s drink moderately next time. The bone soup has already arrived?”\n“Yeah. It arrived faster than I thought.”\n“Let’s start with the hangover cure.”\nAs I was about to sit down at the dining table, Eun-ha grabbed the collar of my shirt tightly.\n“Aren’t you going to eat?”\n“I think it would be better if you dried your hair first, Han-gyeol.”\n“Can’t I just eat and then dry it?”\n“I feel bad, so come here. I’ll dry it for you.”\nNo. I’m actually hungry...!\nBut Eun-ha seemed so apologetic that I silently let her lead me away.\n“Here- sit down.”\nEun-ha sat me down on the bed and then sat behind me with a hairdryer.\n“Wouldn’t it be better to dry it on the floor? My hair may fall on the bed.”\n“It’s fine, just stay still.”\n“You’re unfriendly~”\n“Ju, just stay still.”\n“What’s that-! This is fun.”\nAs soon as she finished speaking, Eun-ha turned on the hairdryer and started drying my hair.\nThe noise of the hairdryer was so loud that I couldn’t hear anything Eun-ha was saying.\nSince my hair isn’t that long, it dried quickly.\nOnce my hair was dry, Eun-ha hugged me from behind.\n“I’m sorry about last night.”\n“It’s okay. People can get like that when they’re drunk. But you shouldn’t do that with anyone else.”\n“Of, of course not! If it wasn’t Han-gyeol, I wouldn’t have acted like that even drunk... forgive me.”\n“I’ll see how Eun-ha behaves.”\n“Uh- I’m sorry. You’re not really mad, are you?”\n“It seems like it~”\n“Ah-! Sorry~!”\nEun-ha buried her face in my back, appearing troubled.\nI turned around to face her.\nShe looked up at me with a remorseful expression, and I gently pinched her cheek.\n“You teased me a lot yesterday.”\n“I’m reflecting on it...”\n“But you were cute. Shall we go eat now?”\n“Let’s just lie down a bit longer. Can we nap for 30 minutes?”\n“Uh? Okay. Let’s do that.”\nAs soon as we lay down, Eun-ha turned her head towards me.\n“Eun-ha, you were staring at me with wide eyes yesterday too. Remember?”\n“Maybe because Han-gyeol is so handsome.”\n“Being generous with compliments today? Feeling guilty?”\nAt my words, Eun-ha pulled her face close and kissed my cheek.\n“Will you devour me if I keep teasing?”\n“Now you kiss so casually in bed. It’s dangerous.”\n“We’ll eventually live together and sleep in the same bed every day anyway.”\n“That’s true.”\nIn response, I also pressed my lips to Eun-ha’s cheek.\nWith a bright smile, Eun-ha looked into my eyes and asked,\n“But why did Han-gyeol sleep in my brother’s room?”\n“Who sleeps next to a wild beast? I’d have been devoured the moment I woke up.”\n“Wasn’t Han-gyeol in a position to be devoured too?”\n“Yes. I wanted to devour you.”\nShould I say I held back incredibly?\nShould I say I almost pounced on Eun-ha?\n“You could have devoured me...!”\nEun-ha moved closer until her face was right next to mine.\nThe faint scents of shampoo and body lotion started reaching my nose.\nUnaware of how much I had restrained myself yesterday, Eun-ha made that remark again.\nA bit mischievously, I brushed her hair behind her ear.\n“Really?”\n“Huh?”\n“That means I can devour you, right?”\n“No, I mean, I did say that but...”\n“Then quietly let yourself be devoured, Eun-ha.”\nI twisted around and pressed my lips to Eun-ha’s neck.\nShe might have felt a tickle as she flinched, but I didn’t stop.\nJust as Eun-ha had done to me the day before, I began to gently suck on her neck.\n“Han-gyeol...?! Wait a minute...”\n“Eun-ha, are you stopping?”\nI grabbed Eun-ha’s wrist and continued kissing her without a word.\nI breathed against her neck just as she had done to me.\nWhenever she squirmed from the tickle, I kissed her even more intensely there.\n“Han-gyeol...! Han-gyeol, just a moment..!”\n“No matter what you say, I’m not stopping.”\n“Ah...! I’m embarrassed...!”\nAfter Eun-ha’s resistance faded, I briefly caressed her lips and then deeply kissed her.\nThe desire I had restrained since dawn now leaked out, and I pushed my tongue deeper into her mouth than usual.\nEun-ha too silently accepted me, wrapping her arms around my neck and extending her tongue.\nIt was more intense and profound than usual.\nI might normally hold back, but maybe out of a sense of revenge, I wanted to torment her more.\nIt became sticky, and now we both breathed out heatedly as we kissed.\n“Ah...! Han-gyeol..! Han-gyeol, uh.”\nI had wanted to do this from the moment I stepped into Eun-ha’s room.\nUsing revenge as an excuse, I wanted to overwhelm Eun-ha’s lips and lay her down on the bed.\nI was supposed to hold back, but Eun-ha’s shallow kiss had acted as a catalyst.\nI can’t hold back.\nNo. I don’t want to hold back.\nI wanted more of Eun-ha.\nI moved my hand from Eun-ha’s wrist to her waist.\nAnd very slowly, I slid my hand inside her shirt.\nTouching Eun-ha’s soft skin, I slowly pulled her close.\nWhile we continued kissing, my hand slowly moved towards her chest.\n“Ah...”\nMy hand, not satisfied just with Eun-ha’s soft bare skin, reached her undergarments.\nShould I go further...? Maybe I was being too hasty.\nJust as I was about to reluctantly withdraw my hand, Eun-ha looked up at me and repeated,\n“It’s okay... I won’t forget...”\nHer words turned my mind blank for a moment.\nBut there she was, looking into my eyes and saying it clearly once more.\n“I want to do this with Han-gyeol... Please do...”\nSee illustration [ 18+]\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After our first time, I lay beside Han-gyeol, clutching the blanket up to us.\nThe words and actions blurted out in excitement lingered in my mind, leaving me terribly embarrassed.\n‘Please hurry…’\n‘I like it when you touch me…’\nEven the provocatively moaned sounds...\nI was so mortified that I pulled the blanket over my head.\nI should have been a bit more restrained! Why did I get so carried away!\n“Eun-ha, why are you hiding all of a sudden?”\n“I’m embarrassed!”\n“Now? After everything we’ve already seen?”“Ah! Don’t speak so bluntly...! It’s embarrassing.”\nI peeked out from under the blanket to look at Han-gyeol.\nHe still gazed at me lovingly and kissed me on the forehead.\n“It was amazing. Eun-ha, you were so beautiful.”\n“I, I enjoyed it too... Han-gyeol, you were incredible...”\nI had heard that the first time would be terribly painful, but thanks to Han-gyeol’s consideration, it wasn’t bad at all.\nIn fact, it felt so good, I could see us doing this often if we ever moved in together... all day long...\n“Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing!”\nThe reason it felt so wonderful must be because I could feel that Han-gyeol truly loved me and desired me with all his being.\nDid Han-gyeol feel the same way?\nI really love him and desire him with all of me.\nSince my feelings might not have been conveyed, I wanted to say it out loud.\n“Han-gyeol...”\n“Yes? What is it?”\nI spoke honestly, albeit shyly.\n“I love you so much, Han-gyeol... I want to give you my heart, my body, my future, everything!”\nI said this and swiftly pulled the blanket over my head again.\nAs soon as I hid my face, Han-gyeol quickly grabbed the blanket and pulled it down, looking at my flushed face as he responded.\n“I love you too, Eun-ha. My heart, my body, my future, they’re all yours. You know that, right?”\n“You don’t need to say it, but... can I really think of you as mine?”\n“Yes? Of course, I’m yours. Who else’s would I be?”\n“Good...! In return, I am yours. I’ll give myself to you, so give yourself to me.”\n“I’d give myself to you without you even asking.”\nI joyfully hugged Han-gyeol.\nPerhaps because we were bare, Han-gyeol felt even warmer than usual.\n“Now, Han-gyeol is mine.”\n“Just don’t be too rough, okay?”\n“Can’t I?”\n“Should you?”\n“But you can be rough with me, can’t you?”\n“What?”\nHan-gyeol’s eyes widened suddenly.\nWas that too much? But it was heartfelt.\n“No, just kidding! Take good care of me!”\n“You scared me. I’ll cherish you.”\n“Yup! Thank you.”\nI don’t know why it makes me so happy to say Han-gyeol is mine.\nAnd that I’m his makes me incredibly happy, too.\n“Eun-ha, why are you so excited?”\n“Because Han-gyeol is mine! I love that.”\n“Is that really something to get excited about?”\n“Yes. It’s a very happy thing. I love it.”\n“Oh, you’re so cute, I could die.”\nHan-gyeol teased my cheeks as he spoke.\nI love the way he looks at me with such affection.\nI grinned back at him.\n“Don’t die without my permission~”\n“Right. Eun-ha, don’t you die without my permission either.”\n“Of course!”\nAfter our cheerful conversation, we started to get up from the bed.\nBut then, the thought of showing Han-gyeol my naked self while fully sober was embarrassing.\n“Could you go wash up first, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? It’s okay, you can go first.”\n“Then, could you close your eyes for a sec—!”\n“Eh? Why? Isn’t it okay to shower together?”\n“I-I’m too embarrassed for that now... It’s too much, I might actually die of embarrassment!”\n“Ah~ I wanted to shower with you~”\n“No, can’t do!”\n“Why~?”\nHan-gyeol asked innocently.\nSometimes he really seems like a child.\nBut he’s too cute.\nStill, showering together is too much.\n“In the bathroom together... nobody would know if anyone came in!”\n“Oh...!”\n“So, let’s save that for next time... Put on your clothes first, Han-gyeol. I’ll be pulling the blanket over myself..”\n“Okay. Let’s shower together next time?”\n“Sounds good...”\nAs soon as I covered myself with the blanket, Han-gyeol got out of bed.\nI could hear the sound of clothes brushing against skin nearby.\nMaybe it’s okay to peek just a little?\nI swallowed and slightly lifted the blanket.\nI sneakily watched Han-gyeol as he put on his shirt.\nMaybe it’s because of his build, but he has a very manly body.\nHis broad shoulders and the slight glimpse of his abs made my heart race.\nI want to touch him again.\nI want to be touched again.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Eek-! I-I didn’t see anything!”\n“Caught you the moment our eyes met.”\n“But I wanted to see...!”\n“Admitting it outright.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol chuckled and kissed me on the forehead again.\n“Go wash up. Come on, get up.”\n“Turn around, Han-gyeol...!”\n“You peeked. I’m going to peek too.”\n“This is outright staring!”\n“Then, is sneaking a peek okay?”\n“I’m taking the blanket.”\nAfter wrapping the blanket tightly around myself, I got out of bed. As I was gathering clothes to change into and heading to the bathroom, Han-gyeol jumped with surprise.\n“Hey Eun-ha...!”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“We need to wash the sheets.”\n“Oh, right...!”\nAt the sight of the sheets, I noticed they were stained with traces of our first time together, including faint blood spots.\nI hadn’t realized at the moment, caught up in the feeling, that this is how blood appears...\n“I’ll strip the bed and toss the sheets in the washer. You go shower.”\n“No, no! I’ll do it, you stay in the room!”\nI didn’t want my boyfriend to handle the sheets stained with my fluids and blood.\nEmbarrassed beyond belief, I quickly gathered the sheets and rushed to the utility room.\nI put the stained sheets in the washer and turned it on.\nAs I was about to head to the bathroom, Han-gyeol peeked out of the room and looked at me.\n“Turn around, will you?”\n“Eun-ha. I’m sorry in advance.”\n“For what?”\n“Nothing. I thought you’d have noticed by now, but since you haven’t, you’ll see when you shower~”\nWith that, Han-gyeol went back into the room.\n“Notice what in the shower?”\nI entered the bathroom, dropping the blanket. As the warm water ran over me, I saw the kiss marks all over my chest.\n“Gasps!”\nThe sight of Han-gyeol’s marks beautifully imprinted on my body brought back the image of him kissing my chest.\nI kept picturing his desirous eyes, how much he seemed to want me. And that image, so irresistibly sexy, was stuck in my mind.\nHan-gyeol, usually so reserved, wanting me so passionately... was incredibly sexy. That side of him is something only I, as his girlfriend, get to see.\nIt felt strangely wonderful to feel like I truly owned Han-gyeol, boosting my spirits while also feeling peculiar.\nI never thought of myself as possessive, but why does the thought of Han-gyeol being mine make me so happy? And the fact that I am his uplifts me tremendously.\nThe kiss marks on my body felt like proof that I belonged to Han-gyeol, which was thrilling.\nI found myself hoping they’d be even deeper next time.\nI sat down, covering my heated face with both hands.\n“What should I do... I think I’ve changed...”\nThe memory of today seemed like it would linger until the kiss marks faded.\nI hoped the embarrassment would wash away with the water, but it stayed with me until I finished showering.\nAfter drying off, I changed clothes and headed back to the room.\n“Are you back?”\nHan-gyeol was sitting in a chair, smiling brightly up at me.\n“Yeah! I’m back.”\n“Did you see the kiss marks? Sorry, I was a bit shocked myself.”\n“Han-gyeol-!”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m yours...!”\nI looked into Han-gyeol’s eyes as I spoke.\n“So... don’t be sorry. Next time, mark me even more deeply... more than now.”\nHan-gyeol was momentarily speechless. Then, his face began to redden, and he leaned back in his chair.\n“What, what?!”\n“Why are you embarrassed!”\n“It sounds so strange! ‘More deeply’?!”\n“But I loved that you marked me with kiss marks!”\n“Not embarrassed?!”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I nodded incessantly.\n“Yes! It’s great! It feels like proof that I’m yours!”\n“Shh! What if someone hears!”\n“I don’t care! If they start to fade, mark me again!”\n“This girl, there’s nothing she can’t say!”\n“And I’ll always mark Han-gyeol’s body with kiss marks too!”\n“Got it, now shush! Let’s leave it at that!”\nI want to give all of myself to Han-gyeol and own all of him.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Ever since my first intimate moment with Han-gyeol, I’ve been in high spirits.\nHan-gyeol declared himself as mine, and I couldn’t be happier about belonging to him.\nI’ll never let him go. If he tries to run, I might just lock him up somewhere.\nWhy does he have to look so handsome even when he’s working?\nOh, I wish I could leave work early and kiss Han-gyeol...\n-Han-gyeol, is your throat better now?\n-Yes, it’s much better now.\n-Oh my, even young people need to be careful about herniated discs.\n-Indeed, haha!\nHan-gyeol had to wear a neck plaster for a while because of the kiss mark I left on him.Next time, I’ll mark somewhere less visible...\nI didn’t expect it to last this long. But Han-gyeol’s mark still lingers on my chest.\nIf it fades, shall I mark him again? Just the thought of it makes me so happy.\nI want to do it again.\nKissing Han-gyeol and then in bed...\n“Eun-ha, is something wrong?”\n“Huh-?! What?! No, nothing’s wrong”\n“No? You’ve been giggling all morning... I thought something might be up.”\n“No, not at all! Is there anything you need me to do? I was just about to upload the work you mentioned.”\n“Today’s your last day, so take it easy~”\n“I want to work hard like Han-gyeol.”\nUpon hearing this, the team leader also peered over the partition at Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol is kind of an exceptional presence.”\n“It seems like this is really his calling.”\n“The CEO has been eyeing him for a while... It’s his last day today, right?”\nMy mom has already decided Han-gyeol is the perfect son-in-law.\nI wish Han-gyeol would become my husband soon.\n“It looks like today will be the last day, according to the CEO and Han-gyeol.”\n“Well, he’s going to be a college student starting in March, so he must have a lot to prepare for. I’m jealous~ I wish I could go back to being twenty.”\n“You still look twenty!”\n“Haha! Thanks, even if it’s just flattery.”\n“Hehe...”\nI’ve been so happy lately.\nRight after finishing the last task, the CEO called Han-gyeol and me into her office.\n“Eun-ha, Han-gyeol, could you come to my office for a moment?”\n“Yes.”\n“Yep!”\nWe promptly got up from our chairs and entered the CEO’s office.\n“Alright, everyone, have a seat.”\nAs Han-gyeol and I took our seats, the CEO looked at us with a fond smile.\n“Is it your last day already? I’m so pleased with all of you as your CEO, and as a mother, I’m truly proud.”\n“Right?! So, you’ll keep the promise you made?”\n“Of course. Honestly, I didn’t expect you both to perform this well, thank you for the great results.”\nAs soon as mom gave permission for us to live together, I hugged Han-gyeol with a wide smile.\n“Kyaa! Han-gyeol, we can live together now. Ah~ I’m so happy.”\n“Uh, Eun-ha? We’re still at the office. And the CEO is watching...?!”\nHan-gyeol, wary of mom’s gaze, gently pushed me away.\nRealizing the situation, I quickly settled down and sat properly in my chair.\n“You shouldn’t behave like this at work.”\n“I’m sorry, I just got too happy...”\n“Promises are promises, so start looking for an apartment next week.”\nFinally, Han-gyeol and I could live together.\nI’m incredibly happy and excited.\nNow we can be together every day.\nWaking up to see Han-gyeol, and even when I close my eyes, he’ll be there.\nJust imagining it makes my heart flutter and lifts the corners of my mouth.\nLiving together, we might kiss anytime…\nAnd morning, noon, and night, whenever there’s a chance with Han-gyeol... Hehe.\n“Your smile could almost reach your ears. Are you that happy?”\n“Yes! I’m really happy. Thank you for allowing this.”\n“You’re mixing formal and informal speech... Anyway, since there’s nothing much to do today, say your goodbyes this afternoon and you can head out early.”\n“Okay~”\nI was already looking forward to living with Han-gyeol.\n***\nAs lunchtime ended, Mom gave us a chance to say our final goodbyes to our colleagues.\nIt was bittersweet to think it was the end.\nIt was my first job since turning twenty, and everyone had been so kind.\nBut now, it was time to say farewell.\n“Thank you for everything!”\n“Eun-ha, you’ve worked hard~ Have a great time at university~”\n“Thank you!”\nAfter my farewells, it was Han-gyeol’s turn.\n“I also want to thank everyone. I learned a lot here.”\n“Aww, we learned more from you~ You worked hard.”\n“Thank you.”\nAs Han-gyeol bowed to say his goodbyes like me, my CEO mom spoke up.\n“I’d love to throw a farewell party since it’s your last day, but we can’t as the work isn’t done yet. I’m sorry.”\nResponding to Mom’s comment, Han-gyeol’s team members added a few words.\n“I guess we’ll see each other again next time~”\n“If we have any issues with the Excel sheets Han-gyeol made, I’ll contact you~.”\n“I envy you for being a college student~ You both have worked hard this month. Travel safely.”\n“Then, we’ll be going now. Take care!”\nWith the last goodbyes exchanged, we boarded the elevator.\nAs soon as the elevator doors closed, Han-gyeol sneakily grabbed my hand.\n“Han-gyeol-ssi? We’re still at the company~”\n“It’s all over now~”\n“We haven’t even left the building yet~ You never held my hand while we were working.”\n“Couldn’t help it, it’s the office rules.”\n“You wanted to hold my hand?”\nAt my question, Han-gyeol nodded.\n“Then you owe me a kiss too~?”\n“Here?”\n“Yes!”\n“Well, guess I can’t resist.”\n“Don’t give up!”\nHan-gyeol laughed at my remark.\n“There’s CCTV, so let’s just hold hands~”\n“In dramas, they always sneak off to the utility room for a kiss...!”\n“You’re thinking of getting us into trouble. We can kiss all we want at home.”\n“Will you really do it all we want?”\n“Depends on Eun-ha~”\n“What is that! Even if you do it every time I see you, it won’t be enough…!”\n-The elevator has reached the first floor. Doors are opening.\nAs soon as we arrived at the first floor, we quickly let go of each other’s hands.\nWe walked out of the building and headed towards the subway station.\n“Eun-ha, shall we hold hands again?”\n“Hurry up and grab it before I change my mind~”\nWith a slight smile, Han-gyeol clasped my hand again.\n“Now that we’ve quit, should we go eat something delicious?”\n“No. There’s something I want to do first, let’s go home!”\n“Something to do? What is it?”\n“Come here.”\nI pulled Han-gyeol closer and whispered into his ear.\n“Leaving kiss marks on Han-gyeol’s body...”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol covered his neck and stepped back.\n“Again?! I had to wear a patch because of that last time! I was so nervous it might peel off.”\n“I told you I’d always keep kiss marks on your body~ Where do you want it this time?”\n“There’s nothing you won’t say, huh...”\nI grinned and hugged Han-gyeol.\n“Why~? Embarrassed~? We’ve done more embarrassing things~”\n“Eun-ha, have you been drinking?! It feels like that time again.”\n“I don’t know~ I just like Han-gyeol too much~”\nHan-gyeol, embarrassed, pushed me away.\n“We’re on the street...! Let’s tone it down a bit.”\n“What a pity~ So, we only need to restrain ourselves on the street?”\n“You’re just a wild animal now.”\n“If you have a complaint, why don’t you become wild too?”\nAs I smiled at him, Han-gyeol came closer to my ear.\nI perked up my ears, and he whispered softly.\n“I want to touch Eun-ha’s chest during sex...”\n“Huh-?! What, what are you saying?!”\nI was shocked and covered my ears, putting some distance between us.\nEven if it was a whisper, to say such a thing on the street...!\n“You started it, Eun-ha.”\n“I, I was controlling the level of it—!”\n“I don’t think there was much of a difference.”\nReally... He always goes one step further.\n“Really...! That’s embarrassing...!”\n“I like it when Eun-ha looks embarrassed.”\n“Pervert...”\nAt my words, the area under Han-gyeol’s eyes quivered.\n“It really feels unfair hearing that from Eun-ha...”\n“What, what-?! Are you calling me a pervert?”\n“Are you denying it? You really have no awareness?”\n“I, what-!”\n“It could be true...”\n“Don’t just convince yourself, explain it to me!”\nI moved closer to Han-gyeol as I spoke. Maybe he found it cute because he then pinched and stretched my cheek.\n“You know you get pretty wild when you’re drunk, Eun-ha.”\n“That, that’s only when I’m drunk!”\n“But I like wild Eun-ha too?”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I averted my gaze slightly.\nReally, what’s with that? How can I even respond to that?\n“I guess I am a pervert...”\nAt my admission, Han-gyeol laughed heartily and grasped my hand tightly, pulling me towards him.\n“Han-gyeol? Where are we going?”\n“To share a deep kiss with Eun-ha.”\nHan-gyeol firmly held my hand and walked forward. It seemed like he really wanted me, so I quickly followed him.\n“Great! Let’s hurry!”\nIt seems like both Han-gyeol and I are somewhat wild.\nMaybe that’s why we get along so well?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I was standing on my hands because I have an important dinner appointment tomorrow.\n“Eun-ha, do you really need to go this far?”\nHan-gyeol, who was holding my calves, asked me.\n“Ugh...! I have to...! I need to show my pretty side to your mother...!”\nThe dinner appointment mentioned by our parents at the graduation ceremony was set.\nNow that we’re officially living together, it’s only natural to have a family dinner.\nUnfortunately, my dad and Han-gyeol’s father are too busy to attend.\n“I don’t see what standing on your hands at home has to do with any of this.”\n“They say it helps reduce swelling in the calves...! Ugh...it’s tough.”\n“Do you want to rest for a bit? Should I help you down?”“Yes...! Help me down...!”\nHan-gyeol slowly lowered my calves to the floor.\nI lay there, exhausted, gasping for breath.\n“Should I get you some water?”\n“No... I’m okay...”\n“You don’t need to do this; my mom will think you’re pretty no matter what. You’re pretty as is.”\n“Oh no...! Han-gyeol, you’ve already earned a lot of points with my mom, but I haven’t!”\nMy mom has already accepted Han-gyeol.\nNow it’s my turn to be accepted by his mother.\n“I might just ask your mom to give you to me.”\n“I’ve thought about it, but it seems like you are overdoing it. Pass!”\n“So, you thought about it?”\n“Of course.”\nIf I had a son like Han-gyeol, I’d be so disappointed. To think, a son I raised for nearly 20 years, wanting to leave home to live with his girlfriend.\nI even worried it might lead to mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts.\n“So, what does Han-gyeol’s mom think...? What kind of daughter-in-law does she want?”\n“You know, any mother would love to have a daughter-in-law like Eun-ha.”\n“Tell me the facts, not just nice words! A quiet daughter-in-law? Or one who’s assertive? Which is better?”\n“I don’t really know my mom’s taste that well. But Eun-ha is loved wherever she goes, you know?”\n“That’s nice to hear, but—”\nHan-gyeol put his hand on my head and tousled my hair.\n“This will ruin my hair.”\n“You don’t need to try so hard, you’re lovely enough as it is. To me, you’re the loveliest person I’ve ever seen.”\nHan-gyeol always says nice things to me. Hearing his affectionate voice always makes my cheeks turn red.\nReally...\n“I love it so much—!”\n“Ah—!”\nI pounced on Han-gyeol, who was sitting down, and pushed him to the floor.\nI peppered his cheek with kisses, overwhelmed with happiness.\nIt’s all because Han-gyeol is too adorable!\n“I love Han-gyeol so much too—!”\n“I’m only adorable to Eun-ha.”\n“Right~ I wish you were only adorable to me. To keep other girls from eyeing you. Maybe I should have left a more visible hickey.”\n“Absolutely not—! Eun-ha. There’s already a very noticeable hickey on my chest.”\n“That’s because you left one on me too, so it’s only fair~”\nWhen we were together, I left a vivid hickey on Han-gyeol’s chest.\nOf course, Han-gyeol did the same to me, and the mark is still there on my body.\n“I’m speechless. Have you picked out what you’re wearing tomorrow?”\n“Yeah, of course. I’m going for something neat! What about you, Han-gyeol?”\n“I was thinking of dressing neatly too.”\n“That’ll look great.”\n“You always say I look good no matter what I wear.”\n“But you really do look great.”\nI lay down next to Han-gyeol, and we shared a moment of happiness, facing each other.\n“Eun-ha, you look beautiful in anything.”\n“Really? When do you think I look prettiest?”\n“I have a very clear answer to that question.”\n“What is it?”\n“When you wear nothing at all.”\n“Hey—!”\nI sat up abruptly and yelled at Han-gyeol.\nWith his innocent smile, Han-gyeol really is... sometimes he’s incredibly bold.\nIt seems I’ve started to become like him without realizing it...\n“Then get up quickly.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“I want to show you a pretty side of me...!”\nI find myself wanting Han-gyeol all the time.\n“Goodness... I must go see this right away~”\n“Kyaa—!”\nHan-gyeol got up and hoisted me over his shoulder.\nEven entering the room felt blissfully happy.\n***\n“Eun-ha~ If you’re ready, let’s go.”\n“Okay~ heading out now.”\nDressed neatly, my mom and I headed to a nearby family restaurant.\nHan-gyeol and his mother had already arrived when we got to the meeting place.\n“Oh, you’re already here.”\n“We just arrived~”\nAfter my mom and Han-gyeol’s mother exchanged greetings, I also bowed politely.\n“Hello—!”\n“Hello, Eun-ha~ I’ve only seen you in your school uniform, but you look very pretty in your casual clothes too.”\n“Th-thank you!”\nI felt good about making the effort!\nHan-gyeol’s mother was as gracious with her compliments as Han-gyeol.\n“Hello.”\nHan-gyeol also bowed to my mom.\n“Hello~”\nMy mom smiled brightly and waved at Han-gyeol.\n“Shall we go inside?”\n“Yes, let’s talk more inside.”\n“There’s so much to talk about. Hehe...”\nMom and Han-gyeol’s mother smiled and went inside.\nWe sat down, ordered from the menu, and started with small talk.\nThe real conversation began once the food arrived.\n“Has our son been causing any trouble at work? He’s just turned twenty, so I imagine he’s been quite error-prone starting out in society~”\n“Not at all~ He’s been so helpful. If it were up to me, I’d hire him at the company right away, but the kids should enjoy their college life too~”\n“Though their majors are different, they seem to be having fun since they go to the same university.”\n“Thanks to Han-gyeol, Eun-ha has been studying harder too~ It’s so pleasing to see them positively influence each other.”\n“I think so too~ They complement each other’s weaknesses and take care of each other well.”\nHan-gyeol and I listened intently to our mothers’ conversation.\nIt was a bit difficult to jump into their dialogue, but the atmosphere was very pleasant.\n“How should the kids find an apartment?”\n“Since they’ll be living together, I think it’s best they look for it themselves, but maybe an adult should help out too. What do you two think?”\nAs soon as my Mom asked, Han-gyeol promptly replied.\n“It might be a bit difficult for us to handle everything from searching to signing the lease. We’d need to gather family registry documents and it’s our first time dealing with real estate contracts. Plus, there’s the risk of rental fraud.”\nOur moms smiled proudly at Han-gyeol’s response.\n“How mature you are, Han-gyeol! You’re not at the age to worry about family registries and rental scams. It’s reassuring to see you so grown-up.”\n“It’s all thanks to Eun-ha. Having a wonderful girlfriend like her, he’s growing emotionally too.”\n“Shall we start looking for the apartment then? Let’s set a day to go see some places with the kids.”\n“That sounds good. We’ll let the kids pick their furniture too.”\nThe meal continued in a cheerful atmosphere. Both parents quickly grew closer through praises for their children.\nAs we were wrapping up, Han-gyeol’s mother turned to me and said,\n“If my son ever does something wrong, make sure to tell me, okay?”\n“Oh, no—! Han-gyeol is so good to me, I don’t think that will be necessary—!”\n“Really? I didn’t know my son was such a kind person.”\n“From what I see, Han-gyeol is incredibly kind and thoughtful. He’s also very responsible.”\nHan-gyeol looked a bit embarrassed by my mom’s praise.\n“I’m a little embarrassed, but thank you.”\nWith Han-gyeol’s blush, our dinner came to an end.\n“We’ll see each other again if there’s a chance. You said you were heading to Busan the week after next, right?”\n“Yes. It would be nice to have the kids’ father join us for a meal next time.”\n“That would be good. We’ll see you next time then. Take care. Eun-ha, you’re staying a bit longer with Han-gyeol, aren’t you?”\nAt my mom’s words, I nodded.\n“Yeah. Planning to spend a bit more time on our date.”\n“Alright, do that. See you next time, Han-gyeol?”\n“Yes. Take care.”\n“Okay.”\nOnce the tension-filled dinner was over, I felt my legs go weak.\nI almost slumped to the floor, but Han-gyeol caught me.\n“Feeling a bit more relaxed now?”\n“Yeah. I’m relieved. Now it really feels like we’re living together.”\n“That was always going to happen, wasn’t it?”\n“Now it really hits home. Let’s live beautifully together!”\n“Yes. Let’s make a beautiful life together.”\nI was spending my twenties much happier than I had ever dreamed.\n“I love you, Han-gyeol~”\n“I love you too~”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The studio apartment where I lived with Eun-ha was a typical newly built villa with two rooms, one bathroom, and a small living room.\nIt looked tidy to the eye, but since it was a fresh start, we cleaned every nook and cranny.\nHaving my own experience living alone, I thoroughly cleaned, and Eun-ha, who usually took care of household chores, even finished cleaning the bathroom immaculately.\n“Phew... That’s about everything. We don’t need to buy any furniture separately, right?”\n“Yeah! Honestly, I was planning to buy the furniture gradually, but thanks to the previous tenant, we’re all set. We just need to buy a folding table.”\nThe previous tenant, a kind college student, had offered to sell us her furniture at a low price, so we took several pieces from her.\n“Let’s go to the supermarket to buy that. Shall we go now?”\n“Let’s eat first!”\n“Since it’s our first day after moving in, how about ordering from the Chinese restaurant?”\n“Yup! Let’s also order some sweet and sour pork.”We quickly ordered from the Chinese restaurant and laid newspaper on the living room floor.\n“It feels like we’ve just moved into our honeymoon home~”\n“Right. After we eat, let’s go out and buy the necessities.”\n“Yup! We need more bathroom and kitchen supplies. We should also shop for groceries in the evening.”\n“You’re so thorough~”\n“Then, should we get married soon?”\n“At least let’s graduate college first~”\n“As you wish~ I just need to marry you~”\nEun-ha smiled brightly.\nIt was a little past lunchtime, so the food arrived surprisingly fast.\nWhen the doorbell rang, I hurried to the front door.\n“They arrived incredibly fast!”\n“I’ll go and get it.”\nI picked up the food and placed it on the newspaper.\nI unwrapped the plastic and mixed the black bean noodles for Eun-ha, handing them to her.\nThen, Eun-ha mixed her noodles and handed them back to me.\nWhat’s this? Isn’t it pointless to mix for each other?\n“Thanks~”\n“Thank you, too.”\n“It’s funny. There’s no point in mixing for each other, is there?”\n“It’s the thought that counts~ I love doing this with you.”\n“Really?”\n“Yup! I love how these small things add up.”\n“There will be plenty more of this in the future.”\n“That’s why I love it~ Here, ah~”\nEun-ha picked up a piece of sweet and sour pork and fed it to me.\nAfter enjoying the crispy pork, I fed her as well.\n“We could end up feeding each other like this the whole time.”\n“Let’s eat faster now~ The noodles will get soggy.”\nAfter finishing our Chinese meal, both Eun-ha and I got up without hesitation to clean up.\nStanding side by side at the sink washing dishes, I couldn’t understand why I felt so fluttery inside.\nMaybe it’s because it felt like we were newlyweds?\n“Han-gyeol, what should we have for dinner?”\n“What do you want to eat, Eun-ha?”\n“Hmm~ I want to make something you’d like.”\n“Then I’d love some pork kimchi stew.”\n“Should we? We did bring kimchi from home after all!”\n“Yeah. We can cook it together for dinner.”\n“Great~”\n“Should we head out now? We need to go to the supermarket to buy the meat.”\n“Yeah. Let’s hurry~”\nAfter cleaning up, we headed to a large nearby supermarket.\nI pulled the shopping cart while Eun-ha meticulously stacked the needed items inside.\nEun-ha’s expression, deep in thought while choosing the meat, was incredibly cute.\n“Han-gyeol, pork belly seems a bit expensive; how about using pork leg? It looks like we could eat generously if we use pork leg.”\nSince we were still receiving living expenses from our parents, we had to save where we could. Any shortfall would soon be made up with part-time jobs.\n“Let’s go with pork leg.”\n“Yep, that sounds good. We just need to buy soy sauce now. Han-gyeol, do you want to drink tonight?”\n“How about a simple beer?”\n“Sure! Let’s drink it like a celebration toast.”\nAt the beer section, we added a four-pack to our cart.\n“It feels like we’re newlyweds.”\n“It’s not our first time at the supermarket together.”\n“But now that we’re living together, it feels even more special.”\nEun-ha gently linked her arm through mine. It really did feel like we were on our honeymoon.\nI felt incredibly happy.\nAfter paying, we carried the shopping bags home.\n“Han-gyeol, isn’t it heavy?”\n“We didn’t buy that much.”\n“Still~ Let me carry one side. I want to carry it together.”\nAt Eun-ha’s request, I handed her one side of the shopping bag.\n“Let’s go shopping like this every day~”\n“Once collage starts, we’ll have less time for this, you know?”\n“Still~ I want to spend as much time as possible with you.”\n“What about all the gatherings you’ll have?”\n“If it’s not absolutely necessary, I won’t go. I get drained in crowded places...”\n“Me too~ Then we’ll always be playing together.”\n“Really~? I want to play with you every day. That’s when I’m happiest and most joyful.”\n“But you need to know how to spend time alone too, in case I’m not around~”\nEun-ha glanced at me briefly after I spoke.\n“Is it because of the military service? Are you worried I’ll be sad and lonely without you?”\n“I can’t say that’s completely untrue. Eun-ha, you do like me a lot.”\nEun-ha stepped in front of me as we stood on a slight uphill slope, putting us eye to eye.\n“Right. I do like you a lot, Han-gyeol. And you like me a lot too, don’t you?”\n“Of course. How could I not? You’re so lovable.”\n“Yeah, I know. That’s why I don’t feel lonely even when you’re not right beside me. Because I know you love me.”\nEun-ha was making such earnest declarations. When I looked away, she smiled and said,\n“Han-gyeol, look at me.”\n“Hmm?”\n“I love you.”\n“Me too.”\n“I love you, Han-gyeol~”\nMy face began to heat up.\n“I, I love you too...”\n“I love even this shy side of you, Han-gyeol. So don’t worry about me. But if you’re still worried, there’s a way to feel like we’re together even when you’re not here. Curious? Should I tell you?”\n“Is there really such a way?”\n“Want to hear it?”\nI nodded, and Eun-ha whispered carefully into my ear.\n“We could just have Hanbyul and Eunbyul before you go...”\nAt Eun-ha’s provocative statement, I blushed up to my neck.\nShe looked at my expression and smiled brightly.\n“You... you’re really something!”\n“Hehe. Embarrassed? We’ll have to have kids someday, why not start a little early?”\n“You’re provocative...”\n“It’s just for you, Han-gyeol~ What about naming our fourth?”\n“We should take it slow on that.”\nSoon, we’ll even be naming our grandchildren.\nEun-ha was always dreaming about our future together. I felt so happy it was almost overwhelming.\n***\nEun-ha, wearing a cute apron, was cooking in the kitchen.\nI was merely organizing the cooking utensils beside her, not much help.\n“Han-gyeol, come and taste this.”\nEun-ha scooped some broth into a small dish.\n“Be careful, it’s hot.”\nAs soon as I tasted the broth, I gave a thumbs up.\n“It’s incredibly delicious.”\n“Really? Then let’s let it simmer a bit more before we eat.”\n“You’ve worked hard. I’ll take care of the rest, so you take a break.”\n“Should I? Then it’s your turn to wear the apron.”\nEun-ha took off her apron and tied it around me. Then, she hugged me tightly from behind and didn’t let go.\n“I said to take a break.”\n“To me, this is taking a break~ Ah, this feels good~”\n“If that’s what Eun-ha wants.”\n“Focus on the cooking~”\n“Yes, yes. Just keep stirring the broth for thirty minutes, right?”\n“Yes, exactly. So, I’ll be hugging you for the next thirty minutes~”\nEun-ha clung to me until the cooking was completely finished.\nAfter we were done, I placed the pot on the folding table we had bought from the supermarket.\nThe delicious aroma filled the house, and Eun-ha served the food into a bowl for me.\n“Ah, I need to grab the beer~”\n“Are you going to have some too, Eun-ha?”\n“Of course~”\nEun-ha cheerfully fetched the beer from the refrigerator.\n“Just have a little, Eun-ha.”\n“Okay. And I can’t finish a beer anyway; it fills me up too much. Cheers~”\n“Cheers~”\nWe clinked our beer cans together and took a sip.\nThen, I immediately tried the kimchi stew Eun-ha had made.\nThe meat was exceptionally tender.\n“It’s incredibly tasty.”\n“Really? I’m so glad you like it. I’ll cook tomorrow. What do you want to eat?”\n“Anything you make will be great.”\n“Don’t make it hard, just tell me.”\n“Um—Doenjang jjigae and egg rolls!”\n“That’s super easy.”\n“But that’s what I want.”\n“Got it. I’ll make it tomorrow.”\n“I’m so happy.”\nEun-ha smiled broadly as she ate the kimchi stew.\nShe quietly finished her bowl, seemingly content with her own cooking.\nAlthough she ate slowly, she eventually finished her meal.\nAfter we were done eating, I offered to clean up, but as I started washing the dishes, Eun-ha called out from behind me.\n“I want to help too~ I want to help~!”\n“Just relax on the sofa. You must be tired from cooking.”\n“Helping Han-gyeol isn’t tiring at all.”\n“I’ll take the sentiment.”\n“I can’t just sit.”\nEun-ha inevitably got up from the sofa and rushed over to me.\nShe nudged me slightly to make space at the sink and started washing the dishes.\n“It’s faster with two of us~ Let’s finish quickly and play.”\n“Okay. What should we do after the dishes?”\n“Hmm… Let’s watch a movie-!”\n“Got a movie in mind?”\n“We can look it up once we’re done.”\n“Sounds good~”\nI should have saved the beer for later.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Eun-ha and I were watching a movie while munching on potato chips.\nBut then... something went wrong halfway through.\n- Haah···! Haah···! Aah-!\nIt seems like we picked the wrong movie.\nA man and a woman started sweeping things off a table and began having loud, passionate sex.\nThe sounds of their moans, almost like screams, spilled out of the TV, making me feel a bit embarrassed.\nI felt relieved for a moment when the scene changed, but then the scene shifted to the bathroom where the main characters were again having intense sex in the shower.\nWhoa... this is intense...\nI thought Eun-ha would definitely be embarrassed, but surprisingly, she kept watching the movie without a hint of discomfort.\nShe seemed to be watching it like a documentary, feeling neither embarrassment nor awkwardness.“Eun-ha, should we watch something else?”\n“Huh? Why? Are you not enjoying it, Han-gyeol?”\n“No, it’s just... those embarrassing scenes keep coming up.”\n“Embarrassing... why?”\nEun-ha asked, genuinely puzzled.\nDoesn’t she feel anything watching that?\nDoes she just see it as a simple video?\n“Eun-ha, don’t you feel anything watching bed scenes?”\n“Huh? Oh... was it some kind of incredible scene? Did I miss something? Should we rewind it?”\nWhat? It feels like we’re not on the same page here.\n“No, there’s no need for that. It’s just that the man and woman are... you know, having sex.”\n“Huh...? It’s not a big deal... Is it bothering you, Han-gyeol? Why?”\n“Isn’t it normal to feel something when you see people having sex naked?”\nEun-ha dropped a piece of potato chip she was holding.\nHer eyes widened slowly, then she hurriedly covered my eyes with both her hands.\n“Don’t look-!”\n“Huh? Why?! What’s with the sudden reaction?!”\nI had no idea what was happening, but Eun-ha climbed onto my lap.\nShe looked at me with a deeply annoyed expression.\nWhat’s going on? Why is she mad? What did I do wrong in this situation?\n“Han-gyeol... do you get bothered when you see other people having sex? Do you watch, like, porn or something?!”\n“N-No-! I’m really confused about how this conversation turned, but could you clarify your point first?”\nEun-ha puffed out her cheeks and stared straight into my eyes.\n“I only care about having sex with you... I’m only interested in your body...!”\n“That’s the same for me! I’m only interested in your body, Eun-ha!”\n“Then why are you embarrassed...? If you got embarrassed watching the actors moan on screen... does that mean you were aroused...? Isn’t it normal to feel nothing?! I feel nothing even when I look at the guy on the screen?!”\nI think I’m in trouble.\nIs there no way out of this?\nI shouldn’t have said anything. I should’ve just let it go.\n“Eun-ha, men are visually stimulated, you know? Seeing the woman’s chest on the screen... Ugh!”\nRealizing I had misspoken, I quickly shut my mouth.\n“...So you got aroused watching the woman on the screen? Why?! Sure, I don’t have enormous breasts, but they aren’t small either!”\nDamn. This isn’t going well.\n“I have no interest in other men, only in you, Han-gyeol, but you...!”\nI’m in trouble.\n“No, Eun-ha, please give me a chance to explain-”\n“You’re only supposed to desire me...!”\nEun-ha lifted the clothes she was wearing and pulled them over my face, hugging me tightly.\nSuddenly enveloped in Eun-ha’s pajamas, her chest was right in front of my eyes.\n“Eun-ha?! Mmph-!”\n“I hate you, Han-gyeol!”\nDespite her words, Eun-ha hugged me tightly.\nAs my face was pressed against her chest, I felt my face heat up.\nThe soft texture and her pleasant scent made my mind go blank.\nIs this... a reward...?!\n“You said you only look at me—liar! Getting excited over another woman! Han-gyeol, you pervert!”\n“...!”\nThe sensation of Eun-ha’s chest against me made my head spin.\nI wanted to calm her down quickly, but I was too happy at that moment.\n“Say something!”\n“Mmph-!”\nAs I patted Eun-ha’s body, she finally let me go.\n“Ah-!”\nEscaping from Eun-ha’s embrace, I saw her still pouting.\nHer cheeks puffed up, demanding an explanation.\nAh, she’s so cute.\nShe’s so cute I want to pounce on her right now.\nBut now isn’t the time to be admiring her; I need to resolve this quickly.\n“Eun-ha, did you really not feel anything watching that movie?”\n“Of course not! I only desire your body! Other men’s bodies are like mannequins to me...! I only get excited by you! I only want to hold hands with you, kiss you, and have sex with you!”\nHer words about only desiring my body were incredibly explicit but made me feel immensely loved.\n“I only desire your body too, Eun-ha.”\n“Then why were you embarrassed, you idiot?”\nWow, she called me an idiot.\nThis is serious. If I hesitate, I’m dead.\n“Explain it clearly. I’ll give you 10 seconds. 10...9...”\n“Do you want the truth?”\n“Don’t stall, Han-gyeol. 5...4...”\nShe’s sharp...!\nEun-ha demanded an answer with frightening precision.\nBut even in a dire situation, there’s always a way out.\n“I wanted to do that with you too.”\n“What?”\nI carefully wrapped my arms around Eun-ha’s waist.\n“The thought of doing that with you in the shower made me embarrassed!”\nSlowly, I slipped my hand under Eun-ha’s clothes and caressed her bare skin.\nBut Eun-ha seemed to want a more straightforward answer.\nShe leaned in close and spoke softly.\n“Han-gyeol, stop beating around the bush and just tell me. Did you get aroused by another woman or not?”\nWow—if I say yes, even as a joke, I’m dead.\nIt’s my fault for letting my guard down in front of a predator.\n“Of course not!”\n“...Really? I only get aroused by you, Han-gyeol... I have no interest in anyone else... Got it?! Since this is the first time, I’ll let you off with a warning.”\nEun-ha asked so seriously that I nodded silently.\nI thought she might finally get off my lap, but instead, she casually turned off the TV with the remote.\n“Then let’s go wash up.”\n“Huh?”\n“I want to wash up with you in the shower...”\nI had no intention of holding back after hearing that.\n“Kyah-!”\nI stood up, still holding Eun-ha, and headed to the bathroom.\nDangling from me, Eun-ha spoke.\n“Han-gyeol...”\n“Yeah? What?”\n“It’s okay to be rough...!”\nShe’s just pouring gasoline on the fire.\n“Don’t plan on sleeping tonight~”\n“Hehe... alright.”\nFrom angry to laughing... she’s really an unpredictable girlfriend.\n***\nInside the shower booth, we kissed under the warm stream of water.\nAs I massaged Eun-ha’s soft breasts, I couldn’t wait to enter her.\n“Eun-ha... turn around.”\n“Okay... like this...?”\nEun-ha’s posture, with her hands against the bathroom wall and accepting me, was incredibly erotic.\nThe water droplets running down her back and her wet hair looked extremely sexy.\n“Ahh...!! Han-gyeol...!”\nAs I thrust into Eun-ha, her waist quivered slightly.\nThe shower booth was cramped, but there was enough room to move.\nThe problem was that Eun-ha’s back was so sexy, I couldn’t hold back.\nThe slickness of the body wash made Eun-ha’s body look even more seductive.\nWith heavy breaths, I gripped her hips and moved my waist as she leaned against the bathroom wall.\nCome to think of it, this is our first time doing it from behind...\n“Han-gyeol... it feels so good...! So good...”\nEun-ha’s voice echoed erotically in the bathroom.\n“Eun-ha... can I move harder?”\n“Yes...! However you want, it’s all yours...! Hnn-!”\nThe moment she gave permission, I began moving my hips more vigorously.\n-Slap, slap...\nThe sound of our bodies colliding grew faster.\nEun-ha’s moans became more intense, and I pulled her even closer.\nWhy is she so lovable?\nI want to be gentle, but seeing Eun-ha like this arouses a deeper desire in me.\nI thrust deeper, harder, hoping to excite her even more.\n“Ahh...! Ah..! Ah...! Han-gyeol..! Han-gyeol...! It’s so deep...!”\nI grabbed her waist tightly and lifted her upper body.\n“Han-gyeol...! What do I do...? I’m going crazy, what do I do...?!”\n“It’s okay... just let go...”\nI massaged her slick breasts while moving my hips.\nEun-ha turned her head, giving me a lascivious look as she whispered her love.\n“I love you... I love you...! Han-gyeol... I’m... I’m going to come...! I’m going to come...!”\n“I’m going to come too...!”\nI moved my hand from her breasts to her clit, gently rubbing it.\n“Ahh-! Ah...! Hnn...! Haah...!”\nAt that moment, Eun-ha let out a loud moan, her body tensing up.\n“Ugh...!”\nThe sudden tightening around me filled the condom with my release.\n“Hnn...!”\nEun-ha’s whole body trembled as she slowly sank to the floor.\nStill shaking, she looked up at me, trying to speak but only managing to moan.\n“Haah...! Haah...!”\nThis is seriously too erotic...!\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "I woke up before the alarm clock could ring noisily.\nMy mood lifted instantly when I saw Han-gyeol as soon as I opened my eyes.\nI snuggled into Han-gyeol’s embrace, who had one arm draped over me.\n‘It’s so warm.’\nEvery time I felt Han-gyeol’s body heat, I was incredibly happy.\nEven in his sleep, Han-gyeol looked so handsome.\nHis long eyelashes, smooth-looking skin... even his sleek lips.\nWhen I wake up early, I silently admire Han-gyeol’s sleeping face.\nThere’s something about his face that automatically makes me smile.\nAs I was admiring Han-gyeol’s face, the alarm clock started to ring loudly.As soon as it goes off, I close my eyes and listen carefully.\nBeep-beep-beep-! Thud-!\nHan-gyeol quickly turns off the alarm as soon as it rings.\nI love how he does that so I can sleep a bit more.\nThinking I’m still asleep, Han-gyeol quietly gets out of bed. He tidies up my blanket and gently pats my head before leaving.\nThis makes me so happy.\nLately, I’ve been starting every morning like this.\nEventually, I hear clattering sounds from the kitchen, and I slowly open my eyes again.\nI tidy up the blanket and carefully leave the room, pretending I’ve just woken up.\n“You’re up early again today? It’s my turn to make breakfast, so you should sleep more.”\n“No way~ I want to watch Han-gyeol cook.”\n“Do as you please~”\n“What are you making? It’s fine if it’s something simple.”\nI spoke while watching Han-gyeol’s back.\nHan-gyeol took out tofu, mushrooms, and zucchini and cut them into bite-sized pieces.\n“I’m making this because I want to eat it.”\n“You always say that, but you only make things I like.”\n“Nice observation? Then be quietly moved.”\nI walked over and hugged Han-gyeol from behind.\n“I’m really touched~”\n“It’s dangerous to hug me while I’m cooking.”\n“I don’t mind getting hurt by you.”\n“You say dangerous things.”\n“Are you making soybean paste stew?”\n“You love this stew.”\n“Yep, Han-gyeol’s stew tastes just like the ones at barbecue restaurants.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol slightly turned his head to look at me.\n“Want to know the secret?”\n“What is it?”\n“Add a spoonful of MSG; everything tastes good.”\n“That’s true. But everything Han-gyeol makes is delicious.”\n“Because I put MSG in everything.”\n“Huh?”\nI stared at Han-gyeol with a dumbfounded expression.\nSeeing my face, Han-gyeol’s lips curled into a smile.\n“Just kidding.”\n“Ugh- You got me again...”\n“I need to use the stove now, so sit on the sofa.”\n“No way~ I’m not letting go~”\n“Lately, you’ve been even more affectionate.”\n“Don’t you like it?”\n“I love it. Now, please go rest on the sofa~”\nHan-gyeol tried to turn around and gently push me off. Instead, I pressed closer against his chest.\n“I said no~ I want to hear your heartbeat more.”\n“Aren’t you tired of hearing it every day?”\n“Nope. I want to hear it every day.”\nI love the sound of Han-gyeol’s heart pounding.\nI also love how he silently strokes my hair.\n“Your heart is racing, Han-gyeol.”\n“That’s because you’re hugging me, Eun-ha.”\n“Aren’t you tired of me hugging you every day?”\n“Nope. I want to hug you every day.”\n“Why are you copying me~”\nWith a soft smile, Han-gyeol pulled me into a tight embrace.\n“Because you’re so cute. So cute.”\n“Hehe, I like it.”\nAfter pulling away from Han-gyeol’s arms, I sat on the sofa, watching his back.\nI wanted to jump back into his arms, but I didn’t want to bother him.\nI heard the bubbling sound of the soybean paste stew and the fragrant smell wafting through the air.\nHan-gyeol quickly finished making the rolled omelette and brought the dishes to the table.\n“Let’s eat.”\n“Thank you for the meal.”\nAfter eating the breakfast Han-gyeol prepared, I usually handle the cleanup. But every time, Han-gyeol tries to get up and help with the cleanup.\nThough I appreciated the gesture, I firmly declined.\n“You’re trying to help again! We agreed that the person who makes breakfast doesn’t do the cleanup.”\n“It’s faster if we do it together.”\n“No way. We have to follow our rules.”\nWhen I spoke firmly, Han-gyeol soon agreed.\nI carried the dishes to the kitchen and placed them in the sink.\nAs I started washing the dishes, Han-gyeol sneaked up and hugged me from behind.\n“There’s no rule against hugging.”\nHan-gyeol, peeking out his head, looked incredibly cute.\n“You couldn’t wait to run over?”\n“What’s with this fresh puppy treatment?”\n“You’re adorable. Han-gyeol, you’re like a big puppy.”\n“Really? Others say I’m like a silent bear.”\n“That’s because you don’t smile much in front of others. You just quietly do your work.”\nWe talked as I washed the dishes.\n“Am I like that? Don’t I smile in front of others?”\n“At first, I thought you did, but you always have a blank expression when I’m not around.”\n“Even you think so? I should fix that.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I stopped and turned to look at him.\n“No! Don’t fix it. You can’t walk around smiling… you look even more handsome when you smile.”\n“It only seems that way to you, Eun-ha. I’m just ordinary.”\n“No way. Han-gyeol, you just don’t realize it! Sure, when you’re expressionless, it looks like you’re annoyed with the world, but even that looks handsome…!”\n“Is that a compliment? That I look annoyed with the world?”\n“But it’s also subtly sexy…”\n“Got it. I won’t smile. Let’s finish the dishes. Need help?”\n“Don’t try to brush it off…! You can’t go around smiling, okay?”\n“Yes~”\nI felt a bit uneasy. Of course, Han-gyeol only loves me…!\nI quickly took off the rubber gloves I was wearing.\n“Eun-ha? We’re not done with the dishes yet.”\n“This won’t do. I need to mark you. Come here.”\nI pulled Han-gyeol’s head down and kissed his neck.\n“Ah! Eun-ha, the new semester is starting soon, you can’t do this-!”\nHan-gyeol belongs to me.\n***\nAfter tidying up and having a small tussle with Han-gyeol, we decided to go for a walk.\nHolding hands and exploring a new neighborhood felt exciting, but doing it with Han-gyeol made it even more enjoyable.\nA morning walk with my boyfriend in the fresh air… is there anything more blissful?\n“Oh right. I have plans to drink with Yujin this weekend. Is that okay?”\n“With Jang Yujin? Oh, that reminds me, I totally forgot I made plans with Harim in February!”\n“Then how about the four of us meet up? It might be nice to have a drink together before the semester starts.”\n“Ah, should we?! That sounds great. I’ll contact Harim this afternoon.”\n“Alright. Should we head back home now?”\n“Let’s grab a coffee at a café first.”\n“Sure. Where do you want to go?”\n“I saw a place on our way here. Let’s go there.”\nWe retraced our steps and went into a café near our home.\nSince it was morning, the café was quiet, and we found a nice spot to sit.\n“I’ll go order. What do you want to drink, Han-gyeol?”\n“Let’s go together.”\n“No need for both of us to go. I’ll get it. What do you want?”\n“Then I’ll have an iced Americano.”\n“Got it~”\nLeaving Han-gyeol behind, I headed to the counter.\n“Hi, may I take your order?”\n“Two iced Americanos, please.”\n“That will be five thousand won. Are you staying here?”\n“Yes, we’ll drink it here.”\n“Alright, please wait on the right. Your order will be ready shortly~”\n“Thank you~”\nI moved a few steps to the side.\nFrom afar, I could see Han-gyeol had taken off his jacket and was spacing out again.\nJust as we talked about in the morning, Han-gyeol always had a blank expression when he wasn’t around others.\n“But he looks so handsome…”\nIn high school, we were always together in the same classroom, so I didn’t have to worry too much.\nEveryone in our class and even the neighboring classes knew about my relationship with Han-gyeol.\nBut university is different.\nEven if we coordinate our general education classes, our majors are different, so we can’t always be together on campus.\nNaturally, this means we’ll each become close with our classmates in our respective majors... As his girlfriend, I can’t help but feel a little concerned.\n“Here are your two coffees~”\n“Oh! Yes, thank you!”\nI took the tray and walked over to Han-gyeol. The closer I got, the more I took in the details of his appearance.\nWhen I sat down, Han-gyeol’s expressionless face transformed into a bright smile as he looked at me.\n“You’re back?”\nThat slight curve of his lips is so endearing!\n“D-Don’t smile like that-!”\n“Huh? You don’t want me to smile in front of you either?”\n“Seriously... I just want to lock you up and keep you all to myself...!!”\n“Could you not say scary things like that...?”\n“I mean it...!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Eun-ha and I walked into the bar we had promised to meet at.\nAfter showing our IDs, we scanned the room and spotted Jeong Harim waving enthusiastically from a distance.\nEun-ha smiled brightly as she approached the table to greet Harim.\n“Harim~ Hi~”\n“Eun-ha, long time no see~ How have you been? You look so much better since you started living with Han-gyeol~”\nShe had told them we were living together before we met up.\n“Yeah, yeah. It’s been great. Hi, Jang Yujin.”\n“Hey. Hi.”\nI also greeted Yujin from behind Eun-ha.\n“Long time no see.”“You’re here?”\nWe settled into our seats and ordered a bottle of soju and some stir-fried pork. But today, we were here more for the conversation than the alcohol.\n“By the way, did Han-gyeol lose weight? I haven’t seen you in about a month, but your face looks slimmer.”\n“Yeah, right? I’ve been gaining weight from drinking and partying, but why are you losing weight? It’s annoying.”\nJeong Harim’s comment prompted Yujin to chime in as well. I did feel like I had lost some weight recently.\nThe reason, if I had to pinpoint it...was probably because of how much Eun-ha and I had been doing it.\nI knew living together meant we’d do it a lot, but it was more than I expected.\nOn days when Eun-ha wanted it...morning, noon, evening, even at dawn...\nI have a pretty high sex drive, but Eun-ha’s is no joke either.\nLately, Eun-ha seemed to be the one wanting it more often... Feeling a bit guilty, she stammered out a response.\n“R-really? Maybe it’s because Han-gyeol and I have been going out a lot lately... Haha. Hahaha.”\nI couldn’t exactly say it was because we’d been having too much sex.\nHowever, Jeong Harim seemed to catch on to something in Eun-ha’s nervousness and looked at her with a knowing expression.\nYujin, on the other hand, didn’t seem to notice anything unusual and spoke to me.\n“Don’t you guys fight? Most people fight at least once when they live together.”\n“We’re doing well. We’ve divided up the housework nicely.”\n“Oh- really? That’s practically like being married. Why don’t you just get married already?”\n“We’re only twenty, it’s a bit ea-”\nBefore I could finish, Eun-ha looked at Yujin and said.\n“You think so too?! I think so too! Yeah, it’s practically like we’re married.”\nYujin was taken aback by Eun-ha’s bold statement. Meanwhile, Jeong Harim maintained her characteristic calmness and teased the situation.\n“Sooner is better~ How many kids do you want~?”\nAlthough Jeong Harim asked playfully, Eun-ha responded seriously.\n“Four.”\n“What?”\nFor the first time, the composure disappeared from Jeong Harim’s face.\nShe probably didn’t expect us to be thinking that far ahead. And not just one or two kids, but four...\nOf course, that would be surprising. Just as a slight awkwardness began to settle over the group, our drinks and snacks arrived at the table, perfectly timed.\n“L-let’s talk while we drink.”\nJeong Harim, flustered, opened the bottle of soju.\n“Sure.”\n“Okay.”\nEach of us filled our glasses with soju and clinked them together in midair.\nAfter downing our drinks, we finally began to have a proper conversation.\n“Meeting like this feels so new~ I can’t believe we’re adults.”\n“Yeah, it does. But being twenty is fun. We get to drink like this.”\n“I used to love watching Eun-ha and Han-gyeol dating in high school, but now I can’t, and it’s a bit sad~”\n“Not much has changed since then.”\n“Really? I wonder about that~ Huhu...”\nAs expected, Jeong Harim was quick to catch on. She always had a sly side.\n“It’s changed a lot...!”\nBut Eun-ha responded without any hesitation to Harim’s comment.\n“What’s changed, exactly~? Come on, tell us~”\n“Han-gyeol’s become even better...”\nEun-ha’s innocent remark brought another wave of silence.\n“Oh, come on-”\nYujin, sitting across from me, silently refilled his glass.\nJeong Harim extended her glass towards Yujin as well.\n“Give me some too.”\n“Alright. Let’s drink the bitter stuff and forget the sweetness.”\nSurprisingly, these two got along well.\n“Han-gyeol, aren’t you worried that once the new semester starts, there will be lots of guys hitting on Eun-ha?”\nJeong Harim hit a sore spot. Her sly smile was annoying, but... honestly, it was a bit concerning.\nI subtly turned my head to the side to see Eun-ha, whose overwhelming beauty stood out.\n“Why?”\nI had a feeling that if she walked alone on the street right now, tons of guys would ask for her number.\nAlthough we’re always together now, it wouldn’t be the same once we started university.\nTrying to look unbothered, I lifted my glass, but the drink wobbled slightly for some reason.\n“W-worried? No way... Eun-ha only loves me... She’s the kind of strong girl who’d reject any guy in a heartbeat... She loves me and always says she’s mine, so it’s fine... It’ll be fine...”\n“Sorry, did I touch a nerve? Your glass is trembling.”\nAs Jeong Harim’s comment ended, this time, Yujin spoke up.\n“Honestly, shouldn’t Shin Eun-ha be just as worried? Han-gyeol might have a quirky personality, but he’s still pretty good-looking, isn’t he?”\nWas he saying that for my sake? I felt grateful to Yujin. But my anxiety seemed to have spread to Eun-ha as well.\n“I-I’m fine... Han-gyeol is mine... If any girl approaches him, I’ll cut them off immediately... Han-gyeol has to stay by my side until he dies... So, it’s fine... I have no intention of sparing any girl who comes near him...”\nUnlike my trembling glass, Eun-ha’s hand, holding a fork, was shaking.\n“Aren’t you two a bit different in style? What’s this about not sparing anyone?”\n“You two are a perfect match~ like soulmates.”\nIt seemed they enjoyed watching us.\n“Han-gyeol, don’t worry about me. I’m definitely yours. Don’t worry. If you want, we can get married right now. We don’t need a wedding. All I need is for the law and society to recognize us as a married couple.”\n“Isn’t that a bit unromantic?”\n“All I need is Han-gyeol.”\n“But I want to see you in a wedding dress, Eun-ha...”\n“Then, soon...!”\nSeeing us like this, Yujin and Jeong Harim clinked their glasses together, looking envious.\n“Hey, why are we being left out?”\n“It felt like you two were in another world. For a moment, I thought we disappeared.”\n“Got it. We’ll tone down the lovey-dovey stuff. Let’s all enjoy together.”\n“Right. It’s been a while since we met. Let’s drink properly from now on.”\nJeong Harim and Yujin filled their glasses again and extended them towards us.\n***\nEun-ha and Yujin seemed to have similar drinking capacities, as they both collapsed onto the table.\nOnly Jeong Harim and I remained conscious.\n“So, this is how it ends... I didn’t expect Yujin to get this drunk and pass out.”\n“He can’t handle alcohol. Last time too, he just went ‘plop’ around this point~ It was tough getting him into a taxi.”\n“You two drank together before?”\n“Oh no~ I slipped up~ Hurry and take care of Eun-ha~ I’ll handle Yujin.”\n“No way. Even so, how are you going to-”\nBefore I could finish, Jeong Harim grabbed Yujin’s arm and lifted him up with ease.\n“Huh? What did you say?”\n“N-nothing... You’re really strong...”\n“This is nothing. Anyway, can you settle the bill? Send me the total and I’ll cover Yujin’s share too.”\n“Sure. I’ll take care of my girlfriend first.”\nI helped Eun-ha up, paid the bill, and we left the bar.\n“Take care on your way home. Make sure Yujin gets home safely.”\n“Don’t worry~ You take care of Eun-ha too. Let’s meet again soon.”\n“Yeah, it was fun.”\n“For us too~”\nJeong Harim supported Yujin and walked away.\n“Come to think of it... Did she always call Yujin without his last name?”\nWell, their relationship is their business. I needed to take care of Eun-ha.\n“Han-gyeol~ The ground is waving~ It’s amazing~”\n“Oh dear, we need to get you into a taxi. Let’s go.”\n“Carry me, Han-gyeol~ Carry me.”\nHer cuteness made me give in and carry her on my back.\n“How’s this? Satisfied?”\n“...”\n“Eun-ha?”\n“...”\nShe must have asked to be carried because she was sleepy.\nAs we slowly walked towards the taxi stand, Eun-ha began muttering in her sleep.\n“Han-gyeol is mine... If you touch him, I’ll start with one arm...”\n“What kind of dream are you having? Eun-ha, calm down. What’s with starting with one arm?”\n“Stay still... It’ll hurt more if you move... Slice.”\n“Eun-ha? Who are you cutting?”\nScary…\nEven in the taxi, Eun-ha continued her violent dream.\n“Whose is Han-gyeol...?”\n“Yours, Eun-ha.”\n“Right... Good job...”\nIt seemed she had brainwashed someone in her dream.\ngently placed my hand over Eun-ha’s, who held onto it even in her sleep.\n“Mine...”\nEun-ha’s birthday is coming up in a few days, so I’ll take this chance to measure her finger size.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "A few days ago, after drinking with Harim and Jang Yujin, there was something that kept bothering me.\nIt was Han-gyeol’s rapid weight loss...\nit must be because of me, right?\nBut I love it when Han-gyeol touches my body, and I’m so happy when we passionately embrace.\nOf course, Han-gyeol seems to love it too, but I’m worried it might lead to health problems.\nEverything in excess is harmful...\nI carefully brought my laptop to the living room while Han-gyeol was asleep at dawn.\nSitting on the dark living room sofa, I opened my laptop and started searching online.\nScrolling through various searches, it said that twice was appropriate.\n“Huh? That’s pretty normal.”What a relief.\nIt seemed like Han-gyeol’s weight loss wasn’t solely due to our relationship.\nJust as I was about to turn off the laptop, I misread a headline.\nI opened my eyes wide and re-read the headline.\n- Couples in their 20s say having sex twice a week is appropriate...\n“A week...?!”\nIt said twice a week was appropriate...!\nThen what about us who do it twice a day...?!\nWell, except during my period, so is it okay?\nNo, it means we’re doing it seven times more than average...\nRecently, Han-gyeol and I have been doing it every morning and evening…\nAlthough Han-gyeol wanted it, I wanted it more…\nThe skinship with Han-gyeol feels incredibly good.\nI can truly feel the love in every action.\nThe consideration and care for me?\nSomething indescribable fills my heart immensely.\nBut I should probably control myself a bit more from now on.\nIs there anything else?\n“Eun-ha...? What are you doing, not sleeping?”\n“Kyaa-!”\nStartled by Han-gyeol’s sudden appearance, I hurriedly closed the laptop screen and fell off the sofa.\n“S-sorry! Did I scare you?!”\n“Didn’t you sleep, Han-gyeol?”\n“No... I woke up. Anyway, get up.”\n“Ouch... my butt hurts...!”\n“What were you doing alone at dawn...?”\n“I-I just couldn’t sleep! Go back to bed...!”\n“Okay. I just came to drink some water. Now, get up.”\nHan-gyeol helped me up and drank a cup of water in the kitchen.\nLooking closely, it seemed like he did lose some weight…\nI decided to exercise some self-control from now on.\n“Eun-ha, are you going to stay up a bit longer? Need help with anything?”\n“Huh?! No, no. Let’s go back to bed~”\nI lay down on the bed again with Han-gyeol.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah, what is it?”\n“I just woke up at dawn and felt happy seeing you.”\nHan-gyeol kept saying things that made my heart flutter.\nThat’s why I keep wanting to do it…\nI want more love... I want him more…\nWhat should I do... I want to be loved again.\nUnconsciously, I placed my hand on Han-gyeol’s cheek.\nCome to think of it, it always felt like this.\nOur deep relationship began with Han-gyeol’s words that made my heart flutter and me covering his lips with mine.\nIf I endure just this, I could let Han-gyeol sleep peacefully tonight.\n“I like you too. Let’s sleep.”\n“Yeah. Goodnight, Eun-ha. See you later.”\n“Yeah. See you in the morning~”\nHan-gyeol’s eyes closed first.\nHe must be really tired these days, falling asleep as soon as he closed his eyes.\nI can’t do this.\nI can’t overwork the person I love, so I decided to hold back a bit.\nWhen he wakes up, I’ll make sure to take good care of him.\nBut since I held back from kissing, holding hands while sleeping should be okay, right...?\nGently holding Han-gyeol’s hand, I slowly closed my eyes too.\nYeah.\nFiery, passionate moments are great, but I also love these calm, warm moments.\nI decided to be content with simply being connected with the person I love.\nStill, I want to connect even more deeply.\n***\nJust as I thought at dawn, I made Han-gyeol a healthy meal.\nAfter thoroughly cleaning a chicken, I made a nourishing soup with various medicinal herbs.\nIt was my first time following this recipe, but it turned out to be quite tasty.\nThe internet really does know everything.\n“Han-gyeol, come eat!”\n“Wow~ You can make this too?”\n“I heard you’ve been losing weight lately, so I made this to help you feel better~”\n“Thanks~ I’ll eat well.”\n“Yeah, yeah!”\nHan-gyeol started devouring the soup happily.\nJust watching him eat makes me so happy.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes?”\n“I love you~”\n“I love you too. You should eat too, Eun-ha.”\n“I just want to watch you eat a bit more~ You look so good eating.”\n“Everything you make is delicious.”\n“What should we do today?”\n“Hmm? I’m going to Yujin’s house for a bit at lunchtime today. Didn’t I tell you?”\n“Oh, was that today? My bad. When will you be back home?”\n“I’ll be back before dinner.”\n“Okay, got it.”\nAfter eating the soup, Han-gyeol did the dishes.\nSeeing him getting ready to go out made me feel a bit sad.\nIt was the first time we’d be apart since we started living together.\nBut, if we’re going to college, we need to get used to this kind of time apart.\nIs there really no way to stay together every day?\n“Okay, Eun-ha. I’m off~”\n“Okay, be careful!”\n“Should I bring something delicious when I come back?”\n“Get whatever you want~ just a lot of it.”\n“Alright, alright~ I’m really going now.”\n“Okay~ have a good time~”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol left, I turned around and looked at the house.\nHmm- the house feels a bit empty without Han-gyeol.\nMaybe because we’ve been together so much lately, the emptiness hit me harder.\nI thought about taking a nap, but I wasn’t really sleepy.\n“Maybe I should clean?”\nI got out of bed, vacuumed, and wiped down the floors.\nI sorted the recycling and did the laundry, but only an hour and a half had passed.\nIf I’d known it would be like this, I would have cleaned slowly instead of rushing.\n“Hmmm... what should I do now? Maybe watch a movie.”\nI sat on the living room sofa and turned on a movie.\nI picked one that I’d heard of before, but it just didn’t catch my interest.\nAfter the beginning of the movie passed without grabbing my attention, I opened my laptop.\nHowever, since I don’t really use the internet much, I quickly closed it again.\nThrowing myself onto the bed, I stared at a picture of Han-gyeol on my phone.\nNo matter how I look at him, Han-gyeol is incredibly handsome.\nWhen he’s expressionless, he looks like a silent bear, and when he smiles brightly, he resembles a big puppy.\nHe’s such an attractive boyfriend.\nKind, gentle, cool, and even mature.\nJust looking at him naturally brings a smile to my face.\n“Ha- I want to touch Han-gyeol. And be touched by him.”\nBored even with my phone, I stared at the white ceiling.\nIn school, I only studied and didn’t have any particular hobbies.\n“Maybe I should find something to do when Han-gyeol’s not here...”\nIn the end, I decided to take a nap with my eyes closed.\nEven though I wasn’t very sleepy, napping seemed like the fastest way to pass the time until Han-gyeol returned.\n‘Sleep. Sleep. Sleep…’\n“Agh-”\nI eventually gave up and opened my eyes without falling asleep.\nI pondered what to do and then something suddenly came to mind.\n“Aaaah-! Han-gyeol’s birthday!”\nCome to think of it, my birthday is next week, and the week after that is Han-gyeol’s birthday!\nI quickly got out of bed, turned on my laptop again, and started searching.\nGift for boyfriend.\nBirthday gift for boyfriend.\nBest birthday gifts for boyfriends.\nTop gifts boyfriends want from girlfriends.\nI almost faced Han-gyeol’s birthday without any preparation.\nWhat should I get him? I gave him a wallet for Christmas, so that’s out.\nWhat would be good? First, I checked my bank account.\nHmm. Good.\nI still had quite a bit of money saved from working under my mom.\nI couldn’t touch my living expenses, so I decided to use this money for Han-gyeol’s gift.\nWhile scrolling through various options, I found something interesting.\n“Perfume...?”\nWith that, I could cuddle up to Han-gyeol every day and smell him...!\nIt would be nice if he wore the perfume I gifted him, even when I wasn’t around.\nNothing is as stimulating as a scent.\nA watch... would have been nice, but I didn’t have enough money for that.\nSo, I decided on perfume as Han-gyeol’s gift... but it felt like I was only giving him something materialistic.\nI wanted to do something more personal, as his girlfriend, along with the gift.\n“A birthday meal? That’s a given, so skip~”\nLying on the sofa, I started looking up things I could do for Han-gyeol.\nJust the thought of doing something for Han-gyeol made my boredom vanish completely.\n“Hmmm~ What would Han-gyeol like~?”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Living Together (6)\nI wanted to buy Eun-ha a ring as a birthday present, but I decided on a necklace instead, thinking we might get matching rings later.\nHowever, picking out a necklace was no easy task—there were countless designs, and I wasn’t sure if I could choose one that suited Eun-ha’s taste.\nI had never bought jewelry for a woman before, and I had never seen Eun-ha wearing a necklace, which made the decision even harder.\nAfter wandering around for a while, I narrowed it down to three options.\n“From what I see, these three seem the prettiest and most versatile. Which one is the best seller among them?”\n“For daily wear, the first one is the best choice. The design is simple, and the cubic zirconia isn’t too large, so it’s quite popular. I often recommend this to those who find flashy designs overwhelming.”\n“Can I pay for it now and pick it up over the weekend?”\n“Of course. I’ll have it ready for you.”\n“Great. See you then.”\nAfter completing the payment, I left the jewelry shop.\nI thought it would take at least four hours, but it only took two.\nI shouldn’t have said I’d be back right before dinner.\nI need to kill about two more hours before heading back...\nBut Eun-ha is sharp.\nWon’t she guess I went out to buy her a birthday present?\nI miss her... Should I just go back early?\nI wonder what she’s doing right now.\nShe might need some alone time, so should I wait a bit longer before going back?\nBut what if she’s been eagerly waiting for me the whole time?\nAlright. I’ll just say I finished early and head back.\nI’ll pick up something for dinner on the way.\n“Guess I’ll stop by the market.”\nVisiting the large supermarket alone felt strangely empty since I was used to coming here with Eun-ha.\nIt might be obvious, but Eun-ha and I really haven’t been apart for a single moment.\nFeeling a bit lonely, I realized how indispensable she had become in my daily life.\n“This is something Eun-ha likes.”\nI started filling the shopping cart with food for dinner.\nShe enjoyed the salmon dish I made last time, so maybe I’ll make it again.\nMaking sushi together could be fun too…\nI’ll save that for last.\n“Is this too much?”\nI missed Eun-ha so much that I ended up filling the cart with all her favorite foods.\nIt seemed like too much, so I put some items back.\nAfter putting the prepared salmon in the cart, I headed to the checkout.\nCarrying the shopping bag home made me feel very happy.\nHaving someone waiting for you at home is truly a joyful thing.\nI wondered what kind of expression she would greet me with.\nAs I started pressing the door lock code, I heard footsteps from inside.\nI entered the house after punching in the code, and there was Eun-ha, smiling brightly.\n“You’re back early! I missed you!”\nShe threw herself into my arms.\nI was overjoyed, but I couldn’t help but worry about how she would cope when I wasn’t around.\n“What were you doing?”\n“Hmm? Thinking about you, as always~”\n“You can’t just think about me all the time~”\n“My head is filled with thoughts of you, what can I do?”\nAt Eun-ha’s words, I gently patted her head.\n“Feels good...!”\nLike a cute kitten, she leaned in for more.\n“What’s in your hand?”\n“Oh- I bought some salmon to cook for you.”\n“Wow- really? That sounds delicious. Give it to me, I’ll put it in the fridge.”\n“Thanks~ I’ll just go wash my hands.”\n“Sure. Hurry back~”\nWhen I came out of the bathroom after washing my hands, Eun-ha was organizing the groceries.\nI helped her stack everything neatly in the refrigerator.\nAfter we finished, we just exchanged satisfied glances.\nEun-ha looked so adorable that I wanted to give her a quick kiss.\nShe slowly closed her eyes and leaned in, but then her eyes suddenly flew open.\n“No-!”\n“Ouch-!”\nEun-ha’s sudden movement made me bump my nose into her head.\n“Ow, that hurts.”\n“Oh no-! I’m sorry! Suddenly...?! Ahhh!!”\n“It’s okay, it’s not that ba-”\nSomething trickled from my nose.\nI looked down at what had dropped to the floor.\n“Whoa. A nosebleed.”\nI sat on the couch with tissues stuffed up my nose.\nEun-ha, who always insisted on sitting next to me, now sat on the floor looking distraught.\nIt wasn’t intentional, just an accident, but she seemed deeply upset about hurting me.\n“I’ll atone with my life...! Thank you for everything...”\n“That’s too much... It’s fine. The bleeding will stop soon.”\n“But it hurts, doesn’t it?! I’m so sorry...!”\nHonestly, the pain was already gone.\nWhat really bothered me was that Eun-ha had rejected my kiss for the first time.\nOf course, it’s not like she always has to accept my kisses, but... maybe... I’m bad at kissing?\nHave all our kisses been enjoyable only for me?\nHave I been completely insensitive to my girlfriend’s feelings?\n“Eun-ha... Can I ask you something? Please answer honestly.”\n“Of course-! Ask me anything!”\n“Do you... think I’m bad at kissing? Do you enjoy our kisses?”\n“Huh? Why... why would you think that?! Was my reaction weak or something?!”\n“No... it’s just that you rejected the kiss earlier. Never mind, forget I asked. It was silly.”\nIn hindsight, it was an unfair question. I felt guilty for putting her on the spot.\n“Let’s just cook the salmon di- whoa!”\nAs I tried to get up from the sofa, Eun-ha pushed me back down. She then sat on my lap, grabbed my face, and spoke confidently.\n“Kissing you is amazing! No, it’s beyond amazing! It’s like... my brain gets soaked in sweetness...?! I can’t describe it perfectly, but it’s incredibly sensual, it feels so good that my body relaxes, my heart races, and I want to touch you more and have you kiss me everywhere...! And... when we kiss, I don’t want to stop! I get so sexually excited that I... get wet... It’s so embarrassing and awkward, but I end up undressing you without realizing it! When you slowly put your hand inside my clothes and reach my chest, every cell in my body screams with pleasure!”\nEun-ha went on with a detailed explanation.\nEven so, her explanation didn’t quite resolve my confusion.\n“Then why did you reject the kiss earlier…?”\n“Well, that’s…!”\n“Please tell me. If you don’t, misunderstandings will pile up…”\nI was really worried about what Eun-ha might say.\nCould there be something I hadn’t noticed?\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Eun-ha slowly started to speak.\n“Because I don’t want you to lose any more weight!”\n“Huh?”\nHer unexpected response left me puzzled.\n“You see…we’ve been doing it a lot recently…? I enjoy those moments so much and want to do it anytime, but when we met Harim and Jang Yujin, they both said you seemed to have lost weight…! After thinking about it, I realized it might be because of our... activities... So, I thought we should cut down a bit…”\n“Can’t we just stop at kissing?”\nEun-ha shook her head vigorously at my suggestion.\n“No, we can’t!”\n“Why not?”\n“Well… once we start kissing, I naturally want to go further with you… I’m sure I won’t be able to resist.”\nFinally, her explanation made sense.\nI was relieved… it wasn’t that she didn’t like being intimate with me.\n“So that’s what it was… Thank goodness.”\n“I love all kinds of intimacy with you… holding hands, kissing on the cheek, passionate kisses… and sex, too.”\n“Well, it’s true that I’ve lost some weight recently, but there’s no need to reduce our intimacy—”\n“No way! Continuous weight loss could harm your health, so let’s refrain for now! I’ll do my best to resist! Until you’re back to your normal weight, I’ll be strong!”\nI didn’t want to resist… but since she was thinking of my well-being, I agreed.\n“Alright. I’ll make sure to get back to my normal weight as soon as possible.”\n“Yup, yup! And that means no kissing for a while.”\n“Okay. Holding hands and hugging are still fine?”\n“Yes… I can’t go without those.”\n“Then let’s conclude that and start cooking the salmon? Do you want sushi?”\n“Great~ Let’s make it together.”\n“I’ll handle the cleanup.”\n“Then I’ll set everything up.”\nFinally, Eun-ha detached herself from me and headed to the kitchen.\n“Han-gyeol~ Let’s not make all of it into sushi. Let’s grill some of the salmon too.”\n“Sure. I brought tartar sauce, so we can use that as well.”\n“Yay! I like that~”\nShe seemed relieved after talking, looking unexpectedly excited.\nBut Eun-ha practicing abstinence… can she really manage it?\nIt might be interesting, so I’ll try to hold back too.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Living Together (7)\nIt’s been three days of abstinence...\nBut maybe I shouldn’t have tried to restrain myself.\nAs time passed, it became incredibly hard to endure.\nThey say resolutions only last three days... and that’s exactly where I am now.\nI can’t take it anymore...\n“Eun-ha? Why are you staring at me while eating?”\n“...It’s nothing. How’s your weight? Has it come back?”\n“It hasn’t yet. Why~? Why do you ask?”\nHan-gyeol smiled brightly, seeming to enjoy the situation.\nBut I couldn’t go back on what I had said...\n“It’s nothing.”\nFeeling defeated, I bowed my head and picked at my food.\nAt this rate, I’m the one who’s going to lose weight... not that it’s a bad outcome.\n“I’ll clean up. You sit on the sofa, Eun-ha.”\n“Okay...”\n“Why does your voice sound so weak? Are you sick?”\n“I’m hungry...”\nI’m hungry for Han-gyeol.\n“Huh?”\n“It’s nothing.”\nHan-gyeol smiled and started cleaning up.\nI sat and looked out at the window, soaking in the sunlight.\n“Eun-ha, what are you doing staring out the window?”\n“Photosynthesizing...”\nThe sunlight is warm.\nIf I were a plant, would I not feel these desires?\nBut rather than warmth, I crave heat...\n“From behind, you look like a prisoner basking in the sun in solitary confinement.”\n“A prisoner, indeed...”\n“What’s your crime?”\nMy crime is probably... ‘suppressing the desire for human procreation.’\nSexual relations between a man and a woman are a noble act for human reproduction.\nIt felt like I was being punished for going against that natural order.\nNo human can escape nature’s law, and I was foolishly arrogant to think I could.\n“Arrogant, huh...?”\n“Really? Then keep photosynthesizing and reflect on it~”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol’s teasing made me turn my back on him.\nHe clattered around in the kitchen, doing the dishes.\nOf all people, he should understand why I’m acting this way, yet he seemed so carefree.\nCould it be that Han-gyeol doesn’t have much sexual desire? Maybe he believes in platonic love?\nNo way... that can’t be true. As his girlfriend, I’m certain of it.\nHe must be enjoying watching me hold back.\nBut Han-gyeol must be restraining himself too...!\nWait a minute. Han-gyeol can make the first move, right?\nAlright then.\nToday, I decided to seduce Han-gyeol.\nSince holding hands and hugging were allowed, I hugged him from behind.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah? Why?”\n“I just felt like hugging you.”\n“Finish the dishes, and I’ll hug you too~”\nAs I hugged him, wouldn’t Han-gyeol’s desire start to rise too?\nHmm! That seemed like a good idea, so I waited until he finished the dishes.\nMy heart began to race as Han-gyeol took off his rubber gloves.\nHe turned around slowly, embraced me, and stroked my hair.\nJust a bit more! One more step!\nI looked at Han-gyeol with eyes full of anticipation.\nI wanted him to read my mind and lead me to the bedroom.\n“Eun-ha, you look tired lately.”\n“Yeah! I’m really tired!”\nSo hurry to the bed-!\n“Want a hug?”\n“Yes! I’ll do whatever you want, Han-gyeol!”\n“Alright~”\nHan-gyeol picked me up and swung me over his shoulder.\nMy heart started pounding wildly.\nAs expected, my boyfriend is so strong!\nI felt incredibly happy.\n“Kyaa-”\nThrown onto the bed, I looked up at Han-gyeol.\nBut he gently covered me with a blanket and said,\n“If you’re tired, you should rest. Take a nap if you need to.”\n“Huh?”\n“You didn’t eat well either. I’ll watch TV in the living room so you can rest.”\n“Huh?”\nHan-gyeol said that and carefully distanced himself from me.\nEven though he knew exactly what I wanted, he pretended not to notice.\n“Eun-ha, why that face~? Do you have something to say?”\nSo, he’s not giving in, huh...?\nFine. I’ll endure to the end too.\nLet’s see who can hold out longer.\nI bit my lower lip lightly and said,\n“You don’t need to be that considerate~ haha.”\n“How can I not be? You’re my beloved girlfriend.”\n“Really~? It’s always nice to hear that~?”\n“I’m glad it makes you happy.”\nHe really enjoys teasing me.\nBut this time, I won’t back down.\nJust wait and see.\n***\nIt’s not exactly a cold war, but it feels like a battle of wills with Han-gyeol.\nI couldn’t keep falling into his pace, so I gave up on direct methods.\nI planned to use every trick to make him want it.\nAs night fell, I started getting ready for bed.\nI always take longer in the shower than Han-gyeol, so he goes first.\nAfter he entered the bathroom, I rummaged through the dresser and took out new pajamas.\n“It’s a bit of a stretch to call this pajamas...”\nI hid a spaghetti strap top and short dolphin shorts under my towel.\nReally... even though Han-gyeol wants it too, he’s playing hard to get.\nEven if he begs for it, today I absolutely, absolutely, absolutely won’t give in.\n“Wait, no? That would be a loss for me too?”\nAs I pondered what to do next, the bathroom door suddenly opened with a clunk.\n“Eun-ha, I’m done washing up.”\nHan-gyeol emerged with a towel around his neck.\nHa... It’s a sight I see every day, but Han-gyeol with wet hair is incredibly sexy.\nHe lifted his hair to apply lotion, and it suited him perfectly.\nWith his bangs down, Han-gyeol has a warm, inviting look.\nWith his bangs up, he exudes a certain decadence.\nEven though it’s a sight I see every day, my heart never stops racing.\n“Eun-ha? Aren’t you going to shower?”\n“Oh! Yes, I need to shower.”\nGet a grip.\nNow is not the time to be captivated by Han-gyeol.\nMy goal tonight is to capture him through a strategic approach.\nAfter a warm shower, I emerged wearing only the spaghetti strap top and dolphin shorts.\nI applied lotion and then slowly climbed into the bed where Han-gyeol was lying.\n“Eun-ha, you finished washing up pretty qui-!”\nAs soon as he saw me, Han-gyeol’s eyes widened.\nI lay down beside him, noting how his gaze wasn’t on my face.\n“Eun-ha...? Aren’t you cold?”\n“It’s warm because I always sleep hugging you. Why~?”\n“N-nothing.”\n“Yawn~ I’m sleepy.”\nAs usual, I snuggled into Han-gyeol’s arms.\nI placed my hand on his chest and pressed my body against his.\nNormally, Han-gyeol would hug me back, but tonight he hesitated.\nHis reaction amused me, so I acted even more playful than usual.\n“Han-gyeol, hug me~”\n“Uh?!”\n“We always sleep hugging each other, so hug me tonight too. Why? Can’t you?”\nHan-gyeol’s heart started racing wildly.\nI could feel his heartbeat through my hand, and it made me incredibly happy.\nHe enjoys teasing his loving girlfriend so much!\nFeeling mischievous, I stared intently at him.\n“Hug me~ quickly~”\nFlustered by my cuteness and whining, Han-gyeol didn’t know what to do.\nEventually, I hugged him even tighter.\nStartled, Han-gyeol finally met my gaze.\nHis face was flushed, and his Adam’s apple bobbed prominently.\n“Eun-ha, you...!”\n“Yes? Why?”\nI responded with a bright smile.\n“I... I can’t feel any underwear.”\n“Wearing it while sleeping is uncomfortable~”\n“So, right now...?!”\n“Yes, that’s right. I’m not wearing any.”\nHan-gyeol’s body turned rigid like a stone.\n“Oh, right! I just remembered I have something to do on my laptop. I’ll do it in the living room and sleep there!”\n“What?! Is it urgent?”\nI can tell he’s lying.\n“Yeah. It’s really urgent and difficult, so I’ll be up late. You go ahead and sleep first, Eun-ha.”\n“No way. I’ll lie here quietly with my eyes closed, so stay until I fall asleep. Okay? Don’t leave until I’m asleep.”\n“But it’s really urgent-!!”\nI carefully placed my leg over Han-gyeol’s.\n“Okay. Then hurry and help me sleep. I fall asleep quickly, so just stay like this for a bit. Please? Please? Can’t you? Really can’t?”\nAs I looked into Han-gyeol’s eyes, he swallowed hard once more.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes.”\n“I love you.”\n“I love you so much too, Eun-ha.”\n“Hehe. So, hurry and help me sleep~”\nAt this point, I expected him to lose control and kiss me passionately, but Han-gyeol was holding onto his sanity with great effort.\nHonestly, I wanted to share a deep kiss with him right now, but tonight I decided to watch him struggle with his desires.\nI love every bit of Han-gyeol—his embarrassment, his confusion, and his struggle to contain his desires.\nHe is truly so lovable.\nI feel like I’m going to have a very pleasant dream tonight.\nI hope Han-gyeol dreams of me too.\n“Goodnight, Han-gyeol.”\n“Y-yeah... Goodnight, Eun-ha.”\n“I love you~”\nI smiled contentedly and closed my eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Living Together (8)\nIn just one day, the situation completely turned around.\nHan-gyeol really wants it too but keeps teasing me instead-!\nEven though I wanted to kiss Han-gyeol right away, I was holding back, reflecting on what happened yesterday.\nEven while drinking coffee, Han-gyeol’s gaze kept drifting towards me.\nI guess this spaghetti strap outfit is more provocative than I thought. Does he like it?\nThen I should start wearing this to bed from now on.\n“Are you drinking coffee because you’re sleepy, Gyeol? Did you not sleep well last night?”\nLast night, I seduced Han-gyeol a lot in bed, so he ended up falling asleep late in the early morning.\nTo be honest, I thought Han-gyeol would give in right away, but he held out better than I expected.\nBut I was very curious about when that restrained desire would just burst out.\n“No, I slept well…”\n“Really? That’s a relief~”\nBecause Han-gyeol keeps teasing me,\nI felt like playing a little prank back on him.\nI was about to tease him a bit more when Han-gyeol spoke.\n“Eun-ha, let’s go on a date tomorrow.”\n“Huh? All of a sudden?”\n“It’s your birthday, and it feels a bit sad to just stay home. Let’s go on a date.”\n“You remembered my birthday? That’s enough to make me happy~”\nI propped my chin on the table and looked at Han-gyeol.\nI didn’t mean to, but my upper chest came up, and Han-gyeol quickly averted his gaze.\n“Of course, I’m your boyfriend…!”\n“Hehe~ Han-gyeol, you’re not meeting my eyes today?”\n“Ugh- Anyway, we’re going on a date tomorrow.”\n“Great! What are we going to do?”\n“It won’t be fun if I tell you now. You’ll find out tomorrow if you follow me.”\n“What~ It sounds really fun!”\n“Don’t get your hopes up too much.”\n“Then what should we do today? Huh? What do you want to do, Gyeol? What do you want to do right now~?”\nHan-gyeol should be giving in by now, but he just hurriedly avoided the situation.\nIt’s just as hard for me to hold back, but seeing Han-gyeol resist is so sexy.\nI feel like if I just poke him lightly, all the pent-up desire will come pouring out.\nHonestly… really honestly! It’s a bit of a perverted thought, but I’m a little curious about what Han-gyeol would be like if he couldn’t hold back his sexual desire.\nIt’s a terrible thought, but… seeing the unrestrained side of Han-gyeol might be incredibly… sexy.\nI was very curious to see how long he could hold out.\nAnd I’m at my limit too.\nI’m dying to do it.\n“Gyeol~”\nWhen I hugged him from behind, Han-gyeol’s body flinched.\nHe quietly continued washing the cup and answered.\n“What?”\nDespite trying to appear calm, his face was already turning red.\n“Just~ seeing your back makes me want to hug you.”\n“You can hug me all day long.”\n“Han-gyeol, look at me.”\n“I’m washing the cup.”\nAdvertisement\n“Just for a moment~ please? Please? Turn around and look at me, Gyeol~”\nAs I kept pestering, Han-gyeol finally turned to show his blushing face.\nSometimes he’s sexy, and other times he’s so cute…\nWhy is Han-gyeol so attractive?\n“Han-gyeol, your face is really red. Hehe.”\nI hugged him again.\nI could hear his pounding heartbeat and feel his warmth and… hardness.\nHuh?\nHardness?\n“…?!”\nI slowly lowered my head.\nI could see the shape of Han-gyeol’s erection straining against his clothes.\nStartled, I quickly stepped back, but Han-gyeol looked at me with wide eyes and said,\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Uh…! I mean…! It was an accident!”\n“Sorry. Accident or not, I can’t hold back anymore.”\n“What?! What do you mea—mmph! Mmmph…!”\nHan-gyeol pulled me back and covered my lips with his.\nThe Han-gyeol who always took his time to arouse me was gone, replaced by one who roughly pushed his tongue into my mouth.\nNo… not so suddenly…! If we kiss like this while I’m off guard… I’ll get wet right away.\nBut… it feels so good. Since it’s been a while, I got excited faster than usual.\n‘I’m getting wet…!’\nIn an instant, I was soaked, but there was one problem.\nI wasn’t wearing any underwear, and my dolphin shorts were quite loose… so my arousal started trickling down my thighs.\nAs I squeezed my legs together, Han-gyeol, who was stroking my thigh, noticed the wetness.\n“Eun-ha, you’re wet from just one kiss. That’s naughty.”\n“No…! It’s because I’m not wearing underwear…!”\n“Isn’t it because you’ve been having naughty thoughts?”\nHan-gyeol hit the mark right away.\nYes, to be honest, I had been wet since morning.\nAfter all, it wasn’t just Han-gyeol who had been holding back.\n“Let’s go to bed.”\nAdvertisement\n“Kyaa-!”\nHan-gyeol picked me up and carried me straight to the bedroom.\nThrowing me onto the bed, he couldn’t hold back and quickly took off his top.\nHis breathing was rough… his actions more intense than usual.\n“Eun-ha… just tell me. Should I stop?”\nHe always asks like this…\nEven though he knows exactly how I feel…\nBut I want to be honest with Han-gyeol.\n“Do whatever you want, Han-gyeol…! Huh-!”\n“Should I touch you? Say it with your mouth, Eun-ha.”\nHan-gyeol said as he touched my private area.\nI was so embarrassed, but my body was already heated up, dripping with arousal.\nI was ready to accept Han-gyeol at any moment.\nI couldn’t hold back anymore.\n“Touch me quickly… put it in, Han-gyeol… I can’t take it anymore… I can’t stand it, Gyeol…”\nAh- I said it.\n“Okay.”\nHan-gyeol answered shortly, then pulled off my pants and threw them behind him.\nI thought he would finally enter me, but instead, he buried his face between my legs.\nIn an instant, he began to pleasure my clitoris with his tongue.\n“Ahh-!!”\nI felt a scream welling up, so I covered my mouth with both hands.\nUnlike me, Han-gyeol continued to pleasure me with his face buried between my legs.\nWhat is this…!\nThis kind of stimulation was different from before, making my whole body tremble.\nEvery time his tongue licked my private parts and touched my clitoris, my brain was soaked in pleasure.\nIt’s so embarrassing…! But it feels so good…! I might get addicted to this…!\nBut… it’s not right…!\n“Gyeol…!! Not there… not there…! It’s dirty…!”\nIgnoring my words, Han-gyeol spread my thighs with his hands and pleasured me even more intensely.\nAdvertisement\nNo… he hasn’t even entered my body yet…! It’s just starting…!!\n“Ahhh-!! Ahh-!!”\nMy hips naturally lifted off the bed.\nI couldn’t think of anything; I could only writhe in pleasure.\nI let out moans that sounded like screams, panting like a pervert.\nIt feels too good. I think I’m going crazy.\nNo, I might already be crazy.\nI’m making lewd sounds in front of the person I love.\nThen Han-gyeol grabbed my waist that was floating in the air.\n“Eh…?”\n“I’m putting it in, Eun-ha.”\nAs soon as I saw Han-gyeol’s fully erect erection, I sensed danger.\nNot now… I’m still not over the climax yet…\nBut I couldn’t say no.\n“Ah…! Ahh…!!”\nWithout giving me time to resist, Han-gyeol entered deep inside me.\n“Ahh-! Ahh…! Gyeol…! Right now… if you move-!”\n“Sorry. I can’t stop now either. I love you.”\n“Ahh…!! Mmph-!”\nHan-gyeol kissed me on the lips and moved his hips roughly.\nEvery time he pushed inside me, I could only gasp for air.\nI don’t know anymore…! I don’t think I need to think about anything anymore.\n“Ah…! I love you… I love you, Eun-ha.”\nHan-gyeol’s rough breaths told me he was feeling good too.\nAh… it’s the first time I’ve seen Gyeol this excited…\nMoving his hips so vigorously… it’s so sexy.\nI want more… I want him to go deeper and harder.\n“Gyeol…! It feels so good…! So intense..! So deep…! Go deeper…! Do it harder…! Make me a mess…!”\nHan-gyeol seemed to get more excited at my words, gritting his teeth as he ravaged me.\nEvery time he hit and brushed against my most sensitive spot, my mind seemed to go blank.\nI had no thought of resisting the waves of pleasure crashing over me.\nInstead, I hugged Han-gyeol tighter and whispered in his ear.\n“Han-gyeol…! I’m coming again…! I’m coming again…!! Ahh-! I’m coming again-!”\nAdvertisement\nI clung to Han-gyeol’s back, wanting nothing but him.\nHan-gyeol kissed my mouth, passionately exploring inside.\n“Ahh…!”\n“Eun-ha…!”\nAs Han-gyeol’s penis swelled, my whole body began to tremble.\nI loved seeing Han-gyeol biting his lower lip, struggling to hold back.\n“Come inside…! Just like that…!”\nI wanted Han-gyeol to fill me completely.\nI wanted my body and heart to be entirely filled with him.\nI’m his… only his…!\n“Ahh-!”\nAs Han-gyeol released inside me, I was overwhelmed by a wave of pleasure.\n“Ahhh-!! Ahh…!!”\nI clung tightly to Han-gyeol’s back, trying to withstand the climax, but it was impossible.\nThe pleasure engulfed me, making my entire body tremble as if in convulsions.\n“I love you…”\nI wanted to say I love you too…\nI wanted to say I feel good…\nI wanted to say I’m happy…\nBut I couldn’t say anything.\nI could only gasp for breath, staring at Han-gyeol.\nI hope he understands through my eyes…\nView Image\nHan-gyeol looked down at me, breathing heavily.\nThen he reached into the bedside table and pulled out another condom.\n“I want to do it again.”\nIf we go again, I might really break.\nBut if it’s Han-gyeol, the one I love, who is breaking me…\nI’ll gladly give myself to him.",

      "content": "I’ve lost count of how many times I did it with Han-gyeol.\nWas it about three times…?\nIf we count the number of times we reached the climax, it was much more.\nHan-gyeol seemed to have been holding back a lot; he kept wanting me without tiring.\nAnd I accepted all of Han-gyeol without any hesitation.\nIt didn’t stop there; even while washing up in the bathroom, we had sex.\nBecause of that, when we came out of the bathroom and lay back in bed, we were completely drained.\nLying exhausted on the bed, I stared intently at Han-gyeol’s face.\nThe way he looked at me with such loving eyes was incredibly captivating.\nIf I kept looking, I might just get sucked in.“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah, Eun-ha?”\n“I really like you so much. What should I do? I really, really like you.”\nAt my confession, Han-gyeol smiled and gently hugged me.\nI wanted to stay in his warm embrace forever.\nI wished time could stop like this.\nNow, I can’t even imagine a life without Han-gyeol.\nIt feels like he has become my entire life, and I keep looking at him.\nIn the end, I couldn’t resist and gave Han-gyeol a quick kiss on the cheek.\n“Do it on the other cheek too.”\n“Okay!”\nI promptly kissed his other cheek as he requested.\nBut I couldn’t stop there and ended up covering his face with kisses.\nI really, really like him more than anything in the world.\n“I wish we could just stay together like this all the time without having to go back to study.”\n“There are fun things at college too.”\n“Not as fun as being with you, of course.”\n“That’s true, but we still have to make the most of our college life~”\nHan-gyeol is a diligent person, so he’ll study hard at university.\nBut I want to just take it easy in college and spend my days like this with him, cuddling every day.\nCooking breakfast for each other, helping with the cleanup, and occasionally spending these passionate nights together—that would be perfect.\nOh, how wonderful it would be to always be with Han-gyeol like this.\n“Hey, Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“We can’t always stay together like this, can we?”\n“Why are you asking that all of a sudden?”\n“It’s a bit sudden, but I really don’t want to be apart from you even for a moment. When college starts, and later when you go to the military, and when we start working, it feels like we won’t be able to spend as much time together as we do now.”\n“That’s a realistic point. We probably won’t be able to stay like this forever. Right now, our parents support us with rent and living expenses, but later on, we’ll have to take responsibility for that ourselves.”\n“Yeah, I figured. It’s disappointing to think about it.”\n“Can I ask an embarrassing question? Do you really like me that much?”\n“Of course I do!”\nI sat up abruptly in bed.\n“It’s really hard to explain how much I like you, Han-gyeol…! I really, really like you… to the point where even I think it’s a bit excessive. That’s why I keep acting like this. I don’t want to be apart from you even for a moment; I can’t live without you.”\nAs I rambled on, Han-gyeol chuckled and pulled me into his arms.\nHe held me tightly and whispered in my ear.\n“Then I’ll have to cherish you even more so that we won’t have any regrets later.”\n“You already cherish me enough…”\n“Isn’t it still not enough? If I cherish you even more now, we won’t miss each other as much when we have less time together later.”\n“But I don’t want to burden you. This is my selfish desire, so you don’t have to push yourself.”\nHan-gyeol paused for a moment after hearing my words and then spoke.\n“Wow, you think the same as I do?”\n“Huh? What do you mean by that?”\n“Well, I’ve been holding back some things because I didn’t want to burden you.”\n“What?! Why? There’s no need to hold back!”\nI looked at Han-gyeol in surprise.\n“Because you always say you’re already getting enough love? I didn’t want to overwhelm you by giving too much.”\n“N-no! It’s not overwhelming at all! When I say it’s enough, I mean it’s perfect, not that you should stop!”\n“Really? Then from now on, I’ll just show you even more love without holding back.”\nHan-gyeol’s words made me realize once again how important it is to communicate honestly.\nEven if we say the same words, they can be interpreted differently by the other person.\nClearly expressing our intentions... seems to be the best way.\n“So, can I tell you what I want too?”\n“Of course. Why? Do you have something you want from me?”\nI hadn’t planned on saying it, and I wasn’t sure if my feelings were right, but today I became certain.\n“When Han-gyeol touches me, I can really feel his love.”\n“Hm?”\n“When you look at me lovingly, when you pat my head like I’m cute, and when you compliment me, I feel loved. But what I love most is when you touch me. So... I want you to want me more.”\nHan-gyeol listened to my words intently.\n“Like today... I want you to want me intensely...! Hug me and kiss me a lot... And I like it when you desire me roughly like today...! I want you to touch me more! More than now! Anytime! And if possible, passionately!”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, Han-gyeol gently swept my hair behind my ear.\n“Anytime?”\n“Yes, anytime.”\n“No matter when?”\n“Yes, whenever you want.”\n“Your body won’t last.”\n“It’s okay. I’ll make sure not to worry you.”\n“Alright. I’ll touch you every day from now on. Passionately!”\n“Hehe, I love that!”\nI smiled happily and gave Han-gyeol a kiss on the cheek.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Why are you calling me?”\n“Thank you for coming into my life.”\n“Thank you too. For making me happy.”\nWe pressed our foreheads together and smiled brightly.\nJust looking at each other made us smile.\nFrom now on, we decided to love each other more generously.\n***\nHan-gyeol and I had satisfied all our pent-up desires yesterday.\nBut perhaps we were too tired; even the loud alarm couldn’t wake us up.\nIt wasn’t until Han-gyeol kissed my forehead that I woke up with a grin and eventually got out of bed.\nI hurried to the kitchen when I smelled a fragrant aroma filling the house.\n“You’re finally awake. Happy birthday, Eun-ha.”\n“Wow-! What is all this?! A birthday feast?!”\nIn front of me was a birthday feast that Han-gyeol had prepared.\nI was stunned to see seaweed soup, japchae, and even galbijjim.\n“Did Han-gyeol do all of this?”\n“Well... the galbijjim was hard. That’s a meal kit.”\n“Oh, come on~ This is amazing.”\nI ran over to Han-gyeol, who was wearing an apron, and hugged him tightly.\nUsually, he would hug me back firmly, but today he lifted me up into the air and spun me around in circles.\nThen, he planted a deep kiss on my cheek.\n“Hehe. It feels so good to get a kiss too. I should have asked for more affection sooner!”\n“You really like it~ Your smile is as wide as your ears.”\n“I’m so happy! Don’t ever hold back again! Got it?!”\n“Then Eun-ha, you have to do it too. Here-“\n“Okay! I’ll do it too.”\nWhen Han-gyeol offered his cheek, I eagerly bit it and didn’t let go.\n“Ah- I’m getting eaten.”\n“Mmm-“\n“Alright, let go and let’s eat the birthday meal first. I hope it tastes good.”\n“I want to eat Han-gyeol first~”\nAfter clinging to Han-gyeol’s cheek for a while, he led me to my seat.\nSeeing Han-gyeol serving me warm seaweed soup was incredibly endearing.\n“Okay, Han-gyeol. Sing the birthday song quickly.”\n“I was wondering when to do that. Should I do it in the morning? I planned to have the cake in the evening.”\n“Do it now and again later! I want to hear it now too.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol slowly began to sing the birthday song.\n“Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~”\nHearing Han-gyeol’s voice always lifts my spirits.\nEven though he was shy, he sang the entire birthday song to me.\nWhy does my boyfriend in front of me keep making me feel so dazed?\nWhy does just looking at him make me feel like I’ve got the whole world?\n“Happy birthday, dear Eun-ha~”\nAfter finishing the birthday song, Han-gyeol silently looked at me.\n“Happy birthday, Eun-ha.”\n“Thanks! Now, let’s eat the food Han-gyeol prepared.”\nI smiled brightly and took a spoonful of seaweed soup.\nAs soon as I tasted the deeply flavorful soup, a natural smile spread across my face.\n“How is it?”\n“It’s the best in the world!”\n“What’s that~!”\n“Seriously, it’s the best in the world~”\nMy first birthday in my twenties started off so well.\nI think it’s going to be a wonderful day.\n“Eun-ha, you look even brighter today.”\n“It’s all thanks to Han-gyeol~”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After finishing the birthday meal, Eun-ha hurriedly got ready for their date.\nShe insisted that she wanted to show off once she was completely dressed and told me not to enter the room under any circumstances.\n“Eun-ha, are you ready?”\nAs soon as I spoke, Eun-ha burst out of the room.\nShe beamed at me, twirling once to show off her outfit.\n“How do I look, Han-gyeol?”\n“You look stunning.”\n“And you look handsome too. Come on, let’s head out!”\n“Why are you so excited? Calm down a bit.”\n“I’m just happy to go on a date with you after so long!”“Alright, let’s do everything you want today.”\nThe moment we stepped out the front door, Eun-ha immediately grabbed my hand tightly.\nLooking at her face, I saw her smiling brightly.\n“Why are you holding my hand so tightly today?”\n“Because I don’t want to let go~ Where should we go first? Food? Coffee? Or maybe a kiss in a nice place?! No, we should kiss right now~”\nEun-ha let go of my hand, wrapped her arms around my neck, and pressed her lips to mine.\nI thought it would end with a brief peck, but she quickly slipped her tongue into my mouth.\nStanding on tiptoes, we shared a long, deep kiss before she gently placed her feet back on the ground.\n“You’re being very forward with the skinship.”\n“It’s all because of you, Han-gyeol. You made me this way~ So you have to take responsibility, got it?”\n“Okay, I’ll take responsibility for the rest of my life, but can we leave the building now?”\n“Oh, it looks like my lipstick’s a bit smudged. Let me reapply it. Just a moment.”\nEun-ha took a lip balm from her handbag and applied it to her lips.\n“Han-gyeol, you should put on some lip balm too. Can you bend down a bit?”\n“Ah, thanks.”\nWhen I bent down, Eun-ha pressed her lips to mine again. The sound of a quick kiss echoed as she smiled shyly.\n“Weren’t you going to use the lip balm?”\n“Isn’t a kiss better than lip balm?”\n“You’re right.”\n“See? Next time, I’ll put it on you like this too.”\n“Then the lip balm won’t last long.”\n“We can always buy more~ Let’s go.”\nEun-ha led me out of the building. The weather was sunny, promising a fun day ahead.\nSince it was Eun-ha’s birthday, I wanted to have a different kind of date.\nWe had breakfast late, so we headed to a book cafe where we originally planned to have lunch.\nHonestly, it was my first time at such a quiet and serene book cafe. As soon as we entered the antique bookstore, the soft lighting filled the cafe.\nThere were many people on dates like us, and we ordered Americanos before finding a seat.\n“Shall we pick out a book too?”\n“Sure, let’s take a look.”\nStanding side by side with Eun-ha in front of the bookshelf, I pondered over which book to read.\nSuddenly, Eun-ha smiled as if she remembered something.\n“Why are you smiling all of a sudden?”\n“Just remembering the day we first met at the library.”\n“You remember that day? Honestly, it’s a bit hazy for me.”\n“Yes, it’s strange. I remember everything that happened with you.”\n“Then, do you remember which book I wanted to read?”\n“The Little Prince.”\n“Wow, no hesitation at all.”\nEun-ha tilted her head slightly and asked,\n“Do you remember everything about me, too?”\n“I remember all the basic things.”\n“Then I’ll quiz you. Han-gyeol, you gave me a stuffed toy once, do you remember which one it was?”\n“The blue turtle.”\n“Wow, you got it right immediately.”\n“Yeah, I didn’t think I’d remember so quickly either.”\n“Huh, that makes me happy. Alright, let’s pick out a book. What should we choose... Oh, that one looks interesting.”\nEun-ha reached up to a high shelf but couldn’t quite reach.\nWhen I stretched my arm behind her to get it, she flinched in surprise and turned around.\nAfter glancing around, she hugged me gently.\n“You helped me get a book like this back then too.”\n“You really remember everything.”\n“Yes. I love you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Me too~ So, should we go read this? Is this the one?”\nI pulled the book out and checked the title. “Psychological Tests for Couples?”\n“Yes, yes. I want to understand everything about you, Han-gyeol~”\n“Sounds fun. Let’s do it.”\n“Great~”\nAs soon as we opened the book, it was about types of love.\nIt classified love into six types through various questions, but it seemed too complicated to test with just the book.\nEun-ha quickly turned on her phone, searched, and sent me a link via message.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s do this one.”\n“It won’t take long, right?”\n“Yes, it says around five minutes.”\n“Alright. You go ahead too, Eun-ha.”\n“Okay, okay.”\nSince it was a Yes or No psychological test, it didn’t take long.\nAfter about three minutes, both Eun-ha and I finished and checked our results.\nMine came out as the “Mania” type. The interpretation was somewhat... a bit alarming.\n‘Type that has a strong possessiveness and obsession with their loved one.’\nWhat the...? It’s so accurate it’s creepy.\n“Han-gyeol, what did you get?”\n“Can you tell me yours first?”\nEun-ha shook her head.\n“Then let’s show each other at the same time.”\n“Okay. One... two... three!”\nWe exchanged phones and immediately checked the results. As soon as we saw the screens, we exchanged glances.\n“You’re a Mania type too, Han-gyeol?”\n“And so are you, Eun-ha.”\nWe silently looked into each other’s eyes before bursting into laughter simultaneously.\nAfter turning away and laughing, we exchanged phones again.\n“Do you really want to possess me, Han-gyeol? Really?”\n“I tried not to show it, but honestly, yes. How about you, Eun-ha?”\n“Yes. If I could have you, Han-gyeol, I’d do anything.”\nEun-ha nodded, sipping her coffee.\n“We’re a perfect match.”\n“Right? I think so too. And while I want to possess you, I also want to be possessed by you.”\n“Just like it says in the book. Honestly, I feel the same way. It feels like being loved, doesn’t it?”\n“Exactly. When you want me, I feel loved and it makes me happy.”\nEun-ha’s bright smile was incredibly cute.\n“Sometimes, I even dream about tearing apart girls who flirt with you. Do you feel the same, Han-gyeol?”\nEun-ha spoke cheerfully, but my expression hardened.\nIt seemed... Eun-ha’s possessiveness might be stronger than mine.\n“Am I the only one feeling this way?”\n“Yes. But remember, murder is bad.”\n“But they touched you, Han-gyeol. It’s only natural to cut them out, right?”\n“I-is that so?”\n“If someone touches me, what would you do, Han-gyeol?”\n“Well... just a regular dismemberment?”\n“That’s not regular at all... We’re just the same.”\nEun-ha said this, oddly delighted.\nRight. Every couple has their own way of expressing love.\n“Own me forever, okay?”\n“Of course.”\nIt’s fun.\n****\nAfter visiting the book cafe, eating at a good restaurant, and watching a musical, the sun had set.\n“Eun-ha, should we go have dinner now?”\n“Hmm? Did you make a reservation for dinner too?”\n“I checked a few places, but they don’t take reservations.”\n“Then let’s take a walk in the park and have dinner at home.”\n“Okay... But we need to pick up the cake on the way.”\n“Great~”\nEun-ha grabbed my hand and headed straight for the park.\n“Han-gyeol, today was so much fun.”\n“Really? I’m glad you enjoyed it.”\n“Yes, yes. I love talking with you, eating delicious food with you, and seeing the same things as you. Everything is wonderful when you’re by my side. It’s amazing. When I hold your hand, the whole world turns pink.”\nEun-ha looked up at me and said,\n“Han-gyeol, I love you. Thank you for making today so enjoyable.”\n“I love you too.”\nOriginally, I planned to give it to her after dinner, in a more romantic setting... But giving it in a quiet park wouldn’t be bad either.\nI discreetly took out the necklace from my pocket.\n“Shall we sit on that bench? My feet are tired.”\n“Ah! We did walk a lot today. Let’s go there.”\nAs soon as Eun-ha moved ahead to the nearby bench, I hugged her from behind.\n“You can’t sit if you’re holding me like this, Han-gyeol~”\n“Happy birthday, Eun-ha.”\nI gently put the necklace around her neck. Realizing the necklace touched her skin, Eun-ha turned around in surprise.\n“T-this...!”\n“It’s your birthday present. We’ll get matching rings later.”\n“W-when did you pick this? Didn’t you have no time to prepare?”\n“I lied about meeting Yujin last time. I went to pick this necklace instead. Sorry for lying.”\n“No! You did it to surprise me. Wow... it’s so beautiful! It’s so gorgeous, Han-gyeol!”\nEun-ha jumped up and down in my arms.\n“I love it. I love you so much, Han-gyeol...!”\n“I’m glad you like it. I thought a lot about it.”\n“I’m the happiest in the world...! Huh...! I love it so much-!”\nEun-ha lifted her head slightly, tears streaming down her cheeks like chicken droppings.\n“Hey, why are you crying on such a good day?”\n“I’m just so happy...! I’m so moved that I’m crying! Huuu...”\n“Eun-ha, you’re cute even when you cry.”\n“I love you. I really love you, Han-gyeol. I truly, truly love you. I love you more than anything in the world, more than my life! Thank you... I didn’t expect such a big gift...! I’m so happy. I feel like I’m going to die from happiness...! I could die right now without any regrets...!”\nI gently wiped away Eun-ha’s tears as she cried happily.\n“Don’t die. You have to live with me.”\n“Yes...! I’ll live with you, Han-gyeol... I’ll have lots of kids with you and live happily...!!”\n“Of course~ Shall we head home now?”\n“Kiss me...! Kiss me now, Han-gyeol. Right now... kiss me...”\n“We can’t do that here in public~ I’ll kiss you at home.”\n“Then... let’s go quickly!!”\nEun-ha immediately grabbed my hand and hailed a taxi.\nEven in the taxi, she kept touching the necklace and smiling.\nAfter getting off, we picked up the birthday cake from a nearby bakery and headed home.\nAs soon as we got home, Eun-ha tried to kiss me.\n“Now... let’s kiss... hurry and kiss me? Hurry...! Kiss me now...”\n“You’re in such a rush. Let’s blow out the candles on the cake first—”\n“Okay! Got it!!”\nWithout even taking off her jacket, Eun-ha quickly set up a table in the living room.\nDespite the darkness, she found the table and set it up. Does she have night vision like a predator?\n“Come on, hurry! Let’s blow out the candles and kiss!”\nIt felt like completing a quest. But since it’s her birthday, I should do everything she wants.\nI placed the cake on the table and lit the candles.\n“Alright then—! Blow them out!”\n“Wait a second! Didn’t you want me to sing the birthday song at dinner?”\n“Ugh...! Let’s skip that part!”\n“Nope. Morning Eun-ha wanted it.”\n“Tch... then sing it quickly!”\nI stopped her from blowing out the candles immediately and sang the birthday song.\n“Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday dear Eun-ha~ Happy birthday to you~!”\nAs soon as Eun-ha blew out the candles with a puff, the house went dark again.\nAs I stood up to turn on the lights, Eun-ha smeared whipped cream on my lips.\n“Eun-ha, usually the birthday person gets the whipped cream on their face—mmph!”\nIn the dark, Eun-ha didn’t just smear whipped cream on my lips; she immediately kissed me, her lips pressing against mine.\nTasting the sweet whipped cream, she pushed me onto the living room floor, holding my head as she continued the sticky, deep kiss.\n“Han-gyeol... I can’t hold back anymore. I want to kiss you more... I want to be closer to you...! I love you...!”\nEun-ha climbed on top of me, kissing me fiercely, her tongue exploring my mouth.\nLooks like we’ll have to save the cake for tomorrow.\n[BONUS] Chapter 108.5: Album\nMy phone gallery was filled with pictures of Han-gyeol and me.\nFrom the cherry blossom festival to photos of Han-gyeol wearing an apron.\nThere were also many photo booth pictures taken during our dates.\nFor that reason, I decided to select a few and print them out to put in a separate album.\nI even bought a pretty album from a shopping mall.\n“Han-gyeol, let’s make an album.”\n“Huh? What album?”\n“We take a lot of pictures, right? It’s nice to have them saved on the phone, but I thought it would be good to choose a few and make an album. Later, we can quickly look back at how we dated!”\nIt was the weekend, so we had plenty of time.\nWe had lunch and finished all the housework, so we could comfortably spend time together.\n“Sounds good. Should we do it now since we’re talking about it?”\n“Yes, yes! I love it! Let’s start by selecting the pictures on the phone! Lie down here, Han-gyeol.”\n“Don’t we have over a thousand pictures?”\n“Probably around that many.”\nHan-gyeol and I lay side by side and began sorting through the pictures for the album.\n“We must include the ones from the cherry blossom festival.”\n“Yes, yes! I was planning to. Ah-! This one is pretty too.”\n“Don’t I look a bit funny in that one?”\n“You look handsome! Shall we include this one?!”\n“Sure.”\nWe swiped through the phone screen, gathering the photos for printing into a separate folder.\n“Eun-ha, let’s include this one too.”\n“What-?! I look so silly in that one!”\n“You just look cute.”\n“Well, if you think it’s cute, then okay!”\nAfter a long time of looking at the phone screen, we put the phone down and opened the drawer.\n“There are so many···”\n“Right? We took pictures every time we went on a date, so it’s natural.”\nHolding the numerous photo booth pictures, we lay back down on the bed.\n“Are we going to put all of them in the album?”\n“Hmm···that’s a bit much, right? Let’s just pick the good ones and put them in. Which pictures do you like, Han-gyeol?”\n“This one where I’m giving you an orange-flavored candy.”\n“Alright~ Then I choose this one! The one where we’re making a heart!”\n“This one is good too. We’re both looking at each other instead of the camera.”\n“Isn’t that interesting~? We didn’t even plan that pose. It’s fascinating~”\n“What else should we include?”\n“Let’s take a look.”\nHan-gyeol and I went through the photo booth pictures one by one, looking for the ones we liked.\nThen, we came across a picture that really stood out and picked it up immediately.\n“Let’s use this one! I really want to include it!”\nIt was a picture where Han-gyeol looked very embarrassed, revealing a kiss mark on his neck.\n“It’s a bit embarrassing···do you really like leaving kiss marks on my neck that much, Eun-ha?”\n“Of course! I like it because it feels like I’m marking you as mine!”\n“Well, if you like it, I don’t mind.”\n“Hehe… then I’ll include it. There aren’t many pictures where you look embarrassed!”\n“Alright, let’s include this one too.”\nWe carefully inserted the selected photo booth pictures into the album.\n“Why do they look even prettier in the album?”\n“Right? They turned out really well.”\nWe smiled proudly at the pictures of us in the album.\n“We should add our wedding photos later~”\n“I’m really looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress, Eun-ha.”\nAt Han-gyeol’s words, I slowly wrapped my arms around his neck.\n“If you want, I can show you sooner~?”\n“I’ll propose properly later.”\n“I might beat you to it.”\nHan-gyeol chuckled and moved closer to me.\n“Give me a chance too. I won’t take too long.”\n“Okay! I love you, Gyeol.”\n“I love you too.”\nI wonder what we’ll be doing when this album is full.\nIt feels like the emotions of today will stay with us even when we open the album in the distant future.\nI’m happy.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Living with Han-gyeol, I've come to learn a few more things about him.\nOne of the easiest things to notice was, surprisingly, Han-gyeol is not a morning person.\nIf the alarm clock goes off, he wakes up immediately, but if he doesn't hear it, he sleeps like a log.\nAt first, I thought he would wake up after thirty more minutes of sleep, but even after an hour, he didn't open his eyes.\nToday, I wanted him to sleep well, so I turned off the alarm clock and headed to the kitchen.\nAfter putting on the apron hanging on the fridge, I immediately started preparing breakfast.\nHan-gyeol always eats breakfast, so after cooking the rice, I went straight to making stew.\nI added plenty of tofu, which he likes, and also put in the beef brisket I bought from the market.\nOnce it started to bubble, I scooped the rice and took out the side dishes.\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c3c5604b327003ff9c2e2\", id: \"pf-4630-1\"})\nI thought about waking Han-gyeol, who was still sleeping soundly in the room, but I wanted him to sleep a bit longer.I dragged a chair next to the bed and sat down, staring at Han-gyeol as he slept.\nAt moments like these, there's a constant battle between the moral sense that says not to pounce on a sleeping person and the desire to just give in and do it.\nAs if sensing my gaze even in his sleep, Han-gyeol carefully opened his eyes. He immediately confirmed it was me and murmured in a deeply sleepy voice.\n“Angel...”\nIt seems he's not fully awake yet.\n“Did you sleep well? Hurry and eat breakfast.”\n“Already? Gosh- I didn't hear the alarm.”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol checked the alarm clock on the bedside table, he jumped up.\n“I turned it off so you could sleep comfortably. Come on, let's eat.”\n“Since I overslept anyway, let's lie down for just ten more minutes.”\n“No. The stew will get cold. Get up now- kyaak!”\nHan-gyeol immediately grabbed my arm and pulled me down.\nHe hugged me tightly and didn't let go.\n“Just ten more minutes...”\n“Alright...”\nSometimes he can be so forceful.\nMy heart started pounding like crazy from the morning.\nI love the gentle and kind Han-gyeol, but I also like this rough side of him.\nI hope he hugs me this tightly on his birthday tomorrow too... Like a bad boy... It's so incredibly sexy.\n“Han-gyeol. It's been ten minutes. Get up now.”\n“I guess I have no choice. Let's go eat breakfast.”\n“Yes, yes. Let's hurry up. The stew will get cold.”\nWe held hands as we left the bedroom and had breakfast.\nHan-gyeol enjoyed the breakfast I made for him.\nI wonder if Han-gyeol knows that his lips curl up a bit every time he eats something delicious.\nWhen we live together, I start to notice little habits unique to Han-gyeol that only I can see.\nI love that. It's something even Han-gyeol doesn't know about himself, and only I do.\nIt makes me feel possessive, and I feel satisfied.\n“Is it good?”\n“Yes. It's really delicious. Your cooking skills have improved over time.”\n“Really? Maybe it's because I added more MSG than usual~?”\n“No, it's because you made it~”\nHe always says the nicest things and never criticizes.\n“Han-gyeol, is there anything inconvenient about living with me?”\n“No. Not at all. I think it's really great that we live together.”\n“Come on~ There has to be at least one thing, right? Tell me~ I won't get mad~”\n“Isn't this one of those typical trap questions?”\n“You're not falling for it~”\nHaving such a pleasant morning is all thanks to Han-gyeol. I love seeing his sleepy face and starting the day with a conversation.\n“Is there anything that bothers you, Eun-ha?”\n“Yes, there is one thing.”\nHan-gyeol's spoon dropped from his hand.\n“What is it... Tell me. I'll fix it.”\n“I like you so much that I always want to see you. Even when you're next to me, I want to see you, and I want to scrunch you up and carry you in my pocket.”\n“If you hadn't said that last part, it would have been very romantic.”\n“The problem is that I like you more and more every day.”\n“I feel the same way. Though, I don't want to scrunch you up.”\n“Hehe. Oh- I'm planning to go home for a bit today.”\n“Why?”\nI had a gift for Han-gyeol sent to my parents' house. A perfume, and an outfit for tomorrow night...!\n“I want to bring back some more clothes before the semester starts.”\n“I'll go with you. I can help carry things.”\n“Oh- Th-there's no need for that!”\n“Why? Are you meeting someone?”\n“Yes! I'm meeting with Hyun-joo Unnie for a bit.”\nSorry, Hyun-joo unnie.\n“Well... If you say so. Call me if you have a lot of stuff to carry, okay?”\n“Sure! Don't worry.”\nI felt a bit guilty about lying, but it couldn't be helped.\nAfter breakfast, I headed straight home.\nI couldn't risk someone at home finding the package.\n****\nAs soon as I arrived home early in the morning, my brother, who was lying on the sofa, greeted me.\n“Huh? What brings you home?”\n“I need to grab a few things.”\nRecently, my brother has been living alone, so I thought the house would be quite messy, but it was cleaner than expected.\nIt seemed he was taking out the trash regularly and vacuuming every day.\nWhat the heck? He's doing better than I thought?\n“What have you been up to lately?”\n“Well, I'm about to return to college too. Please, show some interest in your brother.”\n“You've had plenty of time to play around. Anyway, no packages arrived, right?”\n“Packages? No, none.”\n“That's good then.”\nI went into my room and started packing the clothes I was going to take home.\nSince it was just a formality, I didn't pack much and quickly returned to the living room.\nMy brother, lying on the sofa watching TV, spoke up.\n“How is it living with Han-gyeol?”\n“It's great. Every day is fun.”\n“Hey, you should contact Hyun-joo once in a while. She sometimes asks about you.”\n“Huh? She does? Why doesn't she contact me?”\nwindow.yaContextCb=window.yaContextCb||[] window.yaContextCb.push(()=>{\n Ya.Context.AdvManager.render({\n renderTo: 'yandex_rtb_R-A-2282848-6',\n blockId: 'R-A-2282848-6'\n })\n}) “I guess she's hoping you'll reach out first.”\n“Oh, now that I think about it, I haven't contacted her since I moved in with Han-gyeol.”\n“Meet up with her if you get the chance.”\n“Yeah, I should.”\nI immediately called my unnie. I wasn't sure if she'd pick up since it was morning, but I soon heard her voice.\n\"Hello?\"\n“Unnie-! What are you doing today?”\n“I'm free today. Why?”\n“I called because I miss you~ I'm at home now, where are you?”\n“Oh really? How about we have lunch together?”\n“Sounds good! But I have a package coming, so I might be a bit late. Is that okay?”\n“I'll come to you then. I'll be there soon, so wait for me~”\n“Okay!”\nAfter hanging up, I told my brother that unnie was coming over.\n“She’s coming over.”\n“What? Why not meet outside instead of bringing her here?”\n“We'll be leaving soon, don't worry.”\n****\n“Thank you~”\nThankfully, the package arrived just past noon.\nI quickly put the package in my bag and closed it.\nIt would be embarrassing if unnie or brother saw it…!\nShortly after, unnie arrived.\n“Eun-ha~ I'm here.”\n“Unnie~ It's been a while.”\nAs soon as she saw my face, her eyes widened.\n“Eun-ha, you've gotten so pretty since the last time I saw you. Is it thanks to Han-gyeol?”\n“Yes, yes! I guess it's because I'm living with Han-gyeol. You look great too, Unnie.”\n“Thanks~ Did the package arrive?”\n“Yes, it did. We can go out for lunch now.”\n“Hey, Shin Eunwoo. Are you coming with us?”\n“No, I'll stay home and rest. You two have fun~”\n“Alright~”\nI packed my things and headed to a nearby restaurant with Unnie.\nAfter we ordered, she looked at me with a curious expression.\n“Eun-ha, how is it living together?”\n“Huh…?!”\n“I haven’t lived with anyone yet. I’m curious about what it’s like.”\n“Oh, it's really great. I get to be with Han-gyeol every day...!”\nI answered, but it seemed that wasn’t what she was curious about.\nShe leaned in close and whispered.\n“Are you using protection...?”\nUnnie’s words made my ears turn red instantly. But living together... it was hard to pretend that nothing had happened.\nI gave a slight nod.\n“Alright. You must always use protection, okay?”\n“Y-yeah...! So please, shush-!”\n“Good. This is something you must never forget, no matter what. Although, with Han-gyeol, I'm not too worried.”\n“Right?! Yes, Han-gyeol is very considerate.”\n“If there’s an issue, it’s probably on your end, Eun-ha.”\n“Ugh...!”\nShe hit the nail on the head. Am I that easy to read?\n“You’re not skipping protection because you think it’s a safe day, are you...?!”\nMy heart started pounding for a different reason.\n“N-no! That’s never happened...!”\n“Hmm... I’m suspicious...!”\n“Don’t worry...!”\nI need to be more careful from now on. No more lies to Unnie.\n“I should have told you sooner, but the opportunity never came up. You do realize you’re still too young to get married, right?”\n“Well... if we're going to do it eventually, maybe sooner is better...!”\n“I’m not against marriage. But rushing into it isn’t wise. Remember that. Got it?!”\n“Yes...”\nIn the end, I received a thorough sex education from Unnie during our meal. The main takeaway was never having unprotected sex.\nAlthough I knew this, hearing it directly from her made me more aware.\nAfter lunch, we had a cup of coffee together before heading home.\nAs soon as I walked in with my large suitcase, Han-gyeol greeted me.\n“You’re back sooner than I thought.”\n“Oh- yes! Did you eat?”\n“Yes, I ate the breakfast you made.”\n“Well done~ Didn't you miss me?”\n“Of course I did~ Come here.”\nAs Han-gyeol opened his arms, I jumped into them.\n“I missed you too~”\n“I thought you’d be back late after meeting Hyun-joo Noona.”\n“No, I came back right after lunch and coffee.”\n“Did she say anything special?”\n“She... told us to always use protection-!”\n“Ah-! Yes, we should definitely...”\nBoth of us felt a bit guilty and couldn’t finish our sentences.\n“L-let’s be more diligent about it from now on...?”\n“Yeah, let’s do that.”\nTrying to lighten the mood, Han-gyeol extended his hand.\n“Give me your luggage. I’ll put your clothes away.”\n“N-no, it’s fine! I’ll do it!”\n“Huh? Isn’t it heavy?!”\n“Not at all! You just relax in the living room!”\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c351504b327003ff9bdcb\", id: \"pf-4629-1\"})\nI quickly took my luggage and rushed into the room.\nThere's no way I could let him see what’s inside until tomorrow.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Just as I prepared a birthday meal for Eun-ha, she prepared one for me as well.\nBut unlike my menu of braised short ribs, japchae, and seaweed soup, her spread was much more extensive.\nThere were salmon dishes and all of my favorite foods densely packed on the table.\nHowever, I couldn't help but notice the eel and chives, foods known to boost stamina, scattered throughout.\n\"Happy birthday, Han-gyeol! Eat up! Let me know if you need more!\"\n\"Why did you go through all this trouble? Just the seaweed soup would have been enough.\"\n\"No way! You made me a birthday meal too! This is the least I could do!\"\n\"Thank you. I'll enjoy it.\"\nI feel so loved.\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c3c5604b327003ff9c2e2\", id: \"pf-4630-1\"})\n\"Yeah! All you have to do is eat it up happily!\"With a bright smile on her face, Eun-ha watched as I took a spoonful of seaweed soup.\nThe seasoning was perfect, and the deep flavor brought an immediate smile to my face.\n\"It's incredibly delicious!\"\nHow long has it been since I had a birthday meal prepared by someone else?\nThinking about how Eun-ha must have painstakingly prepared everything from the crack of dawn made my nose tingle slightly.\nStill, I didn't let any tears fall and instead devoured everything she made.\nEach time I emptied a dish, Eun-ha looked more and more pleased.\n\"Did you enjoy it, Han-gyeol?\"\n\"Yes, it was so good that I think I overate a little.\"\n\"There's still some left, so let's put it in the fridge and eat it tomorrow!\"\n\"I'll help you clean up. Let's do it together.\"\n\"No, it's your birthday, so don't do anything today. Got it?\"\n\"I'm so full; I need to digest. Let's clean up together, Eun-ha.\"\n\"Alright then, I'll do the dishes, and you can help me clear the table.\"\n\"Okay, I'll do that.\"\nAfter putting the dishes in the sink, I wiped down the table with a cloth.\nEun-ha seemed delighted that I enjoyed the birthday meal so much.\nShe hummed a little tune and kept flashing cute smiles.\nI hugged Eun-ha from behind and thanked her once more.\n\"Eun-ha, thank you so much.\"\n\"Do you like it that much?\"\n\"Of course. It was incredibly delicious. Promise you'll do it again next year.\"\n\"Of course! I'll be responsible for Han-gyeol's birthday meals forever.\"\n\"Then I'll be responsible for your birthday meals, too.\"\n\"Hehe, that sounds great.\"\n\"Are we going out after we clean up?\"\n\"Yeah, let's go for a walk since we're full, get some coffee, and go on a date. How does that sound?\"\n\"Sounds perfect.\"\n\"You shower first.\"\n\"Okay, I'll be quick.\"\nAfter I showered and came out, Eun-ha got ready quickly.\nShe looked beautiful as always and took the lead, holding my hand.\nWe started our date with a coffee at a nearby café.\n\"Eun-ha, where are we going today?\"\n\"Hmm~ I picked somewhere I thought you'd like. But I'm not sure if you'll really like it.\"\nNow I'm even more curious.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Hmm... I looked up popular date spots that guys want to go to.\"\n\"Okay, what did you find? PC bang? Movie theater? Hotel staycation?\"\n\"An electronics market... want to go?\"\n\"What...?!\"\nThump.\nMy heart started pounding.\nThe holy land of countless electronic devices, also known as the playground for men: computers, laptops, phones, headsets, keyboards, game consoles, drones…\nThere’s nothing that’s missing from that place.\nI never imagined Eun-ha would suggest going there first.\n“Oh- um, is it a bit too much?! Haha... I also thought of some other places just in case-”\nI grabbed both of Eun-ha’s hands tightly and said,\n“Let's get married, Eun-ha. I love you.”\n“W-what?! Is it that good?!”\n“I fell for you all over again… I love you.”\n****\nTo be honest, I didn’t expect Han-gyeol to be this excited.\nHe was touching this and that, checking the specifications, and trying to explain everything to me, but it wasn’t easy for me to understand.\n“Eun-ha, don’t you want a laptop? As a film major, it wouldn't hurt to have a good one, right?! Oh, wait a minute, Eun-ha, your phone is an Apple, isn’t it? How about we check out the Apple store? Of course, if you’re primarily using Premiere or After Effects, you don’t necessarily need an Apple, but considering future use of Final Cut and the expandability with your phone, Apple could be a good choice.”\nI expected him to be happy about building his own computer, but not to this extent.\nHan-gyeol was thrilled, holding my hand as we entered the store.\n“What size do you like? How much storage do you need?!”\n“I don’t think I need a laptop just yet~ Is it really that good?”\n“Yes! The processor performance is great. But the price increases significantly with more storage… that’s the downside.”\n“Han-gyeol, don’t you use Apple?”\n“Yeah. Apple doesn’t support call recording. That’s a huge drawback…”\nSeeing him so excited made me happy too.\nI carefully took Han-gyeol’s hand and moved closer to him.\n“Let me see. Oh? This! I thought about buying a watch before, but I didn’t know much about it, so I didn’t.”\n“Really?! Personally, I think it’s good to start with an entry-level model. If well-maintained, they don’t depreciate much and can be resold at a reasonable price. Do you want one? Should I buy it for you?!”\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"664c18899578c05e8c641ad6\", id: \"pf-9092-1\"})\n“Maybe next time~ Today is your birthday. Should I buy it for you?”\n“Oh- I don’t need a watch yet, so I didn’t buy one. And it’s not really necessary~”\n“If you want one, let me know~ I’ll get it for you. Seriously!”\n“Get it for me next time. You’ve already bought my birthday present, haven’t you?”\nHe is incredibly perceptive.\nEven though Han-gyeol loves electronics, the gift that I picked out with care for him was more precious to him.\n“Eun-ha, I prefer the gift you chose for me. Let’s not change it now, okay?”\n“Ugh-! Sometimes it feels like Han-gyeol can read my mind completely.”\n“I love electronics, but I love the gift that Eun-ha chose for me while thinking about me more. Got it?”\n“Got it~ Let’s look around a bit more.”\n“No, I’m satisfied enough. I’ve seen all the new products.”\n“Huh?! No way. I’m enjoying this too. Let’s stay a bit longer~”\n“It’s alright~ I’m hungry. Let’s go eat~”\nI knew he was being considerate, worrying that I might be bored.\nI wasn’t bored at all, but I decided to accept Han-gyeol’s kind heart as it was.\nHe really is a warm person.\n****\nAfter lunch, we visited a movie theater, a manga café, and an arcade. Lastly, we enjoyed some bite-sized sushi before heading home.\nWhile it’s nice to have dates in atmospheric places with Eun-ha, sometimes a relaxed date like this is just perfect.\n\"Eun-ha, I had an amazing time today. Honestly, this is the most fun birthday I’ve ever had in my life.\"\n\"Really? I was worried you might not like it because it wasn’t fancy enough...\"\n\"Why would you worry about that? Thanks to you, today was truly wonderful. Thank you, Eun-ha.\"\nEun-ha beamed with a big smile, feeling proud of herself.\n\"Han-gyeol, let's go home and eat cake now!\"\n\"I’m not sure if I can fit any more in~\"\n\"If you're too full, we can just light the candles and save the cake for tomorrow.\"\n\"Oh, that sounds great. You’re a genius. I adore you.\"\n\"Hehe. Let’s hurry back.\"\nWe bought a cake and returned home.\nAfter changing clothes, we turned off the lights in the living room and lit the candles.\nEun-ha cheerfully sang the birthday song for me.\n\"Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday dear Han-gyeol~ Happy birthday to you~!\"\n\"It’s kind of embarrassing hearing it in person. Thank you, Eun-ha.\"\n\"You're welcome! Now blow out the candles.\"\nAs I blew out the candles, Eun-ha carefully stood up.\nShe quietly went to the room, possibly to get my gift, and came back holding a small paper bag, which she handed to me with care.\n\"Can I open it?\"\n\"Yes, of course!\"\nWhen I opened the paper bag, I found a beautiful glass bottle of perfume inside.\n\"Wow, perfume?! Thank you! Since you gave it to me, I’ll wear it every day.\"\n\"They say giving perfume as a gift means you want the person to always remember you...\"\nEun-ha’s face turned bright red, clearly feeling shy about saying something so sentimental.\n\"Really? That’s a nice meaning~\"\n\"So, please wear it every day...! It’s a scent that suits you so well that other girls might get attracted to you, but...! Just remember that it’s a gift from me...! I love you...\"\nSeeing Eun-ha so shy and with her head down made her even more adorable.\nI gently approached her and hugged her.\n\"I’ll never forget. I’ll wear it every day and think of you.\"\n\"Then, can you quickly shower and try it on...?\"\n\"Uh?\"\n\"I want to smell it on you...\"\nJudging by the atmosphere, she didn’t just want to smell the perfume.\nUnderstanding what she meant, I immediately agreed.\n\"Okay, I’ll go shower.\"\n\"Oh, wait! I’ll go first today!\"\n\"Huh? Okay. Then I’ll put the cake in the fridge. Go ahead.\"\n\"Got it! I’ll be quick!\"\nEun-ha, still feeling shy, quickly grabbed her clothes and went into the bathroom.\nI've never put on perfume before, but I guess I’ll just do it like they do in the dramas.\nTo be safe, I’ll use just a little.\n\"Han-gyeol, I’m done. You can go shower now!\"\nAfter some time, Eun-ha finished her shower and came out of the bathroom.\n\"Alright, I’ll go now.\"\n\"Take your time!\"\n\"Nope, I’ll be quick!\"\nI flashed a smile at Eun-ha and quickly took my shower.\nAfter applying lotion, I lightly sprayed the perfume she gave me and walked out of the bathroom, drying my hair with a towel as I entered the bedroom.\n\"Eun-ha, I’m done show-!!\"\nThe sight before me made me drop the towel I was holding.\nOh my god...\n\"You’re here...?\"\n\"Is that... a bunny...?\"\nView Image\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c351504b327003ff9bdcb\", id: \"pf-4629-1\"})\n\"You said I look like a small animal...!

      "content": "\"Do I look really strange…?\"\nI couldn't say anything and just took in Eun-ha's appearance.\nA bunny girl... I never imagined I would encounter such a situation in my life.\nI hoped for a moment like this at least once in my life, but I didn't expect it to happen so soon...\n\"No... you're beautiful...\"\nThe long bunny ears... the choker around her neck, the outfit that looked like it might burst, and the black stockings.\nEun-ha had everything a man likes, and it made my head spin.\nI was worried I might get a nosebleed if I wasn't careful.\nWhat should I do... I keep thinking about messing her up completely...\n\"Han-gyeol...\"Eun-ha got up from the bed.\nAs she walked towards me, my heart started to race like crazy.\nUnconsciously, I took a step back, but Eun-ha pulled me into a hug.\n\"Happy birthday...! Thank you for being born...!\"\nI truly felt it was great to be born.\nThere hasn't been a day in my life as good as today.\n\"Eun-ha...\"\n\"Yes?\"\nEun-ha's eyes looking up at me were so lovely.\nI wished she would choose between being cute or sexy, but it was impossible.\nMy vision blurred, and I glanced at the ceiling in a daze.\n\"Look at me…!\"\nNo matter how much time passed, my heart wouldn't calm down.\nInstead, it started pounding even faster.\nIn the end, I took a deep breath and swallowed dryly before turning my gaze back to Eun-ha.\nShe's still so beautiful.\nAh, I really want to bite her.\n\"I love you, Eun-ha. Truly and sincerely!\"\n\"I-I know... you don't have to say it. Hurry and hug me too…\"\nI carefully placed my hand on Eun-ha's back and hugged her tightly.\nAs the soft sensation became vivid in my mind, I felt like I was going to lose my reason.\nStill, gently... I kissed Eun-ha's lips and moved towards the bed.\n\"Mmm... ha…!\"\nAs soon as I laid Eun-ha down on the bed, I took off my top.\n\"Eun-ha, you're so sexy today…\"\n\"It's because of you... I wanted you to be happy…!\"\n\"Yes. I'm incredibly happy, Eun-ha. I love you.\"\n\"I love... mmm! Mmm…!\"\nAs I covered Eun-ha's lips, I roughly explored her mouth.\nEun-ha also opened her lips and accepted my tongue without hesitation.\nAlready heated up, I immediately began to knead Eun-ha's chest while continuing the kiss.\n\"Mmm...!\"\nEach time I squeezed her chest hard, Eun-ha's moans kept stimulating me.\nBeing gentle was out of the question now, so I pulled down the clothes covering Eun-ha's chest.\nAs soon as her ample chest came into view, I immediately kissed it.\n\"Haa...!\"\nAs I took her nipple into my mouth, Eun-ha held my head tightly, wanting me even more.\nThe way she gripped my hair and resisted the pleasure was incredibly alluring.\nNormally, I would give her time to calm down, but today was different.\nMy own rationality had already flown out the window, and I couldn't afford to be considerate of Eun-ha.\nAll I wanted was for her entire body, from head to toe, to be drenched in pleasure.\nAs I lifted her leg and caressed her thighs and the soft stockings, it seemed like her lower half was quickly getting wet.\nI wanted to touch and caress her vulva right away, but I decided to tease her a bit more.\nEven as I kissed her roughly, sucked on her breasts, and caressed her legs, I didn't touch her vulva.\nWhen I repeatedly brought my hand close to her vulva but then stopped, Eun-ha paused the kiss and spoke.\n\"Why aren't you touching me...? Touch me...\"\n\"I don't know where you mean.\"\n\"Really...! You're so mean...!\"\nI thought she would get upset at my words, but instead, Eun-ha grabbed my wrist and placed it on her vulva.\n\"Here... touch me here... Han-gyeol. Stop teasing... quickly...!\"\nSeeing Eun-ha's pleading face, I finally started to touch her vulva slowly.\n\"Ah...! It feels so good...!\"\nAs I touched her, already soaking wet, a moan escaped her lips immediately.\nI teased her further.\n\"You're so wet. Does it feel that good?\"\n\"So good...! Put it in... Han-gyeol...!\"\n\"Alright. I'll put it in.\"\nI slowly moved down to Eun-ha's lower half.\n\"Han-gyeol...?\"\nBefore inserting myself, I spread her thighs apart. Then, I began to caress her clitoris with my tongue.\n\"Ahh-! Han-gyeol..! There...! Right there...!\"\nI teased her lower half more roughly as she lifted her hips.\nShe tried to hold onto the bed sheets to resist the pleasure, but it was too much.\nHer body trembled violently as she reached her climax.\n\"Ahhh...! Ngh...!\"\nThough I had brought her to this point, the sight of Eun-ha climaxing was always erotic.\nThe pure and innocent Eun-ha was gone, replaced by someone trembling with pleasure...\nI felt a bit guilty for bringing her to such a state, but I wanted to see more.\nAfter a while, I approached Eun-ha's face, who was still panting heavily.\n\"I love y- Ah!\"\nJust as I was about to confess my love, Eun-ha turned me over onto my side.\nI worried for a moment that she might be angry, but her breathing was very ragged.\n\"Let me... let me do it too...\"\n\"Ugh...! Eun-ha...!\"\nEun-ha slipped her hand into my pants and grasped my growing hardness.\nAs she began to move her hand up and down, she spoke.\n\"I'll make you feel good, Han-gyeol...\"\n\"Eun-ha...?\"\nShe then moved her body downward and took off my pants.\n\"Han-gyeol, you're so big...\"\nEun-ha seemed surprised as she faced my fully erect member.\nIt twitched with every breath she took. Then, slowly opening her mouth, she took it in.\n\"Ugh..!!\"\nThe warm breath transformed into a hot pleasure, making the hair on my body stand on end.\nThe hot, slippery sensation from Eun-ha’s mouth sent shivers through me.\nShe moved her jaw slowly, taking my member deep into her mouth. I felt like I could climax in her mouth any moment.\nAs the thick and sticky sound resonated, I felt both guilt and pleasure. But, perhaps because it was her first time, she couldn’t do it for long.\nShe pulled my member out of her mouth and started to stroke it with her hand again.\n“Han-gyeol... Does it feel good? Do you like it...?”\n“It feels amazing...!”\n“Then I'll do it more... haap...!”\nEun-ha immediately took my member back into her mouth. She moved more vigorously than before, and I quickly felt the urge to climax.\n“Eun-ha... I’m about to...!”\nI told her, and she must have heard, but Eun-ha didn’t stop. Instead, she used her tongue to further stimulate my member.\nWith the sudden added stimulation, I couldn’t hold back anymore and climaxed right there.\nI felt the thick semen pour into her mouth, filling me with indescribable pleasure.\nOnly after she took all of my semen into her mouth did she finally release my member.\n“...”\nSlowly looking at me, Eun-ha gulped down my semen.\n“Did you... swallow it...?”\n“Haah... haah... Yes... I swallowed it... Did it feel good, Han-gyeol?”\nSeeing Eun-ha like this, my lust surged to its peak.\nI laid her down on her back and put a condom on my member.\n“Yes, it felt amazing. I can’t hold back anymore...!”\n“Yes... Come to me... Do whatever you want, Han-gyeol...”\nAs soon as her words left her mouth, I thrust into her in one swift motion.\n“Ahh...!!”\nThen, I grabbed her hips and moved roughly. I couldn’t hold back any longer.\n“Ahh...! Han-gyeol...! Han-gyeol...! I love you... I love you...!”\n“I love you too...”\nMy movements were rough and relentless, showing no signs of restraint. Each thrust was strong and hit deep inside Eun-ha.\nEun-ha's ample breasts shook violently up and down, and intense moans kept escaping her lips. Embarrassed, she covered her mouth with both hands.\n\"Mmph...! Mmm...!!\"\nI wondered what Eun-ha would look like if she got even more excited. To find out, I rubbed her clitoris while thrusting into her.\nShe immediately opened her eyes wide and tried to grab my wrist.\n\"Ahh...!! No...! Han-gyeol... I feel like I'm going crazy...!!\"\n\"It's okay...! You can go crazy...!\"\n\"Ahh...! I'm...! Again...! Again..!!!\"\nEun-ha's back arched like a bow and she began to tremble. Her fingers and toes stiffened, and she let out a loud moan.\n\"Ahhh...! Ah..! Ahh...!!\"\nEun-ha’s attempts to twist her body and shake off the pleasure looked incredibly erotic.\nEven as she bit down hard on her lower lip and climaxed, I kept moving my hips.\n\"Ah...! I'm...! I'm coming...!!!\"\n\"Sorry... You're just too sexy right now, Eun-ha...! I can't stop.\"\nI thought about stopping if Eun-ha asked me to. But if she told me to keep going, I planned to take it to the end.\n\"Do it more...! More...! It's okay to do it more...!! Ahh...!!\"\nEun-ha wrapped her legs tightly around my waist. As my upper body leaned forward, she hugged me tightly and moaned into my ear.\n\"Ah...! Ah...! It feels good..! I love it when Han-gyeol fucks me...! Ngh...!\"\n\"Ah... I love you, Eun-ha.\"\n\"Me too...! I love you too...! Han-gyeol...! I'm coming again...! Again...!!\"\nHearing Eun-ha's sultry voice in my ear, I moved my hips more roughly.\nAs I began to thrust with all my might, I too reached my limit.\n\"I'm about to come...!\"\n\"Do it...! Come quickly...! I love you...! I love you...! Han-gyeol...!\"\n\"I love you too! I love you, Eun-ha...!\"\nAs I climaxed, I collapsed onto Eun-ha's body.\n\"Ah...!! Ngh...!!\"\nEun-ha climaxed again, leaving scratches on my back.\nBreathing heavily, I slowly lifted my head to check Eun-ha's face.\nHer eyes were unfocused, panting heavily with a flushed face.\n\"Haah... haah...!\"\nYet, just like always, she looked at me lovingly.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Eventually, the first day of classes arrived.\nI wished I could have spent a little more time alone with Han-gyeol. It’s a bit disappointing.\nNow that the semester has really started, I’m even more worried.\nI can't always be by his side, and I'm sure there will be girls throwing themselves at him.\n\"Okay, Han-gyeol. If you're walking down the street and a girl is carrying something really heavy, what do you do?\"\n\"Pretend to be on the phone and walk past her.\"\nOh, that sounds good.\nIt was a satisfying answer.\n\"That's right! You can't be nice to other girls, okay?!\"\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c3c5604b327003ff9c2e2\", id: \"pf-4630-1\"})\n\"You don't need to worry about me. But will you be able to handle it, Eun-ha?\"\"Me? My body and heart belong entirely to you, so you don't have to worry.\"\n\"Same here. But what if a guy asks for your number?\"\n\"I'll tell him I'm married.\"\n\"Good. But let's avoid mentioning that we're living together.\"\n\"What?! Why?!\"\nHan-gyeol thought for a moment before explaining logically.\n\"The reality is, there's still a conservative view on cohabitation. People enjoy gossip more than you think. They might say things like, 'Did you hear about her?' or if you make a minor mistake, 'I knew she'd be like that.' Just say you're living nearby. But don't bring anyone home. Got it?\"\nIt was disappointing, but everything Han-gyeol said was true.\nI thought rumors about us living together would keep girls from hitting on him, but...!\nSeeing I didn't respond, Han-gyeol patted my head and said,\n\"Don't worry~ I'm yours too, Eun-ha.\"\n\"That's right. Han-gyeol is mine.\"\n\"Let's go, or we'll be late on the first day.\"\n\"Okay! Text me when you're done, okay?!\"\n\"Sure. Let's go now.\"\n\"Oh, wait a sec!\"\nAs Han-gyeol was about to leave through the front door, I quickly hugged him from behind.\n\"Eun-ha?\"\n\"Even if there's a girl prettier than me, don't look at her.\"\n\"Then I can look at everyone~\"\n\"We won't see each other for hours, so kiss me...!\"\n\"Alright.\"\nWith a smirk, Han-gyeol turned and kissed me.\nI dropped the bag I had slung over my shoulder and continued kissing him.\nAh... I don't want to be apart. To hell with the start of the semester; I just want to stay with Han-gyeol.\nMore... just a little more...!\n***\nThe first class ended after just taking attendance.\nAs soon as the professor left, the class representative came into the lecture hall.\nShe informed us that there would be a semester kickoff party at a bar tonight after all the classes were over.\nA kickoff party...\nI wanted to go to make some college friends, but I didn't have anyone to go with.\nI guess I should have attended the orientation after all.\nEveryone who made friends at orientation went off to have lunch together.\nI wondered if Han-gyeol was done with his class. I quickly texted him.\n[Hey, Han-gyeol. Are you done with class?]\n[No, it looks like we'll have a full class.]\n[Alright. I'll wait for you then.]\n[If you have someone to eat lunch with, don't wait for me~]\nThe thought of having lunch with Han-gyeol made my heart flutter.\nAs I smiled at my phone screen, someone spoke to me.\n\"Hey, are you going to the kickoff party today?\"\n\"Me? Are you talking to me?!\"\nA girl sitting next to me spoke to me.\nShe had short brown hair that suited her very well.\n\"Yeah. If it's okay, do you want to go together? It seems like everyone made friends at orientation, but I couldn't go because of my part-time job.\"\n\"Oh, sure! I'd love to. What classes do you have this afternoon?\"\n\"I don't have any electives today, just major courses. What's your name? I'm An-Yoori.\"\n\"I'm Shin Eun-ha. I also have only major courses today.\"\n\"I see. Do you want to have lunch together then?\"\n\"Oh-\"\nI hesitated for a moment before replying.\n\"Sure. Let's go have lunch.\"\nI decided to do as Han-gyeol suggested.\nI definitely needed to make friends too.\nMost importantly, I didn't want to turn down Yoori's kind offer.\n\"Alright. Let's go.\"\nWe packed our things and headed to the cafeteria.\n***\nYoori turned out to be even nicer once we got to know each other.\nShe had a bright smile and a gentle way of speaking.\nI felt good about how my college life was starting.\n\"So, does your boyfriend go to our college too?\"\n\"Yeah, he's in the Business Administration department.\"\n\"Shouldn't you be having lunch with him? Am I interrupting?\"\nI waved my hand dismissively at Yoori's concern.\n\"No, he finishes an hour later, so I told him I'd eat first.\"\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"664c18899578c05e8c641ad6\", id: \"pf-9092-1\"})\n\"Ah, I see. Have you been with him for a long time?\"\n\"Yeah, we've been together since our senior year of high school. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?\"\n\"Yeah, I do. We've been together for about four years.\"\nI was surprised.\nI had never met anyone my age who had been in a relationship for so long.\n\"Wow, that's a really long time. Is he at the same college?\"\n\"No, he's retaking his exams now. He's at a boarding academy, so we don't get to talk much.\"\nThe conversation suddenly felt heavier.\nI hoped I hadn’t touched on a sensitive topic, especially since it was our first meeting.\n\"I hope everything works out well for you.\"\n\"Thanks for saying that~ The cafeteria food is good.\"\n\"I was just thinking the same thing.\"\nAfter that, we returned to lighter topics and chatted about various things.\nI'm really glad that Yoori is the first friend I've made in college.\n\"Shall we get up if we're done eating?\"\n\"Yeah, let's go.\"\nYoori and I put our trays away and left the cafeteria.\nPeople were continuously coming in, and among them was Han-gyeol.\n\"Oh? Han-gyeol!\"\n\"Oh?! Eun-ha. Did you just finish lunch? I messaged you, but you didn't respond.\"\n\"Oh, I must have missed it because my phone was in my bag!\"\nHan-gyeol's bright smile was accompanied by his friends.\n\"Wow, Lee Han-gyeol. I thought you were so reserved.\"\n\"Yeah, he changes completely when he sees his girlfriend.\"\n\"Of course, a girlfriend is different from friends.\"\nFortunately, there were only guys with him, which made me feel slightly relieved.\n\"What's this~ Lee Han-gyeol~ You had a girlfriend?\"\n\"Whoa... what are you guys doing here?\"\nJust then, two girls appeared behind Han-gyeol, calling his name in a very familiar tone, which made me feel a bit uneasy.\nStill, I'm not so naive as to get upset over someone just calling his name.\nEspecially since Han-gyeol didn't seem particularly pleased to see them.\nHmm-! It seems like he's doing well!\n\"We're here for lunch too~ Enjoy your meal~\"\nThe two girls passed by Han-gyeol’s group without joining them.\n\"What's her name again... Anyway, oh- is this your friend, Eun-ha?\"\n\"Yeah, her name is An-Yoori. We're going to the kickoff party together tonight.\"\n\"Hi~ So you're Eun-ha's boyfriend? I just heard about you.\"\n\"Yeah, hi~ Okay, Eun-ha. I'll finish eating and then contact you.\"\nHan-gyeol waved brightly and even shook hands with Yoori.\nIs my friend safe? It's too cute.\n\"Yeah, see you later!\"\nAfter watching Han-gyeol go into the cafeteria, I left with Yoori.\nBut it really bothers me that there’s a girl I don’t know saying hi to Han-gyeol.\nNot knowing anything about her makes it even more concerning.\nObjectively speaking, they didn't eat together, just said hello in passing.\nHan-gyeol doesn't have female friends and isn't interested in anyone else but me.\nSo far, this hasn't been an issue, but now I wonder if I need to get used to this.\nThe thought of Han-gyeol talking to a girl I don't know... it hurts a little.\nCome to think of it, Han-gyeol might go to the kickoff party tonight too, right?\nWhat if he gets friendly with other girls?\nUgh, I still feel a bit uneasy.\n***\nAfter the afternoon classes, Yoori and I went to the kickoff party.\nThe students who had already made friends at the orientation were quickly pouring and drinking.\nYoori and I sat in a secluded corner, sipping our drinks.\n\"Everyone's having so much fun.\"\n\"Yeah, they're even playing drinking games.\"\n\"Should we play, just the two of us?\"\n\"That'd be a bit awkward~\"\nWhile Yoori and I were chatting, someone approached our table.\n\"Hey, if there's no one sitting here, can I join?\"\n\"Oh- yeah, sure. Have a seat. What's your name?\"\n\"I'm Choi Jiyoung. Are you all twenty?\"\n\"Yeah, we are. I'm Shin Eun-ha, and this is An-Yoori.\"\nOnce Jiyoung sat at our table, we quickly hit it off.\nAfter a few drinks, we were all laughing and chatting away.\n\"As soon as I came in, this table looked the most comfortable~\"\n\"Really? You're not regretting it now, are you?!\"\n\"Nope, I'm glad I came here~\"\n\"Hehe. Let's drink! Drink till we drop.\"\nYoori and Jiyoung started drinking nonstop.\nCan they handle it?\nI wonder what Han-gyeol is doing right now?\nwindow.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: \"648c351504b327003ff9bdcb\", id: \"pf-4629-1\"})\n\"Come on, Eun-ha, drink up too~\"\nFirst, I need to survive this table.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "“Who~ is drinking?! It's Lee Han-gyeol drinking~! Lee! Han! Han-gyeol! One~ shot!”\nDamn it... Drinking games have evolved way too much these days.\nI'm already bad at drinking games, and here I am playing one I don't even know.\nI have no idea how many penalty drinks I've had, and I feel like I'm going to black out any moment now.\nI gulped down all the penalty drinks in front of me, and my vision was already spinning.\n“Now~ let's start Lee Han-gyeol's~ favorite~ random~ game~ What game~ Game start! Game start!”\nI don't know any drinking games, you guys.\n“Eye Spy Game 1.”\nAs soon as the game started, everyone stood up while checking each other’s moves.\nAnother victim was chosen, and they joyfully downed their penalty drink.Are they all heavy drinkers or what...?!\nThey're all monsters.\n“Oh? Lee Han-gyeol is drunk~!”\n“Finally?! He lasted a long time~”\nSeeing how bad I am at these games, they were all targeting me, so there's no way I could hold out.\nWell, they're just trying to avoid getting caught themselves, so I guess I can overlook it.\nAh—what if Eun-ha's really drunk too... I'm worried, should I call her?\n“I’m going to make a quick call.”\n“You’re not going home just like that, are you~?”\n“I’m going to call my girlfriend.”\n“What~? Lee Han-gyeol has a girlfriend?!”\nSeunghoon and Jaehyun, who were sitting next to me, already knew.\nI've just met these guys today, but I feel like I'll be spending my college life with them.\n“Jaehyun and I have seen her. She’s from our college, right?”\n“Yeah, she's in the Film Studies department.”\n“Oh-! I've seen her too~ She’s pretty~!”\nThe girl sitting across from me said.\nI still don't really know her name.\nWe've been bumping into each other since we introduced ourselves at lunch.\n“Anyway, I'll be right back after the call.”\nI thought my college life would just pass by quietly, but that’s not happening.\nAh, I really want to go home and see Eun-ha. I wonder what she’s doing right now.\n“Oh- my phone.”\nI came out to make a call but... I left my phone behind.\nNothing's going right.\n“Han-gyeol? What are you doing here?”\nAs I was about to go back into the building, I heard Eun-ha's voice.\n“Eun-ha?!”\nWhat is this? A hallucination?\nIf she appears right in front of me like this, there's a chance it's a hallucination.\nA woman who looked like Eun-ha walked straight up to me.\n“Hold on, stop.”\n“Huh?”\n“Are you really Eun-ha...? I've had so much to drink I can't tell.”\n“Hehe... it's Han-gyeol!”\n“Ah!”\nThe way she ran towards me without hesitation confirmed it was Eun-ha.\nEun-ha, who was now in my arms, looked up at me with flushed cheeks, probably a bit tipsy.\nWith her soft hair, fair skin, and bright smile, it was definitely Eun-ha.\n“Hehe... I can smell the perfume I gave you...”\nShe sniffed at me, making little noises.\nShe was definitely a bit drunk.\n“Han-gyeol, did you drink a lot too?”\n“Don’t even ask... I can't see anything except you right now.”\n“If you put it that way, drinking a lot doesn’t seem so bad~”\n“What were you doing here? You should have called.”\n“Ah— I put Yoori and Jiyoung in a taxi and was about to call you when I saw you across the street, so I ran over~ What about you?”\n“I had too much to drink from the drinking games, so I came out for some air. What about you?”\n“Ah-! We played a lot of drinking games, but I never got caught. You know I’m good at games!”\nI thought she was only good at fighting games, but it seems she's good at drinking games too.\n“Did any other guys try to hit on you?”\n“Hmph~ Are you jealous?! This side of Han-gyeol is cute too. I want to kiss you.”\nOf course, they must have asked if she had a boyfriend. We're together so often that I get a little anxious sometimes.\n“Don't change the subject—did any other guys try to hit on you?”\n“Hmm~ When I was drinking at the seniors’ table, a female senior asked if I had a boyfriend, and I said yes. So, no one approached me~!”\n“You did well~ Keep it up. Even if other guys offer to buy you food, don’t go with them, okay? I’ll take care of that.”\n“Sure, sure! So? What about you?”\nEun-ha slightly stepped back from my embrace and looked up at me.\n“Huh?”\n“Did any other girls try to hit on you? You did tell them you have a girlfriend, right?”\nThere was a slight glint of menace in Eun-ha's eyes.\nIf I hadn’t mentioned it earlier, I would have been in big trouble.\nTo be honest, I didn’t say it outright myself.\n“Of course I told them~”\n“I was about to go home, but are you going to stay and drink more?”\n“Huh? No, I was thinking of heading home soon too. I don't think I can drink anymore. Just wait a moment, I'll grab my stuff and come out.”\n“Should I come up with you?”\n“Huh? I'll be quick.”\n“Just~ let’s go up together.”\nI guess it doesn't matter since I'll be out soon anyway.\n****\nI went up the stairs with Han-gyeol.\nI had quite a bit to drink myself, but it looks like Han-gyeol drank just as much.\nI’ve never seen him this drunk before.\nWhen we reached the table where Han-gyeol had been sitting, his friends welcomed him back.\nOf course, they acknowledged me too.\n“Wow—he said he was going to call his girlfriend, and he actually brought her here?”\n“Right on! I want to be a campus couple too. Help me out here.”\n“You might find that on your report card.”\n“Hey, man… we just started the semester, don’t jinx it.”\n“Anyway, since my girlfriend’s here, I’m going to head out. You guys get home safely.”\nJust as Han-gyeol and I were about to leave, I noticed the girl sitting across from Han-gyeol.\nShe was the one who greeted him so warmly during lunch.\nSitting at the same table means she’s close with Han-gyeol, right?\nWell… it’s nothing to worry about for now—\n“Hey~ since your girlfriend is here, have a drink before you go~”\nJust when I thought I didn’t need to worry, someone made me worry right away.\nShe had just met Han-gyeol today, yet she greeted him warmly and was sitting at the same table.\nIt might be my imagination, but it seemed beneficial to know a bit more about her.\n“No, Eun-ha’s already had a lot to drink—”\n“Shall we? Honestly, I could use a bit more to drink too.”\nI decided to join them.\nAs long as I don’t get caught in the drinking games, everything should be fine.\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Let’s have a drink~ I feel bad for making you leave early because of me.”\n“If you’re okay with it, I don’t mind.”\nI took off my coat and settled next to Han-gyeol.\nHe followed and sat down beside me.\n“We were in the middle of a drinking game; is it okay if we continue?”\n“Of course~! I just came from a drinking game with my department.”\n“Did you know Han-gyeol is terrible at drinking games?”\nHer tone was slightly irritating.\n“He has a bit of a cute side to him~”\nThe way she rested her chin on the table and looked at Han-gyeol also bothered me.\nLooking at someone else’s boyfriend like that… it’s starting to get annoying.\n“No, I didn’t know. We’ve always just had drinks alone, so we never had the chance to play drinking games~”\n“Don’t drink too much. If you can’t handle it, give it to me. Got it?”\n“Thanks for looking out for me.”\nAt least Han-gyeol was only looking out for me.\nMaybe I should just show how strong our relationship is here and now?\nBut how? I can’t just kiss him out of the blue, that’s too embarrassing.\nBesides, that might affect his college life, so maybe it’s better to just play it cool today.\nThis person hasn’t done anything to Han-gyeol, but… the way she keeps looking at him is really annoying.\n“Okay! Let’s play a drinking game then?”\nI started the drinking game with a bright smile.\nEveryone was having a good time, but most of the targets were Han-gyeol.\nIt turned out that he was indeed bad at drinking games, as he kept having to drink penalty shots.\nEventually, it seemed too much for him as he hesitated with a drink in his hand.\n“I’ll drink it~”\n“What?!”\nI quickly took the drink from Han-gyeol and downed it.\nUgh—it was extremely bitter. It felt like I just drank four shots of soju in one go.\n“Oh~ that’s impressive!”\n“Isn’t everyone targeting my boyfriend a bit too much~?”\nI gently pulled Han-gyeol’s face toward my shoulder, hugging him closely for everyone, especially the girl, to see.\nHer lower eyelid seemed to twitch slightly, but it could have just been my drunken imagination.\nStill, it felt like a good time to start making our exit since I now knew who to keep an eye on.\n“Han-gyeol is really drunk, so we’re going to head out now.”\n“Already? You can stay a bit longer. The subway has probably stopped running by now.”\nWhat’s with her insistence on keeping Han-gyeol around?\nIs she trying to observe our relationship more closely?\nFrom an objective standpoint, I had no solid evidence to be sure.\nBut it did seem like a good idea to assert our relationship a bit more.\n“It’s fine~ I’ll just have him stay at my place~”\nWith that, I quickly gathered Han-gyeol.\n“Come on, Han-gyeol? Let’s go home~”\n“Uh... yeah. Let’s go.”\nWith Han-gyeol’s arm around my neck, I slowly got up from my seat.\n“Alright, we’re leaving now~ Let’s meet again if we get the chance. It was fun.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After taking Han-gyeol out, I headed straight home.\nIt makes my heart flutter a little to have Han-gyeol, who always takes care of me and gives me strength, now completely relying on me.\nHow can he be so defenseless? What if someone takes him away? I just want to devour him.\nShould I seize this opportunity and devour him for real?\n“Eun-ha... I feel dizzy. The floor is spinning...”\n“Just hang in there a bit longer. We’re almost home, okay?”\n“I like living in the same house as Eun-ha...”\n“Right? You like living with me, don’t you?”\n“Yeah... it makes me really happy.”\nHan-gyeol lifted his head slightly and looked at me.Maybe it’s the mix of alcohol and cologne, but today he seemed even more alluring.\nSeeing him look so vulnerable made my heart race like crazy.\nI wanted to lay him down on the bed and tease him. That desire gave me strength.\n“Ugh...! Just a little more, we’re almost there. Hang in there.”\n“Okay. Sorry for drinking so much.”\n“It’s okay. I like this side of you too.”\nI finally managed to get Han-gyeol home, supporting his staggering body.\nThe walk left a bit of sweat on my forehead. I tossed my bag aside, planning to take a shower first.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll shower first. You should sober up a bit-! Whoa!”\nAs I headed towards the bathroom, Han-gyeol suddenly grabbed my wrist tightly.\nHe pulled me onto the bed, hugging me tightly as he fell.\n“Stay with me a little longer.”\nSo assertive...!\nHan-gyeol started stroking my head, as if he saw me as a cat.\nI loved the gentle touch of his hand, so I stayed cuddled up in his arms. Being tipsy and it being nighttime, the moment felt even more thrilling.\n“Eun-ha, your hair is so soft. We use the same shampoo, so why doesn’t mine smell like this?”\nHan-gyeol’s voice sounded especially seductive tonight.\nAs soon as I felt his breath and voice in my ear, I clutched his collar tightly.\nSomething about being unable to move from his grasp felt incredibly alluring.\n“I like the scent of your shampoo too.”\nHan-gyeol grabbed a handful of my hair and smelled it.\nIt wasn’t an action meant to make my heart flutter, but the atmosphere kept turning more and more suggestive.\nIn the dark room, having my boyfriend smell my hair was surprisingly embarrassing. But wanting him to smell more... that must be a perverted thought, right?\nIs it safe to say it’s just because I want him to know more about me?\nI don’t know. Right now, I just love being in Han-gyeol’s arms.\nI’m already drunk, so it shouldn’t matter, right?\n“You can... keep going...”\nAs I softly spoke in Han-gyeol’s embrace, he hesitated not at all before slipping his hand under my shirt.\nHe felt my back, savoring my warmth and skin.\nWithout caring that my shirt was riding up, Han-gyeol continued to caress my back.\n“Eun-ha, your body is so soft. I want to keep touching you.”\n“...You can keep touching me. I like it when you touch me... It makes me feel loved and happy.”\n“Then I’ll keep touching you.”\nMy heart was pounding.\nA drunk Han-gyeol felt like a bad boy, which made it even more thrilling.\nI loved how he sensually touched my back and how he tantalizingly didn’t move his hand higher.\n“I love being like this with you, Eun-ha. Last year, I couldn’t even think about lying in the same bed.”\n“Back then, we were students... but now we’re adults, so it doesn’t matter...”\n“You’re saying it like it’s okay to do anything because we’re adults now. Can we really do anything?”\n“...!”\nWhat does he mean by ‘anything’? It can only be that, right...? But...\n“Today... is a very dangerous day for me...”\nIt’s a day when I might end up getting pregnant if we’re not careful.\nBut if Han-gyeol wants it, I don’t care. I mean it. I just want to tie the knot with him as soon as possible.\n“I was just talking about kissing~ but you’re always thinking about that.”\n“Ugh...!”\nMy face flushed hot. In this situation, what else could I think of?\n“You’re so naughty...”\n“...”\n“At this rate, you’ll be having a baby before we even graduate.”\n“I don’t mind... I actually want that...”\nAnd I mean it.\n“Don’t you want to enjoy college life?”\n“Of course, I came to college with you, so I want to enjoy it, but I want to get married more...”\n“You’re only twenty, there’s so much we can do ahead of us.”\nHan-gyeol was entirely right. And I wasn’t completely without expectations for campus life. But I couldn’t shake off even the slightest chance.\n“It’s rare for a high school romance to end in marriage...”\n“Huh?”\nI never intended to show it, but I let it slip out thanks to the alcohol.\n“Since the semester started, I’ve been thinking that. As time passes, we’ll have less and less time together. Even today... yesterday it was normal to have lunch together, but today we couldn’t because of our different schedules.”\nEven after just one day, I missed Han-gyeol terribly. I tried spending a day without him as he suggested, making new friends, but I couldn’t help feeling the void.\n“I feel a bit regretful that we’re in different departments... having separate orientation parties. Seeing girls I don’t know talking to you. It might just be because it’s the first day, but I know we’ll have even less time together after graduation. It’ll be hard to stay in touch when we’re working... And with our different majors, working at the same company seems unlikely...”\nI clung tightly to Han-gyeol’s collar.\n“I thought it would be okay, but spending the day like this made me miss you so much. Knowing we’ll have less time together as time goes by makes me feel regretful. That’s why I want to marry you soon before these feelings grow stronger... I want to have a baby with you.”\nThough it was just a day’s feelings, I confessed honestly to Han-gyeol.\n“I see. You looked fine, so I didn’t realize. It’s understandable to feel that way after starting the semester and being apart for a day.”\n“Yeah... But I know you love me a lot. I know you won’t look at other girls. I just regret that our time together is decreasing...! I’m not asking you to spend more time with me, okay?! So don’t feel pressured- kyah!”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol flipped me over and climbed on top of me. Smiling, he spoke.\n“In summary, you felt a bit anxious, right?”\n“Not exactly anxious, but...”\n“But you’re right, Eun-ha. When we graduate, we’ll naturally have less time to be together. Honestly, I don’t know what to say to reassure you right now. I can’t irresponsibly promise that it won’t happen.”\n“Yeah... I wasn’t trying to burden you with what I said.”\n“You do feel my love, right?”\n“Of course... How could I feel any more loved? It’s overflowing as it is...”\nHan-gyeol slowly brushed my hair back.\n“You said before, Eun-ha, that you remember all the days we’ve been together...”\n“Did I say that...?”\n“Yeah, you said it when you were drunk. You said you were happiest when I first told you I loved you.”\n“Oh...! That day...!”\n“Was there ever a day with me that you didn’t like? Apart from feeling disappointed sometimes.”\nI shook my head vigorously.\n“No...! Every day with you has been wonderful, without exception.”\n“Right? So let’s not worry about things that haven’t happened yet. We’ve enjoyed every day so far. Let’s just live each day, focusing on today. Even a year or ten years from now, I’ll make sure you answer the same way. Even if our time together decreases, I’ll make you feel just as loved.”\nHis sweet words made my cheeks heat up.\n“So, did you feel loved today?”\n“I did...”\n“When?”\n“When you asked me if other guys had been hitting on me... I felt loved because you were jealous...”\n“Really? That’s good to hear~ I’ll make sure you feel just as loved tomorrow, the day after, and for the rest of our lives. So don’t rush.”\nWhy does he only say such lovely things? He didn’t promise to not reduce our time together, but instead, he promised to make every ‘today’ full of love.\nIt felt like the same promise, but it was so heartwarming. Really... he’s an amazing person.\n“Han-gyeol, but today was a bit lacking.”\n“Huh?”\nI slowly wrapped my arms around Han-gyeol’s neck.\n“I’m going to shower, so give me a kiss after...”\n“No. I can’t wait that long.”\nHan-gyeol leaned in and started kissing my neck.\n“Han-gyeol...! Wait...! Let me shower...”\n“No... just stay still.”\n“Hngh...!”\nI was embarrassed from sweating a bit earlier...! But Han-gyeol’s hot breath touched my neck, and he continued to suck on my skin.\nHe usually only left marks on my upper chest, never on my neck...!\n“Not the neck...! The semester has already started...”\nHonestly, I’d love it if he left a mark. I want him to mark me as his own. I want him to do it roughly, showing he wants me. A bit more aggressively...\n“Han-gyeol...! Are you listening...! Hngh...! Han-gyeol...!”\n“Eun-ha, you’ll just have to use a patch for a while.”\nEmbarrassingly, Han-gyeol sucked on my neck roughly.\nThis moment was so thrilling, and his uncharacteristic behavior made it even more exciting.\nBefore I knew it, I was holding him tightly, wanting him to ravish me more.\n“Is it too intense?”\nHan-gyeol lifted his head slowly after leaving a mark on my neck. My body was already on fire, and there was no stopping now.\n“Do more...!”\nI grabbed Han-gyeol’s head and pulled him down.\n“Mmph...!”\nI covered his lips with mine, holding him tightly. Both of us were so heated that we began to roughly undress each other.\nThud-\nThud-\nClothes fell one by one to the floor, and we spent our time together once more.\nKissing and caressing each other’s bodies, loving and being loved.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Two weeks had already passed since the start of my university life.\nBoth Eun-ha and I had naturally adapted to our changed routines.\n-“Lee Han-gyeol. Could you show me your notes for Intro to Business Management? I couldn’t take notes because I had to go to the hospital today.”\n“That should be in my locker. Uh, number 76. Just take it out, copy it, and put it back. And buy me a can of coffee.”\n-“Sure~”\nI hung up the phone and refocused on Eun-ha sitting in front of me.\n“Who was that? A classmate?”\n“Yeah. She went to the hospital and asked to see my notes. I told her to get it from my locker.”\n“If it’s your notes, they must be super detailed. Is a can of coffee enough?”\nI wanted to tell her to buy me a meal at the cafeteria, but I didn’t want to make Eun-ha uncomfortable.“I can ask for a favor later. Don’t we have to head to class soon?”\n“Yeah...! I want to hang out with you a bit more, though. Want to audit my class?”\n“That’s a bit much~ I’ll study at the library until my class starts.”\n“Your class ends at five, right? Then I’ll come to your lecture hall after I’m done.”\n“Got it~ Let’s get going. You’ll be late, Eun-ha.”\n“Alright~”\nAfter leaving the campus cafe, Eun-ha walked off to her class.\nShe’s been looking tired lately with all the assignments. Maybe we should go out for some fresh air this weekend.\nLiving together means we’re always around each other in the evenings, but having different classes makes me feel a bit lonely.\nEun-ha used to sit next to me every day in high school...\n“It’s a bit sad.”\nI watched Eun-ha enter the academic building and then headed to the library.\nIt’s only been two weeks since the semester started, and it’s rare to see freshmen in the library.\nBut I don’t have time to waste…\nI need to study for TOEIC and prepare for certifications before I forget.\nI’ll spend my twenties in university, then enlist next year.\nI’ll probably be twenty-three, a second-year student, when I return.\nBy then, Eun-ha will be a fourth-year, about to graduate.\nEven if Eun-ha gets a job, I’ll still be a student for two more years, and it might take even longer if I consider job hunting.\nIn my opinion, the difference between a working professional and a student is quite significant.\nFinancial conditions and daily routines are quite different...\nSo it’s better to prepare to get a job as soon as possible.\nShould I take summer classes to meet early graduation requirements?\nMaybe I should also start volunteer work early.\nOnce I started thinking, my thoughts kept spiraling until it was time for class.\nWhen I arrived at the lecture hall, Seunghoon had saved me a seat.\n“Lee Han-gyeol. I saved you a seat here.”\n“Thanks. But why do you look like that?”\n“Don’t even ask... We drank until five in the morning. I feel like dying.”\n“Lee Han-gyeol... If you had been there, we might have drunk less.”\nSeunghoon and Jaehyun, who were sitting next to me, had recently been attending drinking sessions every day, saying they were releasing the stress of being exam-takers.\nWell, if there were typical freshmen, they would probably be more like Seunghoon and Jaehyun. I guess I’m the odd one for quietly going to the library.\n“We’d probably have all passed out together.”\nI answered as I took my writing tools out of my bag.\n“They’re right, Lee Han-gyeol. Why don’t you ever drink with us?”\n“What? Were you here?”\n“Could you please pay attention to me? I’ve been here from the start!”\nThe girl sitting in front of me was named Chae-in Jeong. I had seen her at lunchtime on the first day, and she was the one who kept making me drink at the welcome party.\nShe had a cheerful and bold personality and already had a good reputation in our department.\n“Did you put my printouts in the locker?”\n“Of course. Oh, by the way, we’re going to have drinks with the seniors after school today. You should come too. Seunghoon and Jaehyun are coming.”\n“Can’t you see these guys are half-dead? How are we supposed to drink with them?”\nI said, looking at Seunghoon and Jaehyun.\n“Let’s ask them. You guys want to go drinking, right?”\nThey quietly raised an OK sign while lying on their desks.\nCrazy. Their livers must be rotting away.\n“See, they’re coming. You should come too, Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“Sorry. I don’t really enjoy drinking that much, and I get terrible hangovers the next day.”\n“Hmm—then I’ll be your black knight. Just trust me. I can drink well!”\n“No, thanks. I don’t really enjoy crowded places.”\n“You didn’t come to the MT* either.”\n“For the same reason.”\nI kept refusing, but I felt like if I kept saying no, I’d start to feel out of place. But Eun-ha said she’d come pick me up after class, so it’s not possible today.\n“I have plans today, so I can’t. How about next Wednesday? I can make it then.”\n“Oh—! You better keep that promise! Let’s drink with our classmates next Wednesday.”\n“Sure.”\nI wonder if Eun-ha would be okay with it.\n****\n“That’s it for today’s class. Good job, everyone.”\nAs soon as the three-hour lecture ended, everyone rushed out of the lecture hall.\nI was about to contact Eun-ha on my phone when I saw her sitting at a table in front of the vending machine.\nShe looked around for me among the students and smiled as soon as our eyes met.\nI was about to walk over to Eun-ha when Cha-in blocked my way.\n“Han-gyeol! I forgot to give you the can of coffee I promised.”\nShe handed me the can of coffee and walked away.\nReceiving a can of coffee from a female classmate right in front of my girlfriend... Is this okay?\nNow that I think about it, I didn’t mention earlier that the person borrowing the printouts was a girl.\nEun-ha, sitting at the table, was watching Cha-in walk away rather than looking at me.\nThis is trouble.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Oh—yeah! Must’ve been tough with all those classes.”\n“Not really~ Shall we head back?”\nI tried to act as if nothing had happened.\nBut Eun-ha kept glancing at the can of coffee in my hand.\n“Was the person you lent the printouts to a girl?”\n“Oh—yeah. I forgot to mention that.”\n“Oh, why make a big deal out of it? Let’s go.”\nWe left the campus and headed towards our place.\nGiven how quiet she was today, it seemed like it did bother her.\nWhat did we usually talk about when heading home?\nWhy can’t I think of anything to say now?\nBefore Eun-ha brought it up—\n“So, are you close with that girl?”\nEun-ha’s slightly chilly words broke the silence.\n“We’re not that close... She’s just one of those people who gets along with everyone in the department. That kind of relationship.”\n“I see. Sorry for asking. I was just curious because I didn’t know her... Haha! What should we have for dinner? How about buying some tofu and making tofu stew? Or kimchi stew?”\nEun-ha is more rational than I often realize.\nShe might seem emotional on the surface, but she possesses a significant amount of rational judgment.\nWhen determining right from wrong, she tends to rely on objective facts rather than her emotions.\nI think we’re similar in that regard, but she maintains this objectivity even in our relationship.\nJust like now.\nIt’s rare to find someone who wouldn’t feel anything in that situation.\nI would also wonder if someone gave Eun-ha a can of coffee.\nBut from an objective viewpoint, it’s nothing more than a small thank you for lending printouts.\nThat’s why Eun-ha discarded her subjective feelings and apologized for asking.\nIt would be nice if she were more honest about her feelings. Lately, it seemed like she was hiding them a bit.\n“Sometimes I think you’re quite a rational person, Eun-ha.”\n“Hmm?! Me?! Really...?! Mom always nagged me for being clumsy sometimes...!”\n“Well... It might seem that way on the surface, but you have a very cool-headed way of looking at things.”\n“Is that a compliment?”\n“It’s a good thing. But do you need to be like that in a relationship? You can be more honest with your feelings.”\nWhen I gently leaned in, Eun-ha took a step back and said, “B-but...! That girl was simply returning the favor to you, Han-gyeol! It’s a bit much for me to make a fuss over that, don’t you think?”\n“So you were thinking that way. But if someone gave you a can of coffee, I think I’d feel a bit uneasy. Isn’t that the same for you? Or is it just my imagination?”\nIt’s a bit ironic to be saying this when I’m the one who received the can of coffee, but it’s best to get this out in the open.\n“Of course, it does bother me a bit, but...”\n“I don’t think we need to be so objective in a romantic relationship. Relationships are fundamentally emotional, right? So it’s okay to express your feelings more openly.”\nEun-ha pondered for a moment before speaking.\n“Really...?”\n“Yeah. You used to speak your mind more often. Why are you hiding your feelings lately?”\n“That’s because—”\n“Go on, tell me.”\nEun-ha hesitated, then looked me straight in the eyes and spoke.\n“I think I have a strong sense of possessiveness over you. When you’re not around, I keep wanting to see you and talk to you. When we were always together, I didn’t realize it, but now that we’re apart, I feel like I might become overly attached, so I thought I should restrain myself.”\n“Oh, Eun-ha, you don’t have to worry about that. If it ever feels overwhelming, I’ll let you know.”\n“Really...? But you’re so kind that I feel like you’d just put up with it and try to understand.”\nShe was right. If Eun-ha had felt that way, I would probably have acted exactly as she described.\nEun-ha sees right through me.\n“Your silence is telling, isn’t it?”\n“Well...! But now that we’re talking about it, I’ll be honest. If it ever feels like too much, I’ll tell you directly, so you should also feel free to speak your mind.”\n“Really...?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Really, really, really...? You won’t hate me?”\n“I could never hate you, Eun-ha.”\nAfter thinking for a moment, Eun-ha opened up and started speaking rapidly, letting out everything that had been on her mind.\n“Don’t get too close with other girls! No being alone with another girl! Don’t create situations where another girl might find you attractive. I’m not saying you should be mean, but don’t go out of your way to help them either. I don’t want anyone falling for your kindness. It’s fine to lend your printouts, but nothing more than a can of coffee in return...”\n“What about group activities, like drinking together?”\n“It’s fine if there are guys too... But no black-knighting for girls! And don’t take a girl home if she’s drunk! Call me if a girl needs help!”\n“Got it. Thanks for being honest. You should have told me sooner.”\nI smiled and pulled her cheek playfully.\n“There’s still one more important thing.”\n“What is it?”\n“Since we can’t have any physical affection at college... give me more affection at home!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: MT: Membership Training (MT) is an event held among university students in South Korea.

      "content": "I’m really glad I ended up at the same university as Han-gyeol.\nIf we hadn’t been at the same university, I might have... gotten pretty obsessed.\nHonestly, I don’t like this part of myself, but I must really love Han-gyeol a lot.\nI want to see him, to touch him, even now.\nWanting to touch him is just a bonus.\nShould I make a ton of money and just stay at home with Han-Han-gyeol?\nBut to live without working, we’d need to own a building…\nEven buying a small building would cost around 3 billion won…\nIt’s an unrealistic amount to save up just from our salaries.\n“Eun-ha, what are you thinking about so deeply? Your boyfriend?”“How did you know?! Was it that obvious?”\n“No... it’s just, you always seem to be thinking about your boyfriend.”\n“As a single person, seeing you like this makes me feel lonely~”\nYoori and Jiyoung were also doing assignments with me in the study room.\n“Jiyoung, you could start dating if you wanted to~”\n“Thanks for saying that, but I can’t seem to find anyone decent~ How about you, Yoori? How’s your boyfriend?”\n“Well, he’s studying hard~ We don’t talk much though...”\nSeeing Yoori’s slight bitterness made Jiyoung and I feel sorry.\nNot being able to talk or see each other freely must be tough.\nSeeing Yoori force a smile made me uncomfortable.\nIt’s not good to be too affectionate in front of her.\n“But it’s okay-! He said he could come out this weekend~ We’re meeting then.”\n“That’s great! Where are you going on your date?”\n“Just hanging out by the Han River and then going to Lotte Tower.”\n“Oh, that sounds fun. Tell us all about it afterwards.”\n“Sure~ Let’s finish our assignments quickly.”\n“Yeah, let’s focus now!”\nAfter ending our conversation, everyone concentrated on their assignments.\nI knew the Film Studies department had a lot of assignments, but I didn’t realize it would be this much.\nEach major class assigned new projects, and delaying them would definitely lead to disaster.\nAfter about an hour or two, the project plan started to take shape.\nSince we could do the filming later, I decided to wrap it up for today.\n“Ugh... I need a break.”\nAs soon as I stretched, my phone on the desk buzzed.\nIt was a call from Han-gyeol, so I grabbed my phone and left the study room.\n“Hello?”\n-Yeah, Eun-ha. Were you doing assignments? You didn’t check my messages.\n“Oh! I must’ve missed them while focusing!”\n-I’m going to grab some drinks now, but I wanted to see your face before I go.\n“Really? Where are you now?”\n-I’m in front of your building. Can you come out for a bit?\n“Just wait a minute!”\nAs soon as I hung up, I fiddled with my bangs and walked down the stairs.\nWhen I stepped out of the building, Han-gyeol was waiting for me with a drink in his hand.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“You came quickly. You haven’t finished your assignment yet, right? Here, drink this while you work.”\nHan-gyeol handed me an iced chocolate he had bought from a cafe.\n“I was just craving something sweet. Thanks! I’ll enjoy it.”\nI took a sip of the iced chocolate Han-gyeol bought for me. The sweet taste spread through my mouth, making me feel great. But then a thought suddenly crossed my mind.\n“Why do you always get iced chocolate? You could bring coffee, you know?”\n“Eun-ha, you don’t drink coffee. You have a bit of a childish taste.”\n“Well, I’ve started drinking it a bit since I’m a college student now! I drink it whenever you do!”\n“You never finish it though~ Alright. Since you’re an adult now, I’ll get you an Americano next time.”\n“Just sometimes get chocolate, okay? Are you going to drink with your friends right after this?”\n“No, I still have some time.”\n“Then let’s sit on the bench and chat for a bit longer!”\n“Sure, I’d like that too.”\nWe took a seat on a bench next to the building.\n“How’s the assignment going? Is it tough?”\n“Don’t even get me started…! Every major class has its own assignments, and none of them are easy. I heard there would be a lot of assignments, but I didn’t expect this much. I feel buried under them. And today, we got another one.”\n“That’s really a lot. Don’t overdo it. When are you going home today?”\n“I plan to leave after finishing the project proposal. I’ll probably leave with my friends.”\n“Don’t stay too late. If you’re out late, call me. I’ll come pick you up.”\n“Hey~ You can’t just leave your friends in the middle of hanging out!”\nI want to be a cool girlfriend to Han-gyeol.\nI hope our relationship stays comfortable like this.\n“What about dinner, Eun-ha?”\n“I’ll probably eat with my friends after finishing the assignment. Don’t worry about me~”\nIt’s right to let him go since he cares about me like this.\nHe’s someone who will think of me even when he’s out drinking.\nWhile we were talking, Han-gyeol’s phone started ringing.\n“Is it time to go? You should go quickly.”\n“Yeah. You should go back in. I’ll wait until you’re inside.”\n“Alright~ Thanks for the iced chocolate!”\n“Get home safely~”\nAfter finishing our conversation, I went straight back into the building.\nI waved back at Han-gyeol, who was waving at me from behind, and returned to the study room.\n“Eun-ha, did you finish the assignment?”\n“Huh? I almost finished the proposal. I’ll do the filming tomorrow. What about you, Jiyoung?”\n“I’m almost done too. Yoori just finished.”\n“I should hurry up and finish too~”\n“Take your time. We’ll wait for you~”\nWith Yoori and Jiyoung’s encouragement, I quickly finished up the project proposal.\nJust to be safe, I uploaded it to the cloud, and then we all left the college building together.\nAs soon as we stepped outside, Jiyoung took a deep breath and exhaled deeply.\n“Ah-! I feel alive again.”\n“You guys worked hard.”\n“I’d love to have a drink, but I have prior plans, so I’ll be heading off first!”\n“I’m tired, so I’m going home to rest. Eun-ha, are you heading to your apartment?”\n“Yeah, I’m going straight home.”\n“Yoori, are you taking the bus?”\n“I’m taking the subway. We’re all going different ways.”\n“Take care, everyone~ See you tomorrow.”\n“Yeah~ Eun-ha, get home safely~”\n“Bye~”\nAfter parting ways, I headed straight to my apartment.\nFor dinner, I thought I’d have the leftover sundubu-jjigae I had for breakfast.\nI planned to spend the evening studying video editing.\n“Maybe it’s because Han-gyeol isn’t here, but my apartment feels farther away today.”\nI walked home quietly, turned on the lights, and immediately went to take a shower.\nAfter a quick dinner of the sundubu-jjigae I had in the fridge, I headed straight to the computer room.\nMost of my peers seemed to have some experience with video editing, but I needed more practice.\nI noticed some seniors making money with their video editing skills, which seemed like a good opportunity.\nIt seemed like a good long-term plan to improve my video editing skills and earn some money.\nPlus, I wanted to buy Han-gyeol the electronics he wanted in the future.\n“Everything seems to lead back to Han-gyeol, doesn’t it?”\nLove is such a strange thing. All the couples in the world must have started as strangers. They get to know each other, share their daily lives, and eventually become each other’s everyday.\nJust as I was thinking this, I received a message from Han-gyeol.\n[Han-gyeol♡: I'm drinking with my classmates right now. We ran into some second-year seniors and are drinking with them. I won’t stay out too late.]\nI quickly replied.\n[Okay! Don’t drink too much~]\nAfter responding to Han-gyeol, I began my video editing studies.\nThanks to some basic knowledge I already had, it didn’t take long to get the hang of it.\nFollowing the book recommended by my senior and practicing video editing was quite enjoyable.\n“Maybe I should film a vlog with Han-gyeol next time~”\nIf I pointed the camera at him, he’d probably dart around trying to hide.\nHe’s a bit shy, so he might run away.\nThe thought of playing around like that with Han-gyeol made me smile. I hummed a tune and continued studying.\nAfter about four hours, it was almost eleven at night when my phone rang again.\nIt was Han-gyeol, so I answered immediately, but his voice sounded troubled.\n-“Eun-ha…?”\n“Hmm? What’s wrong with your voice?”\n-“Well… it’s a bit of a weird situation…! I just wanted to prevent any potential trouble…!”\n“What’s going on?”\nAfter hesitating, Han-gyeol finally spoke.\n-“A female classmate got drunk and passed out on the street. What should I do…?!”\n‘Female classmate’\nThat was all I heard.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n-“Yeah?”\n“Send me your location and wait right there.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As I walked into the bar in front of the college, I saw several of my classmates already seated.\nAs soon as Chae-in Jeong saw me standing by the entrance, she waved her hand vigorously and called out my name.\n“Hey, Lee Han-gyeol! Over here!”\n“Am I late? Looks like everyone’s here.”\n“You’re just on time. We went to the karaoke earlier.”\nI intended to have some fun but not stay out too late, so I took a seat on the edge.\nThe only names I knew were Chae-in Jeong, Seunghoon, and Jaehyun. There were familiar faces, but I couldn’t recall their names.\n“Oh, you’re here? You should’ve come to the karaoke with us.”\n“I was meeting my girlfriend, so I couldn’t have come anyway.”\nHearing this, Jaehyun looked up at me slyly.“What?! You met your girlfriend first? Then you have to take a penalty drink.”\n“Hey, don’t give Lee Han-gyeol too much. If he drinks too much, he won’t come next time.”\n“Right, give him a break. Last time at the semester-opening party, I thought he was going to die.”\n“When you put it like that, it makes me hesitate. Fine, let’s share the penalty drink then.”\n“Sounds good.”\nThanks to Seunghoon’s intervention, I didn’t have to drink the penalty drink.\nThe others at the table chatted and drank without any hesitation.\n“Do you guys understand our major classes? I had a management principles class today and didn’t get any of it.”\n“Chae-in Jeong, shouldn’t you first ask if anyone actually attended the class?”\n“Seunghoon, you should attend classes! What are you going to do during midterms? And you too, Jaehyun.”\n“We trust our future selves to handle midterms.”\n“What is that supposed to mean?!”\nThe lively atmosphere continued. I sipped my beer, listening to the conversation.\nIt would be nice if the mood stayed this way…\nWhenever I think that, the attention always turns to me.\n“Lee Han-gyeol focuses so much in class. You should all try to be like him.”\n“Yeah, I’ve never seen Lee Han-gyeol mess around during class.”\n“Well, there’s not much else to do... might as well listen.”\nI just didn’t want to repeat the same mistakes.\nManaging grades from the first year definitely has its advantages, so I put in the effort.\n“Lee Han-gyeol is just a bit different.”\n“I just think it’s good to have good grades. It doesn’t mean much else.”\n“I bet Lee Han-gyeol will be at the top of our department.”\n“That’d be nice. I’d love to get a scholarship.”\n“Oh, that’s worth aiming for!”\nEveryone laughed and giggled. I laughed awkwardly along, but then someone approached our table.\n“Oh, you guys are drinking here?! You should’ve invited us too.”\n“Huh?! Senior! Hello!”\n“Hello, Ji-Eun unnie!”\nShe was clearly tipsy, and though I couldn’t remember well, I had seen her at the semester-opening party.\nI think she was the class representative of the second years... or was she? My memory was foggy.\n“We’re here to celebrate a classmate’s birthday, so we’re all drinking together. Want to join?”\n“Sure! Take a seat over here.”\n“No, just sing the birthday song with us later. We have a lot of people, so we’ll be moving around tables.”\n“Come to our table too!”\n“Sure, sure.”\nThe simple classmate gathering had now turned into a department-wide party.\nWith more people, it would be easier to slip away later.\nAfter that, the deadly drinking games began again, and once more, I was the target.\n“From the sky comes! The rabbit says! One Shot! One Shot! Bunny bunny bunny bunny-!”\n“Carrot carrot!”\n“Bunny bunny bunny bunny-!”\nI have no idea why these guys are so quick with this game. I’m not even that drunk, but I just can’t keep up with the pace of this one.\n“Bang-!”\n“Huh?! Lee Han-gyeol! You’re caught! Drink up!”\n“Who’s drinking?! Lee Han-gyeol is! Lee Han! Gyeol! One-shot!”\nI downed the beer-filled penalty drink in one gulp, and we immediately transitioned to another drinking game.\nAs long as it wasn’t that stupid ‘Bunny Bunny’ game, I was pretty adept at the rest, so I didn’t have to drink as much.\nAs the games continued, I could see more and more people getting drunk.\nJust as Seunghoon was about to drink his penalty and start another game, a few seniors approached our table with their drinks.\n“Hey everyone~”\n“Jung-Hyuk Hyung? Hello.”\n“Hey. Chae-in Jeong, you’re here too?”\n“Oh, hello.”\nChae-in Jeong’s usually bright expression darkened a bit. I hadn’t known her for long, but the situation seemed pretty clear.\n“Mind if we join?”\n“Of course not~ Please sit!”\nThe seniors naturally took seats at our table, and Jung-Hyuk sat next to Chae-in Jeong. She looked a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t my place to intervene. She’s twenty; she can handle herself.\nAt first, the conversation steered towards major classes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were having a constructive discussion.\nOne of the seniors shared tips about the classes, and another offered to provide past exam papers if needed. But that constructive talk didn’t last long.\nAs we resumed the drinking games, the atmosphere quickly reverted to the initial chaos.\n“What drinking games do you guys know?”\n“Us? Bunny Bunny, Sam-Yuk-Gu game, Babo game, and others?!”\n“Then let’s play Attendance! Attendance game!”\nWhat the heck is that?\n“You’ll learn as we go-! Attendance! Attendance! Attendance!”\n“Chae-in Jeong~”\n“Yes!”\n“Alright~ Chae-in Jeong drinks and we start~”\n“What?!”\nMost of us, except the seniors, ended up drinking two penalty drinks because of this new game we had never heard of before. But once we got the hang of it, the game became familiar, and we weren’t getting caught as often.\nI figured I had drunk enough for the night and started thinking of an exit strategy.\n“Does anyone smoke?”\n“None of us do, I think~? Ugh... I feel like I’ve drunk too much.”\n“Then we’ll go for a smoke break ourselves~”\nThe seniors left the table, and I saw my chance to leave quietly.\nThe others were already too drunk to notice if I disappeared.\n“I’m going to the bathroom.”\n“You better not sneak out!”\n“Yeah, Lee Han-gyeol. You’re staying till the end tonight, right?”\n“Sure, sure.”\nI felt a bit guilty toward Seunghoon and Jaehyun, but it was really late. I grabbed my phone and headed out of the building, planning to go home.\nJust as I stepped outside, I heard familiar voices from between the buildings.\n- Did you see? Honestly, Chae-in Jeong is the prettiest among the freshmen.\n- Yeah. I first saw her at the semester-opening party, she looked kind of innocent.\n- She has a pure look, and her chest is quite big up close, too.\n- Are you planning to take her to your place tonight?\n- She’s drunk, so what can she do?\n- You’re such a scumbag.\nWhy did I have to hear that?\nI was about to walk away, thinking it wasn’t my business. I barely knew Chae-in Jeong; we hadn’t even known each other for a month.\nThere was no reason for me to get involved...\n“Haa... damn it.”\nI turned back. I really hate myself.\n****\nEventually, I returned to my seat. The seniors were already back, and as expected, one of them was sitting next to Chae-in Jeong. She was struggling to keep her eyes open, clearly very drunk.\nGet a grip. You’re about to spend the night with that scumbag.\n“Hey, Chae-in Jeong. You look really drunk. Maybe you should head home now.”\n“Huh...? I-I’m not drunk at all.”\nIt’s frustrating. She has no idea why I’m staying.\n“Sure~ Hang out a bit longer, Chae-in Jeong. Lee Han-gyeol, right? If you’re drunk, just go home. I’ll make sure Chae-in Jeong gets home safely.”\nTo your place, you bastard.\n“Ah, I’ve decided to stay till the end tonight.”\n“Wow... Lee Han-gyeol, you’re really cool. Here, have a drink.”\n“Yeah... Lee Han-gyeol staying till the end... That’s a first.”\nEven Jaehyun and Seunghoon, who were too drunk to function, looked up to support me at that moment. The camaraderie is strong, I guess.\nBut the real issue is how to get Chae-in Jeong home. That senior doesn’t seem like he’ll let her go easily, and she’s in no state to go home alone.\nThe best chance would be to sneak her into a taxi when everyone leaves...\nWhat if that chance doesn’t come? I can’t exactly force the issue.\nEven if I mentioned what I overheard, I have no evidence or witnesses. I might just be seen as a liar.\nIf that doesn’t work...\n“Ugh... I need to go to the bathroom...”\nChae-in Jeong mumbled as she grabbed her phone. The senior didn’t seem inclined to follow her to the bathroom, thankfully.\nHe seemed reassured by her leaving her bag behind, fiddling with his phone as soon as she left.\nHe was so focused on Chae-in Jeong that he didn’t even notice me leaving the table. I stood silently by the entrance, planning to escort Chae-in Jeong when she returned, but she was taking forever.\nIf that senior gets up and comes out, it’ll be trouble... I can’t wait by the women’s bathroom either.\nAfter a moment of deliberation, I decided to ask a passing woman to bring her out. But as I stepped outside, I saw Chae-in Jeong sitting on the stairs, leaning her head against the wall.\n“Whoa! You scared me. What are you doing here?”\n“Ugh...”\n“This is a mess. Hey, get up. Take a taxi and go home.”\n“Ugh... I want ice cream...”\nThis girl is seriously frustrating...! If you stay here, that senior is going to come looking for you.\n“Haa... I’ll buy you ice cream, so get up.”\n“Really...?”\n“Yeah. I’ll buy it, just get up and come outside. I can’t help you up.”\n“I’m not drunk...! See? I can walk just fine...!”\nAs soon as she grabbed the railing and struggled outside, I flagged down the nearest taxi.\n“Get in.”\n“What about the ice cream...?”\n“I’ll buy it once you’re in.”\n“Yay~”\nThe moment she got into the backseat and closed her eyes, I quickly asked, “Hey, what’s your address? Tell me before you fall asleep.”\n“Here~”\nUgh, this is annoying...\n“Stop messing around and just tell me.”\n“Hehe... this is my house~”\nI can’t waste any more time... If that senior comes out, it’ll be a bigger problem.\n“Hey, student. Are we going or not?”\n“Oh...! Driver, can you do me a favor? Could you drive around for about 30 minutes and then come back to the university gate?”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“It’s just that someone keeps bothering her, and we barely managed to get away. Could you please come back to the university gate in 30 minutes? I’ll leave my card with you.”\n“Is this dangerous?”\n“No, it’s just that someone might come out looking for her soon. Please, I’m begging you.”\n“Hmm... okay.”\n“Thank you so much.”\nAfter the taxi left, I went back up the stairs. Just as I was going up, I ran into the senior coming down.\n“Oh, you’re Lee Han-gyeol, right? Have you seen Chae-in Jeong?”\n“Chae-in Jeong? I think I saw her getting into a taxi while I was smoking. Wasn’t she in the bathroom?”\n“Oh... she got in a taxi? Even without her bag?”\n“I’m not sure if it was her exactly... it could have been someone else.”\n“Thanks for letting me know.”\n“Sure.”\nI lied without hesitation and continued up the stairs.\nI need to get to the university gate in about 30 minutes... I’m already scared of telling Eun-ha about this.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As soon as Chae-in Jeong disappeared, the seniors sitting at our table left right away. I timed it just right to grab her bag and head toward the university’s main gate.\nNot long after, the taxi that had picked up Chae-in Jeong arrived.\n“Thank you, driver. Here’s the fare.”\n“Be careful going in. Drink moderately. No matter how young you are, you need to take care of your health.”\n“Yes, I’ll be careful. Take care. Hey, Chae-in Jeong. Get out quickly.”\n“Ugh... I don’t want to...!”\n“Get out quickly.”\nChae-in Jeong, who seemed to have sobered up a bit inside the taxi, stumbled out.\nShe sat on the bench in front of the main gate, but she was still nodding off.\n“Hey... Are you feeling better?”“Ugh... I feel like I’m going to die...”\n“Geez, where do you live?”\n“Here... isn’t this my house?”\n“Forget it.”\n“I’m dizzy... Ugh!”\nChae-in Jeong nodded off and then fell backward.\n“Ugh... My head hurts.”\n“Hey! Are you okay?”\n“Hehe... But it’s comfortable.”\nSince she said she was comfortable, I didn’t bother to lift her up.\nBeing alone with her made me a bit nervous.\nShould I call Eun-ha?\nShe did say to call if a girl needed help. Would she be mad?\nShe told me not to help girls just last week...! But I couldn’t just leave her here...\n“Let’s call...!”\nI cautiously dialed Eun-ha’s number, feeling very anxious.\nAfter a few rings, Eun-ha picked up.\n“Hey, Eun-ha...?”\n- Hmm? What’s wrong with your voice?\nI got chills just thinking about Eun-ha’s bright voice turning serious.\n“Well… it’s a bit of a weird situation…! I just wanted to prevent any potential trouble…!”\n- What’s going on?\nEun-ha’s voice turned serious. Her concerned tone gave me the courage to speak.\n“A female classmate got drunk and passed out on the street. What should I do…?!”\nThere was silence on the other end for a few seconds.\n- Han-gyeol.\n“Yeah?”\n- Send me your location and wait right there.\nClick-\nEun-ha hung up.\n“This is bad... I’m in for it. Ugh- Should I not have helped her? Hah... Whatever. I can’t change it now. It’s my karma.”\nI immediately messaged Eun-ha that I was at the university’s main gate. She’ll save me, right?\n****\nI waited patiently for Eun-ha at the university’s main gate. Chae-in Jeong was still sprawled out on the ground.\nThere wasn’t much more I could do for her at this point.\nShould I have called the police instead? Wait, no. That would mean I lied to Eun-ha. Either way, it’s terrifying-\n“Han-gyeol-! Where are you!”\n“Gasp-! Over here!”\nIt hadn’t even been ten minutes, and Eun-ha had already arrived at the main gate, running.\nWhy did her footsteps sound so menacing, even with her hood pulled up?\nEvery step she took toward me made me want to step back, but I held my ground.\nAs soon as she reached me, she threw back her hood and looked at me like a predator about to pounce on its prey.\n“Where is she? I’m really curious to see what kind of girl my boyfriend decided to help. How long have you two been alone at the university’s main gate this late at night? There must be quite a distance from the drinking spot to here, so how did you manage to bring a passed-out girl all this way? You didn’t carry her on your back, did you? If I find your scent on her, she would better be prepared. And just so we’re clear, be prepared doesn’t just apply to her. You’d deserve an appropriate punishment too, right?”\nWow- this is definitely not going well. But I moved her in a taxi, so there was no physical contact, meaning I might just pass her last question.\n“Well... A male senior was trying to take her to his place...! I asked the taxi driver to bring her here first, then I finished up at the bar, grabbed her bag, and walked to the gate. I didn’t carry her or make any physical contact. She’s just over there, passed out on the ground. She looked comfortable, so I didn’t wake her up. That’s it.”\nI answered Eun-ha’s questions, but her eyes still burned with intensity.\n“You could have sent her home in the taxi. Why bring her to the university gate?”\n“I didn’t know her address. When I asked, she kept insisting this was her house! I thought wasting time would mean the senior might come out, so I sent her here in the taxi first.”\nAs I rambled on, Eun-ha seemed to understand the situation.\n“So? That girl over there lying on the ground is the one?”\n“Yes.”\n“Got it. Leave the rest to me.”\nEun-ha walked past me and approached Chae-in Jeong. She frowned as she looked down at the unconscious girl.\n“Wait a second. Is she...”\n“Huh?”\nOh- of all people, it had to be Chae-in Jeong... I’m doomed.\n“Isn’t she the classmate who smiled at you during lunch that time? And the one who asked to borrow your printouts and gave you a canned coffee?”\n“That... that’s true, but those are separate incidents...”\n“It’s annoying how she keeps getting involved with you...”\nUnaware of the danger to her life, Chae-in Jeong continued to lie there peacefully.\n“Now I don’t feel like helping her...”\n“Should I call the police?”\n“No. If a police car picks up a female student at the university gate, weird rumors might spread. She’s a freshman and it’s early in the semester, so strange rumors could cause trouble for her. Let’s just get her to sit up.”\nEun-ha walked over to Chae-in Jeong and started to lift her up.\nEun-ha propped up the slumped-over Chae-in Jeong and sat her on the bench.\nShe shook her shoulders and shouted.\n“Chae-in Jeong! Get a hold of yourself!”\n“Ugh... I’m so dizzy...”\n“What’s your address? Tell me your home address, quickly! Otherwise, I’ll leave you here!”\n“Isn’t this... my home?”\n“Give me your address before I actually make this your home.”\n“Gyeonggi-do... Ansan-si...”\nAnsan...? That’s almost two hours from here!\n“You live in Ansan? You don’t have a place nearby? Where’s your dorm?”\n“Sorry... I can’t remember...”\nChae-in Jeong dropped her head onto Eun-ha’s shoulder. This was like pouring fuel on the fire.\n“Han-gyeol, did her family call at all?”\n“I didn’t check her phone. There were no calls when we were together.”\n“If no one has contacted her by this hour, she probably lives alone... Has she ever mentioned living alone?”\n“We’re not that close, so I don’t know. Should we unlock her phone with Face ID and try calling her family? Or is that too much?”\n“Yeah... It’s a bit invasive to unlock someone else’s phone. The best option might be to take her home.”\n“But we don’t know her address. And we’re not even sure if she lives alone.”\n“Huh? I meant our home.”\n“Our home?”\nI tilted my head in confusion.\n“Yeah, our home.”\n“W-wait a minute?! The home where you and I live?”\n“We can’t take her to her family’s place at this hour, and leaving her alone in a nearby motel feels unsafe.”\n“Even so, bringing her to our home is a bit much...”\n“You’ve already helped her. You have to take responsibility till the end.”\n“Sorry, I didn’t expect things to escalate this much. I thought she’d sober up by now.”\nWhen I apologized to Eun-ha, she looked up at me and said.\n“I’m jealous, but you don’t need to apologize. I understand your intentions for helping her. I’m jealous, but I’m not angry.”\nI felt a bit touched by Eun-ha’s words.\n“Could you grab her bag for me?”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“You’re not thinking of carrying her home on your back, are you?”\n“Of course not...! Should I call a taxi then?”\n“It’s not that far, so I’ll help her walk.”\n“Got it.”\nEun-ha carefully draped Chae-in Jeong’s arm over her shoulder and stood up slowly.\n“Let’s go...”\n“Okay.”\nEun-ha struggled to move Chae-in Jeong to our place.\nShe was panting heavily but never once asked for my help.\nFinally, she threw Chae-in Jeong onto the living room sofa and let out a deep breath.\n“Phew... I thought I was going to die.”\n“Good job.”\n“Yeah, yeah. Han-gyeol, you’re sleeping at the jjimjilbang* tonight.”\n“Huh? Why?”\nEun-ha glanced down at Chae-in Jeong’s face and replied, a sly smile creeping onto her lips.\n“From here on out, it’s a matter between women.”\n“What...?”\n“Well, I can’t just send a girl who got help from my Han-gyeol home quietly, can I?”\nThe moonlight streaming through the curtains illuminated Eun-ha’s face. It looked like a scene straight out of a thriller movie.\n“Don’t worry, Han-gyeol. I’ll make sure she gets home safely. You aren’t still worried about her, are you? Your concern should have ended the moment you put her in that taxi. You weren’t actually planning to spend the night in the same house as this girl, even with me here, were you? That won’t do. The only woman who gets to spend the night with you is me. Forever. Right?”\nIf I refuse, I’m dead.\n“I’ll be back tomorrow afternoon.”\n“Great~ Be careful, and let me know when you get to the jjimjilbang, okay?”\nRealizing that defying Eun-ha might be dangerous, I carefully put on my shoes.\nJust before leaving, I spoke to Eun-ha one more time, just in case.\n“Uh, Eun-ha.”\n“Yes, yes! What is it, my lovely Han-gyeol?”\n“Um... Don’t kill her, okay?”\nEun-ha only smiled sweetly in response, without saying a word.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: *: Jjimjilbang are bathhouses in South Korea.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "-Bee-bee-beep-! Bee-bee-beep-!\nI woke up to the sound of the alarm clock blaring from the bedroom.\nLast night, after sending off Han-gyeol, I had slept on the living room floor.\nAs I stretched and got up, what greeted my eyes was not Han-gyeol, but his colleague, who was sound asleep, oblivious to the world.\nHer name was Chae-in Jeong. The first time I saw her was during lunch on the first day of the semester.\nEven then, I thought she had quite a pretty face.\nI didn’t think she’d have any connection to Han-gyeol, so I didn’t pay much attention... But I never imagined I would get so deeply involved with her.\nYou never know what life has in store, do you?\n“Don’t fall for Han-gyeol. Got it?”\nI murmured to the sleeping Chae-in Jeong. It seemed silly to speak to someone who was asleep, but I had to give the warning.If I told her about last night, she might fall for Han-gyeol. To be honest, it was a situation too perfect for falling in love.\nFirst, I got up and turned off the alarm clock in the bedroom. I tidied up the bedding and took it to the bedroom, then gently shook Chae-in Jeong to wake her up.\n“Chae-in Jeong, it’s time to wake up~”\n“Ughhh...”\nShe twisted and turned, not waking up easily. If she kept this up, I’d be tempted to just bury her.\n“Come on, wake up~ Before I bury you behind the school~ Get up~ Hurry up~”\n“Mmm...? Bury...? Who...?”\n“Who else? The person sleeping so soundly in someone else’s house~”\nI smiled brightly at Chae-in Jeong.\n“But who...!”\nHer closed eyes slowly opened and met mine as I squatted next to her.\nHer eyes widened, and she opened her mouth wide, screaming.\n“Ahhhhh-! Who are you?! What are you doing here?!”\n“That’s a stronger reaction than I expected. Don’t you remember last night?”\n“L-Last night...? I... I was drinking with my colleagues, and then the seniors joined in...”\n“Anyway, take your time remembering and go wash up. You slept without removing your makeup.”\n“But who are you...? Are you a senior...? I’ve never seen you before!”\n“I’m not a bad person, probably?”\n“What-?!”\nHan-gyeol’s actions were right, but it’s hard for me to be kind to a girl my boyfriend helped.\n“Hey...! Who are you really?”\nI went to the kitchen, tied an apron around my waist, and opened the refrigerator.\nShe had been through a lot, so the least I could do was make her breakfast.\n“Think about it slowly. You can wash up in the bathroom.”\n“Wait-! Please explain properly first...!”\n“Sorry~ I’m in a bit of a bad mood and don’t feel like explaining everything right now~ I’ll tell you everything after you wash up~”\nChae-in Jeong could have been angry at my half-hearted answers, but she just sat on the sofa, staring at me blankly.\n“I feel like I’ve seen you before... Are you a senior?”\n“We do go to the same college~ Ah, we could have chicken stew.”\nI took a chicken out of the fridge. It was a whole chicken that needed to be cleaned and prepped.\n“Um, first... I’m sorry for the trouble-!”\n“You should apologize to someone else after you remember. Do you know how many times I’ve told you to wash up~?”\n“Oh-! Sorry, sorry. I’ll wash up now-!”\nSeeing that she was properly dressed and recognizing that she was a woman, she didn’t seem too cautious.\nShe seemed to mistake me for a senior in our department... Well, I could explain everything once she remembered.\nChae-in Jeong got up from the sofa and cautiously headed to the bathroom, glancing at me as she went. The sound of running water soon filled the air, and I immediately began prepping the chicken.\nI washed it in cold water, cut off the tail, and trimmed the fat.\nThen, I took out a cutting board and started breaking down the chicken with a knife.\nI had bought it because it was on sale at the market, but next time I would just buy pre-prepped chicken.\nThere was supposed to be a sequence to breaking it down, but I couldn’t remember, so I just went with the flow.\nBut whether it was the wrong order or a dull knife, it wasn’t going as planned.\n“It’s not working. I’ll need a different knife...”\nLuckily, there was a large cleaver in the knife block.\nJust as I raised my hand to chop, Chae-in Jeong came out of the bathroom at the perfect moment.\n“Huh?”\nShe seemed startled to see me in the kitchen, chopping the chicken. But seeing the chicken on the cutting board, she seemed slightly relieved.\nLittle did she know, it was too early to be relieved.\n“Uh, um...!”\n“Yes?”\n“I’ve washed up, so now can you tell me who you are? Are you a senior? I was too drunk last night to remember...”\n“I’m not a senior. We’re the same age.”\n“What? The same age? So you’re twenty?”\nI nodded silently.\n“Then who...”\n“A bit hurtful~? We’ve met before and even had drinks together, but you don’t remember. Though, we never properly introduced ourselves, so it’s understandable.”\n“We’ve met before...”\nShe seemed to recall something as she looked at my face.\n“Oh...? Could it be...?!”\n“Do you remember now? How could you pretend not to? A bit hurtful, really.”\n“Han-gyeol’s girlfriend...”\n“That’s right. I’m Han-gyeol’s girlfriend~ We drank together at the start of the semester party, remember?”\nThe moment she realized who I was, Chae-in Jeong froze. She stared at me silently before hurriedly bowing and apologizing.\n“Oh...! I’m so sorry...! I’ll just leave now-!”\nRealizing how awkward the situation was, she quickly grabbed her bag and phone. But I couldn’t let her go just like that.\n“Come on~ You should hear how you got here last night~”\nI stood in front of the shoe rack, blocking Chae-in Jeong from leaving.\nIn my hurry, I still held the cleaver I had been using to prep the chicken. It was a mistake, I swear. I had no intention of intimidating her.\n“A bit hurtful~? I personally brought you here last night, and you’re just going to leave like that?”\nI smiled sweetly at Chae-in Jeong, who was trying to leave. Then, I carefully closed the distance between us.\n“Aren’t you curious about what happened last night? Why you’re here? How you got here? I’ll tell you everything from start to finish. So, instead of thinking about running away, why don’t you sit on the sofa, wait for me, and then we can have a nice breakfast together and talk over coffee. Doesn’t that sound like a great idea? If you’re okay with it, could you also tell me about how Han-gyeol is doing in his department? We were always together in high school, but now that we’re in different departments, I’m curious as his girlfriend. You’ll tell me, right? You’re not going to just run away, right, Chae-in Jeong?”\nMy expression must have been a bit intimidating because Chae-in Jeong looked absolutely terrified.\n“Eek-! Um, um! Could you put the knife down first?!”\n“Oh, this?! You’ll try to run the moment I put this in the sink, right? I know all your tricks~”\n“I won’t run away-!”\n“Really? Can I trust you? If you run, I’ll chase you.”\nTerrified, Chae-in Jeong silently nodded.\n“Then, sit on the sofa.”\n“N-no! I’ll help-! Please let me help!”\n“Do you know how to cook? Do you know how to prep a chicken?”\n“N-no! Just, just simple things-!”\n“Then come over here-! Prepping the chicken is a bit fun, I’ll show you!”\nI brought Chae-in Jeong, who had offered to help, to the kitchen.\n“Watch carefully~? You might need to cook chicken for your boyfriend someday~”\n“Yes...”\n“When cutting meat, it’s easy if you bend the joints like this. With a satisfying snap, the bone pops out of the meat like this. You could just tear it apart with your hands, but like this-!”\nWith a thud, I brought the knife down. I lifted the cleanly cut piece of meat and showed it to Chae-in Jeong.\n“Tada~ It’s cleanly cut like this. Easy, right?”\n“Yes...”\n“After you’ve prepped the chicken, you need to clean the innards that might give off a bad smell. Use your fingers to clean the innards between the bones. It might feel a bit gross at first, but you’ll get used to it. It’s better to eat clean, right?”\n“Y-yes... Haha...”\nAfter prepping the chicken, I quickly made chicken stew and placed it on the table.\n“I’m not sure if it’ll suit your taste~ but it’s made with care, so it should be delicious~”\n“Yes...! It looks really appetizing-!”\n“Really? I should make it for Han-gyeol next time too. It must be hard on the stomach, so let’s eat it with the broth.”\n“Yes... Thank you for the meal.”\nStill, it’s best not to bother someone while they’re eating.\n“Let’s talk after you finish eating~”\n“Pardon?”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "After finishing breakfast, we started talking over a cup of warm cocoa.\n“I’m not sure where to start. Honestly, I only heard about what happened at the drinking party from Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah- We were definitely drinking together, but then we ran into the second-year seniors. They said they came to drink together because it was a classmate’s birthday.”\n“Ah- Yes, Han-gyeol told me that in a text. Han-gyeol said you drank with the second-year seniors, is that right?”\n“Yes...! But there were some uncomfortable seniors there.”\nThere was no difference from what Han-gyeol had said.\n“Han-gyeol said the same thing. And then you got drunk, right?”\n“Probably... I think so, but I don’t remember after that...”\nI took a sip of cocoa and continued speaking.\n“This might sound unpleasant... but it seems like one of the seniors who was drinking with you tried to do something bad to you, Chae-in Jeong. Han-gyeol said that someone tried to take you to their place, but somehow he found out and helped you.”“What?!”\nShe must be surprised that she was in danger.\nIt would be a bit tricky if she fell for Han-gyeol’s kindness.\nIf that happens, I might have to take out the chopping board again.\n“You should hear the details from Han-gyeol. He said he managed to get you into a taxi. He was planning to send you home before the seniors came out, but you didn’t tell him your address. In a hurry, he asked the taxi driver to drive around and then drop you off at the university gate. Thirty minutes later, Han-gyeol found you at the gate, called me, and I took you to my place. That’s all I know.”\nThere were no objections to my explanation.\n“I’m sorry for the trouble I caused.”\n“The ones at fault are those seniors, so there’s no need for you to apologize. Are you okay? If you feel uncomfortable, you can take a moment to gather yourself.”\n“What? No-! Nothing happened in the end, and I was cautious of that senior, but... I drank too much yesterday...”\n“It’s good to be a bit more cautious. You were completely wasted last night.”\n“I’m sorry...”\n“There you go again. I said it’s okay, so can I ask you a few things?”\n“What? Yes-!”\nI slowly leaned in closer to Chae-in Jeong.\n“I’ll tell you in advance that I have a strong sense of possession and jealousy... I consider it a flaw, but I can’t seem to fix it. So, you need to answer carefully... Did you fall for Han-gyeol because of what happened? Or did you already have feelings for him? If it’s affection you have for Han-gyeol... to what extent is it? It’s okay. Be honest. Go ahead.”\nDepending on her answer, I had to decide my actions.\nRight now, I was the most nervous asking these questions.\nChae-in Jeong slowly opened her mouth and then shook her head.\n“N-No-!”\n“When I first saw you during lunch and at the start of the semester party, when you borrowed Han-gyeol’s printout and gave him canned coffee... I’ve been watching you closely. It felt like you were often involved with Han-gyeol... As his girlfriend, I can’t help but look at it with suspicion.”\n“Eeek-! It’s not like that, so please relax your expression...! O-Of course, when I first saw him, I thought he was very handsome-! But it was nothing more than that-!”\nNot exactly a safe answer.\n“Ah... So can I interpret it as you having some level of affection for my Han-gyeol?”\n“Ahhh-! No! It’s something any girl in our department would have thought at least once-!”\nMy face turned cold.\nIt’s better to cut off the buds of anxiety early for the future.\nBut... if what she says is true, there are too many anxious buds.\n“So... Han-gyeol is quite popular in your department, huh...?”\n“Well-! He is definitely good-looking-! But I don’t like him or anything like that-! I just thought I wanted to get closer to him!”\n“Why...? Wanting to get closer to someone of the opposite sex is a form of affection, isn’t it...?”\n“Well-! He seemed to have a clear sense of self and appeared to be a good person! There’s always someone who attracts those around them, right?! That was exactly Han-gyeol!”\nAnother precarious answer.\nIt seems like I might have to take out the chopping board and knife again.\nIt’s something I’ll have to endure as the girlfriend of a handsome boyfriend...\n“Chae-in Jeong...?”\n“Yes...?”\n“I have no personal hard feelings for you.”\n“Isn’t that something someone would say before killing someone...?”\n“Oh? Was it?”\nI carefully got up from my seat.\n“W-Wait a minute! Stop! Please stop! Your eyes! Please soften your gaze!”\n“What about my eyes? My Han-gyeol always tells me they’re beautiful~. Are you denying the love Han-gyeol has for me? That’s basically denying me, you know?”\n“N-No! But it’s true that everyone in our department knows how much Han-gyeol likes his girlfriend!”\nHmm? This was an interesting topic.\n“Can you tell me more? Did Han-gyeol brag about me to your department...?!”\n“Not so blatantly, but... how should I put it? It just seemed that way to us...”\n“Tell me in detail.”\nI sat back down in my seat.\n“Well...! It was something that came up when we were talking among the girls... You know how Han-gyeol is usually aloof, right?”\n“Yes, continue. I’m listening.”\nI was curious about how Han-gyeol behaved when I wasn’t around.\n“At first, everyone thought Han-gyeol was just a cold guy! That was the first impression! But some girls said they saw him smiling brightly when he was on the phone or texting outside the classroom...! We were sure it was his girlfriend!”\nListening to Chae-in Jeong’s words made my cheeks flush slightly.\nEven when I wasn’t there... Han-gyeol was smiling thinking about me…\nI was so embarrassed that my ears were turning red.\n“What do the other girls say...?”\n“Well... there were some who said they wished they could be loved like that too and... also-”\n“What? All of Han-gyeol’s love belongs to me! Do you know their addresses?”\n“That’s scary...!”\n“Ahem...! Continue.”\nFor now, I decided to keep listening.\n“Seeing that, there were girls who said they envied Han-gyeol’s girlfriend-!”\n“Hehe... That’s embarrassing! Of course, Han-gyeol may seem cold usually, but he is incredibly warm when he smiles! The biggest charm of Han-gyeol is the contrast between his expressionless face and his smiling face! And he’s great at cooking and always helps when asked! I think Han-gyeol is way too good for me~ Talking about it makes me miss him again.”\n“Ah! Come to think of it, when is Han-gyeol coming? I want to thank him before I go.”\n“What? Why would Han-gyeol come here?”\nI asked, tilting my head in confusion.\nChae-in Jeong also tilted her head as she answered.\n“Aren’t you living together?”\nChae-in Jeong and I were silent for a few seconds.\nBut one thing was clear.\n“I need to get rid of you...”\n“Eek! Why! Why?! Spare me...!”\nI stood up from my seat again.\n“How did you know? There’s no way Han-gyeol would tell anyone we’re living together... No, that’s not important. I’m sorry. I still have no personal feelings. It’s all for the sake of me and Han-gyeol’s life... Please, make a sacrifice.”\nI slowly approached Chae-in Jeong.\n“W-Wait a minute! What’s wrong with living together?! It’s possible, isn’t it?!”\n“Hmm... Do you really think so? Living together at twenty might look strange to some people. That’s why we kept it a secret...”\n“Too many things give it away to call it a secret-!”\n“Tell me.”\nIt’s important to know what to improve after dealing with her.\n“There are two toothbrushes in the bathroom-! There are men’s shoes in the shoe cabinet-! And I saw that there are too many dishes in the kitchen for someone living alone...! I naturally figured you were living together-!”\n“Huh... You’re quite perceptive. I appreciate it. Then-”\nWait a minute. I grabbed onto the tail of a sudden thought.\nIn just a short time, she figured out we were living together and from our conversation, it seemed like she didn’t have romantic feelings for Han-gyeol.\nBut it was clear that Han-gyeol was quite popular in the department and knowing about the girls who might target him when I’m not around would be useful.\nSo, it would be a rational choice to establish an information network.\nAnd in front of me was a girl who seemed likely to cooperate.\nWhat’s this? A lucky find?\n“Your name is Chae-in Jeong, right?”\n“Yes!”\n“Do you want to be friends?”\n“Suddenly?!”\n“Let’s be friends. You’re Chae-in, right? Nice to meet you.”\n“Suddenly talking informally?!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "[Eun-ha: Han-gyeol. I think you can come home now. Be careful!]\nAs soon as I saw the message from Eun-ha, I started to worry.\nLast night, I was too drunk to be concerned, but now... As I recalled Eun-ha’s expression, a chill ran down my spine.\nI hurried my steps, anxious that something might have happened.\n“Whoo...!”\nStanding in front of the door, I took a deep breath and entered the passcode.\nWhen the door opened and I stepped inside, I saw Eun-ha’s feet at the entrance.\nSlowly, I raised my gaze from her toes to meet her eyes.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re back?!”\n“Hmm-?”I worried she might be looking at me with cold eyes, but it was just the usual Eun-ha.\nSeeing her greet me with a bright smile, I felt somewhat relieved.\n“Yeah, I’m back. Have you eaten, Eun-ha?”\n“I was waiting to eat with you~”\n“Did Choi Jiyoung go home?”\n“Yeah, yeah! We talked for a long time after breakfast and decided to be friends!”\n“Friends?”\n“Yes! Friends! She said she wants to have lunch next time and thank you too. Let’s go together.”\nIt seemed like she had sent Choi Jiyoung home. But there was something slightly different about Eun-ha’s demeanor today.\nShe seemed oddly excited, but why?\n“Okay. Nothing happened, right?”\n“Hey~ Do you think I would do something to Choi Jiyoung?”\n“Ah, no. It’s not that-”\n“I’ll get mad if you worry about other girls~”\nSomething felt off... or maybe it didn’t...\n“Are you hungry? I made some soybean paste stew. Let’s eat and talk afterward~”\n“No wonder the house smelled so good when I came in. I’ll go change my clothes.”\n“Okay! Hurry, I want to see you~”\n“Alright~”\nI carefully closed the door to the bedroom where the wardrobe was.\nAs I changed my clothes, I quickly processed the situation in my mind.\nThis must be how a husband feels when his wife smiles and says they need to talk.\nI guess Eun-ha might not like that I took care of a female colleague.\nIf I were in her shoes, would I be okay with it? Honestly, it wouldn’t feel good.\nIt would be strange to act like it didn’t matter. So what does this mean for me going forward?\n“Han-gyeol~ Have you changed your clothes?”\n“Oh-?! Yeah. I’m coming out now.”\nShe didn’t even give me time to think. After changing my clothes, I looked at the meal prepared in the living room.\n“Come on, eat up~ You didn’t have a proper breakfast, right?”\n“Ah- I had an egg at the sauna.”\n“Is that enough? Hurry and eat.”\n“Alright.”\nEun-ha didn’t seem much different from usual.\nWas I just being paranoid?\n“Tasty?”\n“Yeah. It tastes even better today~”\n“That’s good. If you need more, just say so~”\nShe seemed even more considerate than usual.\n“Do you want to talk before eating?”\n“Um... no. Let’s talk after we finish eating.”\n“We can talk now if you want.”\n“I still need to gather my thoughts. Let’s eat first, okay?”\n“Alright.”\nIt was best to eat quickly and then talk to Eun-ha.\nAfter we finished our meal, we cleaned up together and sat on the sofa.\nI couldn’t remember what we usually talked about after lunch.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“Can we talk now?”\n“Sure. What’s on your mind?”\nEun-ha gently cupped my cheek and turned my head to face her. Looking straight into my eyes, she slowly began to speak her mind.\n“First of all, what you did yesterday was the right thing.”\n“Huh?”\n“The girl could have been in danger, so you did well. I don’t blame you. In fact, I should commend you. If something like that happens again, help out just like you did last night. But, it’s important that you don’t put yourself in danger. Understand? I want you to think of yourself first. Do you get what I’m saying?”\nI nodded silently.\n“Now, here’s the main point... I’m just being honest, so I want you to answer honestly too.”\n“Okay. What is it?”\nEun-ha seemed hesitant, as if she was struggling with what to say.\n“Eun-ha, it’s alright. You can tell me.”\nThis was my choice. I had to take responsibility.\n“Well...!”\n“Yeah?”\nWhat was she trying to say?\n“Before, I told you that I already feel loved enough and that you didn’t need to love me more, right?”\n“Yes, you did. But why bring that up?”\nWhat was she trying to say?\n“I’m taking it back!”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\n“Because of this incident, I realized something! I want you to love me more! It’s not that I feel unloved, but I want you to be kinder to me than to other girls, and I want you to pay more attention to me! I want more physical affection and for you to call my name more often! You don’t have to do it all the time, but especially on days like yesterday when you’re kind to other girls, I want you to show me more love! I hesitated to say this because I didn’t want to burden you... but I got really jealous this time! Of course, what you did was right, but it still made me uncomfortable. So, can you love me more today?”\nI blinked in surprise at Eun-ha’s words. Her face was flushed with embarrassment.\nShe must have found it extremely embarrassing to ask for more love.\n“You’re adorable...”\n“What?!”\nHonestly, I expected her to get angry, but instead, she cutely asked for more love.\nEun-ha, with her flushed cheeks and clear eyes looking up at me, was incredibly adorable.\n“I thought you’d be mad...”\n“Well... I am a bit upset, but what you did was the right thing...!”\nI gently placed my hand on Eun-ha’s head.\nAs I slowly stroked her hair, she quietly accepted my touch, snuggling closer to me.\nIt was incredibly cute how she nestled against me, pushing her head into my hand.\nWhat’s this? She’s even cuter than usual today.\nI wondered how she’d react if I stopped.\nAs I subtly withdrew my hand, Eun-ha quickly grabbed it.\n“It’s not enough...! Do it more.”\n“Are you a cat...?”\n“Hurry, keep petting me...! Keep going until I say stop.”\n“Why are you so cute today?”\n“Wh-what! I’m allowed to be like this today! You took care of another girl, so it’s fair for me to want more today!”\nHer sulking expression was utterly endearing.\nI lifted Eun-ha up and placed her on my lap.\nI wanted to see her flushed face, but she kept turning her head away, trying to hide her face.\n“Let me see your face.”\n“No. It’s embarrassing.”\n“Come on, show me. I want to see it.”\nEventually, Eun-ha showed me her face.\n“You’re about to burst...”\n“You were teasing me! That’s it! No more face for you!”\nShe threw her arms around me, pressing her face against my shoulder, and hugged me tightly without letting go.\n“Did you get jealous?”\n“Of course I did...”\n“Did Choi Jiyoung leave safely?”\n“For now...”\nFor now?\n“That sounds a bit ambiguous. You didn’t kill her, did you?”\n“Why would I kill her?! We just talked, that’s all!”\n“What did you talk about?”\nMeeting my gaze, Eun-ha replied.\n“Han-gyeol... she thinks you’re handsome. Other girls in the department think so too! I wish you weren’t so handsome. What if someone likes you? What if they try to seduce you? Answer me quickly.”\n“What? You’re still thinking about that? I don’t really-”\nShe interrupted me, squirming on my lap.\n“Ahhh-! You’re just oblivious to your own attractiveness! You’re handsome! So, answer me quickly! What will you do if another girl tries to seduce you? If you don’t answer, I’ll take matters into my own hands.”\n“Take matters into your own hands? How?”\n“It’s not something nice, so it’s a secret. Just answer me quickly.”\n“What if my answer doesn’t satisfy you?”\n“If that happens, next time I’ll lock you up and make you look at only me for the rest of your life. I’m not joking. I’m serious.”\nWhat?\n“That’s scary...”\n“You seduced me first... You have to take responsibility. So, answer me. What will you do?”\nI smiled at Eun-ha, who kept pressing for an answer.\n“Eun-ha, honestly, I only have eyes for you. You’re the prettiest, cutest, and most lovable person in the world. So don’t worry about it~ There’s no one more beautiful or cuter than you. I truly love only you. It’s sad that there’s no way to prove it.”\n“Then hurry and love me more. Come on- quick! Pet my head again and hug me!”\nEven Eun-ha being clingy and demanding more love was incredibly adorable.\n“Should I give you a kiss too?”\n“Only after you brush your teeth...!”\n“What about doing more than just a kiss?”\n“...Actually, that’s what I want the most.”\nWith those words, I lifted Eun-ha, still holding her tightly, off the sofa.\n“Eek-! I just ate, so I must be heavy-! Put me down quickly!”\nShe wriggled in my arms, concerned about her weight.\n“Nope, you’re really light. Come on, let’s go shower.”\n“Together...?”\n“Yeah. Together. Is that okay?”\nFinally, Eun-ha clung tightly to my shirt and replied.\n“I like that...”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The showerhead was pouring water, and we were passionately kissing under it.\nHan-gyeol gently brushed my wet hair behind my ears while caressing my body.\nFeeling Han-gyeol's loving and tender touch filled me with happiness from deep within, making me wish he would touch me more.\nI wanted his hands to graze every part of my body.\n\"Han-gyeol...! Touch me more...!\"\nMy mind was filled with nothing but Han-gyeol, and I pleaded for more. As he pulled me tightly against him, his hard member pressed against my body.\n\"Han-gyeol... I can't take it anymore, hurry...!\"\nI wanted to be one with him as soon as possible.\nI grasped his large length with my hand and gently moved it. I wanted him so badly... I wanted Han-gyeol to fill me completely.\n\"Put it inside me...\"Han-gyeol's eyes trembled slightly as he whispered in my ear.\n\"Turn around...\"\n\"Okay...\"\nAs I turned and placed my hands against the wall, Han-gyeol firmly grabbed my waist. Slowly, he began to insert his member into me, then thrust all the way in at once.\n\"Ugh...!!\"\nJust the insertion made me come lightly, and Han-gyeol immediately started moving his hips roughly.\nThe sound of our wet skin slapping echoed in the bathroom, creating an intensely erotic atmosphere.\nI bit my lip to stifle my moans, embarrassed by the lewdness of our bathroom encounter.\n\"Ugh...! Ah...!!\"\n\"Eun-ha, you don't have to hold back your moans.\"\n\"I... can't! Ah...!! Han-gyeol, please... slower..! I can't hold it...! Ah...!\"\nBut instead, Han-gyeol moved his hips even more roughly, stirring me up inside.\nMy mind felt like it was going to explode, and I was on the brink of climax.\nAs I tried to hold back my moans, it felt like every cell in my body urged me to let them out.\nOn top of that, Han-gyeol's hand reached my clit and began to tease it with his fingers.\n\"Ahh-!\"\nNo, this was too much. I felt like I would lose my sanity. My whole body tensed, but I couldn't hold on any longer.\n\"Han-gyeol...! No...! Stop...! I really...! Really...!!\"\n\"I love you, Eun-ha. It's okay to let go...!\"\nJust hearing Han-gyeol's voice made my body react.\nThinking about how intensely he wanted me made it even harder to resist.\nI wanted him to hold me tighter, deeper. I wanted to lose myself in him completely.\nI didn't care about anything else... I just wanted to love Han-gyeol more.\n\"Ugh...! Ah...! Ah...! Han-gyeol..! Han-gyeol! I'm going to...! Again...!!\"\n\"Ah-! I'm about to come too...! I love you...!\"\n\"Me too-! I love you too, Han-gyeol! Come inside me...! Faster...! Hold me tighter...!!\"\nAs I climaxed, Han-gyeol pulled out of me. I felt his thick thing slide out, and then a hot stream splashed onto my back.\nMy legs gave out, but Han-gyeol held me close in his arms.\nI wanted to speak... to tell him I love him... but I couldn't say anything.\nMy whole body was still trembling with pleasure. I loved being loved by Han-gyeol...\n\"I love you, Eun-ha...\"\n\"...\"\nI can't live without Han-gyeol anymore. My heart and body are already completely filled with him, and I can't imagine life without him.\nWhat should I do...? No matter how much I try to control it, my feelings for Han-gyeol only grow stronger with time.\nEven now, without the strength to speak, I wrapped my arms around Han-gyeol's neck and kissed him deeply. I continued the intense deep kiss, sucking on his tongue. Ah... I want to have sex with Han-gyeol again...\n\"Han-gyeol... let's go to the bed...\"\n****\nWith only a towel drying us off lightly, we headed straight to the bed. Our hair was still wet, which made Han-gyeol look even sexier.\nAfter laying him down on the bed, I climbed on top of him.\n\"Han-gyeol... tonight, just stay still... okay?\"\n\"Huh? What do you- mmph!\"\nI immediately covered his lips with mine. I wanted my feelings of love and desire to be fully conveyed to him.\nAs I kissed him deeply, I hoped he could feel all my emotions. Right now, all I could think about was making Han-gyeol feel as good as possible.\n\"Don't answer...! Tonight, I'll make you feel good... I love you... I really love you...! Let me do this...!\"\nAfter putting a condom on his member, I slowly lifted my hips and guided him inside me.\n\"I'm putting it in...!\"\nAs I lowered my hips, I felt every inch of him entering me. It felt like I might climax immediately, but I bit my lip and held on.\n\"Ah...! Han-gyeol, it's all in... Han-gyeol... does it feel good?\"\n\"It feels amazing...!\"\nTrying to keep a composed expression, I looked at him. He was gazing at me intently, clearly feeling very good too.\n\"I'm going to move...! Don't hold back, you have to come, okay?\"\n\"Eun-ha...!\"\nHan-gyeol seemed like he wanted to say something, but I started moving my hips right away.\n\"Han-gyeol...! Ahh..!! It's so big...!!\"\nEvery time I lifted and lowered my hips, Han-gyeol's expression twitched. He looked at me with his hands on my waist, and I felt incredible.\nI wanted to make him feel even better.\nI was worried I might tire out and collapse again today. But today... just for today, I wanted to make Han-gyeol feel as good as possible.\nI wanted to be loved more, so I wanted to love him more.\n\"Han-gyeol. I love you...! I think I'll die without you...! It feels so good...!\"\n\"I love you too, Eun-ha. I love you so much.\"\n\"Han-gyeol... hold my hand...!\"\nI intertwined my fingers with his and moved my hips vigorously up and down. Feeling him deeper inside me was driving me crazy...!\n\"Ahh-! Ah..! Ah...!\"\nOh my gosh...! I feel so erotic right now...! With my fingers interlocked with his and my legs spread, I moved my hips.\nWhen I looked down, I could see his member entering me completely. Every time his member hit deep inside me, it felt like my mind was pounding.\nIt was so embarrassing, but it felt so good. Han-gyeol, seemingly aroused by my appearance, was staring intently at me.\n\"I love you...! I love you... Han-gyeol...!\"\n\"Eun-ha...! Slow down a bit...!\"\nEven though Han-gyeol asked me to slow down, I moved my hips even more.\n\"Ahh...! Ah...!! No...! I want to make you feel good-!! Ah...! Ugh..!\"\nI wanted Han-gyeol to climax first, but in the end, I couldn't hold back the overwhelming pleasure and reached my climax again.\nI wished the climax would leave my body as soon as possible, but it lingered within me.\nThe lingering sensation didn't fade since Han-gyeol's member was still firmly inside me.\n\"Eun-ha... did you finish?\"\n\"No...! I didn't...! I didn't, so...! Ah...!!\"\nHan-gyeol sat up and wrapped his arms around my waist.\n\"Eun-ha. Don't push yourself. It felt really good. Let me do it...\"\n\"No...! Tonight...! I'll do it...!\"\nI pushed Han-gyeol back down, refusing to let him take over. I wanted to be in control from start to finish tonight. With my hands on his shoulders, I started moving my hips again.\n\"Han-gyeol...!! Ah-! Come for me...! Come...!\"\n\"Eun-ha..! If you move like that all of a sudden...!!\"\n\"Quickly..! Quickly...! Before I come again...!! Ah-! Han-gyeol, come first...!! Hurry...!\"\nI felt like I was going to lose my mind. Even though I was the one moving my hips so vigorously, I felt like I was going to finish first.\n\"Han-gyeol...! I love you...! I love you..!\"\n\"I love you too, Eun-ha... I love you so much.\"\n\"I love you more...! I love you more...! Ah...!! Come for me...! Quickly...! I... feel like I'm going to come again!\"\nI knew I couldn't hold out much longer, so I moved my hips even more earnestly.\nHan-gyeol seemed to be at his limit too, biting his lip as he looked at me.\nSeeing his pleasure-filled expression brought me to the brink of climax.\n\"Han-gyeol...! I'm...! Again...!\"\n\"I'm going to come too...! Eun-ha...!\"\n\"Ahhh...!!\"\nAs I pressed my hips down, Han-gyeol gripped my waist tightly and came. I collapsed onto his body, panting heavily.\n\"Eun-ha...?\"\n\"Ahh...! Ah...! Ah...!\"\nMy hips kept moving involuntarily. My mind was filled only with thoughts of Han-gyeol, and I couldn't speak or act.\nAll I could do was breathe heavily as I trembled with pleasure. At least we finished together... that's a relief.\n\"Eun-ha.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Eun-ha...?!\"\nI didn't have the strength to respond...\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "“Are you feeling better now?”\nAfter we finished, I carefully wrapped my arms around Eun-ha.\nShe had been so passionate just moments ago, but now, embarrassment seemed to take over.\nShe buried her face in my chest, reluctant to show it.\n“Eun-ha, can you show me your face?”\n“It’s embarrassing...”\n“Why? You were so bold just a little while ago.”\n“Ack! Don’t bring that up, seriously—stop it!”\nSuddenly, Eun-ha began to tickle my sides.\n“Ahahaha! I’m sorry! I’m sorry—please stop!”I grabbed Eun-ha’s arms tightly and pulled her closer. Finally, she lifted her head, revealing a face flushed with a deep blush.\nFinding her cute and endearing, I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and she smiled softly.\n“Kiss me on the lips too.”\n“Alright.”\nAs soon as I kissed her lips, Eun-ha grinned and placed her arms around my torso.\nShe traced circles on my chest with her fingers, watching my reaction closely.\n“I’ve always noticed, but you’ve got quite a bit of muscle...”\n“Should I build more? Do you like more muscles?”\n“Huh? Oh, no—I just like you as you are. Why? Do you want to bulk up?”\n“Well, if you like it, then maybe...”\n“Would you build more muscle just because I said I liked it? Why~?”\n“Because I want to look good for you.”\nEun-ha laughed happily, clearly pleased with what I said.\n“You still want to look good for me, huh?”\n“Of course. Isn’t it the same for you?”\n“Yeah, it is. Hehe... but hearing it directly makes me really happy.”\n“I wish you would completely fall for me.”\n“What?!”\nEun-ha suddenly sat up on the bed, looking down at me while covering herself with the blanket.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“N-no... it’s just, I was thinking the exact same thing...”\n“You want me to fall completely for you too?”\nEun-ha nodded vigorously.\n“Yeah! I was thinking how I’d love for both your body and heart to be completely mine! I was just thinking that a moment ago! But don’t worry, I’m already all yours, through and through. I can’t live without you now!”\nEun-ha couldn’t stop smiling, clearly overjoyed that we shared the same thoughts.\n“Today feels amazing...! To think we were thinking the same thing. So? Have you fallen for me?”\n“It’s a bit cheesy to say, but yeah. I can’t stop thinking about you every day.”\n“When do you think about me the most? Hm? When do I cross your mind? Tell me.”\n“I mean, you just come to mind naturally. Whether I’m eating or drinking coffee, I start wondering what you might be doing.”\nEun-ha plopped back down beside me.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m really excited right now. My heart is racing like crazy. Just having you next to me makes it beat so fast. Wanna listen?”\n“Huh? Whoa—!”\nEun-ha suddenly pulled my face towards her and pressed it against her left chest.\n“How is it? Can you hear it...?”\nIt felt incredibly intimate, having my face buried in her chest, but I listened closely.\nThump-thump-thump-thump—\nEun-ha’s heart was racing wildly, beating incessantly.\n“How is it? Can you hear it?”\n“Shouldn’t we go to the hospital? Your heart’s racing like crazy.”\n“It’s because of you, Han-gyeol~ Now it’s my turn~”\nEun-ha suddenly leaned over and pressed her ear against my left chest.\n“Whoa—! You can take your time, you know.”\n“Nope~ I need to listen to your heartbeat, so be quiet!”\nWhat guy wouldn’t have his heart race with his girlfriend’s ear pressed against his chest?\nAs my cheeks grew warm, I could feel my heart pounding wildly. Eun-ha, with a happy smile on her face, kept listening to my heartbeat.\n“Aren’t you done listening yet?”\n“Nope~ it’s still not enough. I can barely hear it~”\n“Don’t lie. It’s my heart, so I know it best.”\n“Your heart is pounding so hard. Do you really like me that much? Hmm?”\nI was embarrassed... I turned my head to avoid answering.\n“Hurry up and answer~ Do you really like me that much? Do you miss me when I’m not around, and want to touch me when I am?”\n“Well, of course...! In high school, we were always together, but now that we’re in different departments in college, we’re apart.”\n“I was thinking the same thing~ Yeah, in high school, we were always together, and it was amazing. Right?”\n“It was amazing~ We were together every day, studying together and everything.”\n“But back then, we couldn’t be this affectionate, right?”\n“Um...! Yeah, that’s true.”\n“Han-gyeol is getting all shy~ So cute.”\nEun-ha gave me a quick peck on the cheek.\n“You’re cuter, Eun-ha.”\n“Han-gyeol, I love you. Isn’t there anything more you can say besides ‘I love you’? It feels like it’s not enough.”\n“Even if I don’t say it, you know it, right? I love you a lot, Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah, I know. But still, say it often, okay?”\n“I love you.”\n“Me too...!”\nWhen our eyes met, a natural smile spread across my face.\nYeah, we don’t always need to say it out loud to know.\n****\nSince I had a first-period class today, I got up before Eun-ha.\nShe seemed too tired to wake up, so I turned off the alarm clock and headed to the bathroom.\nAfter quickly preparing breakfast in the kitchen, I made another serving for Eun-ha and was about to leave the house.\nJust as I grabbed my bag and was heading out, Eun-ha came out of the bedroom, rubbing her eyes.\n“Han-gyeol, are you leaving...?”\n“Yeah. Make sure you eat breakfast.”\n“Isn’t there still some time...? Stay a bit longer...”\n“I prefer going early.”\n“Today, leave just on time...”\nEun-ha grabbed me as I was about to leave and hugged me tightly.\n“Come on, you should wash your face and eat breakfast.”\n“Can’t I eat you instead?”\n“You had a lot yesterday.”\n“Hehe... that’s true. I did eat a lot~”\nEun-ha nuzzled her face against me, refusing to let go.\n“Han-gyeol, I love you.”\n“I love you too~”\n“So, take it slow today~”\nI hugged Eun-ha tightly in return.\n“Ugh...! You’re crushing me, Han-gyeol...”\n“Should I let go?”\n“No. I’d be happy to die like this. Hug me tighter.”\n“You’re too cute.”\n“Don’t die—don’t you have to go? Be careful, okay? Watch out for cars?”\n“Yeah. I’ll text you when I get there. I’m off.”\nSince it was almost time to leave, I gently pried Eun-ha away from me.\nShe looked at me longingly, and then, as if something suddenly came to mind, she quickly spoke up.\n“Oh, right—! I forgot to tell you yesterday, but Chae-in Jeong found out that we’re living together.”\n“What? How did that happen?”\n“Turns out she’s more observant than I thought. She noticed the toothbrush, the shoe rack, and the dishes in the kitchen.”\n“I thought she wouldn’t notice since she was drunk... I’ll make sure to ask her to keep it a secret.”\n“Hmm? No need~ I’ve already talked to her about it, so don’t worry.”\n‘Did she really talk things out?’\n“Hey, Han-gyeol, you’re going to be late. Be careful on your way~”\n“Ah—yeah. I’ll be back. Don’t forget to eat breakfast, okay?”\n“Okay! See you later in the afternoon~”\nAs soon as I stepped out of the front door, my mind was consumed with how I should explain things to Chae-in Jeong.\nWe weren’t that close, but she wasn’t the type to refuse when asked to keep a secret. Besides, it was Eun-ha and I who had helped her out, so if I asked her to keep this under wraps, she probably would.\nI should’ve cleared away the toothbrush and shoes that day... That was my mistake.\nBut what exactly did Eun-ha mean by saying she “talked things out”? She’s a smart girl, so she probably handled it well, but I should still make sure to talk to Chae-in Jeong myself.\n“Ah!”\n“Ah!”\nJust as I was about to enter the classroom, I ran right into Chae-in Jeong. The moment she saw me, she lost all focus in her eyes and started mumbling.\n“I didn’t see anything, and I didn’t hear anything, so don’t worry. Eun-ha is my friend, right? It’s only natural to keep a friend’s secret. Of course... yes, of course. The number of toothbrushes I saw in the bathroom wasn’t two, but just one. There was no trace of a man in the shoe rack, and the many dishes in the kitchen were just because of Eun-ha’s taste, right? Don’t worry. Lee Han-gyeol, there’s nothing for you to worry about. This secret will go with me to my grave, so don’t worry. Got it? So could you please put in a good word for me with Eun-ha?”\nWhat’s going on? Why is she acting like this?\n“Uh... sure. Thanks.”\n“No, I should be thanking you...”\n“Just don’t drink so much next time. You’re having lunch with Eun-ha, right? When’s good for you?”\n“Whenever it’s most convenient for you and Eun-ha.”\nEun-ha?\n“Okay... do you want to choose what we eat?”\n“As long as it’s not chicken... chicken is the only thing I can’t handle...”\n“Isn’t that the safest option? Eun-ha’s good at cooking chicken.”\n“No way... I can only eat boneless chicken now. Did Eun-ha say anything to you? Like about... breaking my joints—”\n“Han-gyeol~!”\nBefore Chae-in Jeong could finish her sentence, Eun-ha’s voice suddenly echoed through the hall. Both Chae-in Jeong and I turned our heads at the same time, and there she was, standing right there.\n“Eek—! You didn’t come alone?!”\n“Eun-ha?! What are you doing here?”\nEun-ha hurried over to me and handed me my phone.\n“You left your phone, so I brought it to you~ Oh, Chae-in Jeong’s here too.”\n“Oh, I did forget it. Thanks for bringing it.”\nAs I took the phone from her, Eun-ha glanced at Chae-in Jeong.\n“Chae-in Jeong Hi~”\n“Hello...!”\nWhat’s up with these two?\n“Hey~ We agreed to drop the formalities, remember? Did you already forget?”\n“Oh, right...! My bad, I totally spaced out.”\n“Okay then, I’m off. See you in the afternoon, Han-gyeol? And bye, Chae-in Jeong~”\n“Yeah. Take care on your way back.”\n“Please get home safely...!!!”\nAfter Eun-ha left to go back home, I looked at Chae-in Jeong.\n“You okay? There’s no need to be so formal with Eun-ha, right?”\n“M-My life was in danger...! It felt like standing in front of a wild beast.”\nWhat? So she did see everything clearly, huh?\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Last night, after having a really close moment with Han-gyeol, I felt incredibly happy.\nAnd the fact that he wants me to be completely immersed in him...!\nJust thinking about it makes me so joyful.\nHe’s already made me think of nothing but him, yet he’s still so greedy.\nI have a feeling today is going to be a great day.\n“Hehe…”\n“Eun-ha, you look especially happy today~! Did something good happen?”\nIt seems others can tell I’m in a good mood too. Chae Jiyoung noticed my expression and asked.\n“Huh? Do I really look that way? Well, something nice did happen~.”\n“Oh? What is it?! Come on, tell me~ I’m curious. Please? Tell me quickly~.”Jiyoung started poking me in the side, urging me to spill the details.\n“Well, I just had a fun time with my boyfriend~.”\n“Eun-ha, do you really enjoy hanging out with your boyfriend that much?”\n“Yeah, it’s super fun and exciting. Next week is the cherry blossom festival, so we’re planning to go see the blossoms.”\nI’m already looking forward to our second cherry blossom festival together with Han-gyeol.\nThis time, I’ll pack a nice lunchbox too.\n“Oh, right. Yoori, you mentioned you’re meeting your boyfriend this weekend, didn’t you?”\n“Yeah, it’s been almost a month, so I’m really looking forward to it too.”\nYoori smiled brightly, clearly as eager for the weekend as I am.\n“Do you and your boyfriends ever fight? You both seem so happy all the time.”\n“Han-gyeol and I? Hmm, I don’t think we’ve ever really fought. What about you, Yoori?”\n“Well… we do fight a bit. Not all the time, but yeah… we have our moments~.”\n“Yoori, that’s more typical. Eun-ha, have you really never had a fight?”\n“Umm… Nothing comes to mind. If we have, I guess I’ve forgotten?”\nFighting with Han-gyeol… No matter how hard I try to recall, nothing comes up.\nWe’re both pretty good at expressing any dissatisfaction right away, and we take care of each other well.\n“What do you usually fight about with your boyfriend, Yoori?”\n“Well… if he doesn’t contact me often or if there’s an issue with female or male friends?”\nWe’re together so much that honestly, I’m not sure.\nNeither I nor Han-gyeol have any female or male friends that would be an issue.\nIf anything, there’s Harim or Choi Jiyoung, but that’s about it.\nAnd I don’t have any male friends to speak of.\n“I see. I’ll keep that in mind and be careful.”\n“You two must be really compatible as a couple… Maybe it’s because we’ve been together for so long, but these days it feels like…”\n“Does it really change a lot after being together for a long time?”\n“Yeah… I think so. There’s almost nothing we don’t know about each other, and we’ve done just about everything when it comes to dates. So, I guess that’s why we fight more often. We try to mix things up sometimes, but given our situation, it’s not easy~.”\n“I see.”\n“You and Han-gyeol are coming up on one year, right? Try to change things up every now and then~. It’s natural to get too comfortable as time passes.”\nEven though I listened to Yoori’s advice, nothing specific came to mind.\n“Change things up?”\n“Yeah. Before things get too routine, it might be a good idea to introduce some changes every now and then.”\n“Change, huh… I’m not really sure what that would look like.”\nSeeing me deep in thought, Jiyoung chimed in from the side.\n“What about changing your hairstyle?”\n“My hair? Hmm… I’ve always had long straight hair. Maybe I should try dyeing it? Or go for a bob cut?”\n“That could be nice! The difference between long hair and a bob is huge. Guys would definitely notice a big change!”\n“Really?”\nSomething Sparked in Me\nI was intrigued.\nEven though Han-gyeol seems to prefer long hair.\nI remember having short hair when I was very young, but I never thought it suited me much.\nShort hair is definitely more convenient… Should I give it a try this time? But, I do feel a bit hesitant.\n“Eun-ha, I think you’d look adorable with short hair. What do you think, Yoori?”\n“She’d be super cute. Eun-ha has this pure vibe with long hair, but with short hair, she’d be, like, incredibly cute, you know?”\n“Right? Eun-ha, come over here for a second.”\n“Huh? Why?”\nBefore I knew it, the girls came up to me and started tying up my hair.\nThey pulled my long hair up as high as possible and tied it securely, instantly shortening its length.\n“Wow...”\nJiyoung and Yoori both stared at me, speechless.\n“So cute…”\n“Right? Even cuter than I imagined. It’s like you’ve gone all-in on cuteness, leaving the pure look behind.”\n“Wow, that’s such a perfect description. Eun-ha, have you ever shown your boyfriend how you look with short hair?”\n“No… I think I’ve only shown him when I’ve loosely tied it up.”\n“You should totally show him! I bet he’d love it!”\nTheir compliments made me a little shy, but I hope Han-gyeol finds it cute too.\nI’ll take a look in the mirror when I get home and show him later tonight.\nMaybe I should even try some different hairstyles while I’m at it.\n“Okay! I’ll show him tonight!”\n“Yeah~! Let us know how it goes!”\n“Sure! Thanks!”\n****\nAfter all my classes were done, I met up with Han-gyeol for a bit.\n“Eun-ha, you’re heading home now, right? I’ve got a three-hour class, so don’t wait for me. Just go home first.”\n“Okay! Got it. Then I’ll stop by the market on my way home.”\n“If you have a lot to buy, we could go together later in the evening.”\n“It’s fine~ I don’t need to buy much. I can carry it all on my own.”\n“Alright then. I’ll see you at home later. I’ve got to head to class now.”\n“Yep! See you later~.”\n“Be careful. Watch out for cars.”\n“Will do~.”\nAfter waving goodbye to Han-gyeol, I headed straight to the supermarket near home.\nI’ve set a budget for my living expenses, so I can’t afford luxurious meals every day.\n“Hmm… maybe I’ll just make a simple kimchi stew today.”\nI put a pack of pork shoulder into my shopping basket.\nThen I wandered around the store, looking at seaweed and various vegetables.\nI wanted to make something with salmon, which Han-gyeol loves, but my budget is tight this month.\nMaybe I should start looking for a part-time job starting in April.\nIt’s probably still too early to make money from video editing, right?\nI think Han-gyeol has been browsing part-time job sites occasionally.\n“Oh—right, I need to buy eggs too…!”\nWith an eco-bag in one hand and a carton of eggs in the other, I headed home.\nAfter arriving, I immediately put the groceries away in the fridge.\nAs I started to casually tie up my hair, the girls’ words suddenly popped into my mind.\n“Should I tie it up now…?”\nI stood in front of the wall mirror in the living room and tied up my hair the way I wanted to show Han-gyeol.\nI think I showed him a ponytail once before… Maybe braiding my hair would be a good idea.\nAs I played around with my hair, I decided to split it into two braids.\nHmm... Pigtails Might Be Too Much, Right?\nPigtails at twenty years old? Yeah, it does feel a bit much.\nBut still, reminiscing about childhood memories with my mom, I decided to try it out for old time’s sake.\nSince no one else was home anyway, I carefully tied my hair into two pigtails and looked into the mirror.\nAs expected, doing this at twenty feels a little embarrassing.\n“It’s a bit awkward to pull this off as an adult.”\nJust as I was about to untie my hair, I suddenly heard the door click open.\n“Eun-ha, you home?!”\nMy heart nearly stopped.\nBut as soon as I saw Han-gyeol coming out of the computer room, I felt both relief and utter dread.\n“Oh? You tied your hair…?”\nHan-gyeol paused for a split second when he saw me.\nThat pause told me everything.\n“Why is Han-gyeol… coming out of there…?”\nIt felt like the world was crashing down around me.\n“Answer me. Why is Han-gyeol… coming out of there? What about your class?”\n“Uh… well… The professor suddenly canceled, so I came home.”\n“You could’ve called…”\n“My phone died…! Haha…! I saw you coming up from the window, so I thought I’d surprise you by hiding in the computer room…!”\n“Oh. I see. You did…”\nAs Han-gyeol was about to comment on my hair, I quickly shouted out.\n“Don’t say anything—!! Absolutely—! Please…! The only thing you should do right now is go back into the computer room as if nothing happened. Got it…? Just erase what you saw from your memory… And come out in ten minutes like nothing ever happened. Got it…?”\nA twenty-year-old girl tying her hair into pigtails at home, admiring herself in the mirror—\nNo matter how much Han-gyeol cares for me, this might be a bit much for him to handle.\nI’m doomed.\nOf all people, to be caught by the last person I wanted to see this…\nI collapsed onto the sofa, utterly defeated.\nSeeing me like that, Han-gyeol offered some comforting words.\n“Eun-ha, you look cute with pigtails.”\nAs soon as his words reached my ears, my face started to flush rapidly, starting from my neck.\nIn the end, unable to bear the embarrassment, I screamed and dashed into the bedroom.\n“Ughhhh—! Han-gyeol, I hate you—! I told you not to mention it—!”\nI locked the door, something I’d never done before, and slumped down against it.\n“Ugh—! Eun-ha! You really looked cute! I’m serious—!”\nHan-gyeol kept knocking on the door, trying to talk to me.\n“I don’t care—! Everything’s ruined—! Just leave me alone—!”\n“Eun-ha, you were seriously the cutest—! Honestly, the cutest in the world—!”\n“I don’t care—! Stop calling me cute! Please forget it ever happened—!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "It would be a lie to say I wasn’t surprised, but Eun-ha looked utterly adorable.\nTo be honest, I wanted to see it again, but Eun-ha kept pouting.\nShe was huddled in the corner of the bedroom, cheeks puffed out with air.\n“Eun-ha, can you show me your face now? How long are you going to stay like that?”\n“No… It’s embarrassing! I’m so embarrassed—!”\nShe doesn’t seem to realize how cute she looks, all curled up in the corner.\nIt makes me want to tease her even more.\n“Why~ You looked like a mischievous little girl. It was cute~”\nAs I teased her with a grin, Eun-ha’s head creaked toward me.\nThen, biting her lip, she lunged at me on the bed.“Ugh—! I told you not to tease me like that—! Forget it! Forget it now! Just forget it—!”\n“How could I forget that? Can’t you do it just one more time? I didn’t get a good look.”\n“I hate you! I hate you, Han-gyeol! Get out! Get out of the bedroom—!”\n“No way~ I want to cuddle with my cute girlfriend.”\nI wrapped my arms tightly around Eun-ha, refusing to let go.\nShe struggled with all her might, but it wasn’t enough to break free.\n“Ugh…! Let me go—! I’ll leave!”\n“That’s not happening~ You started this. You can come in as you please, but you can’t leave just like that~”\n“Argh—! Just forget it! Please! I’m twenty years old, I don’t want to create any more embarrassing memories!”\nOh wow, she’s stronger than I thought.\nI might actually lose my grip.\n“I thought you looked cute with pigtails though. Can’t you show me sometimes when we’re alone?”\n“No way—! Not even you can see that—!”\n“But the only hairstyle I’ve seen you with is a ponytail. I’m curious.”\n“Ugh… Even if you say that, pigtails are off-limits! Absolutely not!”\nShe’s really not budging.\nI thought she’d give in by now, but she must be super embarrassed.\nBut I can’t back down here.\n“You looked so cute, though.”\n“I said no!”\n“You really did look cute.”\n“No way—! That’s not happening—!”\n“So cute I want to see it again.”\n“…”\nOh—she’s wavering.\n“You were so cute I’d love to see it again, even in a dream. Usually, you’re so pure and lovely, but with pigtails, you were just pure cuteness. I mean it in a good way. I’d love to see that side of you again, but if you really don’t want to, I won’t ask anymore. But just one last time, could you show me?”\nI pulled Eun-ha into my arms and spoke softly.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, she murmured quietly.\n\"Do you… really want to see it that much?\"\n\"Yeah. But if you really don’t want to, that’s okay.\"\n\"What… How can I not show you when you say it like that—!\"\n\"It’s really fine~\"\n\"Your tone says it’s absolutely ‘not’ fine—! Fine! I’ll show you—!\"\n\"Thank you~\"\nI grinned at her, feeling triumphant.\n\"Wait a moment.\"\nEun-ha pouted, then fetched a comb from the vanity and handed it to me.\n\"But you have to tie it yourself—!\"\n\"Me? I don’t know how to tie hair.\"\n\"I’m not backing down anymore—! If you want to see it, you have to do it yourself!\"\n\"At least give me some instructions.\"\n\"Just comb it out and tie it on both sides… that’s it…!\"\n\"That’s a pretty vague explanation.\"\nIt seemed she didn’t want to explain any further.\nHanding me the comb, Eun-ha sat down right in front of me.\n\"Is this the first time I’m combing your hair?\"\n\"I guess so. You’ve dried it for me before, but I don’t think you’ve ever combed it.\"\n\"Really? Well, I’ll do it now. Come a little closer?\"\nDespite her grumpy expression, Eun-ha scooted closer to me.\nI carefully started to comb her hair.\nThe scent of her shampoo filled the air, and her silky hair became neatly arranged.\n\"Your hair is really soft, Eun-ha.\"\n\"Is it…? I didn’t really do anything special.\"\n\"The shampoo smells nice too.\"\nI gently held a section of her hair and inhaled the fragrance.\nEun-ha’s ears turned slightly red, as if she was embarrassed by the situation.\n\"Are you embarrassed by the smell of your shampoo?\"\n\"N-no… It’s just been a while since someone’s combed my hair…!\"\n\"That means you’re embarrassed.\"\n\"Just tie it up already—! Ouch!\"\nThere was a loud snap as her hair tangled and pulled.\n\"Oh no, sorry.\"\n\"Han-gyeol, you…!\"\n\"It was an accident, an accident. I’ll go slowly. Look straight ahead.\"\n\"Be gentle, okay…?\"\n\"Yes, yes~\"\nEun-ha seemed to secretly enjoy me combing her hair, as she sat silently, without complaint.\nI considered saying something to break the silence, but the quiet moment didn’t feel so bad.\nOnce her hair was smooth, I divided it into two sections, taking one and attempting to tie it with a hair tie.\n\"This isn’t easy…\"\n\"Do you like me better when I’m cute? Or when I’m pure? Or maybe when I’m sexy?\"\n\"Hmm. Each has its own charm. When you’re like this, you’re cute and lovable, when I see you from afar, you’re pure and beautiful, and at night… you’re incredibly sexy. Are you by any chance sweet by day and wild by night?\"\n\"Ah—! Stop right there! Why are you raising the stakes all of a sudden?\"\n\"I’m just saying you’re pretty no matter what. There— all done.\"\n\"Really? Let me see.\"\n\"It might be better if you don’t…\"\nEun-ha got off the bed and walked over to the vanity, gazing at her reflection in the mirror.\nThere's no way I could tie her hair well, given that I barely know how to do it.\n\"What is this—! It looks totally weird!\"\n\"It’s my first time, so what do you expect?\"\n\"Do you really think this is cute?!\"\n\"I told you, you’re pretty no matter what.\"\n\"So that’s what you were leading up to earlier?! Get over here—! Han-gyeol, come here!\"\nEun-ha jumped back onto the bed.\n\"Ack—! Sorry! I’m sorry—!\"\n***\n\"Why does it end up like this?\"\nEun-ha fiddled with my hair, eventually tying it into a small ponytail on top of my head, often called an \"apple hair.\"\nEun-ha’s expression was adorable as she looked up at me, clearly happy, but this hairstyle...\n\"You look so cute, Han-gyeol…! Super cute…! Can’t you do this apple hair sometimes?!\"\n\"Impossible. While you actually look cute, I definitely do not.\"\n\"As long as I think you’re cute, that’s all that matters~ Right now, you’re so cute! I just want to nibble on you—!!\"\nEun-ha with pigtails is objectively adorable, so that’s fine.\nBut me, with my stoic expression and this ridiculous apple hair…\nthere’s no way it’s cute.\nBut why is she looking at me with those sparkling eyes, making it so hard to refuse?\n\"Han-gyeol! Just once a month! No more, no less, just once!\"\n\"No way~ I’m not cute, so let’s skip it.\"\nWhen I refused, Eun-ha mumbled in disappointment.\n\"But I really want to see it.\"\n\"I said no~\"\n\"I really, really want to see it.\"\n\"No way~ This is absolutely—\"\nWait, what?\nIsn’t this the exact same situation from earlier?\nExcept our roles are reversed?\n\"Really not happening?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Really, really, ‘really’ not happening?\"\nEun-ha slowly crawled toward me on the bed.\n\"Not even once a month? How about once every two months? You know, Han-gyeol, you usually look so serious, but sometimes you’re unexpectedly cute like this. The contrast is so striking that I really want to see it again. But if you really don’t want to, I won’t push it. Just one last time, can you show me?\"\nI lost. I totally lost.\n\"Later, you can do apple hair for Hanbyul, and I’ll do pigtails for Eunbyul. Let’s think of it as practice until then. Okay? I love you, Han-gyeol. So, just once every two months—!\"\n\"Alright. But not for life, okay?! If I hate it, I’m stopping.\"\n\"What—?! Where’s the fun in that! If you’re going to do it, you should do it for life—! You’re so stingy!\"\n\"I’m just trying to find a compromise here.\"\n\"Fine, until Hanbyul and Eunbyul are born!\"\nThey’re not even born yet…\nIs this all part of Eun-ha’s grand plan?\n“If you don’t like it, then let’s hurry up and have kids—!”\n“You really don’t hold back, do you?”\n“I always mean what I say, you know?”\nEun-ha’s serious tone caught me off guard.\n“Lately, living with you, Han-gyeol, I’ve realized that a lively home is really the best! We haven’t had any big fights, and we get along so well, don’t we?!”\nEun-ha spoke with a happy smile, recounting our daily lives.\n“Other couples say they fight a lot, but I don’t think we’ve ever had a serious argument. The more I think about it, the more I want to build a proper family with you as soon as possible. We can have Hanbyul, Eunbyul, Saetbyul, and even our youngest, who we haven’t named yet. It sounds wonderful. I’d love to take pictures with our son in an apple hair and our daughters in pigtails, just like today~”\n“You start by tying hair and end up talking about kids who aren’t even born yet.”\n“Don’t you want to be the kind of dad who ties his daughters’ hair?”\n“I do want to be loved by a daughter who looks just like you.”\nI’ve never seen Eun-ha as a child, but…\nImagining a daughter who looks like her running to me, calling “Dad”...\nWhat is this? I could die happy right now.\n“I knew it. Then we need to practice. I’m offering my hair, so go ahead and practice.”\nEun-ha smiled and handed me her hair.\n“Be honest. You enjoyed tying my hair, didn’t you?”\n“Was it that obvious…?! For some reason, it made my heart flutter. I also liked it when you combed my hair.”\n“What if our daughters ask me to comb their hair too? I’ve only got two hands.”\n“Then I’ll have the boys tie my hair~”\n“If someone overheard us, they’d think we already have kids.”\n“So what? It’s just a story that will become reality someday.”\nEun-ha has always believed in and waited for our future together.\n“Yeah, you’re right. Let’s graduate quickly, save up money, and get married.”\n“Yeah! And let’s have kids right away!”\n“Sure, sure.”\nKnowing that someone wishes for a future with me makes me incredibly happy.\nIt made me feel like I was someone really special.\n--- The End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Hello\neveryone\n!

      "content": "Outside the window, pink cherry blossom petals were gently falling one by one.\nJust like last year, when we went to see the cherry blossoms together, I wanted to go to the cherry blossom festival this year as well.\nThe thought of going to see the cherry blossoms with Han-gyeol every year until the day I die made me feel incredibly excited.\n\"Han-gyeol. We're going to see the cherry blossoms again this year, right?!\"\n\"Yeah, we have to. Want to go to Gyeongbokgung Palace instead of Yeouido?\"\n\"Huh? Isn't Yeouido the most famous place for the cherry blossom festival?\"\n\"That's exactly why it'll be crowded. But Gyeongbokgung should have beautiful cherry blossoms too.\"\nWouldn't it be tough to bring lunch to Gyeongbokgung?\nAh— but if there are too many people, Yeouido might be tough too.\nI've never been to Gyeongbokgung, so I wasn’t really sure.\"Did you want to go to Yeouido?\"\n\"Well... I was thinking of packing lunch for the Yeouido cherry blossom festival.\"\n\"Then how about this weekend we go to Yeouido, and next weekend we visit Gyeongbokgung?\"\n\"Oh—! Sounds great! But after the cherry blossom festival, we'll have to start preparing for midterms. Are you sure it's okay?\"\n\"I'm not planning to study as hard as I did in high school. I've got plenty of time.\"\nNow that I'm in college, the study pressure is definitely less.\nThere are a lot of assignments, but as long as I don't procrastinate, it's manageable.\nSometimes I do end up sitting in front of the computer until dawn, though.\n\"I'm all for it—! I want to go to both places.\"\n\"If we go to Gyeongbokgung, are you going to wear a hanbok?\"\n\"Hanbok?\"\nEven though I’ve never been there, the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Gyeongbokgung is a hanbok...\nI imagined Han-gyeol wearing a hanbok in front of me.\nWould he look like a flowery nobleman?\nOr maybe a dignified aristocrat?\nWhat's this? I’m super curious now.\nI’ve got to see this as soon as possible.\n\"Han-gyeol-ah. Let’s go to Gyeongbokgung this weekend and then to the cherry blossom festival next weekend.\"\n\"Why the sudden change?\"\n\"I want to see you in a hanbok—! Have you ever worn one, Han-gyeol?!\"\n\"I think I wore one when I was little, but I haven't worn one since I started school.\"\n\"Right?! Let’s go wear hanboks! We’ll take tons of pictures—!\"\n\"You really like the idea. Alright~ Let’s go to Gyeongbokgung this weekend.\"\n\"Yes, yes! Ah~ I wish the weekend would come sooner.\"\nI started getting really excited.\nAnything Han-gyeol wears looks amazing on him.\n****\nTime passed slowly, and the weekend finally arrived.\nI can't express how much I’d been waiting for today.\nDuring the weekdays, I kept picturing Han-gyeol in a hanbok over and over in my mind.\nHolding Han-gyeol's hand tightly, we got off at Gwanghwamun Station.\nWe exited through Exit 2 and walked past the statue of King Sejong.\nSince starting college, it had been a while since we'd gone on a date far from campus, so I felt giddy with excitement.\nI swung our clasped hands up and down as we walked.\n\"Do you like it that much?\"\n\"Yeah! I love it!\"\n\"I like it too.\"\n\"Right?! Let’s have fun today~ We’ll take pictures and put them in an album!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nWhen we arrived at the hanbok rental shop, we had to choose a skirt and jeogori.\nFor some reason, I really wanted to wear whatever Han-gyeol picked out for me.\n“Han-gyeol-ah, you pick something for me~!”\n“Me? I don’t have much fashion sense, though.”\n“Still~ I want to look pretty for you, so you should choose.”\n“Hmm… there are so many options. Can’t you narrow it down to a few choices?”\n“We’ve got plenty of time, so take it slow~ You pick for me, okay?! I’ll pick out something for you too, Han-gyeol.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol started holding up skirts and jeogori* against me, carefully selecting the hanbok I should wear.\n“Wouldn’t it look weird if both the top and bottom were white?”\n“Why? Are you worried I’d look like a ghost?”\n“That’s not what I was thinking…”\nA funny thought crossed my mind, so I leaned in close to whisper in Han-gyeol’s ear.\n“I’m not a virgin because of you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Ah—! You...! What if someone hears you…!”\n“What’s the big deal~ It’s true~ Now, pick the hanbok for me~”\n“You’re getting bold…”\n“It’s because of you, Han-gyeol.”\nBlushing, Han-gyeol continued to pick out the hanbok for me.\nHis ears even turned red. Han-gyeol’s embarrassed face is always amusing to see.\nThat’s why I can’t resist teasing him every now and then.\n“How about this one?”\nAfter much deliberation, Han-gyeol finally chose a white jeogori paired with a navy skirt.\nIt was a hanbok with beautiful patterns embroidered on the sleeves and skirt.\nIt was a style I usually wore.\n“Do you like this one?”\n“Yeah. I think it’ll look great on you, Eun-ha.”\n“It’s okay if you pick something flashier, you know? This is just like my usual style.”\n“I like Eun-ha just the way you usually are.”\nHearing those words from Han-gyeol made me feel happy.\n“Then it’s my turn to pick something for you, Han-gyeol~”\nThough there weren’t as many options for men’s hanboks, everything we needed was there.\nThere were even gonryongpo, and all the designs you see in historical dramas were available.\n“Do you want to try wearing a gonryongpo*, Han-gyeol?”\n“I feel like that would attract too much attention. But if you want me to wear it, I will.”\n“Really? Then what should we go with…”\nAs I browsed through the men’s hanboks, one particular outfit caught my eye.\nIt was a bright yellow hanbok with intricate, flashy designs.\nIt was far from Han-gyeol’s usual image, which made it all the more interesting.\n“Han-gyeol-ah, how about you try this one?!”\n“It’s yellow? I’ve never worn anything like this before.”\n“It’s the perfect chance to try it out~ I think it would look good on you.”\n“I wanted to match with you, though.”\nWhen Han-gyeol looked a bit disappointed, my heart skipped a beat.\nWhat should I do… His pouty face is so adorable, I wish I could capture it in a photo.\n“Then, Han-gyeol, why don’t you pick something that matches the yellow~!!”\n“Alright. I had something in mind earlier, so let’s go with that.”\n“Yes, yes! Perfect—! We should match since we’re a couple!”\nWe took the white jeogori and yellow skirt he picked and headed to the dressing room.\n“See you in a bit, Han-gyeol.”\n“Take your time.”\nSince I had to wear a hanbok today, I came prepared with a tank top under my shirt.\nThe staff member helped me put on the underskirt and the hanbok.\nIt was more challenging than I thought, so I needed quite a bit of assistance.\nAfter putting on the underskirt, skirt, and jeogori, I moved to the dressing table next to the dressing room.\n“How would you like your hair done?”\n“Could you braid it for me?”\n“Yes, of course~ Would you like it like that?”\n“Yes—!”\nHan-gyeol went to change into his hanbok at the same time as me, so he should be done by now, right?\n“Do men get their hair done too?”\n“Yes, if they’re wearing a gat*, we need to style their hair up~ Most of them wear gats, so we usually do it that way.”\nJust the thought of Han-gyeol wearing a gat made my heart race.\nAs I watched my hair being braided, I couldn’t help but feel happy.\nThe thought of sharing this new experience with Han-gyeol filled me with joy.\nTime passed, and soon my hair was beautifully styled.\n“You can choose your hair accessory from these~”\n“I’ll go with this one!”\nAfter adding a pretty ribbon to my hair, I carefully stepped out of the dressing room.\nI was sure Han-gyeol had finished first, but he wasn’t anywhere to be seen.\nThen, I overheard the conversation of some women passing by.\n“Did you see that just now?”\n“Right? He must be here with his girlfriend.”\n“Ugh, I’m so jealous of his girlfriend… Seriously…”\nI started to feel uneasy, so I wandered around the shop looking for Han-gyeol.\nIt didn’t take long to find him.\n“…!”\nThe moment I saw Han-gyeol dressed in a hanbok with intricate patterns, I was left speechless.\nIf this were the Joseon era, he would surely steal the hearts of every woman in the market with his noble appearance.\nThe bright colors of his hanbok made him look even paler than usual.\nIn his hand, he held an ornate floral fan, adding to his refined yet glamorous look.\n“Oh my…!”\nI clasped my hands over my mouth, staring at him from a distance.\nI’m supposed to be his girlfriend, but I couldn’t help but wonder if I even deserved to stand beside him.\nWhat on earth… Why does he look so handsome? He’s literally the perfect flower scholar.\nI wanted to grab a random passerby and show them just how amazing he looked.\n“Huh?”\nNoticing my gaze, Han-gyeol looked in my direction.\nNo, please don’t smile at me right now…!\nMy heart feels like it’s going to explode.\n“Eun-ha!”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol saw me, he walked over.\nThe closer he got, the more wildly my heart pounded.\nI wished I could calm down, but Han-gyeol stopped right in front of me, taking in my appearance with his eyes.\nNot wanting him to see my flushed face, I lowered my head.\n“You look so beautiful…!!”\nAs soon as I heard his voice, I felt my face heat up even more.\nInside, I was torn between wanting to see his face and wanting to hide mine.\nBut my curiosity got the better of me, and I slowly lifted my head to look at him.\n“Wow…”\nWhat do I do? He looks so good, I want him to wear hanbok every day.\nI stood there, captivated, trying to memorize every detail of his appearance.\nHan-gyeol, in turn, looked at me and showered me with praise.\n“Eun-ha… you’re so beautiful. Really, so… beautiful.”\nI didn’t even have time to be thankful or flattered by his compliment.\n“Han-Han-gyeol, you look amazing too..! Really amazing...!”\nI could barely get the words out.\n“Shall we head out now?”\n“Yeah…”\n“Eun-ha?”\n“Huh?! Y-Yeah! Let’s go…!”\nOh no...\nI can’t even look at Han-gyeol’s face right now.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL:\n-\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Even though I saw Eun-ha every day, today it felt unusually difficult to look at her.\nHer white jeogori and yellow skirt suited her so well that if I kept staring, I might lose myself completely.\nI was sure that if our eyes met, my face would heat up for sure.\nThe small comfort in this awkwardness was knowing that I wasn’t the only one feeling it.\nEun-ha also seemed unable to meet my gaze; she didn't look at my face either.\nTo an outsider, it might’ve seemed like we were in the middle of a fight, given how silent we were.\nWe simply walked forward, passing through Gwanghwamun, then Heungnyemun, and finally arriving at Gyeongbokgung without a word.\nThe silence felt so awkward that I decided to break it first.\n“There are more people here than I thought…!”\n“Yeah. Hey… Han-gyeol. There are so many people, can I hold your hand?”“You usually just take it. Why are you asking now?”\n“Well, that’s because…!”\nEun-ha stopped walking and turned to face me.\nSeeing her still flushed cheeks made my heart race.\n“That’s because?”\n“Sorry-! I still can’t look at your face right now…!”\nNot long after, Eun-ha lowered her head, hiding her expression.\n“You picked this outfit for me, so you have to take responsibility. Come on, look…!”\n“It’s too much-! Today, you feel untouchable…!”\n“What are you talking about…! If anything, you’re the one who seems untouchable today…!”\n“But-! Han-gyeol, you look so handsome today! So handsome that I can’t even meet your eyes-! How could I possibly look straight at you?”\nEun-ha shouted, tightly shutting her eyes.\nI could feel the gazes of the people around us, but it seemed like Eun-ha, with her eyes closed, didn’t notice.\n“Honestly, I thought you were a dignified scholar, but seeing you now, you look like you’d revel in the attention of women, indulging in pleasures like a playboy…! You look like someone who would wander the streets, spreading your charm! That’s how handsome you are! I’ve realized that you suit the bad boy look better than I thought! This version of you is so unfamiliar to me that I can’t even look you in the eye!”\nEun-ha, dressed in her beautiful hanbok, spoke in a sharp voice.\nBut playboy? Was that a compliment or an insult?\n“I love it! I love it so much! I love you the most! You’re so handsome that it makes me glad you were born! Now I understand what it means to feast your eyes!”\n“Eun-ha? There are people around, so maybe you could tone it down a bit…”\nThe people’s gazes shifted from Eun-ha to me.\nSome walked by with a satisfied smile, while others looked at us curiously.\n“Eun-ha, this is embarrassing, so could you just-”\n“I’m saying that I want to snatch you up right now and hold a wedding ceremony-!”\nNow she's not just pressing the accelerator—she's completely ditched the brake.\n\"Shh—! People are watching!\"\n\"If this were the old days, we’d probably have two kids by now at twenty, so maybe we should get married quickly?! What do you think, Han-gyeol?! We should consider Hanbyul, Eunbyul, and Saetbyul too! Maybe they’re eager to come into the world—! We already picked out their names! I’m ready! Let’s get married!”\nEun-ha lifted her head and shouted.\nStanding in front of Gyeongbokgung in a hanbok, Eun-ha's call for marriage drew all eyes to her.\nBefore I knew it, a crowd had formed a circle around us.\nThere were people marveling with “Oh…!” and I could faintly hear the sound of applause.\n“Th-That’s—!”\nBut Eun-ha still seemed oblivious to her surroundings.\n—How could he refuse when she’s saying all that?\n—Come on~ He’ll accept, right?\n—You never know until they’re at the altar…\n—Why is he hesitating? Is this one-sided? Poor girl…\nThe people around us were looking at me, eagerly waiting for my response, and Eun-ha was no different.\nI didn’t want to say anything irresponsible, but... truth be told, I wanted to get married right after graduating from college too.\n“L-Let’s get married as soon as we graduate…”\n“Yes! As soon as we graduate, let’s get married right away!”\nAs soon as I accepted Eun-ha's proposal, everyone around us broke into happy smiles and applause.\n“Huh?”\nFinally, Eun-ha looked around and realized what was happening, her face flushing red.\n“N-No…! Why are all these people… looking at us…!”\n“Eun-ha. Can you run?”\n“I can run, but…!”\n“Let’s run—!”\nI quickly grabbed Eun-ha’s wrist and we dashed away from the crowd’s gazes.\n“I’m seriously going to die because of you, Eun-ha—!”\n“Sorry—! But you’re just that handsome today?!”\n“Even now, you’re still complimenting me?!”\n“But you’re so handsome?!”\n****\nWe ran all the way past Gyeongbokgung and near Gyeonghoeru Pavilion.\nOnly when we reached a less crowded area did we finally stop, panting heavily.\n“Haah…! Han-gyeol, I can’t run anymore—!”\n“Let’s rest here for a bit, then move on…”\n“Hehe… Still, it was kinda fun.”\n“How could you confess your love so loudly in front of all those people? What if someone recorded it and uploaded it? Do you want to become the ‘Gyeongbokgung Proposal Girl’ on social media?”\n“If that happens, maybe it’ll speed up our wedding plans?!”\n“Calm down a little.”\nSeeing Eun-ha’s bright smile, I couldn’t help but gently pinch her cheeks.\n“Uwaaah… I’m sowwy…! Thih won’t happen aghain…”\n“Still, it was kinda fun like you said. I never imagined running around Gyeongbokgung like this.”\nI let go of Eun-ha’s cheeks.\n“But Han-gyeol, you really do look amazing today…!”\n“You’re beautiful too. It’s not that I didn’t want to say it; it’s just that I’m having a hard time looking at you directly right now.”\n“Then tell me more. Where exactly do I look beautiful? Be specific.”\n“I can’t…”\nI averted my gaze slightly.\n“What?! Why?! Tell me I’m beautiful! I told you exactly how I feel about you! Look at me!”\nEun-ha grabbed my face and turned it towards her.\n“Tell me quickly! Where exactly am I beautiful? Point out every single detail! Am I your type right now?!”\n“Don’t make me say something so obvious! It’s embarrassing—!”\n“Why not?! Tell me! If you don’t, I’ll never wear a hanbok for you again!”\nSo that’s how she wants to play it, huh?\n“Come on—quick! Be specific!”\n“You’re so beautiful that I don’t even know where to start—! Your braided hair is beautiful, the ribbon in it is beautiful, and the moment I saw you in that hanbok, my mind was completely filled with thoughts of you! We’re at Gyeongbokgung, but I haven’t even looked at the palace; I’m just looking at you—!”\nAt my words, Eun-ha blushed and took a step back.\n“Well, you could’ve just said it like that…!”\n“How am I supposed to say it when I’m this embarrassed… I’m not used to how you look right now.”\n“Am I really that pretty…?”\nEun-ha, still blushing, kept some distance between us.\nMaybe it was from running, but her face was even more flushed than before.\nAt this rate, she’s going to burst.\n“Stay just that far away. Any closer, and it’ll be bad for my heart.”\n“Does your heart race more when I’m close?”\nBut suddenly Eun-ha started closing the distance between us again.\n“Why are you coming closer?”\n“Because I want your heart to race more—!”\n“I’m telling you, it’s bad for my heart—!”\n“I’ll give you CPR—!”\nI was at a loss for how to respond to Eun-ha’s words.\n“I give up… I give up…”\n“Can I hug you?”\n“Quick, while no one’s around.”\n“Yay~”\nEun-ha closed the distance completely, resting her head against my chest.\n“It feels so good to be complimented by you, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha looked up at me with a bright smile.\nSeeing her grinning so sweetly, I couldn’t help but smile back.\n“You must be happy too, Han-gyeol. You’re smiling so brightly.”\n“That’s because you’re smiling the brightest right now.”\n“Well, that’s because I’m in your arms~”\n“I’m not sure if this is okay in a cultural space…! Let’s pull away now.”\n“Oh, come on~ We’re going to have four kids, so we’re patriots. They’ll understand.”\nI tried to pull away, but Eun-ha only hugged me tighter.\n“No escaping~ I’m wearing a hanbok today, so at least let me hug you~ Isn’t that fair? Don’t you want to hug me when I’m in a hanbok?”\n“Eun-ha, you seem… unusually happy today. This isn’t your usual vibe.”\n“Well, today’s the first time you’ve seen me in a hanbok~ and you even complimented me on it! Of course, I’m in a better mood than usual~”\n“In high school, you used to get embarrassed at everything I did.”\n“That’s because I’ve changed thanks to you~ And I like who I am now more than who I was before. You’ve changed too, Han-gyeol. You used to make me blush every day~ But now, don’t you realize you’re the one getting embarrassed more often?”\nEun-ha was right.\nI used to tease her more often, but now…\n“You agree, don’t you? Look at you, not even denying it because you know it’s true. So cute I could—”\nBefore she could finish, I leaned in and gave her a quick peck on the lips.\nI watched as her cheeks slowly turned red.\n“Wh-Where did that come from—! That’s not fair—! You were just saying we shouldn’t be doing this in a cultural space—!”\n“But you said it’s okay since we’re going to be patriots. I love you.”\nEun-ha quickly glanced around, checking if anyone was nearby.\nAfter confirming we were alone, she grabbed my face, stood on her tiptoes, and gave me a quick kiss on the lips.\nThen she smiled brightly and said,\n“I love you too.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Yesterday, as promised, we went to the cherry blossom festival.\nWe took a lot of photos and had a great time, but there wasn’t much time left before midterms.\nThere were plenty of assignments to submit, and right after, Han-gyeol started preparing for the midterms.\nEven though we were busy with exams, Han-gyeol suggested going on a trip.\n“Eun-ha, how about we go on a trip after midterms?”\n“Huh? A trip?! That sounds awesome! Where do you want to go?”\n“Do you have a place in mind?”\n“I want to see the ocean! Let’s fly to Jeju Island!”\nThe idea of taking a flight with Han-gyeol and going far away sounds exciting.\nIt would be nice to look at the ocean from outside our accommodation as well.“Jeju Island is hard to get around by public transportation. We could rent a car, but... renting for all ages can be pretty risky.”\n“I’ll be fine! I like walking around!”\n“Still, Jeju might be a bit difficult. How about we go to the East Sea instead? We can visit Jeju during the vacation. What do you think?”\n“Yeah, the East Sea sounds good too. Honestly, as long as I’m with you, anywhere is fine!”\nHan-gyeol looked at me with a loving gaze when I said that.\n“Then, how about we leave right after classes on Friday? If we return by Monday lunchtime, we won’t miss any class.”\n“Sure! Let’s do that. We need to start planning!”\n“Let’s eat first.”\nAfter we ate, Han-gyeol and I cleaned up together and went into the computer room.\nWith the dual monitors, we could both comfortably look at the screen.\nI pulled my chair next to Han-gyeol’s and sat down beside him.\n“We originally planned to go on a trip before entering college, but we’re only going now.”\n“Back then, getting permission to live together was more urgent. And once we started living together, we were so happy that we didn’t even think about it.”\n“Yeah, we delayed it a bit, so let’s make sure to have a blast this time. Just thinking about it makes me excited!”\n“Right. What kind of traveler are you?”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nHan-gyeol looked at me with a search window open.\n“People often argue when they travel, right? It’s important to know each other’s travel styles beforehand.”\n“Oh, that?”\n“Yeah, so I’m asking, are you the type who plans everything?”\n“Yes, I’m a planner. What about you, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m also the type to plan things out before going. Looks like we’re off to a good start.”\nAs Han-gyeol was about to move on to the next question, I jumped in first.\n“Ah! Let me ask the next question!”\n“Sure, go ahead.”\n“Is the accommodation important to you?”\n“I was just about to ask that too. It’s funny. I’m neutral on this. As long as there are no bugs, I don’t mind.”\nIt seems like we might have some differences here.\nPersonally, I’m a bit particular about accommodations.\n“What about you?”\n“Me? Hmm... I don’t expect anything luxurious, but I do prefer places with a nice view. If it’s not too expensive, I’d like to stay somewhere with a good view. But if the price difference is significant, I’m fine with just avoiding bugs, like you said. I’m okay with choosing a more economical option!”\n“Then, since it’s a 3-night, 4-day trip, how about we find a budget-friendly place for the first two nights, and for the last night, we stay somewhere with a nice view, like you want?”\n“Oh! I love that! Since Friday and Saturday will be expensive, let’s do that for the last night, from Sunday to Monday.”\n“That’s smart and economical.”\nTalking about our travel preferences with Han-gyeol like this was really fun.\n“Do you prefer staying inside the accommodation or exploring outside?”\n“I don’t mind if we do it like our usual dates, but since we’re going far away, I’d like to walk around more than usual. After all, we’ll be by the ocean, right?”\n“I feel the same way.”\n“Yeah! I’m already excited!”\n“Now, let’s start looking into transportation options.”\n“Alright!”\nI Planned the Trip with Han-gyeol, Side by Side.\nWe booked train tickets from Cheongnyangni Station to Gangneung Station.\n“Eun-ha, do you like window seats?”\n“Yeah, I love them. Do you mind?”\n“Not at all. I like window seats too.”\nWe exchanged glances for a moment before I quickly raised my arm.\n“Rock-paper-scissors!”\nHan-gyeol threw scissors, and I threw paper.\n“Darn it!”\n“You can have the window seat on the way back.”\n“Really? You’ll do that for me?!”\n“I’ll let you have it~”\n“Thank you.”\n“You’re welcome.”\nAfterward, we booked our accommodation.\nAs expected, places with ocean views were pricey, so we first looked at other options.\nWe compared several sites, checked reviews, and shortlisted a few candidates.\n“This one seems the best, right?”\n“It looks a bit small. Are you okay with that? Location-wise, this place seems better.”\n“But the price difference is quite noticeable. Wouldn’t it be better to go for this one even if it’s a bit farther?”\n“You’re right. Let’s go with this place for our stay. Now, let’s pick our accommodation for the last night.”\nPlanning the trip with Han-gyeol felt incredibly smooth.\nI could definitely feel that our preferences matched well.\nIt made me happy, almost as if we were a perfect match.\nFinally, after booking the ocean-view accommodation for our last night, we took a break.\n“Shall we plan the detailed itinerary later?”\n“Yeah! That sounds good. Planning the trip with you has been so easy.”\n“I know, right? I was a bit worried about potential disagreements.”\n“But we always find a way to work things out~ You’re so considerate. Thank you, and I love you~”\n“I love you too~ Let’s have a great time on this trip.”\n“Absolutely!”\n*****\nTime flew by, and midterms were just around the corner.\nThe exams would start tomorrow and end on Friday.\nI only had one exam on Friday morning.\nAs soon as I finish the exam, we’ll board the train to Gangneung.\nAlthough I was exhausted from all the assignments, there was a happy feeling inside me.\nIn Gangneung, I’ll eat delicious food with Han-gyeol and see the ocean.\nJust imagining walking barefoot on the beach and taking a stroll in the cool night air brought a smile to my face.\nHan-gyeol is the kind of person who makes me smile just by thinking about him.\nI miss him.\n“Eun-ha~ Are you done with your assignments?”\nJiyoung, who was sitting behind me, asked.\n“Ah! I’m almost done. Should be finished soon.”\n“Ugh, I don’t understand why we have so many assignments. I’d rather just take an exam...”\n“Just hang in there a little longer. Once midterms are over, we can have fun.”\n“I’m heading out now. Are you staying longer?”\n“I’ll stay a bit longer to finish up. You can go ahead, Jiyoung.”\n“Alright~ See you tomorrow~”\nJiyoung headed home first, and I stayed for about thirty more minutes before leaving the student center.\nHan-gyeol had finished his classes earlier than me today and said he would study at the library while waiting.\nI went straight to the library and searched for Han-gyeol.\nAfter looking around, I found him studying hard.\nI quietly took a seat next to him, but he didn’t move at all.\nHe seemed so focused that I didn’t want to disturb him.\nHe’s really working hard.\nI found myself stealing glances at Han-gyeol as he studied.\nIt had been a while since I saw him study like this.\nBack in high school, we used to study together all the time, but it had become a rare sight lately.\nEven now, as a college student, Han-gyeol still has the habit of lightly biting his lip whenever he’s solving a difficult problem. I wonder if, as we continue to live together, I’ll discover more of Han-gyeol’s habits.\nDoes he also know about the little quirks I’m not even aware of?\nJust watching him makes me happy. I can’t wait to get home, hug him, and kiss him.\nHonestly, if I could, I’d carry him around in my pocket all day.\nAfter a while, Han-gyeol pulled out his phone and sent a message to someone.\nImmediately, my phone buzzed in my pocket.\nHearing the vibration, Han-gyeol turned his head towards me.\nI shyly waved at him as he looked at me.\n“Oh!”\nHan-gyeol’s eyes widened in surprise. He gestured for us to head outside, grabbed his bag, and we left the library.\n“You should’ve told me you were here. I almost screamed.”\n“Hehe. You were so focused, I didn’t want to interrupt. It was nice to see you studying again after so long. How did it go?”\n“I worked hard. What about you? Didn’t you have a lot of assignments?”\n“I finished them all. I even submitted them.”\n“Did you eat?”\n“I waited to eat with you~”\n“What?! You must be starving. Let’s go home right now. I’ll cook something delicious for you.”\nThis week, it was Han-gyeol’s turn to cook.\nBut I didn’t want to make him cook after he had just finished studying.\n“You still have studying to do, so let’s just grab something simple on the way home.”\n“Alright. What do you feel like eating?”\nI felt so grateful and loved by how much Han-gyeol always tries to accommodate me.\n“Let’s get whatever you want to eat this time. You don’t always have to think about me~”\n“Then how about we stop by the rice bowl place and get some salmon bowls to go?”\n“Sounds perfect~ Let’s go quickly.”\nI tightly held onto Han-gyeol’s hand.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“Nothing, I just wanted to say your name.”\n“What’s that about?”\n“I love you~”\nI’m so grateful to have Han-gyeol, who gives me strength in the midst of our busy lives.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "“Hey, Han-gyeol, how did your exam go?”\n“Economic Principles was pretty tough. How about you?”\n“Ugh...! I think I chose the wrong major. It was insanely difficult.”\n“Seems like it was hard for everyone. Do you have any exams left?”\n“Nope, I’m done. Seunghoon still has his Marketing Principles exam though. Want to grab drinks when he’s done?”\nJaehyun suggested, but I had to turn him down.\n“Ah, sorry. I have plans with my girlfriend today, so I can’t make it.”\n“Yeah, I figured. Let’s do it next week with Seunghoon.”\n“Sounds good. You did great on your exams. I’ve got to go now, I’ve got something planned.”\n“Alright~ Have fun~”After finishing the conversation with Jaehyun, I headed towards the student center where Eun-ha was waiting.\nSitting on the bench outside, I replayed today’s exams in my head as I waited for her.\n‘I think I did well, but I wonder if it’ll be good enough for a scholarship.’\nI had completely forgotten all the stuff I studied for the college entrance exam, so I had to start from scratch, but studying for my major was different.\nSurprisingly, all the things I learned in my previous life were still fresh in my mind, so I was expecting good results.\nBack in high school, I was too busy studying for the entrance exam to notice, but being younger definitely has its perks.\nHaving to go through military service again felt like the world could crumble at any second, but there was nothing I could do about it.\nSince I had this chance to start over, I thought it’d be smart to start preparing for a job a little early.\nGetting certifications like CFP, AFRK, or becoming an investment manager would be great to have under my belt while I’m still young.\nOr maybe, I could start studying for a professional license while I’m ahead of the game.\nSome of the university courses overlap with the first exam requirements, so it wouldn’t be too hard to prep for the first stage.\nWould the best option be to pass the first stage around the time I finish my military service and then prep for the second right after?\nThat way, I’d have the certification before I even graduate.\nHaving struggled with job prep in my previous life, I wanted to start as soon as possible. I thought I worked hard back then, but I didn’t really understand the job market, and that made things rough.\nNow that I’m 20 again, creating a gap between me and my competition is the smartest thing to do.\nI need to maintain my grades for the scholarship, but extracurriculars can wait until after military service, right?\nI should get some certifications and start preparing for language exams in the meantime. I should at least take the TOEIC before the second semester starts.\n“Han-gyeol~!”\n“Hm?!”\nEun-ha came running out of the student center, and I spotted her right away. She had the biggest smile on her face, and I stood up from the bench.\n“Han-gyeol~ Let’s go to Gangneung~!”\nShe bounded over to me, her bright eyes sparkling as she gazed up at me.\n“Why are you so excited? How did your exams go?”\n“Hm?! Who cares, they’re over! Let’s just go!”\n“We’ve got plenty of time~ Let’s stop by home and pack first. Okay—”\nWhen I reached out my hand, Eun-ha smiled shyly and intertwined her fingers with mine.\n“You worked really hard on your exams.”\n“You worked hard too, Han-gyeol~ Ah, the others gave me a list of great places to eat in Gangneung.”\n“Oh, really? Let’s check them out.”\n“I love traveling with you. I think it’s going to be so much fun.”\n“With a perfect plan, it has to be fun~”\n“Exactly. Let’s go already!”\nWe went back home, packed our things, and headed out.\nAfter taking a taxi to Cheongnyangni Station, we grabbed some croque-monsieur and coffee at a café and reviewed our plans.\nWe made sure to double-check the check-in time for the accommodation and even had a Plan B ready, just in case.\nThe weather was clear, and our first trip together was going smoothly.\n“Han-gyeol~ Pay attention to me too~”\n“Hm? Oh, I thought you were busy looking at your phone.”\n“The plan is all set now, so we can relax, right?”\nEun-ha smiled sweetly and placed her hand on top of mine, her fingers playfully moving across the back of my hand, drawing my attention.\n“Alright~”\n“I’m a planner too, but you’re on a whole other level~”\n“I just don’t like when unexpected things happen.”\n“Really? I think it’d be fun if something unexpected happened while we’re traveling, especially with you!”\nEun-ha looked at me intently, swaying her head side to side, her feet playfully nudging my leg.\n“Maybe I’ve been thinking too much about the plan.”\n“But I like you because you’re so handsome and sexy when you plan.”\n“Wow, you really just say that out loud, huh? I like you too, Eun-ha.”\n“Han-gyeol, where should we go during summer break?”\n“How about an indoor pool? I want to see you in a swimsuit.”\n“Whaaat~? You’re so cheeky~”\nEun-ha’s bright smile was so lovable that I couldn’t help but be charmed.\n“You’re so beautiful, I can’t help but want to see more.”\n“Alright. Let’s go to the pool in the summer and find a nice, cool place to stay.”\n“And if we have time, let’s visit Jeju Island too.”\n“Yes, yes! Let’s make lots of memories!”\n“The train should be arriving soon. Let’s go.”\n“Okay~”\nEun-ha and I left the café and headed towards the train platform. In the distance, the KTX pulled in, and we quickly boarded.\n“Is it because it’s Friday lunchtime? There aren’t many people.”\n“By evening, it’ll probably be packed. Give me your bag, I’ll put it up for you.”\nI placed my bag in the overhead compartment and lifted Eun-ha’s bag up as well.\n“Thank you~”\n“If you need anything, just let me know.”\n“Got it! Let’s sit down.”\nOnce seated, Eun-ha showed me some restaurants on her phone.\n“Yoori said this place has amazing kalguksu! Do you want to try it?”\n“Think you can eat all that? The portions look pretty big.”\n“It’s fine~ I can eat a lot! We’re on a trip, so we should indulge in lots of good food. Ah—! And this place! They’re famous for their gelato. Want to check it out? It’s not too far from where we’re staying.”\n“Let’s do that~ We can go whenever we have some free time.”\nEun-ha, brimming with excitement, was absolutely adorable.\n“Han-gyeol, I’m already having so much fun. What do I do?”\n“What do you mean~? We’ll just have even more fun once we get there.”\n“Yeah, yeah! Thanks for coming on this trip with me.”\n“I should be the one thanking you~”\nWhy is she so lovable?\n“It’s about an hour and a half to get there, right?”\n“Yeah, and the place we’re staying is just a short walk from Gangneung Station.”\n“Cool. What do you usually do on the train? Do you sleep?”\n“I usually look out the window for a bit and then sleep. What about you?”\n“Then I’ll just watch you sleep, Han-gyeol. Go on, sleep.”\n“I’m not gonna fall asleep that fast.”\n“I’ll lend you my shoulder.”\nEun-ha gently offered me her shoulder. I tried leaning on it, but the height wasn’t quite right, and it felt a bit uncomfortable.\n“How is it? Comfortable?”\n“It’s a bit cramped.”\n“But only you get to use it.”\n“True~ but you smell amazing.”\n“It’s like having a personal diffuser, huh?”\n“What even is that?”\nI couldn’t help but chuckle at her joke. This wasn’t my usual vibe.\n“Since I gave you my shoulder, I should get to hold your hand.”\n“I thought it was a free service?”\n“Nothing’s free in this world~ Come on, hand it over.”\nShe held out her palm, so I placed my fist on top of it.\n“How am I supposed to hold this? Open your fist!”\n“Try opening it~”\nEun-ha struggled to pry my fist open with one hand. When that didn’t work, she turned her body and used both hands to force it open.\nOnce she finally managed, she tightly clasped my hand with a satisfied smile, offering me her shoulder again.\n“Han-gyeol, what should we do first when we get there?”\n“We’ll probably be hungry, so how about we grab something to eat? Should we head to Gangneung Market first?”\n“I love it~ Since we have plenty of time, let’s take it easy on the first day and then really explore starting tomorrow.”\n“What should we eat at the market?”\n“Just follow me. I’ve already picked out a bunch of stuff I know you’ll love. Want to see?”\nEun-ha showed me her phone screen.\n[Must-eat foods at Gangneung Market]\n○ Chicken skewers. 4,500 won\n○ Kalguksu. 3,000 won\n○ Ice cream hotteok. 3,000 won\n○ Fish cake croquettes (Kimchi, Cheese croquettes recommended). 3,000 won\n○ Kimchi-wrapped pork belly. 5,000 won\n○ Garlic bread. 3 pieces for 13,000 won\n.\n.\n○ Sweet and spicy chicken. 20,000 won (22,000 won for half mild, half spicy!)\nSeeing the long list of dishes made me smile involuntarily. I hadn’t expected her to look all this up in such detail.\n“When did you find all this?”\n“I’ve been looking things up whenever I had time~”\nShe was so adorable, I thought I might die from it. I hadn’t realized she was looking forward to this trip so much.\n“Sounds good~ So, how about we start with kalguksu and then work our way through the rest?”\n“Yes, yes! Perfect. Should we save the sweet and spicy chicken for dinner, though? It’s a bit much right after eating, don’t you think?”\n“Yeah, let’s do that~ What else did you find?”\n“A gelato place, some cafés we can visit, and so on.”\n“We’ll probably spend the whole trip eating at this rate.”\n“I also found a great shellfish grill and a sashimi restaurant for the evening! Don’t worry, I only picked places with great reviews, so just trust me and follow my lead.”\nEun-ha, insisting I just trust her, was too cute for words. I tried holding back my laughter since we were on the train, but it was impossible.\n“Pfft…!”\n“Why, why are you laughing?”\n“Sorry. You’re just so cute right now… I can’t help it.”\n“Wh-what do you mean cute? What did I do to be cute?”\n“You’re just too cute. Why are you like this?”\nI leaned closer, resting my head on her shoulder.\n“I really like you.”\n“Why am I so cute, though~?”\n“Everything about you is cute. Were you this excited for the trip? I don’t know how you held it in until now~ Anyone looking would think you’re a little kid. Next time, let’s go somewhere even farther. And be this excited for that trip too, okay?”\nTeasing her playfully, I could see that she was getting embarrassed.\nShe must have realized how overjoyed she’d been this whole time, as her face flushed bright red.\n“N-no way! Do you think I’m a kid or something…?!”\n“Anyone would think so~”\nAh, this is going to be such a fun trip.\n“Stop teasing me…!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "After arriving at Gangneung Station, we didn’t head to our lodging right away. Instead, we made our way to the beach.\nAs soon as the sea came into view, I looked at Han-gyeol.\n“Han-gyeol, this is already so much fun! The weather is amazing too—! Should we dip our feet in before we go?”\n“Let’s drop off our luggage first. We’ve got plenty of time, so let’s take it slow and enjoy.”\n“Okay~ Ah, why is it so exciting to be on a trip with you, Han-gyeol? My heart’s racing!”\n“Me too. But we should grab some food, so let’s head to the lodging first~”\n“Yes~”\nWith my arm linked with Han-gyeol’s, we arrived at our lodging, which was a little ways from the beach.\n“Hello, we have a reservation under Lee Han-gyeol.”\n“Got it. You’re in room 202~”The lady, who seemed to be the owner, was really friendly.\nAs soon as we got into the room, we started unpacking right away.\nI had packed a bunch of things, so it took a bit of time to organize.\nI should stash the underwear I’ll wear on our last night in the suitcase for now—\n“Why’d you pack so much stuff?”\n“Ah—!”\nI quickly threw myself over the suitcase to hide it.\n“What’s going on?”\n“N-Nothing! You just startled me, sneaking up on me like that.”\n“Why’d you bring so much luggage? Want me to help you unpack?”\n“I’m not a kid~ I can handle this much on my own.”\n“You’re so excited for this trip, you’re acting like one.”\n“Anyway—! I can do this by myself, so why don’t you just relax on the bed?”\nI shoved the underwear back into the suitcase and pulled out my clothes and toiletries.\nAfter quickly finishing the unpacking, I jumped onto the bed where Han-gyeol was lying down.\n“You’re gonna get hurt like that~”\nI rested my head on his arm as he lay there.\n“Hehe. Ah, I’m so excited. I should’ve gone on a trip with you sooner.”\n“We’ll have plenty of trips to take from now on. Where do you want to go? Not Jeju Island.”\n“Hmm~ As long as it’s with you, I don’t care. But I do want to go abroad.”\n“Where abroad? Japan since it’s close?”\n“Hmm~ Japan sounds good, but Southeast Asia wouldn’t be bad either~”\nThe thought of going somewhere new with Han-gyeol is always thrilling.\n“Think about it—if we can, we’ll go everywhere.”\n“Sounds good, sounds good. Han-gyeol, let’s go to the Central Market now—! I’m starving!”\n“Alright, let’s go get some kalguksu.”\n“Ah—wait a sec, let me tie my hair~”\nI reached for the hair tie around my wrist and started gathering my hair.\nIt’s just more convenient to have it tied up when walking around to eat.\nAs I held the hair tie in my mouth and started pulling my hair together, I noticed Han-gyeol staring at me.\nOh, right. He likes this.\n“Hehe~ You like this, huh?”\n“Well, what can I say… your neckline is just so sexy. I see it all the time, but it always catches my eye.”\n“If you like it that much, want to tie my hair for me? That way, you can see my neck even more.”\n“Sure, I’ll do it. Come here.”\nI handed him the hair tie and turned around.\n“Make it look pretty~”\n“Can I do pigtails?”\n“You’ll regret it~”\n“Too bad~”\nHan-gyeol carefully gathered my hair into his hand, lifting it up with such care.\nAll that was left was for him to tie it, but he took his time, moving at a leisurely pace.\n“Why are you taking so long~ Hurry and tie it.”\n“If I tie it quickly, I won’t be able to admire your neckline for long.”\n“If you like it so much, maybe you should be the one tying my hair from now on.”\n“No can do. I love watching you hold the hair tie in your mouth—it’s incredibly sexy, and I don’t want to miss it.”\n“I have no idea why that’s sexy~”\n“Just think of it as my personal taste. There—done.”\nAs soon as Han-gyeol finished tying my hair, I turned to the mirror.\n“Wow—you tied it really nicely!”\n“Yeah? I feel good hearing that.”\n“Come on, let’s go out—!”\n“Alright~”\nWe left the lodging and walked straight to Gangneung Central Market.\nFrom the entrance, the delicious smell of food hit us, and we eagerly explored the market.\nShops I had only seen in videos were now right in front of me. We found the noodle place that Yoori had recommended and walked in.\n“Welcome~”\n“Two bowls of spicy kalguksu, please~”\n“Sure~”\nAs soon as we sat down, I couldn’t stop smiling as I looked at Han-gyeol.\nSeeing my face, he chuckled softly.\n“Are you that happy? You haven’t stopped smiling.”\n“Yeah! This is so much fun!”\n“We haven’t even done anything yet.”\n“True~ but it’s still fun. Are you having fun, too?”\n“Of course~ I’m here with you.”\nMaybe it’s because we’re on a trip, but Han-gyeol’s words sounded even sweeter.\nNo matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t stop grinning.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah, Eun-ha?”\n“I just wanted to call your name~”\n“You’ve been calling me ‘Han-gyeol’ a lot lately, haven’t you?”\n“Oh—really?!”\n“Yeah. It’s been a while since you last called me by my full name.”\nNow that I think about it, I really have been calling him by just ‘Han-gyeol’ more often lately.\n“Huh, you’re right. Do you prefer if I use your full name?”\n“Nah~ I just thought of it, that’s all. I kinda like the nickname, to be honest.”\n“Han-gyeol. Han-gyeol. Han-gyeol. Hmm—no one else calls you ‘Han-gyeol,’ right?”\n“Right. Only you call me that.”\n“Then I’ll keep calling you ‘Han-gyeol’~”\n“Go ahead~”\nIt made me feel really special, like it was a nickname only I could use.\n“When we get married, I’ll call you ’honey~’”\n“Alright. And when we’re married, I’ll call you ‘darling~’”\nIf Han-gyeol ever called me ‘darling,’ my heart would probably explode from beating so hard.\n“Can’t you call me that right now?!”\n“Depends on how Eun-ha behaves~”\n“Aw, come on! Do it now.”\n“I’ll do it if Eun-ha deserves it~”\n“You’re so mean.”\nBut I still love it.\n****\nAfter finishing our spicy kalguksu, we wandered around the market.\n“That kalguksu was so good. Should we have it again on our last day?”\n“Sounds good. I kind of want more too.”\n“You were really enjoying it, Han-gyeol. Was one bowl enough for you?”\n“We’ve got other stuff to eat~ Let’s go get some ice cream hotteok now.”\nHan-gyeol grabbed my hand and led me to the hotteok stand.\nIt seemed like he was excited too, which made me feel even better.\nHe was holding my hand more tightly than usual and walking faster.\nActing all excited because we’re on a trip~ I don’t even know who the real kid is anymore.\n“Two ice cream hotteoks, please.”\n“That’ll be 6,000 won. Please put the money in the box~”\n“Sure~”\nHan-gyeol placed the money in the box and stared intently at the hotteoks cooking.\nWatching him like that was so adorable that I couldn’t take my eyes off him.\n“Han-gyeol~ Do you like it that much?”\n“Why so sudden?”\n“It’s just… you seem extra upbeat today.”\n“Do I? Now I feel embarrassed.”\nWhenever Han-gyeol gets embarrassed, he avoids eye contact and scratches the back of his neck.\nAh—why is he so lovable?\nNo matter how many times I look at him, he’s just endlessly adorable.\n“You’re cute…”\n“Could you say I’m handsome instead of cute to your boyfriend?”\n“Then stop being cute~ It’s your fault, Han-gyeol~”\n“I’m sure you’re a hundred times cuter than me.”\n“Really? Then take care of me for the rest of your life~”\n“I already am, aren’t I?”\nAs we were teasing each other, the hotteok was ready.\n“Two hotteoks~”\n“Oh—thank you! Here, this one’s yours, Eun-ha.”\n“Yum! Should we eat while walking?”\n“Weren’t you planning to eat this and then find something else?”\n“Let’s not just stick to the market. How about we go see the ocean? We can always come back to the market tomorrow, right? You can’t truly enjoy food if you’re too full~”\n“You’re right. Let’s go to the ocean. Here—your hand.”\n“My hand!”\nAfter grabbing Han-gyeol’s hand tightly, we walked from the market toward the sea.\nAs the beach came into view and got closer, my heart started racing, and my face felt like it was heating up.\nThankfully, the cool breeze against my cheeks helped calm me down.\n“Do you like the ocean that much? You’re all smiles.”\n“It’s my first time seeing the ocean with you, so I’m extra happy!”\n“I’m glad you’re so happy, Eun-ha. Look, there’s a bench. Let’s go sit there for a bit.”\nHan-gyeol gently tugged me along.\nLeaving our footprints in the sand, we walked toward the bench.\n“Han-gyeol, wouldn’t it be nice to have our honeymoon at the beach too?”\n“Going straight to the honeymoon, huh? We’ll have to go somewhere else too.”\n“I want to spend a beautiful beach honeymoon with you!”\n“I’d like to go wherever you’d be happiest.”\n“Really? But make sure I’m not the only one getting my way.”\n“Of course~ But I still want to see you this excited again.”\n“I’ll show this side only to you.”\n“Good. Make sure I’m the only one.”\nWe sat on the bench, eating hotteok while gazing at the ocean.\nI like looking at Han-gyeol, but it’s also nice sharing a view, just watching the waves crash and feeling the cool breeze brushing past us.\nIt feels peaceful and exciting at the same time.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“I love you. Truly!”\nAfter I confessed my love, Han-gyeol responded softly.\n“I love you too.”\nHis words made me feel so happy.\nAs I grinned, Han-gyeol added something else.\n“Darling.”\nI whipped my head around at his words.\nHis face flushed red, and he quickly looked away, clearly embarrassed.\n“Han-gyeol, did you… just…”\n“Sorry. That was too much for me.”\nSuddenly, Han-gyeol jumped up from the bench and bolted forward.\n“Hey—! Where are you going?!”\nI quickly chased after him as he sprinted along the beach.\n“Say it one more time!”\n“I can’t—!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "We were taking a walk along the beach and ended up at a café with an ocean view.\nSitting by the window, we leisurely ate our dessert, but Eun-ha had a pouty expression on her face.\n“Just once—! Just one more time—!”\n“I told you, it’s embarrassing~ I’ll do it next time.”\n“When’s next time?”\nEun-ha seemed to really like being called “Darling.” Ever since the beach, she had been begging me to call her “Darling” just one more time.\nHonestly, I could’ve done it, even though I was a little embarrassed, but Eun-ha’s persistent nagging was too cute, so I decided not to give in.\nI had to hold back my grin as she puffed up her cheeks and glared at me with a sulky look.\n“Hmm, maybe when we go on another trip?”\n“That’s too far away. Can’t you just do it now and get it over with?!”“Eun-ha, can’t you just hold out a little longer?”\n“I’m holding out even now. It’s not like it’s a big deal, so just do it. If you do it one more time, I won’t ask aga—mmph.”\nI shoved a piece of cake into her mouth. Eun-ha chewed it slowly, staring at me the entire time.\n“Isn’t it good?”\n“If you call me ‘Darling,’ I think it’ll taste even sweeter…”\n“You really want to hear it that badly?”\nAt my words, Eun-ha nodded furiously.\n“I’ll call you that once the whipped cream on your lips is gone~”\n“What—?!”\nEun-ha quickly turned to check her face on her phone screen. Then, she looked back at me with a cold expression.\n“There’s nothing on my lips…!”\n“I was just teasing you. Darling.”\n“…!!”\nEun-ha flinched, blinking rapidly. I watched her face turn red, all the way from the beginning to the end.\n“Your face went red so fast. You’re gonna explode.”\n“Seriously…! You always hit me with these things out of nowhere…!”\nMaybe trying to cool herself off, Eun-ha grabbed the coffee cup from the table. She took a big gulp of the iced Americano, trying to calm down, but it wasn’t working.\nHer flushed face wouldn’t cool down, and the poor Americano quickly disappeared.\n“Teasing you is my favorite thing in the world.”\n“Enough already?! I’m not falling for your tricks anymore.”\n“Really? Then why is your face still so red?”\n“Ugh…! I’m mad that I’ll keep getting embarrassed no matter how many times you do this…!”\n“Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it if you hear it enough~”\nAs I smiled at her, Eun-ha’s face turned even redder.\n“I don’t think this feeling will ever go away. Whenever you call me that, my heart flutters. People say that as time passes, excitement fades and comfort grows, but why is that not happening to me?”\n“Huh?”\n“The more time I spend with you, the more I like you and the more I get excited. Maybe it’s because I already felt comfortable with you even before we started dating?”\n“I’m not really the most comfortable person, am I?”\n“Hm…! Objectively speaking, you can be a bit cold, but to me, you’re incredibly comforting. It’s like, when I’m with you, I feel good, at ease, and I don’t have to overthink things.”\n“Thanks for saying that~”\nWe’ve always worked things out through conversation, so I had confidence that, even if conflicts arose in the future, we’d handle them well.\n“Come to think of it, we’ve never really had a fight, have we? The other day Jeong asked if I’d ever had an argument with you, but I couldn’t think of anything~”\n“An argument , huh~? I can’t think of any either. We’ve always been good at talking things through. If I had to point out something, maybe before we started dating, when I asked you to be honest with me because you were avoiding me? Or that time I lied about being sick and you got mad?”\n“Oh-! That’s right!”\nEun-ha suddenly widened her eyes as if she’d just remembered.\n“But still, those weren’t really fights, were they? They were more like misunderstandings.”\n“Yeah, I was definitely hurt when you kept avoiding me like that~”\nI teased her lightly, and Eun-ha looked flustered.\n“T-that wasn’t avoiding—!”\n“Then what was it~?”\n“It was just… around that time, I realized I liked you… so every time I saw your face, my own face would get so hot, and I didn’t know what to do.”\n“That was cute too~ Like when you invited me to get tonkatsu and then apologized at the café afterward.”\n“Ah, come on…! That was a year ago!”\n“And you pretending not to know the answers in class just so I could explain them to you was adorable too~ You don’t do that anymore, huh?”\n“Ugh…! Stop bringing up my embarrassing past!”\nEven when she spoke with a grumble, it was impossibly endearing.\n“Why~? Those were the innocent days of high school.”\n“Ugh…! Thinking about it now, I should’ve just confessed to you right when I realized how I felt!”\n“Even your confession was adorable~ The way you buried your face in the blanket while confessing~”\n“You’re so mean…!”\nEun-ha bit her lip, her cheeks flushed.\n“Oh? You’ve got the same look on your face as you did when you confessed.”\n“Han-gyeol, you seriously—!”\nShe’s just too precious.\n****\nAfter the sun set, we headed to a shellfish restaurant near the beach for dinner. Eun-ha had picked this place after reading lots of reviews.\n“Please prepare it like this. Oh, and a bottle of soju, too.”\n“Of course! I’ll get everything ready for you right away~”\n“Thank you~”\nAfter expertly placing the order, Eun-ha turned toward me with a bright smile.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll grill everything perfectly for you!”\n“Huh?”\n“I watched videos on how to grill shellfish to perfection~ so leave it to me. I’ll wear the gloves and do everything. Trust me!”\nEun-ha confidently slipped on the thick gloves from the table, and the sight of those bulky gloves on her delicate hands was oddly adorable.\n“Everything you do is seriously cute.”\n“Huh?! This is the moment where you should say I’m impressive. I’m planning to grill the shellfish all cool and professionally.”\n“Really~? So you’re going to handle everything from start to finish? I’m not going to help at all?”\n“All you have to do is eat and enjoy~”\n“I do have a conscience, though. Let’s take turns.”\nBut Eun-ha crossed her arms in an X and firmly refused.\n“No way. I really want to do this for you. Most of the time when we eat out, you’re the one grilling the meat.”\n“Well, that’s because I’m good at grilling meat.”\n“That’s exactly why I want to do this for you. I’ll even peel the shrimp for you, so just focus on eating this time! I’ve watched a lot of videos, so I’m confident. Trust me! I’ve got this whole trip under control!”\n“Pffft-! ‘Noona’?”\n“Yeah! If I’m taking care of you, I’m like your ‘Noona’. Plus, my birthday’s earlier, isn’t it?”\n“We’re only a few days apart!”\n“Even a few days is a difference, isn’t it?”\n“Oh, so that’s how you want to play it?”\n“Yup, that’s exactly how I’m playing it!”\nTraveling really is great. Seeing Eun-ha so happy made me excited too.\n“Alright~ I’ll serve you as ‘Noona’ for today~”\n“Okay!”\nSoon, our platter of grilled shellfish and shrimp arrived. Not long after, the soju was brought out, and I immediately opened the bottle.\n“Eun-ha, hold out your glass.”\n“Sure! Pour it respectfully~ I’m the ‘Noona’ today~”\nEun-ha held up her empty soju glass.\n“Eun-ha, are you already tipsy? Did you sneak a drink before I noticed?”\n“What kind of tone is that to your Noona~?”\nIt seemed like she was really getting into the playful mood. This mischievous side of Eun-ha was both fun and adorable.\nThough strangely enough, it reminded me of her older brother, Eunwoo. Maybe that playful streak runs in the family?\n“Han-gyeol~ My arm’s going to fall off~”\n“Where do you even learn to say things like that?”\n“I just came up with it.”\n“Clever.”\n“Really?!”\nEven her proud expression was cute. I poured soju into her glass and handed the bottle to her. After she filled mine, she got right to grilling the shellfish.\n“Even with those gloves on, be careful. It’s really hot.”\n“Yeah, yeah. I’ll be careful not to get burned. Do you not trust me?”\n“I’m neutral~ You’ve never grilled shellfish before.”\n“I’ve run so many simulations in my head, it’ll be fine.”\nSimulations aren’t always foolproof, but watching her focus on the shellfish so seriously was too cute.\n“Aren’t you being a bit too silent, just staring at the shellfish?”\n“I’m trying really hard not to stare at you, so cut me some slack. Are you jealous?”\n“Of the shellfish?”\nEun-ha nodded without saying a word.\n“That’s ridiculous.”\n“Then bear with it a little~ I’ll make sure it turns out delicious.”\nShe flipped the shrimp with the tongs. As the shellfish began to open, Eun-ha’s hands grew busier.\nI couldn’t take my eyes off her as she worked so hard to make sure the grilled shellfish turned out perfectly for me.\nOut of nowhere, something rose from deep within me, and the words just slipped out.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Hm?”\n“I really, really love you.”\nEun-ha’s hands froze mid-action. She looked at my smiling face, then responded with a grin of her own.\n“I love you too. I love you sooooooo much.”\nWho knew the first day of the trip would be this fun? The midterms I’d taken earlier that morning had long since faded from my mind.\nAll I could think about was the adorable Eun-ha in front of me. I couldn’t help but feel excited about how much fun tomorrow would bring.\n“Isn’t it almost done by now?”\n“The oysters are ready to eat-!”\n“Are they cooked through? You should try them first.”\n“No way. The oysters are all yours.”\n“Huh? Why?”\nI tilted my head in confusion, but Eun-ha placed the grilled oysters onto my plate.\n“Oysters are good for men~!”\n“What?”\n“Eat up~”\nIt seems like tonight is going to be even more exciting than tomorrow.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "“Han-gyeol, ah~”\n“Ah~”\nI placed a peeled shrimp into Han-gyeol’s mouth.\nHe smiled, savoring the taste, and the way he enjoyed the shrimp was just so adorable.\nIs this how it would feel to feed our own child who resembles Han-gyeol? I can’t wait to experience that someday.\n“Is it good?”\nAfter swallowing, Han-gyeol responded to my question.\n“Of course. You were kind enough to peel it for me.”\n“I feel so happy seeing you eat well~!”\n“Did you eat enough? You seem like you didn’t have much.”“I ate plenty~ How about we head out now?”\n“Yeah, let’s do that. I’m full. Let’s take a walk along the beach and then head back to the lodging.”\n“Sounds good~ Let’s not overdo it on our first day.”\n“Right. Let’s get up.”\nWe stood up together, paid the bill, and stepped outside.\nIn the distance, I could faintly hear the sound of waves crashing.\nAs we got closer to the beach, the sound of the waves grew louder, and we arrived at a shore covered in soft sand.\n“There are more people here than I thought.”\n“Looks like most of them are couples, huh?”\nJust like Han-gyeol and me, many couples had come out to enjoy the view of the night sea. We kept a reasonable distance from them and started walking.\nNeither of us said anything, just listening to the sound of the waves as we walked along the beach.\nWhile we were walking side by side, Han-gyeol reached his hand out toward me, and I smiled, taking his hand in mine.\n“I love holding your hand and walking by the night sea.”\n“Me too. It’s so peaceful, perfect for this mood. And the breeze feels refreshing.”\nA cool breeze blew past us, and the wind made Han-gyeol’s forehead more visible, which made him even more charming.\nMaybe it was the moonlight, but he looked especially handsome tonight.\nI couldn’t help but let out a giggle.\n“Hehe.”\n“Why are you laughing all of a sudden?”\n“Just… being here with you makes me so happy! I feel so relaxed, and the only thing on my mind is you. This morning, I was so stressed out from taking exams, and just yesterday, I was struggling to study for them. But being here now, I don’t even think about it anymore.”\nWhenever I’m with Han-gyeol, it feels like all the bad thoughts in my head just disappear in an instant.\nWhen I’m with him, my mind is filled only with him, and I’m completely immersed in the moment.\n“I feel the same way. Being with you makes me feel so comfortable and happy. I get excited without even realizing it.”\n“Hearing that makes me feel proud as your girlfriend~ In that case, give me a reward. A reward!”\n“A reward? Sure. If you want one, I’ll give it to you. What kind of reward?”\n“Hmm~ What would be good~”\nI thought about it for a moment.\nI wanted to create the happiest memory of the day.\nThen, a great idea came to me, and I looked at Han-gyeol with a grin.\n“Give me a piggyback ride!”\n“Out of nowhere?”\n“Yep, yep! I want to ride on your back.”\n“I might stumble since I drank a bit.”\n“That’ll be fun in its own way~ Come on, give me a piggyback ride.”\nI spread my arms wide, signaling that I wanted him.\n“Is this what it feels like to have a daughter? Alright, I’ll carry you.”\nHan-gyeol carefully bent down, and I wrapped my arms around his neck as I climbed onto his back.\n“Alright— full speed ahead!”\n“Should I just toss you into the ocean?”\n“You think you can get away with that? Try it if you’re confident~”\n“Whoa, scary. Just hold on tight and don’t fall.”\n“Got it~”\nI held on tightly, hugging him close. But when Han-gyeol’s upper body started to tilt backward, I quickly loosened my grip.\n“Ugh..! Don’t squeeze so hard, or I’ll fall over.”\n“I really love being on your back. Will you still give me piggyback rides when we’re old?”\n“No way, ask our son to do that.”\n“That sounds wonderful too. He’ll look just like you, right?”\n“Honestly, I think it’d be better if he looked more like you.”\n“I think I’d be happiest if he looked like both of us.”\n“No matter who he takes after, we’ll be happy~ Let’s get moving.”\nHan-gyeol began walking carefully.\nBeing pressed up against his broad back made my heart start pounding again.\nI wonder if his heart is racing like mine right now?\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Can I ask you a cliché question?”\n“Go ahead.”\n“Can I get a little cheesy?”\n“Of course. I’ll let it slide since you’re drunk.”\n“How much do you love me~?!”\n“Wow~ That’s like one of the hardest questions a guy can get. Can I get some bonus points or a hint?”\n“I’ll give you 10 bonus points since you’re giving me a piggyback ride.”\n“Hmm~”\nHe started to think deeply.\nIt was just a playful question, but I didn’t expect him to take it so seriously.\nStill, I felt happy that he was putting so much thought into it.\nThis kind of thoughtfulness is one of the things I find so attractive about him.\n“Ah! I’ve got it.”\n“What is it~?”\n“I’d co-sign a loan for you.”\nThat was such a Han-gyeol-like answer.\n“What-?! You love me that much?! Haven’t you heard that you shouldn’t even co-sign for family?!”\n“That’s just how much I love you~ How’s that? Was it a good answer?”\n“It was clever and perfect. I’ll give you 110 points out of 100, with the bonus. But seriously! Never ever co-sign for anyone!”\n“I’m happy to hear that. Is there no reward?”\n“What do you want as a reward?”\n“Just keep looking at me like you do now.”\n“That’s a given~ I’ll give you something else. What do you want?”\n“A picture of you with pigtails.”\n“You’re unbelievable...”\nI hugged him tightly.\n“Hey, I’m going to fall!”\n“That’s because you’re being cheeky.”\n“I just want to see you with pigtails again because it was so cute. I miss it.”\n“How is that cute? Wearing pigtails at twenty is… kind of weird.”\n“That’s why it was even cuter~ Your expression back then was hilarious.”\n“Please, forget it… as soon as possible.”\n“It made such a strong impression, I don’t think I can forget it~”\nHan-gyeol kept walking as he responded to me.\n“But where exactly are we going?”\n“Should we head back to the lodging now?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Let’s take our time on the way back. Put me down.”\n“Carefully now, climb down.”\nHe gently set me down, and I turned to look back at how far we’d walked.\n“Wow, we came this far?”\n“Of course, it probably felt shorter for you since you were getting a free ride~”\n“What?! Didn’t you say I’m light as a feather?”\n“Maybe it’s because we’re by the sea, but that feather seems to have soaked up some water.”\n“What does that even mean?!”\nHan-gyeol laughed, clearly amused, and I couldn’t help but laugh along with him.\nIt’s amazing—when he laughs, I automatically join in.\nI bet if he cried, I’d cry too.\n“Why are you laughing?”\n“Because you’re laughing.”\n“If I cry, will you cry too?”\n“Of course~!”\n“Don’t copy me.”\n“No way~ I’ll follow you forever, even till we die.”\n“You win. Let’s go. Here, take my hand.”\n“Let’s walk with our feet in the water.”\n“Huh?”\n“Hurry up~”\nI grabbed his hand and rushed towards the water.\nWatching the waves roll in, I carefully took off my shoes and socks.\nOnce I dipped my feet into the cool sea, Han-gyeol followed right behind me.\n“It’s so refreshing, probably because it’s nighttime.”\n“Be careful not to get scratched by any rocks.”\n“Don’t worry~ Here, hold my hand.”\nI held my shoes in my right hand and extended my left.\nHe smiled, holding his shoes in his left hand while taking my hand with his right.\n“Ah~ It feels so nice to be here like this with you. I don’t even want to go home.”\n“We can always come back~”\n“I’m going to be so sad when we head home. What should I do?”\n“Then we’ll just come again. Or maybe after we get married, we can bring our family here for a trip?”\n“Ooh! I love that idea!”\n“Traveling with four kids, though... That won’t be easy.”\nEven though he said it with a hint of worry, his smile was bright.\nI love how he imagines the future with me, just like I do.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Thank you~”\n“For what?”\n“For everything! Thank you for making me laugh, for loving me, for caring about me, for smiling at me—thank you for everything from one to a hundred! Thank you for holding my hand like this, and for coming on this trip with me.”\n“I’m thankful too~ for everything.”\n“But most of all, thank you for coming into my life.”\nI stopped in front of him and looked into his eyes.\n“I love you.”\n“Hearing that makes me happy. I love you too.”\nHis face, bathed in the moonlight, was breathtaking.\nI wanted to keep that image in my mind forever, so I walked backward while looking at him.\n“I love you more.”\n“That’s debatable. But careful, you might trip. Come back over here.”\n“What, am I a kid? I won’t fa—whoa?!”\nBefore I could finish my sentence, my view flipped from Han-gyeol to the sky.\nHe tried to grab my arm, but with a loud splash, I fell backward.\n“Ugh.”\n“You really are a kid. Did you get hurt?”\n“I’m fine, but my clothes are all wet now.”\n“Come on, get up. Let’s head back and clean up.”\n“Help me up~”\nI held out both hands, and Han-gyeol grabbed them, pulling me to my feet.\n“I knew this would happen.”\n“But it’s not too bad.”\n“Your clothes are soaked, and you’re covered in sand.”\n“Still, being with you makes even this fun. It’s enjoyable.”\n“Do you want to fall again, then?”\n“No thanks~ Let’s just go inside.”\n“Let’s hurry up and wash off. Come on.”\n“Okay!”\nEverything feels like a precious memory when I’m with him.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“What?”\n“Let’s shower together~”\n“You’re so cheeky.”\n“Hehe. You’re just as cheeky, aren’t you?”\n“True. Let’s hurry.”\n“Okay!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "The first night in Gangneung was… thrilling.\nWe did everything we couldn’t during exam season in just one night…\nIt was a lot. And it was amazing.\nBecause of that, on the second day of the trip, we didn’t even go outside—we just stayed in the room, cuddling.\nSince we had to head back home tomorrow, today was practically the last day of our trip.\nWe had decided to spend the last night at a place with a view of the ocean, so it was time to get up.\nI gently shook Eun-ha, who was sleeping soundly.\n“Eun-ha, let’s get up now.”\n“Mm… just a little more…”\n“It’s almost checkout time. We have to pack and move to the other place~”“Just ten more minutes… I want to lie here with you a little longer. You should sleep a bit more too, Han-gyeol~”\nEun-ha burrowed deeper into my arms.\nShe was so cute, all sleepy like that, so I gave in.\n“Alright. But just ten minutes, okay?”\n“Mm… thanks…”\nI gently smoothed out Eun-ha’s hair as she slept peacefully.\nHer long eyelashes and fair face were glowing, even in the morning light.\nSeriously, I don’t know how she can be this pretty.\n“Eun-ha, ten minutes are up. Time to get up.”\n“Already…? How much time until checkout?”\n“About an hour? If we wash up and head out now, we’ll be good.”\n“Ugh… I guess I really have to get up now…!”\nFinally, Eun-ha slowly sat up.\n“Where’s my hair tie... ah, here it is.”\nShe found the hair tie she had left by the bed and turned to face me.\nShe tapped my cheek and called my name in a sleepy voice.\n“Han-gyeol~ Look at me.”\n“Hm? Why?”\n“It’s time for you to see your favorite part—watch me tie my hair~ Make sure you’re paying attention~”\nWith a mischievous smile, Eun-ha kindly showed me how she tied her hair.\nShe gathered her hair slowly and tied it up with the band, letting me watch every little detail.\n“How is it~? Does watching me tie my hair in the morning make you happy?”\n“I love it. Show me how you do it every morning.”\n“Should I~? Then you have to fix my hair every day too. I love how it makes me feel so loved.”\n“Alright~ I’ll do that for you every day.”\n“It’s a promise~ If you don’t fix my hair, I won’t show you how I tie it~”\n“You’re adorable. I’ll remember that.”\n“Good. Now let’s get ready. You go wash up first, Han-gyeol~”\n“Got it. Just don’t fall asleep again while I’m gone, okay?”\n“Don’t worry. I’ll pack while you’re in there.”\n“Alright~”\nI grabbed a towel and headed to the bathroom.\nI washed my hair, cleaned my face, brushed my teeth, and came out.\n“That was quick.”\nEun-ha seemed to have finished not only packing her own things but mine as well.\nShe was neatly putting my clothes into my bag.\n“I could’ve packed my own stuff, but thanks.”\n“I actually liked packing for you~ I’ll go wash up now!”\n“Alright. Go ahead.”\n“I’ll be back~”\nAfter finishing up, Eun-ha grabbed a towel and went into the bathroom.\nWhen I opened the suitcase to get a change of clothes, everything was so neatly arranged.\nSeeing the clothes stacked so perfectly made me smile without even realizing it.\n“It’s like she is a wife taking care of her husband.”\nBy the time I had changed and dried my hair, Eun-ha came out of the bathroom.\n“You were quick too, Eun-ha.”\n“I need to dry my hair too~”\n“Come here. I’ll dry it for you.”\n“Huh? I can do it myself~”\n“Come on. You packed for me, so let me dry your hair.”\n“Well, I won’t say no~ I’m counting on you~”\nWith a big smile, Eun-ha sat in front of me.\n“If it’s too hot, let me know, okay?”\n“Okay~”\nThe sound of the hairdryer filled the room as I carefully dried Eun-ha’s hair.\n“I love it when you dry my hair~ It feels like a husband taking care of his wife.”\n“I thought the same thing when I saw you packing my clothes earlier.”\n“Really? It felt oddly satisfying organizing your stuff too. It’s strange.”\n“I feel the same, drying your hair. It looks like it’s almost dry now.”\n“Thanks to you, it was nice and quick. Thanks~ Let’s head out.”\n“Yeah, let’s go.”\nWith everything packed, we left the accommodation and headed to the new place.\n****\nThe new place was a somewhat well-known hotel in Gangneung.\nSince it was off-season and we were transitioning from Sunday to Monday, the prices weren’t outrageous.\nAt the front desk, Eun-ha gave her name to the staff.\n“Hello. I have a reservation under Shin Eun-ha.”\n“Yes, here you go. Just take your card key and head to room 1401.”\n“Thank you~ Han-gyeol, let’s go!”\nAs soon as we entered the room via the elevator, the ocean view outside the window greeted us.\nEun-ha was so mesmerized by the sight that she dropped her bags and went straight to the balcony.\nSliding the door open, she called out to me excitedly.\n“Han-gyeol! Hurry and come here! You can see the entire ocean from here!”\n“They said you could watch the sunrise from here. Want to wake up early and see it?”\n“That sounds amazing! Honestly, we should’ve just stayed here all day today instead of wandering around yesterday.”\n“We can come back early. Let’s grab food, hit a café, and come back here.”\n“Yeah, yeah! Are we staying up all night tonight?”\n“I’m good at staying up, but won’t it be hard for you?”\n“I’ll try my best!”\n“Alright~”\nEven though it seemed like a challenge, Eun-ha was full of enthusiasm.\n“Should we rest a bit before heading out to eat?”\n“Before that, I want to change clothes!”\n“Huh? Aren’t you going to wear what you’re already wearing?”\n“I bought a special outfit for the last day~ You turn around while I change!”\n‘Everything she does is so cute.’\n“I don’t want to. I’m going to sneak a peek while you change.”\n“Nooo~ It’s a surprise! Just turn around for a minute~”\n“I’ll be a little disappointed~”\n“Hurry up~”\n“Fine.”\nJust as Eun-ha asked, I turned around.\nI heard her clothes drop to the floor and the soft rustling of fabric as she changed.\nWhat kind of outfit did she get?\nA shirt? A skirt? Maybe something bold?\nNo matter what she wears, I bet it’ll look amazing on her.\n“Hehe~ Han-gyeol~ You can turn around now~”\nExcited, I turned around and saw Eun-ha in a beautiful white dress.\nShe looked pure, almost angelic, with a soft smile as she clasped her hands together modestly.\n“How is it? I bought it just to show you!”\n“Wow- Eun-ha, you seriously look stunning in anything. You’re so beautiful!”\n“Really? Do I look pretty? Ah! I forgot to tie my hair! It’ll look even prettier if I do this, right?”\nEun-ha hurriedly tied her hair and let it fall to one side.\nThe hairstyle suited the atmosphere perfectly.\n“How do I look? Even prettier, right?!”\n“It suits you so well. You look absolutely lovely~”\n“I knew you’d like it~ I’m glad I bought it!”\n“When did you get it? I don’t remember any packages coming to the house.”\n“Oh! I saw it in the underground shopping mall and thought it was pretty, so I bought it! It was only 20,000 won! Cheap, right?!”\nEun-ha proudly held up two fingers as she spoke.\n“It looks like it was made just for you.”\n“You’re flattering me too much~ But hearing you say I’m pretty makes me feel so happy~”\nEun-ha closed the distance between us and snuggled into my arms.\n“You look so handsome today, Han-gyeol~”\n“I’m just wearing my usual clothes.”\n“You’re always handsome~ but today you look even better than yesterday!”\n“Maybe I should’ve bought a new outfit to show you too.”\n“Wanna go buy one today? I’ll buy it for you~!”\n“Alright. Let’s grab some food, and then we can go shopping.”\n“Great! Let’s find an outfit that suits you! Now, let’s head out!”\nEun-ha, beaming with a big smile, grabbed my hand and walked toward the shoe rack.\n“Oh wait, my sandals! I forgot in my rush to get dressed!”\n“You brought sandals too?”\n“Yup! I packed them! I’ll look even prettier with them on, just watch.”\n“Hurry and put them on~”\nEun-ha quickly rummaged through her bag, pulled out a shoe box, and slipped on the sandals.\nThey had quite a bit of a heel, making her taller than usual.\n“Hehe. These are platform sandals, so I’m taller now~”\n“Yeah, you look about 5 cm taller.”\n“What’s your height again? Didn’t you say you grew a bit since high school?”\n“Yeah, when I had my physical, I was around 177 cm.”\n“And I’m 160, so now I must be about 165. Right?”\n“Yep. But why are you suddenly asking about height?”\nI tilted my head, curious, and Eun-ha responded.\n“Did you know something, Han-gyeol?”\n“What?”\n“The ideal height difference for kissing is said to be 12 cm~”\nSo that’s why she asked.\n“Is that so~ I didn’t know that.”\nI playfully replied, and Eun-ha flashed a wide smile.\nSlowly, she cupped my face with her hands and gently pulled my head down.\n“I’m curious if it’s true, mind if we check?”\n“I’m curious too.”\n“Han-gyeol, I love you.”\n“I love you too.”\nAnd with that, Eun-ha pressed her lips to mine.\nWe kissed softly, and I wrapped my arms around her waist.\nDid she buy the heeled sandals just because of that story?\nIf she did, it was too adorable, and I couldn’t resist kissing her more deeply.\nEun-ha seemed to feel the same way, holding onto my shirt as she refused to pull away.\nIn fact, she seemed so happy, continuing to smile even as we kissed.\nWe shared a slow, lingering kiss before finally parting.\n“It really is comfortable, huh~?”\n“Yeah. How about wearing heels like this more often?”\n“Or maybe you could shrink a little~?”\n“I’ll try my best. Now, should we head out?”\n“One more kiss first~”\n“Alright~”\nThis time, I was the one who leaned in and kissed Eun-ha.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "I spent another fun day with Han-gyeol today.\nIt wasn’t like we went on a particularly special date, but everything feels special when Han-gyeol is around.\nEverything feels new, and my heart flutters whenever I’m with him.\nAs expected, travel isn’t really about where or what you do, but more about who you share the time with.\nAfter finishing our day, we stopped by a convenience store, bought a mat and a can of beer each, and sat by the beach.\nWe clinked our cans together, with the sound of the waves and the cool night breeze as our snacks.\n“Han-gyeol, cheers~!”\n“Cheers~!”\nEven just clinking cans together feels so enjoyable.\n“The sound of the waves is so nice, Han-gyeol.”“Yeah, and the night air feels great too.”\n“I love it so much.”\nI rested my head on Han-gyeol’s shoulder.\nHe gently leaned towards me, letting me rest more comfortably.\nI love how naturally considerate he is.\n“Later, when we have kids, I want to come back here and look at the sea again.”\n“We’ll need a bigger mat than this convenience store one. It won’t be big enough.”\n“Pffft—!”\nI burst out laughing, spitting out a bit of beer at Han-gyeol’s unexpected reply.\n“Oh, wow—what surprised you?”\n“Pfft! It’s nothing! I just didn’t expect that answer, that’s all—!”\nIt was such a witty response.\nWhat made it even funnier was the expression on Han-gyeol’s face, like, ‘Was that really funny?’\nWithout a word, he took out a tissue from his bag and gently wiped my mouth.\n“Han-gyeol can be so unpredictable sometimes~”\n“I just meant that this mat would be a tight fit for four people.”\n“True. Since we’ll have six people, we really will need a huge mat~!”\n“Just imagining us all huddled together, looking at the sea, sounds fun.”\n“By then, we’ll be busy taking care of the kids, so we should stay close while we can~.”\nI carefully laid my head on Han-gyeol’s lap.\n“Is it okay if I lie on your lap?”\n“You already are.”\n“I mean, if it’s uncomfortable, I’ll get up~.”\n“No, it’s fine. Just be careful not to spill the beer.”\n“Yes, sir~.”\nLooking up from this angle, Han-gyeol’s face is so handsome.\n“Do you think we’ll have four kids in ten years?”\n“Well, we’d need at least 40 months just for them to be in the womb. I guess we’d have to get married by the time we’re twenty-six.”\n“Let’s have twins to speed up the process~!”\n“Things don’t exactly work out just because you plan them like that~.”\n“I’ll do my best~.”\n“Why are you so cute~?”\nHan-gyeol gently stroked my hair.\n“If we really want four kids by the time we’re thirty, then we’d need to get married by twenty-six.”\n“If you finish military service and graduate from college, you’ll be twenty-six, so we’ll need to start right away.”\n“I’ll try to graduate early. The military… well, there’s no way to shorten that.”\nOh, right, the military.\nWe haven’t really talked about Han-gyeol’s service before.\n“When are you planning to enlist? I don’t think I’ve ever asked.”\n“Well~ I could go after the first semester, or after the first year. I’m thinking of joining the Air Force since I can take leave more often.”\n“I heard the Air Force service is a bit longer, though. Is that true?”\nWhat should I do when Han-gyeol is away for military service?\nThe thought that it was not too far off made me want to look at him even more.\n“Yeah, but I’ll be able to take leave every six weeks, so it might be okay. What do you think, Eun-ha?”\nI carefully placed my hand on his face.\n“I can’t say something like, ‘This is the best decision,’ when I’m not the one going to the military. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly. As your girlfriend, all I can say is, ‘I’ll wait for you.’ So, don’t worry about me. You should do what you want.”\n“Aren’t you worried you’ll feel lonely?”\nI slowly sat up and looked into his eyes.\n“Well… saying I won’t be lonely would be a lie. But it’s not just me who will feel lonely. You’ll be far lonelier and have a much harder time. Han-gyeol, I really love you. It’s hard to fully express how much, but you’re so precious to me. So, don’t worry about me. I love you so much.”\nI hope my words gave him a bit of comfort.\n“Alright~. I’ll think it over slowly.”\n“Yeah. Don’t worry about me. I only have eyes for you. If you could become me for just one day, it would be great—I’d finally be able to show you just how much I love you. Should we just go ahead and file the marriage papers now?”\n“Would that really be okay?”\n“Of course~ My parents would probably approve too.”\n“Wouldn’t they think we’re too young and rushing into things?”\n“When we were working at my mom’s company, she told me to marry you. She kept saying I must never let you go~.”\n“Your mom said that?”\n“Yup!”\nI nodded my head repeatedly.\n“What was it again that you did back then, Han-gyeol? Was it the interest rate model? When you made that in Excel, my mom mentioned it in the meeting room. Not just her, my dad likes you too, and my brother… well, his feelings for you are almost religious. Honestly, the one who should be worried is me. Would they really give their precious son to someone like me so easily...?”\n“My parents like you too, Eun-ha~.”\n“Really? That's such a relief~.”\n“Thank you, for saying that.”\n“Oh, come on~ You’re thanking me for something so obvious?”\n“Still, it makes me feel a bit more at ease.”\n“I’m glad to hear that. Then we need to cuddle and be lovey-dovey more before you leave for the army~ Come here.”\nI planted a soft kiss on Han-gyeol’s lips, and he smiled bashfully, then leaned in and kissed me back.\n“Kissing while looking at the ocean is nice.”\n“I like it too. I like everything about kissing you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Should we head back in now?”\n“Shall we? Let me help you up~.”\nI quickly stood up and held out both hands to Han-gyeol.\nAs soon as he grabbed my hands, I pulled him up with all my strength.\n“Let’s head back to the lodging~!”\n“Yeah~.”\nI just wanted to spend more time with him.\n****\nAs soon as we got back to the lodging, we showered and lay sideways on the bed, gazing out the window.\n“The ocean looks pretty from up here. And the moon is beautiful too.”\n“You’re the prettiest, Eun-ha.”\n“What~?”\nI turned my head towards him and met his loving gaze.\n“We’re talking about the ocean and the moon, but you’re just staring at me~?”\n“Looking at you is a much better deal.”\n“What? Come on, we’re on a trip, at least look at the ocean and the moon. They’re really pretty, you know?”\n“I don’t want to miss out on this deal.”\n“Then let ‘me’ enjoy the view for a change. Your side profile is really handsome.”\n“You’re flattering me too much~.”\n“Hurry up and turn your head to the window~.”\n“Okay~.”\nHan-gyeol smiled bashfully and turned his head towards the window.\nI pressed my face into the bed and kept staring at his side profile.\nI wanted to keep looking, but then his head turned back towards me.\n“What’s this? Keep looking a bit more.”\n“I’ve seen enough.”\n“Really? You’ve seen everything?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Did you look thoroughly?”\n“Yeah, I looked thoroughly.”\n“Then tell me what you think~.”\n“As expected, looking at you is a better deal.”\nI lost this round.\n“Fine. Look at me as much as you want~.”\n“I already am.”\n“Then tell me how you feel about looking at my face~.”\n“Looking at the ocean and the moon is a waste.”\n“Oh, come on~. Be more specific~.”\n“Should I show you with my actions?”\n“Do it!”\nWhen I smiled brightly, Han-gyeol gave me a quick kiss on the cheek.\n“That’s not enough~ Do it again.”\n“Okay.”\nAt my words, Han-gyeol kissed me again.\n“Now give me ten more.”\n“Isn’t that too much?”\n“Make it a hundred more~.”\n“Let’s split it in half.”\n“Deal~.”\nI sat up and straddled Han-gyeol’s stomach.\nThen, holding his face, I gave him a deep kiss on the cheek.\n“There, one down~ Let me know if it’s not enough~.”\n“Alright~.”\nAfter saying that, I showered his face with kisses, and Han-gyeol grabbed my waist and pulled me back down onto the bed.\n“At this rate, I’m going to get devoured.”\n“I’m going to devour you.”\n“You’re a wild beast today~.”\n“But I love Han-gyeol the most~ Now it’s your turn. Hurry and kiss me too~.”\nI grabbed onto his collar and tugged.\nHan-gyeol flashed a quick smile and gave me a soft kiss on the cheek.\n“That’s one~ Forty-nine more to go.”\nThen he kissed my other cheek and finally my lips.\nAs soon as Han-gyeol’s lips touched mine, I immediately wrapped my arms around his neck, holding him close.\nA short kiss became a deeper one, and when I slowly slipped my tongue in, Han-gyeol flinched in surprise.\n“You came in fast.”\n“Why are you pulling away? Come back quickly.”\n“We’re not at fifty yet.”\n“Let’s count the deep kiss as a bunch~.”\n“Alright~.”\nWith that, Han-gyeol leaned back in and covered my lips with his.\nWhen I slightly parted my lips, his tongue naturally found its way in.\n“Mmm…”\nKissing Han-gyeol is always so sweet.\nIt makes me feel even more connected to him.\nAnd the more we kiss, the stronger my desire to be closer to him grows.\nI love him.\nI love him so much.\nI love him more than anyone else in this world.\nOnce again, my feelings for Han-gyeol grew even deeper today.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Eun-ha was determined to stay up all night to watch the sunrise, but as midnight passed, sleepiness began to overtake her.\nIt was adorable how she started to nod off, her head bobbing as she dozed. After all, we had done a lot of walking, so it was natural for her to be tired.\n“Eun-ha, you’re sleepy, aren’t you?”\n“Huh...? No, I’m not sleepy...!”\n“I can tell, even if you pretend otherwise~. I’ve set an alarm for 4:30, so you can sleep a bit now.”\n“But what if we both don’t wake up? You’re tired too, aren’t you?”\n“I’m a light sleeper, so don’t worry. Let’s get some rest now.”\n“Still... I really want to see the sunrise no matter what.”\n“You’ll have a better chance of waking up if you sleep now and get up around 4:30. Staying awake for five more hours will be much harder.”\nShe pondered for a moment before replying.“Alright, let’s do that. But let’s set multiple alarms.”\n“Sure~. You should set yours too.”\n“Okay..! Yaaawn~!”\nEun-ha immediately let out a big yawn.\n“See? You’re sleepy, right?”\n“Hehe... Yeah, I’ve actually been sleepy for a while now.”\n“Come on, set the alarm first.”\n“Yes~.”\nEun-ha set the alarm on her phone, and I turned off the lights.\n“Han-gyeol, come here. Let’s hold hands while we sleep.”\n“We’re just holding hands, right?”\n“Yeah, I think we’ll only hold hands tonight. I’m too tired.”\n“Alright, let’s get some sleep~.”\nWe lay down on the bed, sharing a blanket.\n“Han-gyeol, no matter how sleepy I get, you have to wake me up. Promise?”\nEun-ha gently grasped my hand as she said this.\n“What if you just want to sleep?”\n“Don’t let me! Make sure I watch the sunrise. Okay? I’ll wake you up if you try to sleep through it too!”\n“Got it. Now let’s sleep. We need all the rest we can get.”\n“But I want to cuddle a little more.”\nEun-ha snuggled up close to me.\n“If you’re this close, I won’t be able to sleep.”\n“It’s dark, so I can’t see your face well...”\n“You see it every day; it doesn’t matter if you see it a little less.”\n“Even if I look at you until I die, it won’t be enough~.”\n“You’re too cute. Alright, look all you want~.”\nEun-ha smiled softly as she gazed at my face.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m so happy because of you. I feel like I’m the happiest person in the world.”\n“When do you feel happiest?”\n“I don’t know. I’m just always happy. Just knowing you’re here makes me so happy.”\n“I’ll make you even happier from now on.”\n“No, I’ll make ‘you’ happier.”\n“I’m not sure if it’s possible to be any happier than this.”\n“I’ll make you the happiest person in the world..! Oh-! Am I saying something too cheesy?”\n“No, I love it. Thank you for saying that.”\n“Hehe...”\nEun-ha smiled brightly and planted a kiss on my cheek.\n“Han-gyeol~”\n“Yeah, Eun-ha~?”\nWhen I called her name, she let out a soft giggle.\n“I’m really sleepy~.”\n“Then fall asleep already.”\n“But it’s our last night here, and I don’t want to sleep.”\n“We’ll wake up in four hours~.”\n“Then give me a goodnight kiss...”\n“Alright, come here.”\nEun-ha slowly leaned toward me. I gently stroked her hair as our lips met. When the kiss ended, she smiled sweetly.\n“Thank you... I love you, Han-gyeol...”\nWith that, Eun-ha quickly fell asleep.\nJust how much had she been holding back her sleep?\nEven though she fell asleep right away, she still held onto my hand tightly.\nEvery time I tried to slip my hand out, she wouldn’t let go.\n“Mmm...”\nEven in her sleep, she didn’t want to lose her grip on me.\nIt was adorable how her brow furrowed every time I tried to move.\n“Thank you... I love you too.”\nLove is truly amazing.\nI never believed the saying that love changes people, but I’ve changed the most since falling in love.\nI love waking up to see Eun-ha’s smile in the morning.\nI love the way she turns toward me when tying her hair.\nI love her figure as she prepares breakfast for me when it’s her turn to cook.\nAnd I love how the corners of her lips lift when I gently hug her from behind.\nSince I started dating Eun-ha, I find myself looking forward to tomorrow more and more. I can’t help but wonder, ’What expression will she use to say ‘I love you’ tomorrow?’ My life has become so different from the one filled with worry that I used to know.\nI can hardly believe that I’m experiencing this kind of love.\nEvery moment with Eun-ha feels precious and invaluable. I always thought of myself as a rational person, but when I’m with her, I find myself caught up in emotions.\nIt’s embarrassing and a little cheesy, but I don’t mind getting emotional like this. Slowly, I closed my eyes while gazing at Eun-ha’s face.\nI want to dream about Eun-ha.\n****\n“Han-gyeol~ Wake up~!”\nI felt Eun-ha’s voice and a gentle shaking rouse me from my sleep. As I slowly opened my eyes, I saw her with messy hair, trying to wake me up.\n“Huh...?”\n“It’s 4:40. We need to get up.”\n“Already...? I didn’t even hear the alarm.”\n“You were sleeping so soundly, I turned it off on purpose.”\nEun-ha grabbed both my arms and pulled me up.\n“Go wash your face. I already freshened up. Once you brush your teeth, you’ll wake up fully.”\n“Yeah... I’ll go do that...”\nHalf-asleep, I stumbled into the bathroom. I meant to wash my face first, but somehow I ended up squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush instead. So, I brushed my teeth first, then splashed cold water on my face before coming back out.\n“Feel more awake now?”\n“Thanks to you. I think I would’ve slept right through the sunrise without you.”\n“Then hurry up and come over here and watch me tie my hair~”\nEun-ha patted the bed beside her, calling me over.\n“Did you wait to tie your hair just so I could see?”\n“Of course. You said you love watching me do it in the mornings.”\n“Well, my heart’s racing already.”\n“Come here~”\nAs I sat on the bed, Eun-ha held a hair tie between her lips and began tying her hair, her neck exposed in the soft morning light.\nShe tied her hair with practiced ease, then turned to me with a wide smile.\n“Ta-da~! How does it look?”\n“You’re breathtaking.”\n“Now, let’s go watch the sunrise. It’s so peaceful outside, it feels even more special.”\n“Yeah, let’s do that.”\nEun-ha and I sat on the edge of the bed, gazing out the window. The sky was gradually brightening, but the sun hadn’t fully risen yet.\n“What wish are you going to make while watching the sunrise, Han-gyeol?”\n“Obviously, I’m going to wish that I can stay by your side, being lovey-dovey with you forever.”\n“Then our wishes are the same~. But I guess that’s okay in this case?”\n“Maybe if we both wish for the same thing, it’ll work even better. Let’s just go with that.”\n“Good idea! Let’s wish to stay together like this until the end.”\n“Yeah, that sounds perfect.”\n“Oh! Look, the sun is rising!”\nEun-ha excitedly pointed out the window. The sun was slowly emerging over the horizon.\n“It’s beautiful…!”\nEun-ha’s face lit up with a wide, childlike smile as she watched the sunrise.\nThe sunlight gradually poured into the room, making her face glow warmly.\n“It really is beautiful.” I agreed.\n“Ah-! Han-gyeol, you shouldn’t be looking at me right now—watch the sunrise!”\n“Feels like I’m missing out by not looking at you.”\n“No way! Right now, it’s all about the sunrise, not me! Hurry, look!”\nShe grabbed my head and forced me to turn toward the window. As the sunlight and breeze streamed in, I had to admit, it did feel refreshing.\n“Watching the sunrise just the two of us feels amazing!”\n“Do you like it that much? We’ll have to do this more often.”\n“Yeah! This is our first sunrise together, so it feels extra special!”\nI sneaked a glance at her and saw Eun-ha still smiling brightly.\nWhen the sun finally rose completely over the horizon, Eun-ha gripped my hand tightly.\n“I’m so glad I met you, Han-gyeol! I really, really love this!”\n“I feel the same. I’m so lucky to have met you, Eun-ha.”\n“I love you~”\n“I love you too~”\nWe both smiled at each other, full of happiness.\n“Han-gyeol, what time do we have to check out?!”\n“Checkout is at noon, but our train is at nine, so we have to leave by eight.”\n“Then we only have about three hours left?”\n“Yeah. We’ve seen the sunrise, so let’s get some more sleep. Once we’re back in Seoul, we’ve got to head straight to collage and go to class.”\nWe had only slept for about four hours, so I was planning to catch a bit more rest. But it seemed Eun-ha had a different idea.\n“Han-gyeol~ have you ever skipped class before?”\n“Skipped class? No, I’ve never done it. Why?”\n“Hehe~ is that so~”\n“Why are you asking all of a sudden?”\nEun-ha untied the hair she had just fixed earlier and then slowly pushed me down onto the bed, climbing on top of me.\n“Then, let’s skip class together today.”\n“Eun-ha, are you...?”\nI had a feeling I knew what she was suggesting, but I asked anyway, just to be sure.\n“What are you planning to do if we skip?”\n“What do you think~?”\nEun-ha looked down at me with a mischievous gleam in her eyes.\n“Hold on. Let me check my phone for a second.”\nI reached for my phone on the bed, but Eun-ha quickly grabbed my wrist, stopping me.\n“Nope! No phone. Look at me, not the phone!”\n“I was going to cancel our train tickets.”\n“Oh-! In that case, go ahead~”\n“Just a sec~”\nI hurriedly turned on my phone and canceled our train tickets. After putting the phone back down, Eun-ha asked,\n“Did you cancel it?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Then, let’s do it...!”\nWith that, Eun-ha leaned down and kissed me deeply.\nI never thought my first time skipping class would turn out like this.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "After our trip to Gangneung, both Han-gyeol and I were incredibly busy. Even though we had only stepped away from our assignments for a few days, a surprising amount of work had piled up.\nWhile I sat in front of the computer tackling my tasks, Han-gyeol was absorbed in his personal studies.\nHe studied hard in high school, but I never thought that dedication would continue into college. Watching him like this makes me think I need to step up my game as well.\nJust as we were starting to get a bit of breathing room after those hectic days, the university festival was suddenly upon us.\nAs a freshman, this was my first festival, and I had no idea what to expect. I just tilted my head in confusion, not entirely sure what it was all about.\nAll I knew was that celebrities would come, and departments would open pop-up bars. Our department wasn’t an exception, and the seniors asked if anyone could spare some time to help out.\n“Eun-ha, do you have any time to help?”\n“Yeah, I think I can help out. But I’ll be watching the festival with my boyfriend, so I can’t stay for too long.”\n“That’s totally fine! We’re already grateful for any help. Could you just help us with the setup on Thursday? We need to set up the outdoor tables and move some ingredients for the snacks.”\n“Sure, I can do that.”“Thanks so much! I was worried not many people would participate...”\nWhen I readily agreed, the third-year senior seemed really thankful. After our brief chat, I headed off to my general education class.\nI stopped by my locker for a moment before leaving the building and bumped into Yoori in the hallway.\n“Oh, Eun-ha! Are you helping out with the festival too?”\n“Hey, Yoori~ Yeah, I’m helping out too.”\n“What time are you helping?”\n“I’m just helping with the pop-up bar setup on Thursday. What about you?”\n“Really? Jiyoung and I were asked to help with the pop-up bar too!”\n“Then we can do it together!”\n“Yeah, that works out perfectly!”\nIt looks like my shift will overlap with Yoori and Jiyoung’s, so I won’t be standing around awkwardly by myself.\n“If we finish early, we can relax and enjoy the festival. Are you going to see the celebrities?”\n“Hmm... I’m not too interested, so I’ll probably skip it. What about you?”\n“I’ll probably check it out for a bit~ The guys are really excited about it.”\n“I’m guessing it’ll be super crowded, so I think I’ll pass.”\nAh— I wonder if Han-gyeol will want to go check it out too?\n“By the way, what’s your next class, Eun-ha? Want to grab lunch at the cafeteria?”\n“Sorry, I’ve got another general education class, so I need to head straight there.”\n“Aww, no worries. Can’t be helped~ See you tomorrow!”\n“Yup, see you tomorrow~”\nAfter saying goodbye to Yoori, I made my way to the class.\nBut now I’m wondering—will Han-gyeol participate in the festival? He’s never shown much interest in things like this, so I’m not sure if he’ll attend.\n“Eun-ha! Over here!”\nAs soon as I stepped out of the building, I heard Han-gyeol’s voice.\nWhen I turned my head, I saw him sitting on a bench, waving at me.\n“Didn’t you say you were heading straight to class?!”\n“The professor let us out a little early, so I came to find you. Let’s go together.”\n“Okay!”\nMeeting up on the way to class put me in a great mood.\n“Hey, does your department have a pop-up bar too?”\n“Yeah, the seniors asked if I could help out.”\n“Are you going to participate?”\n“I told them I’d help, but I haven’t decided on the exact time yet. I’ll try to match your schedule.”\n“I only need to help with the setup on Thursday.”\n“Then I’ll tell them I’ll help at the same time.”\n“You’re good at cooking, so you’d be great in charge of the snacks.”\n“Shh—if anyone hears that, they might actually make me do it.”\nHan-gyeol glanced around nervously.\n“What’s the big deal? Everyone would line up to eat if it’s made by you!”\n“I’ve never made food in large batches before. It’d be a disaster in terms of turnover.”\n“Worrying about turnover? Sounds like you’ve got the knack for it already.”\n“I just want to spend the festival having fun with you~”\n“Okay, then! Let’s have fun together.”\nI had a feeling that our first university festival together was going to be a blast.\n“Oh, by the way, I heard a ‘super’ popular idol is coming. The guys are really excited. Are you going to go watch?”\nI teased him, but Han-gyeol responded without hesitation.\n“Spending time with you is way better.”\n“Oh~ Look at you, answering without a second of doubt! Good job~”\nI ruffled his hair playfully.\n“What would you have done if I hesitated?”\n“Good question~”\nHan-gyeol smiled brightly at my reply.\n“I don’t think I’d be brave enough to go check it out now~”\n“I’m kidding! You can really go if you want.”\n“Nah, I don’t even know who’s coming. I don’t really follow idols.”\n“Han-gyeol, you really don’t care about anyone but me, huh?”\n“Well, I care about some things too~”\n“What? Do you actually have a favorite idol?! Who is it?!”\nI’ve never heard him mention this before!\n“I was talking about the new graphics card that just came out.”\n“Oh—“\nOf course, Han-gyeol was always checking out the latest tech gadgets on his phone.\n“You’re the one who wants to go see the celebrities, aren’t you?”\n“I don’t even know who’s coming! Let’s meet up after we finish helping with the pop-up bar and explore the festival together.”\n“I’d love that~ Just call me when you’re done. Got it?”\n“Yup, got it!”\nOnce I entered the classroom, I found a seat near the back.\n“We should sit down at the pop-up bar and have some drinks during the festival.”\n“Just make sure to drink in moderation, okay?”\n“I’ll drink a lot since you’ll be there to take care of me.”\nI was getting more and more excited at the thought of wandering around the festival with Han-gyeol.\n“If you get too drunk, you’ll wake up with pigtails the next day.”\n“No way! That can’t happen!”\n“Too bad~”\n****\nTime flew by, and the day of the festival finally arrived.\nAll the other departments and clubs were also busy with their preparations. Our film studies department was no exception and bustled around as well.\nHonestly, I thought that since it wasn’t a real bar, helping out wouldn’t be that hard.\nI figured it would be easy since I wouldn’t be serving customers like in a restaurant. But there was a lot to move and set up.\n“Hey, sunbae*! We’ve finished setting up the outdoor tables and chairs. What should we do next?”\n“Oh—thank you so much! Could you follow those guys over there and help move the last of the snack ingredients? Once that’s done, the setup will be complete.”\n“Got it.”\n“Thanks, Eun-ha! After this, go enjoy the festival! I’ll make sure you get lots of free food!”\n“Thank you~”\nBy the time we finished setting up the tables, chairs, and moving the snack ingredients, I was exhausted. But thanks to everyone’s help, the preparations wrapped up quickly.\n“Whew... everything’s ready. Great job, everyone. The others will take care of the rest, so feel free to go enjoy yourselves! You all worked so hard!”\nWith those encouraging words from the third-year class rep, everyone said their goodbyes and dispersed.\n“Yeah~ I’ll come by later for a drink!”\n“Great, I’ll make you some delicious snacks!”\n“Okay~ see you later!”\n“See you~”\nAfter bowing politely, I made my way towards the stage with the others.\n“Eun-ha, you’re going to meet up with your boyfriend now, right?”\n“Yeah, sorry for bailing on you again. Let’s hang out together at the festival tomorrow!”\n“Sounds good~ Have fun with your boyfriend!”\n“Thanks! You and Jiyoung have fun too! But don’t drink too much, okay?”\n“We’ll try~”\nYoori and Jiyoung headed off to enjoy the festival first. By the time I reached the stage, the host was already hosting the event.\n“And now! Let’s give another round of applause for a performance that was nothing short of heavenly!”\nThe dance club had just finished their performance and were stepping off the stage, as the host continued with the program. Although there was still a lot of time left before the celebrities arrived, a huge crowd had already gathered in front of the stage.\nIt was getting noisy, so I moved to the far end of the plaza and called Han-gyeol. After a few rings, he picked up.\n“And now! Let’s keep this energy going! Dance teams! Band members! You were amazing! But who wants to show off their talents? Any takers? Anyone here think they’re the life of the party? Raise your hand if you do!”\nThe festival was so loud that I could barely hear Han-gyeol’s voice.\n“Hello? Han-gyeol, can you hear me?”\n“Yeah, I can hear you! Where are you right now?”\n“I’m at the back of the plaza. What about you?”\n“I’m also at the back of the plaza! Do you see me anywhere?”\n“I don’t see you! Are you near the main gate?”\nIt was hard to find Han-gyeol with so many people around, but then I spotted him in the distance, looking around.\n“Han-gyeol! Not there—look to your right!”\n“Right?”\nI waved my arms as hard as I could, signaling to Han-gyeol.\nWhen he finally noticed me waving like crazy, he smiled widely. But just as I felt the excitement of being noticed, I realized something strange—people around me had all turned to stare at me.\nWait, what’s going on?\nWhy is everyone looking at me all of a sudden?\n“Oh! We’ve got someone waving at the back there! The person at the far end of the plaza!”\nHuh?\n“Camera, zoom in on them!”\nI turned to look at the stage, and to my horror, I saw myself on the giant screen behind the host.\n“We’re inviting you up to the stage! Give them a big round of applause~!”\nOh no. This is bad. This is really-really bad.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "“Wow…”\nMy face was still on the large screen above the stage.\nEven I could tell my expression looked half out of it, but there was no way I could escape.\nIn the end, I couldn’t ignore the expectant gazes of the students, so I reluctantly stepped onto the stage.\n“Please give her a big round of applause!”\n“Wooooooahhh!!”\nI’d never had so many eyes on me in my life.\nThe camera followed me as I walked toward the stage, and before I knew it, I was standing right in the middle of it.\nMy eyes caught sight of the countless audience members in front of me—and in the distance, I spotted Han-gyeol with his mouth wide open in shock.\nI felt like I might faint at any moment.“Ah~ nice to meet you! Please introduce yourself first!”\nOne of the festival staff kindly handed me a microphone.\nIt was my first time speaking in front of such a huge crowd.\n“Uh… I’m Shin Eun-ha, a freshman in the Department of Film Studies…”\nMy voice echoed through the large speakers, reaching the audience.\n“Wooooooah!”\n“She’s so pretty!”\n“Noona, you’re beautiful!”\nAlthough I was grateful for the cheers, I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmingly embarrassed.\n“So you’re Eun-ha, huh~ Eun-ha! I saw you waving your hand so energetically from the back earlier. What kind of talent are you going to show us today? Singing? Dancing?”\nAt the host’s question, I hesitated for a moment before answering.\n“Actually, I wasn’t raising my hand for the talent show…”\n“Ah~ so you weren’t raising your hand for the talent show?! Then why were you waving so brightly?”\n“I was just happy to see my boyfriend, so I waved…”\nAt that moment, a collective groan of disappointment erupted from the audience.\n“Wait~ a second! You have a boyfriend?!”\n“Yes, I do.”\n“Is he from your university?”\nI nodded and said, “He’s in the Business Department…”\n“Hey everyone! She has a boyfriend! And he’s here with her today, so calm down, okay?”\nAll I could think about was when I’d finally be able to get off this stage.\nBut the host kept asking questions.\n“Did you meet your boyfriend after you started university?”\n“No, we’ve been dating since high school, and we came to the same university together.”\n“Wow…! So how long have you been together?”\nI cautiously held up one finger and answered, “Over a year…”\n“Got it! Well, even though it was a mistake coming up here, could you still show us a little something for the talent show before you go?”\n“Ah… but I don’t really have any talents…”\n“Then how about naming three great things about your boyfriend?!”\n“He’s handsome, kind, and smart!”\n“Are you sure?!”\n“Yes!”\n“Really?! He’s handsome, kind, ‘and smart’?!”\n“Yes!”\nI nodded confidently.\n“No way~”\n“But it’s true…”\nIt seemed the crowd still couldn’t believe what I’d said about Han-gyeol.\n“Eun-ha, the audience doesn’t seem to believe you.”\n“I’m really upset about that.”\n“Pfft! Oh, are you really upset?!”\nHow could they not believe how handsome Han-gyeol is?\n“I don’t think anyone will believe it until they see for themselves… Where is he now? Let’s find him—Eun-ha’s handsome, kind, and smart boyfriend! Where are you?”\n“Ahh! Han-gyeol doesn’t like being the center of attention—!”\n“Han-gyeol?! His name is Han-gyeol?! Then ask him if he could come up for a moment!”\nI carefully turned toward where Han-gyeol was standing.\n“Han-gyeol… You don’t have to come up if you don’t want to, but… if it’s okay, would you?”\nThe moment I finished speaking, cheers erupted from the crowd.\n“Okay! Boyfriend?! You don’t have to come up, but at least answer loudly! Are you still here, or did you leave?!”\nThe host and the crowd were all looking around, searching for Han-gyeol. And then, locking eyes with me, Han-gyeol cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted:\n“Just wait a minute!!!”\n“There! Over there! Camera, catch him at the far end of the square! Eun-ha’s boyfriend, who is handsome, kind, and smart, is now walking up to the stage! Let’s give him a big round of applause!”\nHan-gyeol was making his way toward the stage, step by step.\nI felt a mix of gratitude and guilt, a rush of emotions all at once.\nAs soon as Han-gyeol got the microphone and stepped onto the stage, I quickly moved to his side.\n“Han-gyeol…! I’m sorry.”\n“It’s fine~ It’s a festival, let’s have fun.”\nI walked with Han-gyeol back toward the host. The screen now displayed the two of us, and the MC immediately started asking Han-gyeol questions, but not before offering a compliment.\n“Wow… everyone, Eun-ha didn’t lie at all. Wow… he really is handsome! Please introduce yourself.”\nEven though Han-gyeol hates situations like this, he responded smoothly.\n“Hello, I’m Lee Han-gyeol, a freshman in the Business Department.”\n“Wooooooah!!”\n“Hyung!! Pay more taxes!!”\n“Everyone, do you know what surprised me the most? The moment Han-gyeol stepped up, Eun-ha immediately moved to his side. Eun-ha, when did you get over there?”\nAt this point, I’d resigned myself to the situation and answered honestly.\n“This was my spot from the start…”\n“Wow~ I’ve been to many university festivals and seen a lot of couples, but… I’ve never been so jealous of one before. This is what youth looks like! This is what a campus couple should be! Don’t you all agree?!”\n“Yesss!!!”\n“Now, Han-gyeol, what are three great things about your girlfriend?”\n“She’s beautiful, kind, smart, and she’s a great cook.”\n“You answered that so effortlessly!”\n“That was easy.”\n“Wow~ I don’t know if I should ask this, but… are you super popular?”\n“No, I don’t have many friends.”\n“But you’re so witty!”\n“Thank you.”\nHan-gyeol’s cool responses made both the host and the audience burst into laughter.\n“Well~ since the two of you came up here, would you mind giving us a short talent show before you go?”\n“Ah… I have to help out at the pub soon, so I should get going.”\nHan-gyeol was trying to use the perfect excuse to escape, but neither the crowd nor the host was going to let us off that easily.\n“Awww~~~”\nRealizing what was happening, Han-gyeol quickly added another comment.\n“Well… I could sing the first verse of a song at least.”\n“A song?! Will you sing it with Eun-ha?”\n“If she’s okay with it…”\nThe host’s gaze shifted from Han-gyeol to me.\nSince this was all my fault, and Han-gyeol had stepped up so bravely…\n“What do you say, Eun-ha?!”\n“Yes! I’ll sing with him!”\n“Great! Let’s hear a classic couple duet! A big round of applause, please!!!”\n“Wooooooahhh!!!”\nAs the music started, I found myself just looking into Han-gyeol’s eyes while singing. A moment ago, I was terrified to even speak in front of the crowd, but now that I was looking at Han-gyeol, everything seemed fine.\nThis moment was just too fun and enjoyable.\nHan-gyeol’s voice began the song, and soon it was my turn. Somewhere along the way, the stiffness in my expression melted away, replaced by a smile, and the tremble in my voice faded.\nI never thought I could sing so confidently with so many people watching. It was all thanks to Han-gyeol.\nI wasn’t even thinking; the lyrics just flowed out, and before I knew it, we had finished the first verse.\nAs the song ended, I walked over to Han-gyeol with a big smile. Holding the microphone shyly, we were approached by the host again.\n“Wow~ That was a stage overflowing with sweetness. Not once! Not even once! Did either of you look at the audience. Anyway! Let’s give a big round of applause to this beautiful couple for such a lovely performance!”\nAs soon as the host finished speaking, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Feeling both amused and embarrassed, I quickly hid behind Han-gyeol.\n“Now—before you go, if there’s anything you’d like to say, please do! Let’s start with Han-gyeol. Just step forward a little. Yes, that’s perfect.”\nHan-gyeol took a small step forward.\n“Uh... Enjoy the festival, and make sure to get home safely.”\n“How about saying something to your girlfriend, too?”\n“Uh…”\nHan-gyeol glanced at me before hesitantly speaking.\n“I… love you.”\n“Woooooaaah!!!”\n“Is this real life?!”\n“Wonderful~ Now let’s hear from Eun-ha. Come on, step forward! How about you say something to your boyfriend who just said he loves you?”\nI took a step forward and stood beside Han-gyeol. It was nerve-wracking to speak in front of everyone, but...!\nGathering all my courage, I spoke.\n“I love you too.”\nAnother wave of cheers exploded from the crowd.\nRight now, in this moment, I felt overwhelmingly happy.\nThis is so much fun.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

Listen up well.\nYou should pay taxes twice, you should serve in the military twice.\n- Anonymous 1\n5 minutes ago\nIf I serve twice, can I meet someone like that too?\n- Anonymous 2\n5 minutes ago\nLOL LOL LOL LOL LOL\nIs that possible?\n- Anonymous 1\n3 minutes ago\nIf you pay taxes twice, you think you can do that?\n- Anonymous 3\n2 minutes ago\nNo way. This is beyond the realm of talent. Stop dreaming.\n- Anonymous 4\n4 minutes ago\nJust wait a little! There was a breaking point, but it got funny again. LOL\n- Anonymous 2\n3 minutes ago\n😭 The host said he has never been so jealous of one before… He asked for help because he was feeling it too much.]\nSeeing Eun-ha’s beauty and behavior, everyone seemed envious of me.\nYeah, I get how you all feel. That’s why I’m serving two terms in the military, right?\n“Ahhh—! It keeps going up. What should I do?!”\nOf course, there were also stories about Eun-ha.\n[\nAnonymous\n15 minutes ago\nFilm Studies, Year 1, here. Oh ho.\nDoes anyone know where to meet a boyfriend like that? Asking for a friend.\n- Anonymous 1\n5 minutes ago\nThey said they met in high school?\n- Anonymous 2\n5 minutes ago\nSo, did they end up going to the same university?\n- Anonymous 1\n3 minutes ago\nYeah, I heard they did.\n- Anonymous (Military Service)\n2 minutes ago\nIt’s like something straight out of a movie plot, right?]\nNormally, I don’t like being the center of attention, but right now, it was a bit amusing.\nThere weren’t any posts criticizing me or Eun-ha, and everyone was cheering us on.\nStill, things escalated so much that Eun-ha felt really sorry toward me.\n“Would it be wrong to ask them to stop posting...?”\n“Just let it be~. After the festival ends, people will forget about it~.”\n“But if I go to college today, I’m sure my classmates will tease me a lot... I’m sorry. They’re going to ask you a lot too, Han-gyeol.”\n“It’s fine~. Honestly, it was a bit fun.”\n“Still...”\nEun-ha seemed worried that I might feel uncomfortable.\nI gently patted her head, concerned that she was overthinking it.\n“It’s really okay~. It feels kind of nice being the university’s official couple.”\n“...Are you sure you’re okay?”\n“I’m fine~. Now that everyone knows you have a boyfriend, no one’s going to hit on you anymore.”\n“Well, it’s the same for you, right? When I think about it that way, it does feel like we did the right thing.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I didn’t know waving my hand wrong would lead to all this.”\nWhen I grinned at Eun-ha, she finally relaxed, her guilt fading away.\n“Didn’t you have fun, Eun-ha?”\n“...To be honest, I enjoyed it a little.”\n“Right? Then let’s go. We’re going to be late for class.”\n“Okay! But if anyone keeps teasing you, tell me! I’ll scold them for you!”\n“Alright~ let’s go.”\n“Okay!”\nI left the house with Eun-ha, heading toward college.\nEven though I could feel people’s eyes on us here and there from the college entrance, I didn’t mind since Eun-ha was with me.\nAfter parting ways with her, I headed to my major class, and the moment I walked into the lecture hall, all eyes were on me.\n“Look who it is—! Handsome! Kind! And smart! It’s Han-gyeol, isn’t it?!”\n“H-Han-gyeol...?”\nJeong greeted me with a bright smile, calling me ‘Han-gyeol’.\nShe said it just like Eun-ha did, and hearing someone else say it made me feel a little disappointed.\n“I saw everything yesterday~! You guys became the university’s official couple, huh?”\nSeunghoon, who was sitting next to Jaehyun, chimed in.\n“If you know who posted those, tell them to delete them.”\n“Come on, you’re a star now! How does it feel?”\n“Just... a little bit fun?”\n“Pfft—! That’s hilarious. Your eyes were dripping with honey, man.”\n“What can I do when I like my girlfriend so much?”\n“Wow~ that’s a smooth line~.”\n“Let’s just focus on class. This is embarrassing.”\nAnd that ended the conversation with the guys.\nBut even the classmates I hadn’t spoken to before were giving me glances.\nI guess I made an impression without meaning to.\nStill, Eun-ha was absolutely adorable yesterday.\nAt first, she was flustered, but her eyes sparkled whenever she talked about me. I kept thinking of those twinkling eyes.\nEven during class, Eun-ha kept popping into my mind, and I couldn’t help but smile a little.\nWhy is she so cute?\nEun-ha really has a talent for driving people crazy.\nI think yesterday’s memories will stay crystal clear in my mind for decades to come.\nLife feels good.\n****\nAfter class, Eun-ha and I wandered around the festival.\nWe grabbed some chicken skewers from a food truck and were enjoying desserts when Eun-ha spoke up.\n“Han-gyeol, do you want to check out our department pub?”\n“Won’t we attract a lot of attention if we go now? You sure it’s okay?”\n“Yeah, it’s fine. They said they’d give us some free snacks.”\n“Well, in that case, let’s go~”\n“Hurry up~”\nEun-ha grabbed my hand and led me into the pub.\n“We’re here~”\nAs soon as we entered, her classmates greeted us with big smiles.\n“Oh—! You brought your boyfriend?! Wait here a sec, we’ll bring you some delicious snacks~”\n“Okay~”\nEun-ha sat down at the table with a bright smile.\n“Oh? Eun-ha’s here~?”\n“Yeah, yeah. Not many people today, huh?”\n“Looks like everyone went to see the idol that’s coming later. Are you going to watch too, Eun-ha?”\n“I’m thinking of squeezing in a little time to go~”\n“They’re also doing a fireworks show later, you should check that out too.”\n“Sure~”\nEun-ha seemed pretty friendly with her classmates, exchanging greetings with ease.\n“You have a lot of friends, Eun-ha~”\n“Thanks to you, Han-gyeol~”\n“What did I do~?”\n“A lot of people got closer to me because of what happened yesterday~ I bragged about you so much!”\n“Could you tone it down a little? It’s embarrassing.”\n“Nope~ I want to brag about you more.”\nAs we chatted, snacks were placed on the table.\nEach time new food arrived, Eun-ha and I thanked her classmates, and they smiled as they left us to enjoy.\n“Should we have just one bottle and then go watch the idol?”\n“Are you sure you won’t get drunk, Eun-ha? Let’s drink moderately.”\n“I’ll be fine~ I’ll pace myself.”\n“Alright~”\nI opened the soju bottle on the table and poured half into Eun-ha’s glass before filling my own.\n“Did a lot of people ask you about us in your department?”\n“Yeah, they did, but I was too shy to brag.”\n“That’s understandable~ Ah~ but I loved bragging about you today. It made me feel so proud, like I was showing off something really precious.”\n“You liked it that much?”\nEun-ha nodded vigorously at my question.\n“Of course! It felt like I was saying ‘This is my guy!’ and I felt so proud. Some people looked at us with envy, and honestly, I didn’t mind at all. I didn’t show it, but it felt amazing.”\nEun-ha’s bright smile was incredibly endearing.\n“You’re cute.”\n“Every day with you is just so much fun, Han-gyeol!”\n“I’m grateful too~ Should we toast?”\n“Yes, yes! Cheers~”\nAfter clinking our glasses, we both downed the soju in one go.\n“Let me feed you some food, Han-gyeol. Open up~”\n“Eun-ha, your friends are here, you know—”\n“It’s fine. I’ve already told them how much I adore you. They understand~ Come on, hurry up~”\n“Ah—”\nEun-ha fed me a bite of the egg roll, her eyes shining as she watched me.\n“Is it good?”\n“Yeah, it’s delicious.”\nWe continued to eat and drink, emptying the bottle together. Even though Eun-ha said she’d pace herself, her cheeks started to turn a little pink.\n“You’re getting tipsy fast today, Eun-ha. I thought you were pacing yourself.”\n“I guess I got carried away enjoying the festival with you~”\n“Let’s not order another bottle. Want to go check out the festival instead?”\n“Yes, yes! I’m curious about the idol too. Let’s get going.”\nEun-ha and I stood up together.\nWe got the snacks for free, so we only paid for the drinks.\n“Thank you. The food was amazing.”\n“Sure~ Come visit our department pub again next time~”\n“Will do. We’re heading out now~”\n“Take care~”\n“Bye!”\nAfter saying goodbye to Eun-ha’s busy friends, we made our way toward the stage.\nBut by the time we arrived, the place was already packed, and it was hard to see the stage.\n“Wow… there are so many people.”\n“Well, it’s a popular idol, so it’s expected.”\n“Doesn’t seem like we’ll be able to see anything from here.”\n“Nothing we can do~ In that case, I’ll just watch you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Should we just head home?”\n“Huh? Don’t you want to see the idol?”\nEun-ha tilted her head in curiosity.\n“I was just thinking of checking it out, but seeing this crowd is kind of draining.”\n“Then should we just go home? How about we watch the fireworks from the rooftop?”\n“Oh— that sounds even better. Let’s grab a beer and watch from the rooftop.”\n“Yes, yes! Let’s go!”\nI grabbed Eun-ha’s wrist, and we made our way out of the crowd.\nAs we headed home, I kept glancing back, worried the fireworks might start before we got there.\nWhen we finally arrived, we grabbed a beer from the fridge and went straight to the rooftop.\n“This is much better than being in a crowded place.”\n“Yes, yes! I’m so excited to watch the fireworks with just you, Han-gyeol!”\nEun-ha said that, squeezing my hand tightly, her fingers interlocking with mine, her smile full of happiness.\n“I feel the same~”\n“Every moment with you feels like it’s glowing, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha suddenly turned her head to look up at me.\n“Now that I think about it, yesterday was hilarious too. It was fun showing you off in front of so many people, and when you shouted for me to wait with your hands together, that was the best! Be honest, you were embarrassed, right?”\n“Of course, I was. Do you think I don’t get nervous?”\n“That’s why I loved it even more. Ah~ this festival has been so much fun! I really want to be with you every single day, Han-gyeol. What should I do?! I just keep liking you more and more!”\n“What do you mean ‘what should you do’? Just keep liking me more~ I feel the same way, Eun-ha. I’m falling for you more and more too.”\n“I really love you so much, Han-gyeol!”\nLooking at Eun-ha’s face, I could see just how much she loved me.\nHer smile was the happiest one in the world.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes?!”\n“Let’s shower together tonight.”\n“Yes! I’d love that!”\nAs soon as Eun-ha, beaming with a bashful smile, answered,\nBoom!\nthe fireworks started.\nBoth of our heads turned up toward the sky at the same time.\nSeeing the fireworks beautifully light up the sky brought a natural smile to my face.\nI glanced over at Eun-ha, only to find her already looking my way.\n“What? You’re not watching the fireworks?”\n“Watching you is better—!”\n“Pfft—! Are you copying me?”\n“But it’s really true~!”\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes! What is it, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m going to love you for the rest of my life. I mean it.”\nWithout a word, Eun-ha wrapped her arms around my neck.\n“Then kiss me—!”\n“Alright. How should I kiss you?”\n“Like you’re going to devour me, deeply!”\n“Okay. Got it~”\nI immediately leaned in and captured her lips in a deep kiss.\nThe sound of the fireworks continued in the background, but I didn’t care.\nI was too happy in this moment to think about anything else.\nI’m really glad I was born.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "After the festival ended, we returned to our daily lives.\nIt hadn’t been long, but final exams were already looming ahead.\nI can’t believe it. Just about three weeks ago, I was enjoying the festival with Han-gyeol.\nTime seemed to pass much quicker than it did in high school.\nIs it because I’m so happy?\nEven now, Han-gyeol was hard at work studying in the computer room.\nRight after the festival, he signed up for summer classes too. He’s such a diligent man.\nSeeing him steadily prepare for the future makes me work hard as well.\nBut still, he should take breaks for meals.\n“Han-gyeol~ Dinner’s ready~ Come out and eat.”I called him from the kitchen.\nWith a click, the door to the computer room opened, and Han-gyeol came out.\n“Already done?”\n“Yup yup. Come on over and eat.”\nAs I set the beef and soybean paste stew on the table, Han-gyeol scooped rice into his bowl.\nWatching him take out the side dishes from the fridge, I found his actions incredibly adorable.\n“You’re such a sweetheart, Han-gyeol.”\n“Out of nowhere?”\n“Just because~ You’re so thoughtful, it’s really endearing.”\n“To my girlfriend, I’m endeari—”\n“Do you want me to call you cool instead of endearing? Of course, you’re cool~”\n“You can even predict what I’m going to say now?”\n“Of course~ We’ve been living together for almost half a year now~”\nWe sat down together and started eating.\n“Han-gyeol, aren’t you studying too much these days? It’s not just college work, right?”\n“Yeah. I’m also studying for TOEIC and some certifications.”\n“It’s good that you’re working hard, but don’t you think you’re overdoing it? You even signed up for summer classes.”\n“You’re working hard too, Eun-ha~ Always doing assignments on your computer.”\n“I’m just keeping up with college and following your lead by signing up for the summer session.”\n“Even that’s impressive~ I don’t have that many assignments myself.”\nRecently, it seemed like he was pushing himself quite a bit.\nAs his girlfriend, I couldn’t help but be a little worried.\n“How about taking the certification exams later…?”\n“It’s fine~ They’re not that difficult, and I can get them with about a month of studying. They’re related to my major, so they’re not too tough.”\nIt felt like he was trying to reassure me.\n“Why are you working so hard? You’re only twenty, you can afford to take it easy.”\n“I’m doing this so we can get married quickly, Eun-ha~”\n“I love hearing that, but I’m just worried you’re putting yourself through too much.”\n“Don’t worry~ I’m not overdoing it.”\nHe gently patted my head.\n“I’ll work hard too..!”\n“You already are, Eun-ha.”\n“I’ll work even harder so we can push through together and get married!”\n“Yeah, let’s do that~”\n“Mm! Now hurry up and eat!”\n“I’ll dig in~”\nWith that, he took a big spoonful of rice.\nAfter tasting the stew, he smiled happily and told me it was delicious.\nOnce we finished eating, we sat together on the sofa with some coffee.\nThe TV was on, but we weren’t really watching it.\nI was simply resting my head on his shoulder.\nThese peaceful moments with Han-gyeol were precious to me.\nAnd I loved it when our eyes would meet, and he’d flash me a shy smile.\n“Yawn~!”\n“Are you sleepy, Han-gyeol? Want to take a nap?”\n“Hmm… maybe. Even after drinking coffee, I’m still a little drowsy.”\n“Take a short nap~ Okay? Get some rest.”\nI nuzzled my face into Han-gyeol’s chest.\n“How about I sleep for just two hours?”\n“I’ll put you to bed!”\nI hurriedly set down my coffee cup and pulled Han-gyeol into the bedroom.\n“Come on-! Lie down~”\nI patted the bed with a loud thump thump- and called him over.\nHe gave a small chuckle and then lay down on the bed.\nAfter covering him with the blanket, I held his hand.\n“Are you going to sleep too, Eun-ha?”\n“Hmm? I’ll just watch you sleep for a bit and then work on my assignments.”\n“Watching me sleep is embarrassing... But if it makes you happy...”\nHis eyes slowly began to close.\nHe must’ve been really tired.\n“I’ll wake you up in two hours. Sleep well~”\n“Mm… Thanks… I’ll just nap a little...”\n“I love you. Dream of me.”\nOnce he fell asleep, I stared at his face for a long time.\nThe fact that he’s working this hard so we can get married… I felt a bit guilty for pestering him about it.\nI worried that everything I’d said so far might’ve been too much for him.\nI decided to hold back a little from now on.\nI didn’t want to burden the person I love.\n“I’m sorry and thank you. I love you, Han-gyeol.”\nI couldn’t let him be the only one working hard, so I got out of bed.\nI needed to finish my college work quickly and make his favorite salmon dish for dinner tonight.\nCarefully, I left the bedroom and closed the door behind me.\nWhen I entered the computer room to start my assignments, I noticed the computer was still on.\nIt seemed like he was planning to study more after we ate and drank our coffee.\nI moved the mouse, and the monitor turned back on.\nBut the moment I saw the screen, I froze.\n<September Enlistment Notice for Air Force Recruitment>\nMy heart sank with a heavy thud.\nI knew this day would come eventually, but seeing that he’d been looking into the military made my chest tighten.\nHe had mentioned it before… saying that if he went early, it’d be after the first semester. But even then, it hadn’t felt real.\nI scrolled the mouse wheel to check the exact enlistment date, and it was three months from now.\nIf he applied, we’d only have three more months together.\nMy mind was swirling with confusion.\n****\nIn the end, I sat in front of the computer for two hours, researching everything I could.\nFrom what I found, it seemed that in the Air Force, having certain certifications would let you choose your specialty.\nSo that’s why he was working on those certifications, huh?\nThe thought of him leaving and me having to live without him made my heart ache.\nI searched for other options, but knowing Han-gyeol, he’d already looked into everything thoroughly.\nStill, I had hoped he’d at least finish his first year before going...\n“It’s disappointing...”\nJust as I was feeling down, the door suddenly opened.\n“Eun-ha. Are you in here?”\n“Ah-!”\n“I woke up, but you weren’t there~ So I figured you were working on your assignme—”\nAs he approached, he saw the computer screen.\n“Han-gyeol… are you going to the military?”\n“Ah- I haven’t decided yet-!”\n“But you’ve been looking into it, right?”\n“Yeah, I have, but I wanted to talk to you before making a decision… Eun-ha?”\n“Are you really going to the military...?”\nMy voice trembled as tears started falling from my eyes.\n“I haven’t decided yet~ Why are you crying~”\nHan-gyeol rushed over to me and pulled me into a tight hug.\nThe moment I felt his warmth, the tears came flooding out even more.\nI knew this day would come... I knew it was inevitable...\nBut still, the tears wouldn’t stop.\n“Waaah-!”\n“Oh dear...!”\nI clung tightly to his shirt, refusing to let go.\nI didn’t want to send him away, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.\nI finally calmed down after soaking hs shirt with my tears.\n“Are you feeling a bit better now? I’m sorry. I didn’t tell you because I hadn’t decided yet.”\n“The deadline is next week, right...?”\n“Yeah. I was planning to talk to you about it tomorrow or the day after, but I’m still not sure.”\n“Isn’t this a bit too sudden...? Can’t you at least finish your first year before going?”\nI sniffled as I asked, and he responded.\n“I just don’t want to come out of the military having accomplished nothing. That’s why I wanted to study for the tax accountant exam while I’m there. The first round of exams is usually in June, and if I enlist in September, I’ll be discharged right before the first exam. I might not make it to the second round, but I think I can manage the first one with enough effort. But, you know, nothing’s set in stone yet.”\nHe scratched his head as he spoke.\nOf course, he’d already thought everything through.\nI wanted to support him, but it was hard to accept right now.\nI knew I was being selfish, but I wished he could stay with me just a little longer.\nI was about to ask him to finish his first year before going, but he spoke up again.\n“Honestly, I want to marry you as soon as possible too. But I figured if we get married right after graduating, I should have something stable in place. It’s not just for me, but for others too, so they can say, ‘Yeah, he’s ready for marriage.’ Something like that.”\nI looked at his face intently.\n“That’s why I want to get my military service out of the way quickly.”\n“Is it because I’ve been pushing you to get married? Have I been too insistent...?!”\n“Huh?! Not at all~ If anything, I want to get married even more! I want to live a sweet, loving life with you, my beautiful Eun-ha, as soon as possible~”\nHe gently wiped the tears from my eyes.\n“I want to have cute kids, take them on trips to places like Gangneung, and just live that kind of life. I can’t wait for it. I know it’ll be so full of happiness, and life will feel so bright. I crave it. When you told me you wanted to get married, I wasn’t burdened at all. In fact, I was so thankful and excited that you wanted the same kind of life as me. Really. I’m still grateful that you see the same future I do.”\nHis words gradually warmed my heart.\nThe confusion and sadness that had overwhelmed me started to calm down.\n“Me too... I’m so thankful for you, Han-gyeol! I’m thankful you love me, I’m thankful you cherish me, and I’m so thankful you want the same life as me! I’m unbelievably, ridiculously grateful… and I love you. I love you so much.”\n“You don’t have to say it. I already know.”\n“You can do whatever you want, Han-gyeol...! I... I can handle it all. I can visit you every week, and when you’re on leave, I’ll cook you all your favorite meals!”\nI said through my tears, pouring out my emotions.\n“Thank you. Now stop crying, okay~”\n“I can’t help it...!”\n“Want me to hold you?”\nI nodded with all my strength at his words.\n“Come here.”\nAs he spread his arms wide, I dove into them with a thud.\n“I love you... I love you so much, Han-gyeol..!”\n“I love you too, Eun-ha.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Once my enlistment was confirmed, Eun-ha wouldn’t leave my side, clinging to my arm.\n“What will I be doing when you’re not here?”\n“Wouldn’t it be fine just to go to college like usual?”\n“Should I just take a break from college too? It wouldn’t be bad to return and graduate with you…”\nHearing her words, I gently grasped Eun-ha’s cheek and gave it a playful shake.\n“I appreciate the thought, but~ it feels like I’d be holding you back. Plus, we need to graduate quickly so we can get married fast~”\n“But I still want to spend more time in college with you!”\n“We’ll have about a year together after I return. Don’t feel too sad.”\n“Well, if you say so… I’ll go to college diligently then. But I’ll visit you every week, okay?!”\n“Every week might be too much. You’ll be tired from college, and it’ll be hard to keep up-“Before I could even finish, Eun-ha vigorously shook her head.\n“No! I’ll come every week!”\n“As much as I’d like that, every week seems like a bit much-”\n“No?! I’m serious! I’ll come every week. No matter what happens. Even if I break a bone, I’ll still come.”\nEun-ha declared with eyes full of determination.\n“Are you sure you can keep that promise~?”\n“Of course! I’ll love you forever, and I’ll only look at you. I’ll visit you every week, even if you tell me not to. Even if it’s just for five minutes, I’ll still come! And I’ll bring you delicious food every time.”\nI guess I’d better train hard and get assigned close to Seoul. Even if I’m stationed far away, she seems ready to fly every week to visit me.\nAlthough her words touched me, I didn’t want her to suffer too much.\n“You’re really coming every week? I’m holding you to that.”\n“Yeah, you can count on it. This is one promise I’ll definitely keep!”\n“You’ll need to visit around 90 times. Can you handle that?”\nEun-ha nodded vigorously with all her strength.\n“Yup! I can do it!”\n“Thanks for saying that. But if something really comes up, you don’t have to-”\n“No. No excuses. That’s just an excuse. Han-gyeol, I’ll come every week no matter what. If I don’t see you every week, I’ll wither away. I’ll even bring your favorite salmon dishes! Don’t worry! Whether it rains, snows, or a typhoon hits, I’ll find a way to see you!” 𝙧\n“And what about when I’m at boot camp?”\n“I’ll just see you a lot now, and hug and kiss you plenty so I can survive a month!”\n“Once I’m assigned, visiting me every week might make my seniors give me strange looks~”\n“Then when can I start coming every week?!”\n“Hmm? Probably when I’m halfway through private first class. It should be fine by then.”\n“What does ‘halfway through’ mean?”\nAh—\n“Usually, when you’ve served more than half your time as a private first class, they say you’re halfway through.”\n“Oh! Then as sad as it is, I’ll just visit occasionally until then! I don’t know much about military life or how to deal with your seniors, so you’ll have to teach me! Don’t try to adjust to me! Got it?!”\n“Eun-ha, don’t feel too pressured. I really appreciate it, but there’s no need to overdo it.”\nI tried to calm Eun-ha down, but she was unwavering. Instead, she spoke to me with even more intensity.\n“No?! Han-gyeol, don’t worry about me. Okay? The military is tough... You’re the one who has it the hardest, so I want to take care of you more. I’m out here where I can eat whatever I want, sleep whenever I want! But you can’t. You have to wake up at a set time, eat whatever they give you, and live with people you’ve never met before… right? So while you’re serving, lean on me more! I’m your future wife, after all—! I won’t ever let you go through this alone.”\nEun-ha placed her hand over her heart and declared it with such conviction. She was so adorable that I couldn’t help but gently pinch her cheek.\n“You’re too cute, seriously~”\n“Ugh—”\n“Why are you so cute, Eun-ha?”\n“I’m doing it to get more attention from you. To make you love me even more.”\nHer bright, radiant smile made my heart melt.\n“I’ll study hard while I’m in the army. I’ll come out with something to show for it.”\n“No! Don’t do that. What if you hurt yourself…?! I won’t be able to take care of you while you’re there.”\n“Don’t worry about me~ I’m really strong, you know. I’ll get plenty of exercise while I’m there.”\n“You’re already so strong… and you’ve got plenty of muscles…”\nEun-ha pressed her fingers against my chest, poking it.\n“It’s so hard…! Can I snuggle up?”\n“As much as you want.”\n“Yay~”\nShe quickly snuggled into my arms, pressing her ear to my left chest to listen to my heartbeat.\n“Your heart’s racing again.”\n“That’s because I’m holding you.”\n“Han-gyeol—!”\n“Hm?”\nAs I tilted my head down, Eun-ha pressed her lips against mine.\n“I love you~ I really love you so much.”\n“I love you too~”\n“This won’t do. I want to kiss you more deeply.”\nEun-ha shifted her position, sitting on my thigh. Then she wrapped her arms tightly around my neck and pulled me in for a kiss.\n“Mmph—!”\nAs soon as our lips met, she slid her tongue into my mouth. These days, whenever we kissed, her tongue would slip in right away.\nAfter an intense and passionate deep kiss, Eun-ha slowly pulled her face back.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m not satisfied with just kissing…!”\n“Should we move to the bedroom?”\n“Hehe…”\nSnuggling into my chest, Eun-ha whispered in my ear.\n“Let’s go quickly...!”\nWith Eun-ha clinging to me, I stood up, holding her close, and headed straight to the bedroom.\n“I want to stay close to you too, Eun-ha.”\n“Me too. I love you!”\n“I love you too~”\nCarefully, I closed the bedroom door behind us.\n****\nAfter finals started, I told Seunghoon and Jaehyun about my enlistment. As soon as they heard the news, their eyes widened, and they looked at me with confused expressions.\n“You’re going to the army...?”\n“You’re enlisting…?”\n“Why do you two look like this has nothing to do with you?”\n“Do we have to go to the army…?”\n“Yeah, don’t say scary things like that. Isn’t the army for soldiers?”\n“Well, you guys are next. I’m just going first…”\nThe two dropped their spoons slowly as they processed my words.\n“Now that someone’s actually going, it feels real…”\n“Yeah… Should I look into it quickly too?”\n“If you’re going, go early. You don’t want to be bossed around by someone younger than you. And trust me, it’s better to get it over with.”\n“Why do you sound like someone who’s already been through it?”\nThis time, I dropped my spoon. Yeah… right now, I’m the one who deserves the most pity. But then again, I’ve started dating Eun-ha, so this is the price I have to pay.\n“Hey, don’t be so harsh on someone about to enlist.”\n“You lunatic. We’re going too. What grade did you get on your physical?”\n“Grade 1. Maybe it’s from drinking all that milk.”\n“Same… Why is my body unnecessarily healthy?”\n“So you’re not going to be around for the second semester, Han-gyeol?”\n“Nope… I’ll have shaved my head, barking out my rank and rolling around by then…”\n“Well\nEven though I sounded defeated, Seunghoon and Jaehyun found it hard to offer comforting words. I guess it would just be like comforting themselves.\n“And your girlfriend…?”\n“She said she’s going to visit me every week.”\n“Well… if it’s your girlfriend, I can believe that…”\nWhen Seunghoon muttered this, Jaehyun nodded in agreement beside him.\n“She didn’t say she was going to enlist with you, did she?”\n“As much as she loves me, that’s not happening.”\nThere’s no way I’d let Eun-ha anywhere near that place.\n“Aren’t you going a little early, though? Most people finish their first year of college before going.”\n“I plan to use the 1 year and 9 months in the army to prepare for the tax accountant exam. My goal is to pass the first part before I come out. I can delay the second part if I need to.”\n“Wow… you really have everything planned out. You live your life so intensely.”\n“I have to live intensely…”\nI want to marry Eun-ha, have kids, and live out the rest of my life with her. I want a sweet, loving future with her.\nBut still… I don’t want to go. It felt like the world was turning gray.\nDo I really have to face that second morning of enlistment again?\nThe blaring sound of the morning bugle…\nThe overwhelming sense of emptiness when you realize you’re in the army…\nThe sighs you let out when it hits you that it’s only been two days…\nThe shouts of the drill instructor wearing the red cap, yelling for you to hurry up…\nThe command from the officer to turn around and shout during the outdoor roll call…\nAnd the scream you let out at the sky with a hollow heart—\n“Hey! Han-gyeol! Snap out of it! Your eyes are losing focus.”\n“Yeah, I should get a grip. I’m going to go see my girlfriend. Let’s grab a drink after finals.”\n“Sounds good… Take care. Have a great date.”\n“Alright, see you next time.”\nI had already told the guys, and I’d also set a day to grab drinks with Yujin. As I headed out of the cafeteria toward Eun-ha’s building, I suddenly heard my name being called from afar.\n“Han-gyeol~!”\nEun-ha, who must have gotten out of class early, was waving at me from a distance, sprinting toward me at an alarming speed.\nThe gray world around me suddenly started to regain its color just as thud—Eun-ha crashed into my arms.\n“I missed you…!”\n“If you want to keep seeing me, can you be a bit more careful when you hug me~? My ribs might break~”\nJust seeing Eun-ha’s face made my heart race, and the corners of my mouth lifted on their own.\nSimply looking at her gave me the strength to keep going.\n“I got too excited to see you. Did you have lunch at the cafeteria?”\n“Yeah, I ate with the guys.”\nHearing this, Eun-ha smiled slightly and looked up at me.\n“Good job. Let’s go home. Is there anything you want to eat? I’ll make anything you want~”\n“If I ask for braised short ribs, will you make them?”\n“If that’s what you want, of course I will!”\n“It’s a tough dish, so let’s make it together.”\n“That sounds fun~ Shall we stop by the market and head home?”\n“Let’s do that. Here, hold my hand.”\n“Okay!”\nAs soon as I extended my hand, Eun-ha eagerly grabbed it.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah, yeah?”\n“I love you.”\n“I love you too~!”\nYou know what? Fine. Bring on the army again!\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "The first semester ended, and so did the summer session.\nNow, as we step into July, Han-gyeol and I will soon have to part ways for a while.\nAs the days I can spend with Han-gyeol grow fewer, my heart refuses to settle.\nThe thought of a life without him already fills me with sadness and regret.\nThe bed we shared.\nThe sofa we sat on together.\nThe dining table where we ate side by side.\nIn a home filled with memories of us, I’ll have to endure a year and nine months.\nBut I have to stay strong.\nAfter all, the one who’s truly enduring this is not me, but Han-gyeol.My sadness and regret would only add to his worries right now.\nThe best I can do is to show him even more love and affection.\nThough it’s unsettling to know I can’t do much else, I’ve decided to focus on cherishing the present.\n“Eun-ha, I’m heading out now.”\n“Mm, take care~”\n“I won’t be back too late.”\n“Alright, have a good time~”\nTonight, Han-gyeol is having dinner with his friend, Jang Yujin.\n“I might drop by my parents' place while I’m at it.”\nSince I’d be alone, I thought I’d pick up some fall clothes and restock on kimchi from home.\nDressed comfortably, I took the subway to my family’s house.\n“What brings you here unannounced?”\nAs soon as I arrived, I saw my brother sprawled on the sofa, as expected.\n“I didn’t come here just to see you.”\n“Neither did I say I was glad to see you.”\n“I came because we’re out of kimchi at home, so I thought I’d grab some, along with my fall clothes.”\n“Where’s Han Han-gyeol? Didn’t he come with you?”\n“Nope, he has dinner plans with a friend.”\nI took out a container from the kitchen drawer and headed to the kimchi fridge.\n“Ah, that’s too bad~ I wanted to see him.”\n“You won’t be seeing him much from now on.”\n“Why? Is he going to the military?!”\nThe word “military” made me freeze for a moment.\nI turned to him and nodded slowly.\n“He is? When?”\n“He’s expected to go in September. He applied for the Air Force.”\n“Wow… Yeah, some guys go right after the first semester ends. Are you sure you’ll be able to wait for him?”\nI frowned slightly at his question.\n“What’s with that? Of course, I will.”\n“Everyone says that at first. My ex-girlfriend also said she’d obviously wait~.”\nMy brother turned back to the TV.\nYes, he did have a girlfriend before he enlisted.\nHowever, they broke up when he was a corporal.\nThough I didn’t want to bring up a sore subject, I asked carefully.\n“What did she say when she broke up with you?”\n“There were things we couldn’t understand about each other. Looking back, it probably would’ve ended that way anyway.”\n“But can’t people work things out by talking if they don’t understand each other?”\nMy brother glanced at me slightly.\n“Do you think it’s that simple?”\n“No, I know it’s not, but if you try to talk things out—”\n“Talking things out isn’t as easy as you think. You and Han-gyeol… You two are special.”\n…He’s right.\n“So, as someone who’s been through it, do you have any advice? Like, how to wait for someone?”\nMy brother responded indifferently.\n“Just keep living your life. I get that Han Han-gyeol is a huge part of your world, but rather than waiting around endlessly, you should stay busy with your own things to make time pass faster. Tell him that, too. It’s good to come out of the military with something, even something small.”\n“Han-gyeol plans to study for his tax accountant license while he’s in there.”\n“That’s huge. And if he’s in the Air Force, he’ll get frequent leaves. He’ll probably get an off-base day every six weeks or so. Just think of it as long-distance, not the military. It’ll be easier that way.”\n“You think that’ll help?”\n“Han Han-gyeol would probably feel more at ease if you spent your time studying rather than hanging out. Not that he’d worry, given how laid-back he is, but it’d be good for him to know you’re working on your goals, too.”\n“Exactly. Even if he wouldn’t worry, I don’t want to do anything that might remotely concern him.”\n“Exactly. Just keep dating like you are now. Just think of it as seeing each other a bit less.”\nToday, My Brother Looked a Little Different.\n“But why did you break up with your girlfriend if you thought all this through?”\n“I didn’t realize it back then; it only became clear after we split. If I could go back in time and relive my life, I wouldn’t act that way.”\n“But… you’d have to go back to the military again.”\n“Holy sh—! No way! I’d never do that again. If you ever meet someone who’s been to the military twice, introduce me.”\n“Why?”\n“Anyone with the mental strength to go through the military twice can probably conquer space! I should be friends with someone like that.”\nThough the conversation veered off in a strange direction, my brother’s words were unexpectedly helpful.\n“Thanks for the talk. It actually helped a lot.”\n“So… does this mean you’ll buy me chicken?”\n“I’ll even throw in cheese balls.”\n“You should be the older sibling.”\nI think I finally know how to handle this.\n****\nWhen I got back home, I decided to have a chat with Han-gyeol before bed.\n“Han-gyeol!”\n“Hm?”\n“Come here and sit for a bit.”\nI patted the spot beside me on the sofa, and freshly showered, he settled in next to me.\n“What’s up?”\n“I have something to tell you.”\n“Yeah? What is it?”\n“You’ll be going to the military in two months, right?”\n“Mm-hm.”\n“I’ve made up my mind!”\nHe tilted his head curiously.\n“What kind of decision?”\n“I’m going to keep in touch with you often, and we’ll go on dates when you’re on leave. But… let’s not get trapped by a sense of duty.”\nI looked straight into his eyes as I spoke.\n“What exactly do you mean by not getting trapped by duty?”\n“Like, for example, I won’t insist that you only spend time with me when you’re on leave. If you want to be alone, you can relax at home. And if you want to go on a solo trip, you can go, too.”\n“I appreciate you saying that, but, as I mentioned before, you don’t need to be overly considerate of me…”\n“Yeah! And I’m not saying this just for you. I also won’t let myself feel bound by obligation. It might sound a bit selfish, but if something comes up, there might be times when I can’t meet you for a date. If that happens, I hope you’ll understand.”\nBefore he could respond, I added quickly.\n“And remember this, Han-gyeol. I love you, and I’ll always love you, only you. But, until recently, I thought I had to always be considerate of you, and I worried it might make you feel pressured. It could also make me start expecting things in return. So… would it be alright if I waited for you with a lighter heart, just like now?”\nHis eyes widened in surprise.\nMaybe he hadn’t expected me to be so straightforward.\n“I don’t want you to push yourself too hard, either. If you wait for me like this, it would make me the happiest.”\nThis time, it was his turn to continue.\n“I won’t be disappointed if you can’t go on a date when I’m on leave. Sure, I’d miss you, but I want you to keep studying diligently and waiting for me, just as you are now. I’ll be working hard, too, while I’m in the military.”\n“You always work hard, no matter where you are.”\nI gently placed my hand on his cheek.\n“But I’ll still visit you at least twice a month.”\n“Really? You don’t have to, though. If my base is far, even once a month could be difficult.”\n“Then, promise to set aside at least an hour for me every day! I want to hear about your day, and I’ll share mine with you. How’s that? A fair deal, right?”\nI clearly communicated my wishes without making him feel pressured.\n“What if I want to talk more?”\n“Then just say so!”\n“But what if you’re busy?”\n“Then we’ll make up for it by talking even more the next day~”\nI answered with a bright smile, and, seeing my face, he seemed convinced.\n“Are you serious? Don’t just say this and end up overthinking things on my behalf.”\n“Absolutely! No need to worry!”\nHearing my response, Han-gyeol beamed with a gentle smile, wrapping his arms around my waist and pulling me close.\n“Thank you… for saying that.”\n“Oh, come on, it’s nothing! Hey, let’s take one more trip together before you leave for the military!”\n“Sounds good~ Where should we go?”\n“Hm… Busan! I want to see the ocean again.”\n“Busan sounds perfect. What do you want to do there?”\n“I want to feed shrimp crackers to the seagulls!”\nHan-gyeol burst into laughter at my answer.\n“Pfft—! What? That’s all?”\n“Why are you laughing?! I’ve only seen it in videos; I’ve never done it myself! It looked so much fun…”\n“It’s not feeding them; it’s more like having them snatch it from you. What if they steal all your shrimp crackers?”\n“In that case, I’ll just grab them by the neck—bam!”\n“It won’t be as easy as you think~”\n“Something tells me I could pull it off.”\nWith a smile, he leaned down and kissed my forehead.\n“You’re so quirky sometimes.”\n“Talking about shrimp crackers makes me want some.”\n“Should I go out and grab some for us? Maybe some cold beer, too?”\n“That sounds amazing—let’s go, quick!”\n“Guess I’ll need to freshen up again.”\nI leaned in and whispered softly into his ear.\n“Want to shower together?”\n“Now I feel like I should shower first.”\n“No way~ Shrimp crackers come first~”\n“Alright, alright. Let’s head out.”\n“Yup!”\nWith that, we were off for an impromptu snack run.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Only about a week remains until my enlistment.\nI had meals with Eun-ha’s family to say goodbye, and shared a casual drink with friends.\nEun-ha and I continued spending time together as usual, eating and sleeping by each other’s side, without letting any sense of obligation weigh us down, just like she insisted.\nNow, we were finally standing on the brink of our last trip together before my enlistment.\nWe chose Busan as our destination, planning to stay for seven days and six nights. The first and last nights, we’d spend at my parents’ house in Busan.\nOn the day of enlistment, we decided Eun-ha would ride with me and my parents to the training center.\nFor the first time in a while, Eun-ha would be seeing my parents, and she seemed quite nervous, fretting over what to wear a few days in advance.\nThe thought of her putting so much thought into her outfit for our dates too made the corners of my mouth lift naturally.\n“Han-gyeol! How do I look today?! Is this okay?! Do I look tidy?”\n“You look so beautiful I could die~ Eun-ha, you look amazing no matter what you wear!”“Be extra critical today, okay~? I’ll be meeting your parents, after all. I need to make a good impression.”\nHonestly, although I knew the address, I’d never actually been to my parents’ house in Busan.\nThinking about it now… I must be a terrible son, huh…?\n“Han-gyeol?”\n“Oh—uh, yeah, you look so tidy. You could wear that exactly as is, no need to be nervous~ My parents already love you!”\n“Thanks for saying that, but I’m still so nervous…!”\n“You’ll be fine~ Let’s go. We don’t want to miss the train.”\n“Yep! Got it. Let’s head out!”\nI reached out, and Eun-ha took my hand firmly. Knowing we wouldn’t be able to hold hands for a whole month after my enlistment, I squeezed tightly.\n“Can’t wait for our trip to Busan!”\n“Let’s eat lots of good food while we’re there~”\n“Yeah, yeah! And we can feed shrimp crackers to the seagulls.”\n“Absolutely~ That’s a must!”\nHand in hand, we stepped out the door. We held on tight, not letting go even once until we reached Cheongnyangni Station by bus.\nWhenever our eyes met, Eun-ha would smile brightly, and I’d return her smile.\nI thought Eun-ha might be feeling sad because of my upcoming enlistment, but she was the same as always, putting me at ease.\nSeeing her like that, I wanted to show her more of my happy side rather than a gloomy face.\nOn the train, I lifted Eun-ha’s bag up onto the luggage rack for her.\nWhile I was doing that, she quickly claimed the window seat.\n“Hey, that’s cheating!”\n“Whoever sits down first gets the spot~”\nHer playful tone only made her more endearing.\n“Fine. Eun-ha, you can do whatever you want~”\n“If you want the window seat, you could always sit on my lap?”\n“I’m good~”\nEun-ha leaned her face against my arm, taking my arm in hers.\n“Before we go to your place, let’s stop at a mart and grab a fruit basket.”\n“Hm? I’m sure it’ll be fine without one. No need to feel pressured.”\n“Oh, really? Well, when you first came to my house, what did you bring?”\n“Did I bring something that time?”\n“Yup! You brought a roll cake, remember?”\nI only remembered when she mentioned it.\n“Oh, right! That’s right! You remember everything.”\n“I remember everything with you~ And so, I’m bringing something too.”\n“Alright. Once we’re in Busan, we’ll stop by the mart on our way.”\n“This time, I’m going to earn major points!”\n“They already like you~”\n“Right now, they probably only like me as their son’s girlfriend! I want to earn some points as their future daughter-in-law!”\nEun-ha clenched her fist with determination.\n“How are you planning to score points?”\n“Maybe if I politely say, ‘Please give me your son’s hand in marriage’?”\n“They might just hand me over right then.”\n“That sounds more like something my parents would do.”\n“I’m grateful they think so highly of me.”\n“It’s because you’re a good person, Han-gyeol~”\n“And you’re pretty great yourself, Eun-ha.”\n“I’m only great for you~”\nShe rubbed her face against my arm like a cat.\n“You’re like a little cat.”\n“So… you’re my owner, then?”\n“W-wait, what?!”\nEun-ha looked at me intently, clearly waiting for my response.\n“So… is that how it is?”\n“Hehe, look at you getting all flustered, Han-gyeol. You’re so cute.”\n“Eun-ha, sometimes I think you don’t have a brake pedal.”\n“When it comes to you, Han-gyeol, it’s full speed ahead~ Who has time to brake?”\n“Don’t go too fast, or you’ll get a ticket.”\n“I’ll go with the sirens blaring.”\n“Pfft—!” I couldn’t help but burst out laughing.\n“Oh?! Han-gyeol, you laughed~”\n“Lucky I wasn’t drinking anything, or I’d be in trouble.”\n“I figured you’d laugh at that! By now, I totally know what gets you going.”\n“That’s a problem—I still don’t fully understand what makes you laugh, Eun-ha.”\n“For me, just looking at you makes me smile. See?! Even now, I can’t stop grinning~”\nWith a beaming smile, Eun-ha gazed at me.\n“Same here~ When I look at you, my lips just naturally curl up.”\n“Really?! Let’s see how far they go up.”\nShe grabbed my face and tilted it to check out my big grin.\nSeeing me with my cheeks raised, she smiled happily.\n“It’s true~ Your smile could practically touch your ears~”\n“You’re the same way, you know~?”\n“Hehe. You’re right!”\nWe chatted, laughing and enjoying ourselves all the way on the train.\nHonestly, she was just so lovable.\n****\nOnce we arrived at Busan Station, we stopped by a mart to pick up a fruit basket before heading to my parents’ place.\nSince I didn’t know the door code, we rang the doorbell and waited at the front entrance.\nWhen the door opened, there stood my parents, whom I hadn’t seen in a while.\n“We’r\n“Hello! How have you been?!”\nEun-ha, holding the fruit basket, gave a polite 90-degree bow.\nMy parents welcomed her warmly, smiling brightly.\n“Eun-ha, you’re here! You’ve gotten even prettier~”\n“Welcome~”\n“Thank you so much! And, um… here!”\nEun-ha handed over the fruit basket, and my mom smiled contentedly.\n“Oh, you didn’t need to bring anything~”\n“N-no, I felt it’d be rude to come empty-handed.”\n“Alright then, come in. You haven’t had dinner, right?”\n“No! Not yet—!”\n“Good~ Let’s eat first.”\n“Yes~!”\nEun-ha stepped inside first, and I followed after.\nAs soon as we entered, the delicious aroma filled the air, and the dining table was so laden with food it looked about ready to buckle under the weight.\nAfter washing our hands, we sat down at the table.\n“Wow~ Everything looks amazing!”\n“It’s all for you two~ Go ahead and eat. Let me know if you need more.”\n“Yes, yes! Han-gyeol, let’s dig in.”\n“Alright. Thank you for the meal.”\n“Thank you for the meal~”\n“Enjoy~”\nThough Eun-ha is always well-mannered while eating, today she was extra careful.\nShe kept her back straight and followed every dining etiquette rule meticulously.\nShe didn’t need to be this formal, but I found her thoughtfulness endearing and lovely.\nWhen we finished eating, she rolled up her sleeves, insisting on doing the dishes.\n“I’ll handle the dishes!”\n“We’ve got a dishwasher, so it’s alright~”\n“Oh! Then I’ll at least load the dishes into the dishwasher and tidy up a bit!”\n“It’s really fine~ Why don’t you relax in the living room?”\nThough Mom politely declined, I wanted Eun-ha’s kindness to shine through, so I lent a hand.\n“I’ll help with Eun-ha to tidy up. You go ahead and relax in the living room, Mom.”\n“Hm… should I?”\n“Yes! At home, we’re a great cleaning team~!”\n“Really? It’s nice to hear you’re living so well~ I’ll leave it to you, then.”\n“Of course!”\nMy parents went to the living room, leaving Eun-ha and me to finish tidying up together.\n“Thanks for helping out, Han-gyeol.”\n“Oh, it’s nothing~ Let’s finish up quickly so we can have some fruit.”\n“Yep, yep!”\nAfter clearing the dishes from the table, we joined my parents in the living room to enjoy some fruit.\nEun-ha proudly announced that she had actually practiced her fruit-peeling skills for this moment, then showed off by peeling an apple in one long, unbroken strip.\nSeeing this, my parents beamed and even clapped in admiration. After neatly arranging the fruit on a plate, the conversation shifted to my enlistment.\n“So, Eun-ha, you’ll be by yourself when Han-gyeol goes to the military. Do you think you’ll be okay?”\n“Oh—yes, yes! During the college term, I’ll stay at the dorm, and on breaks, I’ll go back to my parents’ house.”\n“True, it’s good to keep the apartment since he’ll need a place to come back to on leave. Good thing you got it on lease.”\n“Yes, I’m grateful for that! I also plan to go over occasionally to clean.”\nEun-ha answered confidently, her voice bright and cheerful.\nMy parents then turned to me.\n“Han-gyeol, make sure you take good care of Eun-ha. Understand?”\n“Yes, treat her well.”\nEven my father, who rarely spoke up, encouraged me to be good to Eun-ha.\n“Yes, I’ll do even better.”\n“Han-gyeol’s already doing a great job.”\n“That’s right~ You two need to support each other~ By the way, Han-gyeol, when are you shaving your head?”\n“I’ll shave it the day before enlistment. But they’ll just shave it again at the training center anyway.”\nI took a bite of the apple Eun-ha had peeled.\n“Make sure you write lots of letters to Eun-ha, alright?”\n“I will. Plus, I heard we’ll get an hour to use our phones every weekend at the training center.”\n“Oh, really? That’s a relief~”\n“What do you plan to do to pass the time in the military?”\n“I’ll exercise and maybe study for the tax accountant exam.”\n“Good to have a plan.”\n“It’s all thanks to Eun-ha. I want to marry her as soon as possible.”\nI brought up marriage first, knowing it would be a tough subject for Eun-ha to start on her own.\n“Well, it’s important to know Eun-ha’s feelings too. What do you think, Eun-ha?”\n“M-me?! I’m all for it! If possible, I’d like to marry Han-gyeol as soon as I can! Please give me your son’s hand in marriage! I’ll make him the happiest man in the world!”\nSeizing the moment, Eun-ha placed her hand over her heart and declared her intent with all her might.\nMy parents, holding their forks mid-air, stared at her before bursting into laughter.\n“Alright then—get married already!”\n“Yes! I’ll also make sure you have grandkids soon!”\n“Oh? And how many do you plan to give us?”\nAt this, my mom asked, and Eun-ha beamed brightly.\n“Four!”\nFor a moment, my parents seemed surprised by Eun-ha’s answer.\nTheir faces mirrored my own the first time she mentioned that two wouldn’t be enough.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "I was happy that Han-gyeol’s parents seemed to have a good impression of me.\nBut as I thought of Han-gyeol, who would soon be enlisting, a part of my heart ached.\nEven so, I wanted to see him off with a smile. I didn’t want to shed any tears.\n“Starting tomorrow, you’ll be sightseeing, right? For today, just get a good rest in your room.”\n“Right. If we want to have fun, it’s best to sleep early.”\nChatting with Han-gyeol’s parents made the time fly, and before I knew it, it was already ten at night.\nBut… was it okay to sleep in the same room with him while his parents were here?\nSharing a room while staying with adults—it felt a bit awkward.\n“Eun-ha, you should sleep with Han-gyeol too.”\n“A-ah! Really? Is that okay?”“Of course~ It’s perfectly fine! Han-gyeo doesn’t have any weird sleeping habits, does he?”\n“Not at all! Han-gyeol sleeps really neatly.”\n“Oh, you must’ve seen that a lot~?”\n“Ah—well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but… yes.”\nI answered shyly.\nSoon, I’d have to part with him, and I wanted to be by his side every night until then.\n“So, you’re staying for breakfast tomorrow?”\n“Yes, that’s the plan. We will come back the day before enlists.”\n“Good. Have a great time. Eun-ha, you too, enjoy yourself.”\n“Yes! We’ll have a wonderful time!”\nI think my response left his parents feeling satisfied.\nAfter turning off the lights in the living room, I washed up and headed into the room I’d be sharing with Han-gyeol.\n“Eun-ha, let me know if you’re uncomfortable sleeping.”\n“I sleep fine as long as I’m with you, Han-gyeol!”\n“Alright, then. You lie down first, and I’ll turn off the light.”\n“Mm-hmm.”\nI climbed onto the bed first and pulled the blanket over me.\nAfter turning off the light, Han-gyeol lay down beside me.\nGently, I took his hand and looked him in the eyes.\n“My parents really seem to like you, Eun-ha.”\n“Mmm-hmm. That’s such a relief. Think I earned some good points?”\n“They already seem to see you as a future daughter-in-law.”\n“Hehe… That makes me feel good.”\nAs I nestled into his arms, he pulled me close.\n“You weren’t uncomfortable, were you?”\n“No, no. They treated me so well.”\n“Still, you seemed a bit tense~”\n“Well, I was nervous~ But I felt at ease too.”\n“Now, get some good rest~ Go to sleep.”\nWith his arms around me, Han-gyeol softly stroked my hair.\nEvery time his large hand brushed over my head, I felt a calmness settle over me.\nBut the thought that soon, I wouldn’t have this comfort anymore… it made me sad.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Keep stroking my hair.”\n“Alright~ Like this?”\nHan-gyeol stroked my hair even more gently.\n“Yes, like that. And… a kiss too… No, wait. Since your parents are here, save it for tomorrow.”\n“Why~? I can sneak one in. It’s fine as long as it’s not too intense, right?”\n“It feels a bit like… we’re doing something we shouldn’t—”\nBefore I could finish my sentence, he leaned in and kissed my forehead.\n“I wasn’t done talking…!”\n“Sorry, I just couldn’t help myself. You’re too beautiful, Eun-ha.”\n“But when you start, I just want more…”\n“Then I’ll keep going.”\n“No, I want to do it.”\nI held his face and pressed my lips to his.\nThe soft, warm sensation of his lips—I wanted to etch it clearly into my memory.\n“So where’s that Eun-ha who wanted to save the kiss for tomorrow because my parents are here?”\n“You said it’s fine as long as it’s not intense~ Your lips are so soft, Han-gyeol. Mine are soft too, want to check?”\n“Yeah, come a bit closer.”\nThis time, he gently held my face and kissed me deeply.\nI felt amazing. My heart raced, and I felt even closer to him, as if we were one.\n“This is… so embarrassing…”\n“You’re saying that, but you kissed me pretty boldly.”\n“Being embarrassed is one thing, but wanting to kiss you is another~”\n“I really want to kiss you too, Eun-ha.”\n“Then let’s kiss all the time starting tomorrow. But tonight, let’s stop here.”\n“Aww, come on, just one more?”\n“Hmm, fine. Go ahead, quickly.”\nI smiled, and he leaned in for another kiss.\nI felt so happy, yet there was a bittersweet ache in my heart.\nAs he finished the kiss and tried to pull away, I instinctively grabbed his collar.\nI didn’t want to let him go.\nI didn’t want him to leave.\nBut I couldn’t bring myself to say that.\nI could only hold onto him, silently asking for one more kiss.\nClutching his collar tightly, pulling him close.\nI tried to soothe the sadness in my heart.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? I love you too.”\n“What~? I didn’t even say it yet.”\n“I just knew. Was I wrong?”\n“No. You were exactly right~”\nMy heart fluttered at the loving gaze in his eyes.\nAnd as he stroked my hair once more, I felt at peace.\nWhat am I going to do?\nI wish morning would never come.\n****\n\"Eun-ha, time to get up~\"\n\"Ugh… Han-gyeol…!\"\nThe morning I had hoped would never come had finally arrived.\nJust once, I wished my small hope could be granted, but I was disappointed.\n\"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"Yes… did you sleep well too, Han-gyeol?\"\n\"Of course I did. Now let’s get up. We should wash up and have breakfast.\"\nAt his words, I forced my eyes open and sat up.\nI had planned to get up early and help his mother prepare breakfast.\nBut I had forgotten to set my alarm earlier.\n\"Did your mom prepare breakfast alone?! I should’ve helped her!\"\n\"Nope~ I told her I’d handle it, so she should rest.\"\n\"Then you made breakfast by yourself? You should’ve woken me…!\"\n\"I just wanted to make breakfast for you too, Eun-ha.\"\nI think I understood what was in his heart.\n\"Alright… But let me take care of the cleanup then?\"\n\"Let’s do that together~ Here, I’ll help you up.\"\nHe held out both his hands, and I immediately grabbed them.\nBut he pulled so hard that I ended up crashing right into his arms.\n\"You pulled too hard~\"\n\"Couldn’t help it, I wanted to hold you~\"\n\"Hehe, to be honest, I like it too—\"\nJust then, click!—the door opened.\nStill wrapped in his arms, I looked up and locked eyes with his mother.\n\"Kids, breakfast—\"\n\"…!!\"\nI blinked in silence.\nMy body froze, and I couldn’t even think of pulling away.\n\"Oh dear, sorry~ I forgot to knock~ Carry on with what you were doing~\"\nShe smiled warmly and quietly closed the door again.\n\"Oh no, we got caught.\"\n\"Aaaaaah…!\"\nI could feel the heat rising all the way from my neck to my face.\nAnd of course, Han-gyeol wasn’t any different.\n\"Shall… we go have breakfast?\"\n\"Give me five minutes… just five minutes to cool my face down.\"\n\"Yeah, good idea.\"\nWe fanned each other’s flushed cheeks to cool down.\nWhen our blushes had faded, we snuck out to the kitchen.\nAs I sat down carefully, a slightly awkward atmosphere hung in the air.\nBut thankfully, his mother broke the silence.\n\"My son is surprisingly diligent, huh? Making breakfast too.\"\n\"Oh—! Yes, yes. Han-gyeol and I take turns with the chores every other week!\"\n\"That's the way to do it. Good job, son, keep it up.\"\n\"Yes, I'm trying to do even better.\"\n\"Alright, let’s dig in. You two have a day ahead of you.\"\nAfter his father took the first bite, we joined him for the meal.\nThough it was my first time here, it felt comfortable and homely.\nThe warmth I felt from being around Han-gyeol extended to his family too.\nWhen we finished eating, we tidied up the table together like yesterday.\nAfter washing up and getting ready, we put on our shoes, and his parents came out to see us off.\n\"Alright, we’ll be back. See you on Sunday.\"\n\"Remember, don’t drink too much just because it’s your last outing before enlisting.\"\nAfter Han-gyeol greeted them, I bowed as well.\n\"I’ll see you on Sunday too!\"\n\"Take care, Eun-ha, and have fun~\"\n\"Yes, we will!\"\nWith a bright smile, his mother saw me off.\nHis father pulled out his wallet and handed a card to Han-gyeol.\n\"Use this and don’t even think about coming home until it’s maxed out.\"\n\"Wow…! Thank you. I’ll put it to good use.\"\n\"This isn’t because I like you. It’s so you can show Eun-ha a good time.\"\nHis father shot me a warm smile.\n\"Thank you! We’ll have a wonderful time.\"\n\"Alright, have fun, you two.\"\n\"We’ll be on our way~\"\n\"See you later~\"\nBowing together, we stepped outside.\nGazing down at the card in his hand, Han-gyeol’s face lit up with a grin.\n\"Let’s eat something fancy.\"\n\"Don’t go too overboard~\"\n\"Hey, he told us not to come back until the balance runs out, didn’t he? Let’s get some crab, Eun-ha.\"\n\"That’s going to be too expensive! Let’s settle for sashimi.\"\n\"Fine, then grilled tilefish.\"\nHe looked absolutely delighted.\nI knew he wanted to keep his sadness from showing, not wanting me to see it.\nHow could anyone be so cheerful before enlisting?\nI decided to embrace his kindness just as it was.\n\"Come on, let’s get going already.\"\n\"Yeah, let’s drop off our stuff at the lodging first.\"\nThe final trip before enlistment that I had hoped wouldn’t begin… was finally underway.\n\"After we settle in, we’ll go see the ocean, right?\"\n\"Yes, let’s enjoy it leisurely.\"\n\"Alright~ Let’s hold hands, Han-gyeol~\"\nWhen I held out my hand, he grabbed it tightly.\nI planned to keep holding his hand throughout the trip.\nAh… I really don’t want to let him go.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "On the fourth day of our trip, which was Friday, we booked a place near Haeundae. During the day, we wandered around the beach, and as the sun set, we found ourselves at a seafood restaurant overlooking the ocean, savoring freshly caught parrot fish.\nSince I’d been told not to come back until I’d drained my funds, I splurged a little. Yet, despite being on day four of the trip, my balance hadn’t run out, which meant I must have been given more than enough. It made me wonder if I’d even run out by the end of the trip.\n“Eun-ha, say ah~”\n“Ah~”\nI dipped two slices of fish in the sauce and carefully brought them to Eun-ha’s lips. She looked absolutely adorable, chewing the sashimi with a little munch.\n“Is it good?”\nEun-ha nodded happily with a smile. Ah… she’s too cute. Makes me not want to enlist. Then again, I never really wanted to in the first place.\nAfter swallowing her fish with a soft gulp, Eun-ha beamed up at me.\n“You’re giving me two pieces at once~ Isn’t that a bit too much love?”\n“You look so pretty when you’re eating that I can’t help myself.”“Then I’ll feed you too, come here.”\nEun-ha picked up three pieces and placed them into my mouth. As the fresh taste of the fish spread across my tongue, I couldn’t help but smile.\n“Wow, Han-gyeol, you’re a good eater~”\n“It’s my first time having freshly caught parrot fish. It’s definitely something special.”\n“You know you have a certain look when you eat something you like, right?”\n“Huh? Do I?”\n“Yeah, you do.”\nEun-ha grinned brightly.\n“Whenever you eat something delicious, the corners of your mouth lift just a bit. Especially at barbecue places, when the server grills the meat, you look so cute with that expression.” 𝘙ã\nHer comment made me feel a bit shy.\n“Now I feel a little embarrassed.”\nI took a small sip of water, trying to avoid her gaze.\n“Even the way you’re shyly glancing away is adorable~”\n“You know me too well, don’t you?”\n“We’ve spent years together, Han-gyeol~ Of course I know you well. And you know me well too, right?”\n“Yeah, I definitely know more about you than most people.”\nSince long before we came here, I’d already known a lot. But there were so many new things I’d learned from living together.\n“Oh really~? Is there something you know about me that I haven’t told you?”\n“Of course.”\n“Like what?”\n“You can’t eat eggplant.”\nEun-ha’s eyes widened, and she blushed a little, looking slightly embarrassed.\n“Did I ever tell you that I don’t eat eggplant?!”\n“Nope~”\n“I thought you might hesitate a little, but you answered right away... How did you know?”\n“Easy—I’ve eaten with you enough times. You’re someone who usually eats everything, but you never touch the eggplant side dishes, not even once. That’s how I figured it out.”\nEun-ha looked at me with amazement.\n“Han-gyeol, you really do know a lot about me...”\n“Well, we’ve been living together, so it’s only natural~”\n“Somehow, it makes my heart flutter a bit to know you understand things about me without me saying anything…!”\n“Oh yeah? Why?”\n“It just means you’ve been paying attention to me all this time, right? That makes me happy.”\n“I feel the same way~ You’re always watching me, too.”\n“Yup, I only have eyes for you, Han-gyeol~ Got any other guesses?”\nEvery time she sleep somewhere new, she snore, which is embarrassing, so I won’t tell her that.\n“It feels like everything’s so natural now that nothing specific comes to mind. How about you, Eun-ha?”\n“Nothing really comes to mind for me either. But I still want to know more.”\n“Me too. I’m still curious about you, Eun-ha.”\n“Stop saying things that make my heart flutter~ It’s bad for my health.”\n“I meant it.”\nEun-ha smiled warmly, her eyes fixed on my face. Neither of us had brought up the topic of my enlistment, but we both felt the same way.\nWe didn’t want to be apart, and we wanted to stay close like this.\n“Where should we go after finishing the sashimi?”\n“Hm~ I don’t know. What do you feel like doing, Han-gyeol?”\n“For me, as long as I’m with you, I’m good with anything~”\n“Same here. But tell me what you’d like to do~”\n“Hmm… We’ve been out and about a lot. How about we go back to the place, watch a movie, and drink some beer?”\n“Yes, that sounds good~”\nEun-ha’s cheerful response, even though she must be feeling sad, made me feel so grateful.\n****\nAfter leaving the seafood restaurant, we bought some beer and returned to our lodging.\n“Han-gyeol, I’ll go wash up first~”\n“Oh, sure. I’ll set things up and pick out a movie. Any genre you feel like watching?”\n“Huh? I kind of want a comedy, but if you don’t find one, anything is fine~”\n“Got it.”\nEun-ha grabbed her clothes and headed to the bathroom. As the sound of the shower started, I put the beer in the fridge and searched for a movie.\nLuckily, I found a well-rated comedy and waited in the chair until Eun-ha came out.\n“Han-gyeol~ I’m all done.”\nEun-ha walked out, drying her damp hair with a towel.\n“Alright, I’ll go wash up too.”\nI stepped into the bathroom, turned on the shower, and let the warm water wash over me. After a quick rinse, I headed back outside.\n“You’re here, Han-gyeol? Hurry up and come over.”\nEun-ha was sitting on the bed in her bathrobe, patting the bed beside her. Her gesture was so cute that I hurried to sit next to her.\n“Did you know you’re adorable when you pat the bed like that, Eun-ha?”\n“What~? You think that’s cute?”\n“Everything you do is cute in my eyes.”\n“Thank you. By the way, sorry for asking now, but could you grab the beer from the fridge?”\n“Of course~”\nI brought the cans of beer over and sat down next to Eun-ha on the bed. With a crisp pop, we opened the cans and clinked them together.\n“Cheers~”\nThe movie began, and we watched it while holding hands. I was a bit worried it might not suit Eun-ha’s taste or mine, but fortunately, it turned out to be a lighthearted, funny movie with a few laugh-out-loud moments.\n“It’s funnier than I expected, right?”\nJust as I turned to check if Eun-ha was enjoying it, I saw her profile, and I froze.\n“Yes..! It’s funny..!”\nShe said it was funny, but tears the size of raindrops were falling from her eyes as she stared at the screen.\n“Eun-ha, why are you crying all of a sudden?!”\n“It’s just so funny I’m crying…!”\n“Yeah, right. Who’d believe that? What’s wrong? Are you in pain? Look at me.”\nI set my beer down on the side table and gently turned her face toward me. The moment our eyes met, her tears started falling even faster, soaking the bedsheet beneath her.\n“It hurts…”\n“Where? What hurts?!”\nHer expression twisted, and then she broke into sobs, her voice cracking as if she’d held back her sadness for too long.\n“It hurts in my heart…! My heart hurts…! I’m sorry… I wanted to let you go with a smile, but… I can’t hold it in anymore…!”\nI thought she’d be okay.\nSince we left the house, she’d been smiling for me all this time.\nWe’d talked about everything, and I thought she’d come to terms with my decision after thinking it through.\n“Can’t you stay? Or… can’t you leave just a little later? I don’t want to be apart from you, Han-gyeol… I want to stay with you longer. I’m sorry. I don’t want to let you go… It’s just too hard…”\nIn trying to hide my own sadness and reluctance, I’d nearly forgotten what was most important.\n“Eun-ha…”\nI gently pulled her into my arms. As soon as she settled in my embrace, she clung to my bathrobe and began to cry.\n“Hwaaah—! I’m sorry…!”\nWatching her sob so heartbreakingly, not wanting to let go of me, made my own heart ache. The saddest part was that the only comfort I could offer was softly stroking her head.\n“What are you sorry for~”\nEun-ha’s shoulders shook as she poured out her feelings.\n“I wanted to send you off with a smile…! I didn’t want you to worry about anything…!”\n“Oh, silly. Why try to hold back? If you’re sad, you should cry. Cry as much as you need to.”\n“Han-gyeol…”\n“Yes?”\nEun-ha slowly lifted her head.\n“I love you… more than anything in this world…”\nHer tear-streaked face was beautiful, even in sadness. Even when she cried, she looked so pretty. Gently, I wiped her tears away.\n“I love you too, Eun-ha, more than anything. I can’t imagine life without you.”\n“Me too… I can’t live without you, Han-gyeol. I’d be lost without you.”\n“Yeah. We’re that important to each other. One day, we’ll get married, have kids, and make a happy life together.”\n“Yeah… we will…”\n“Let’s look even further ahead.”\n“Further…?” she repeated softly, her gaze fixed on mine. I spoke carefully, hoping my words might bring her even a little bit of comfort.\n“When I finish my service, you’ll be in your third year. I’ll be in my first-year, second semester. That means we’ll get to go to college together for about a year and a half. I’ll aim to graduate early, but I’ll probably be in college by myself for a year or so. I might feel a bit lonely then, but at least I’ll be able to see you whenever I want.”\nI kept talking, not letting the silence settle in.\n“After we graduate, we’ll get married, just like we promised. We probably won’t have much saved, so we won’t be able to live in a fancy place. Especially in Seoul, where rent is high, we’ll likely start out in a rented place. But as we save, we’ll eventually find a small place to call our own.”\nEun-ha’s eyes were glued to my face.\n“By then, we might have kids too. I wonder if Eunbyul will be our first, or maybe Hanbyul? Or who knows, maybe we’ll have twins. As we raise our kids, maybe we’ll start thinking about having one more. I’ve thought about a name for our youngest… How about Gumbyul? That way, if Eunbyul is the oldest, it’ll be Eunbyul and then Gumbyul as the youngest. Feels nice, doesn’t it?”\nEun-ha gave a small nod, her voice soft.\n“I like it…”\n“When we’re working, there’ll be days when we’re scolded, when we’re exhausted and don’t feel like doing anything. But with you beside me, none of that will matter. Just seeing you will give me happiness and strength.”\n“Me too… just seeing you makes me happy.”\nHer voice had calmed, the storm of sadness starting to fade.\n“Eun-ha, this is only a short separation. But when I come back, we’ll make up for it by being together even more. We’ll go to Jeju Island, your favorite place~ and I’ll watch you tie your hair up every day.”\nI smiled, placing my hand on her cheek. The warmth of her skin spread through me, wrapping my heart in comfort.\n“I love you.”\n“I… I love you too…”\n“All done crying now?”\nShe nodded.\n“Han-gyeol…”\n“Yeah?”\n“Um…”\nI replied with a smile.\n“Give me all the skinship we’ll miss while you’re gone… in advance…”\n“Hmm?”\n“Give me a month’s worth in advance… holding hands… hugging… kissing… everything…”\nI couldn’t help but grin.\n“Okay. Let’s get in a month’s worth.”\n“Good… because I’m not letting you sleep tonight…”\nEun-ha slowly leaned in, covering my lips with hers.\nLooks like there’s no sleeping tonight.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "For the remainder of the trip, I stayed glued to Han-gyeol at the lodge.\nI still didn’t want to let him go; I wanted to keep him here with me.\nBut, as Han-gyeol had said, we decided to look at the bigger picture.\nOnce Han-gyeol finishes his military service and graduates from college, we might get married right away.\nWe might spend our first night as newlyweds making love and end up having a child right after.\nJust like Han-gyeol said, I was curious whether Eunbyul or Hanbyul would come first.\nOr maybe they’ll come together? Since we’re having four, twins wouldn’t be so bad.\n“Hmm…\nThe future father of my children had fallen into a deep sleep, probably exhausted from all the love we’d shared.\nI couldn’t take my eyes off his peacefully sleeping face.Even in his sleep, he muttered my name as part of his dream.\n“Eun-ha… salmon…”\nWhat could he possibly be dreaming about?\nEven so, just knowing he was dreaming about me made me incredibly happy.\nWhat am I supposed to do? He’s so adorable that I can’t even handle my emotions.\nSeriously… I’m so grateful that Han-gyeol came into my life.\nI think I could divide my life into two parts: before and after meeting him.\n“I love you, Han-gyeol.”\nWhen I confessed my love, he turned over toward me.\n“Mm…”\nIt was one of those nights where I felt sleepy but didn’t want to fall asleep.\nI wanted to look at his face a little longer.\nAs I leaned in closer, he pulled me into his arms.\nWith my ear pressed against his chest, I could hear his heart racing like crazy.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re awake, aren’t you?”\n“Mmm… no, I’m not…”\n“Then how are you answering me~?”\nI pinched his cheek, and he slowly opened his eyes.\nThen, he placed a soft kiss on my forehead and murmured,\n“I love you too…”\n“What?! You’ve been awake this whole time?”\n“I’ve been awake for a while now.”\n“What were you dreaming about? It sounded like you were dreaming about me.”\n“Oh, Eun-ha… you were rolling up your sleeves and catching salmon with your bare hands.”\n“What?! That’s ridiculous~”\n“It was cute, though. Waking up to see you right in front of me made me happy.”\nHan-gyeol hugged me tightly.\nThe pressure was comforting, but I had a hard time breathing.\n“I can’t breathe~ Can you loosen up a little?”\n“I don’t want to let go. Just for a bit longer.”\n“Alright…”\nReally… he doesn’t want to let go.\nHearing that makes me not want to let go either.\nWith a mischievous grin, I hugged him tightly around the waist.\n“Argh! Eun-ha, you’re going to break my waist…”\n“I don’t want to let go~ Let’s stay like this for a bit longer.”\n“Your love is overwhelming…”\n“Enjoy it, Han-gyeol.”\nIn the end, I didn’t let him go and held him tightly for a long time.\nPressed against each other with nothing between us, I felt completely at peace.\nI never knew sharing body warmth could feel this blissful until I met Han-gyeol.\nIt was so comforting that I wanted to feel it every day.\nAfter a while, I gently loosened my grip and let him go.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\nThe way he answered my call right away made my face flush bright red.\nEven though I was the one who called him, I instinctively looked down.\n“Eun-ha called me, but why is Eun-ha the one avoiding eye contact?”\n“I just felt like calling you, that’s all.”\n“Don’t just brush it off. Why’d you call me?”\nHan-gyeol pulled me close, locking eyes with me.\nSigh… How could I explain that the expression he wears when teasing me is incredibly sexy?\nHonestly… I kind of like that expression.\nIt’s so different from the kind and gentle Han-gyeol I usually know.\nI adore mature Han-gyeol, but… sometimes, I also really love this mischievous side of him.\nHe didn’t seem to realize how I felt, though, as he continued to stare at me with that teasing expression.\n“It’s, it’s nothing!”\n“Eun-ha, your face says otherwise. Tell me.”\n“I-I’m just sleepy! Let’s go to sleep!”\n“You’re the one who woke me up.”\n“Ugh…”\nI had no good comeback for that.\n“Come on, tell me. Why’s your face all red right now?”\n“I don’t know!”\n“Don’t try to dodge the question—mph!”\nNot wanting to answer, I pressed my lips against his.\nIf I said anything, he’d tease me about it endlessly, for sure.\nAnd besides… moves like this only work when used sparingly.\n“Eun-ha… wait a second…!”\n“It’s all your fault, Han-gyeol…!”\nApparently, just kissing wasn’t enough.\nI grabbed the back of his head and deepened the kiss, letting my tongue slip into his mouth.\n***\nAfter spending the final night together, we returned to his house.\nHan-gyeol looked a bit tired, with dark circles under his eyes.\nMaybe we shouldn’t have done it this morning…\nBut knowing I wouldn’t see him for a long time after today, I wanted to make the most of every moment.\n“Did you enjoy the trip? You look a little worn out, son,” his mother remarked.\n“I just wanted to stay up and enjoy my time as a civilian a little longer.”\nAs he finished his sentence, he glanced sideways at me.\nSure, like he wasn’t the one enjoying it just as much as I did.\nBlaming me, huh? How sneaky.\nSince he had to spend the last night at his parents’ house, there wasn’t much we could do about it.\nEven though part of me wanted to keep going, I knew it was something we’d have to put on hold.\n“By the way, aren’t you shaving your head?” his mom asked.\n“I’ll go out after lunch to take care of it…”\nI had suggested he shave it earlier, but he refused.\nIt seemed like he didn’t want to show me his shaved head, and I couldn’t help but find that endearing.\nSometimes, I think Han-gyeol gets embarrassed more easily than he lets on.\n“Alright then, come in. Let’s have lunch.”\n“Yes, let’s go, Eun-ha.”\n“We’re back!”\n“Welcome back!”\nAfter stepping into the house, we immediately sat down to eat.\nSince it was the day before his enlistment, the table was covered with an impressive spread, and for once, Han-gyeol ate more than usual.\nEven after finishing dessert, we spent time chatting and laughing with his family.\nThough it was bittersweet, I think I’m finally ready to accept that he’s leaving for the military.\nIt’ll be lonely and sad, but when I think about the lifetime we’ll spend together, I can endure it.\nWe laughed and talked brightly.\nWe stole kisses when we were briefly alone in his room.\nWe held hands secretly when his parents weren’t looking.\nIn the evening, we went out so he could shave his head before returning home.\nHis parents laughed and teased him when they saw his new haircut.\nHan-gyeol, on the other hand, seemed too embarrassed to look at me directly.\nBut honestly, I found this shy side of him just as adorable and lovable.\nWhen I tried to gently pat his newly shaved head, he jumped in surprise and grabbed my wrist.\nSeeing him react like that made me want to tease him even more, so I playfully reached out again, darting my hands this way and that.\nFor dinner, we indulged in plates of salmon sushi—Han-gyeol’s last meal of choice before enlistment.\nThe smile on his face as he declared himself satisfied after the meal felt like a memory I would cherish for a long time.\nSeeing him offer to clean up since he ate the most made me feel so proud of him.\nThough he told me to rest on the living room sofa, I couldn’t bear to be apart and helped him tidy up instead.\nEventually, night fell, and after exchanging brief goodbyes with his parents, we returned to his room.\nHan-gyeol climbed into bed first, pulling the blanket over himself.\nI stood by the light switch, turning off the lights before making my way to lie beside him.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Let me touch your head.”\n“No way~ It’s embarrassing.”\n“Just once~ Please?”\nWith a playful pout and a bit of a cute act, I finally convinced him to let me.\n“Fine—here you go.”\n“Hehe…”\nI slowly reached out and ran my hand over his head.\nThe unfamiliar texture fascinated me, though I also felt a twinge of sadness.\n“Your hair feels so prickly. I like it!”\n“You shouldn’t like it…”\n“But it’s ‘your’ hair, so I like it~”\nWhen I grinned at him, he let out a small chuckle.\n“Han-gyeol~”\nHis soft smile was so endearing that I couldn’t help but nuzzle my face into his chest.\n“Yeah, Eun-ha.”\n“I love you~ So much, I love you too much.”\n“Thank you for loving me.”\nThis time, he reached out to stroke my hair.\n“When you do that, I feel so happy,” I said.\n“Really? Then I’ll do it all night.”\n“You can’t~ You’re enlisting tomorrow.”\n“Maybe I should’ve done it more; I feel a little regretful.”\n“No, it’s fine. You’ve already done it plenty. It’s just that I can’t get enough of it… It’s so comforting and exciting that I always want more. But you have to promise to do it every time you come home on leave!”\n“Of course. I promise.”\nHe pulled me into a tighter embrace, leaning close to my ear to whisper:\n“I’ll stroke your hair every time I come home. After I’m discharged, I’ll do it every day. I’ll hold your hand every day, hug you every day, and kiss you every day.”\n“Hmm… but it feels like you left out something important~?”\n“Well, I thought it’d ruin the mood to mention that now~”\n“Will you make love to me every day too~?”\n“If that’s what you want, every day it is~”\nLooking into his eyes, I answered:\n“Hehe… I like that. I love you, Han-gyeol.”\n“I love you too.”\nAfter my confession, he pressed a gentle kiss to my lips.\n“What’s this~? You’re making me want to kiss you more now.”\n“Well, kissing is fine, isn’t it?”\n“Do you think so? Because I think so too~”\n“Come here.”\n“No, I’ll come to you.”\nI leaned in slowly, letting my lips meet his.\nA kiss is harmless, right? Though, of course, it wasn’t just a kiss—our tongues met too.\nWrapped in the blanket together, we cuddled and kissed for a long time before drifting off to sleep.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Today, the sky mirrored the emotions of the new recruits, as rain poured steadily down.\nDue to the rain, the enlistment ceremony was held in the auditorium, which was packed with recruits and their families. Drill instructors in their signature red hats moved around the hall.\nMeanwhile, Han-gyeol was putting on his usual expression, perhaps to keep me from worrying.\nEven though his heart must be uneasy, he tried hard to smile. Seeing that made me feel both grateful and guilty.\nSince it was his enlistment day, I wished he would be a little clingier to me, but Han-gyeol remained his composed self, as always.From the car ride with Han-gyeol's parents, to the meal we shared, and finally to entering the auditorium, I couldn't take my eyes off him.\nI wanted to capture as much of him as I could and stay as close to him as possible.\nI longed for a deep, intimate moment with him, but I couldn't risk doing that in front of his parents...\n“Eun-ha~ You're going to wear out Han-Han-gyeol's face!”\nHis mother, seated to his right, looked at me and teased.\n“Ah—! I-I'm so sorry! I didn’t realize—!”\n“No need to apologize~ It’s nice to see. Look at him all you want while you still can~”\n“T-then I won’t hold back...! I’ll keep looking—!”\nWhen I responded boldly, his parents chuckled warmly, clearly amused.\n“Our son is lucky~ Having such a lovely girlfriend.”\nHis mother playfully directed her comment toward Han-gyeol.\nSmiling brightly at her teasing, Han-gyeol replied,\n“Yes, I’m incredibly lucky.”\n“You’re due for enlistment in about 30 minutes. You’ve double-checked everything, right? Do one more check to be sure.”\n“Just a second...”\nAt his mother’s prompting, Han-gyeol began re-checking the bag he’d brought.\n“I’ve got my ID, my original certifications, my phone... Oh no. I think I left my charger in the car. Dad, could I get the car keys?”\n“Good thing I asked. There’s still about 30 minutes left until the ceremony, so go grab it quickly. You remember where we parked, right?”\n“Yep, I remember. I’ll go with Eun-ha.”\n“Geez~ Didn’t I tell you to double-check before we got out of the car?”\n“I guess I was too distracted because it’s enlistment day. I’ll be right back. Eun-ha, let’s go.”\n“Ah—! Yes, yes! We’ll be back soon.”\n“Alright~”\nTaking my hand, Han-gyeol led me outside the auditorium.\nIt was surprising—he had never forgotten something important before.\n“Han-gyeol, this is the first time I’ve seen you forget something like this...”\n“I didn’t actually forget anything. Look.”\nHe opened his bag and showed me. The charger was right there.\n“Huh? It’s here?! The charger’s here?!”\n“Let’s just stay in the car for a bit.”\n“Han-gyeol, you...!”\nI stared at him, realizing I’d been completely fooled.\nSmiling mischievously, he opened the car door.\n“At most, we’ve got seven or eight minutes. This might be the only time we get to talk alone.”\n“You’re unbelievable...!”\nThough I had been duped, I couldn’t stop my lips from curling into a smile.\nThe idea of even a brief moment alone with him made me happy.\n“What’s unbelievable?”\n“Well done~”\nI grinned and got into the car.\nThe moment we were inside, Han-gyeol clasped my hand tightly.\n“I wanted to hold your hand all morning, but I couldn’t with my parents around.”\n“Hehe... I was holding back too...! Are you okay, though? It’s your enlistment day—it must be tough for you...”\n“I couldn’t show my parents how sad I felt. But yeah, I’m a little down.”\n“Today, you’re allowed to lean on me, you know...”\n“I’m already leaning on you right now.”\nHe gently fiddled with my hand.\n“Eun-ha, your hand is so warm.”\nI also began playing with his hand, gazing at him softly.\n“There’s not much time left, so lean on me all you want!”\n“This right here—this is me leaning on you~”\n“You must’ve been tired, hiding your feelings all morning.”\n“I wasn’t hiding them~ Looking at you made me smile too much to feel down. But honestly, you staring at me so much made me a little embarrassed.”\n“I just wanted to look at your handsome face as much as possible~”\n“What’s handsome about me after shaving my head~”\n“You look incredibly handsome! Makes me want to kiss you.”\nHan-gyeol smiled warmly at my words and planted a kiss on my forehead.\n\"Someone might see us...!\"\n\"The windows are tinted. No one can see in. I checked earlier when we got in.\"\n\"What?! You’re so sly, Han-gyeol!\"\n\"This much is okay before I enlist, right?\"\nWithout hesitation, I leaned in and covered his lips with mine.\nSure, talking was nice, but we could do that over the phone on the weekends.\nRight now, stealing a deep kiss was far more worthwhile!\nI smiled blissfully as we continued kissing.\nIt felt a bit scandalous to do this in his parents’ car, but at this moment...\nI just wanted to kiss him a little longer.\nAfter a brief but intense kiss, we pulled back and gazed at each other.\n“Eun-ha? I wasn’t expecting a kiss, you know.”\n“Han-gyeol, how much time do we have left?!”\n“There’s still a bit of time before the ceremony, but we should head back to my parents within 5 minutes.”\n“Then accounting for the run back, we’ve got about 3 minutes and 30 seconds left.”\n“Sounds about right...”\nEvery second felt precious.\nEven as we talked, time was ticking away.\n“Han-gyeol, I love you.”\n“I love you too.”\n“Then let’s kiss more! There’s no time! Let’s hurry!”\nMy bold declaration made the corners of his lips lift into a smile.\n“You’re the reason I’m alive, Eun-ha. Come here.”\n“Yes!”\nHe gently cupped my face and kissed me again.\nI silently prayed for the next three minutes to stretch on forever.\nKissing him... felt so perfect.\n***\nAfter sharing a short but passionate kiss, we returned to the auditorium.\nThankfully, we weren’t late, and his parents didn’t suspect a thing.\nI was a little nervous we might get caught, but everything seemed fine.\nTime moved forward, and the inevitable moment of separation drew closer.\nThrough the auditorium speakers, an announcement came, signaling that the time to say goodbye had arrived.\n- \"In a moment, recruits and their family members will be separated. Before that, recruits, please take a moment to thank and express your love to your families for the care and support they’ve given you over the past 20 years.\" Ṝ\n“It’s time to go, it seems. Mom, Dad, thank you for raising me.”\n“Yes~ Thank you for growing up so well.”\n“I love you both.”\nAs the time to part drew near, Han-gyeol first said his goodbyes to his parents.\n“And Eun-ha. Thank you for being with me. I love you.”\n“I love you too. Don’t worry about anything—I’ll wait for you.”\n“Alright~”\n- \"Recruits, please check that you have your ID and essential items. Electronic devices such as phones and chargers, valuables, cash, unauthorized medications, and tobacco products are not allowed. Any such items should be entrusted to your family. Additionally, we will be using raincoats instead of umbrellas, so please hand over any umbrellas as well.\"\n“I’ll do my best and return safely. Don’t worry too much, and take care on your way back. Eun-ha, make sure to call my parents once you get home. Tell Eunwoo Hyung and Hyun-joo Noona that I said thank you and to take care of my parents for me.”\nHis words, accompanied by a smile, made it hard to hold back my tears.\nIt was really happening now…\nI wanted to send him off with a smile, but I couldn’t find the words.\nAfraid my voice would crack and tears would spill, I simply nodded.\n- \"It is now time to separate recruits from their families. Recruits, please gather in the center of the auditorium.\"\nHan-gyeol slowly stood up from his seat, and his parents and I followed suit.\n“I’ll be going now. I’ll call on the weekend.”\n“Alright…! Take care, my son…!”\nHis mother’s eyes turned red with unshed tears.\nHan-gyeol hugged her tightly, then shared an embrace with his father.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“Go safely. Stay healthy.”\nFinally, he turned to me.\n“Eun-ha, I’m heading out.”\n“Yes…! Be careful…! Come back safely…!”\nAs soon as I spoke, tears began streaming down my face.\n“Don’t be too sad~ I’ll call you on the weekend.”\nHan-gyeol wiped away my tears and pulled me into a gentle hug.\nAs his warmth enveloped me and his hand patted my back, the tears I’d been holding back burst forth uncontrollably.\nI clenched my teeth to suppress the sobs, but it was no use.\n“I love you…”\n“I love you too…! I really do…!”\nAfter our embrace, he smiled at me one last time before descending the steps of the auditorium.\n“I’ll be back!”\n“Alright… Go safely!”\n“Yes! Eun-ha, see you when I get back!”\n“Yes…! I’ll be waiting…!”\nI couldn’t tear my eyes away from him as he walked away.\nEven as he found his place among the other recruits, he kept glancing back at me and his parents, his smile never wavering.\nI waved at him nonstop, smiling back as best I could.\nWhen all the recruits had gathered in the center of the auditorium, the enlistment ceremony began in earnest.\nHigh-ranking officials entered, the pledge of allegiance to the national flag was made, a moment of silence followed, and then came the welcoming address, introductions of the instructors, and a family encouragement speech.\nFinally, the ceremony reached its last stage.\n- \"Recruits, when the host commands, salute the guests and your families with a loud cry of ‘Victory!’ as part of your farewell gesture.\"\nAs the host spoke, Han-gyeol’s gaze, which had been fixed forward, shifted back to me.\n- \"I will now give the command. Recruits, salute your families, friends, and distinguished guests!\"\n- \"Victory!\"\nThe powerful cry of “Victory!” resonated throughout the auditorium, followed by a round of applause.\n- \"At ease! This concludes the enlistment ceremony. Families and friends, please exit the auditorium through the stairs and main doors. Training officers will guide you safely out to the corridor.\"\nThe crowd in the auditorium began to disperse.\nEven as people shuffled out, Han-gyeol’s eyes remained on me.\nWith a soft smile, he mouthed the words to me.\n“I’ll be back.”\nIt felt unbearably lonely. But for the sake of the future I wanted with him, I knew I could wait.\nI smiled as brightly as I could and mouthed my reply.\n“I love you.”\nI couldn’t be certain he caught my message, but I hoped he did.\nAnd with that, Han-gyeol began his journey in the military.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "As the families and relatives exited the auditorium, a heavy silence settled over the room.\nFrom one corner of the auditorium’s entrance, drill instructors wearing red caps briskly approached.\nThe newly enlisted soldiers, still unfamiliar with military life, hesitated, merely observing their surroundings without daring to act.\nBut it didn’t matter. Drill instructors could instill fear in recruits even in the midst of such stillness.\n“Hey… Line up and stay still. Don’t move.”\nAt the deep, commanding voice of one instructor, the recruits flinched.\nI stood upright, keeping my posture firm, but the recruit in front of me shifted his body ever so slightly.\n“You there.”\n“Y-Yes?!”\n“Step out.”The recruit in front hurriedly placed his belongings to the side and began to stand.\nIt was only a brief moment, but the instructor didn’t miss it and roared in a thunderous voice.\n“Get out here—NOW!!”\nThe instructor’s shout echoed through the auditorium, and the recruit who had become the unfortunate example quickly stepped forward.\n“Hey… Are you here to play around?”\n“No, sir…!”\n“I told you not to move just now, didn’t I? So why did you move?”\n“I’m sorry, sir…”\n“Drop down.”\nWithout hesitation, the recruit got down on the auditorium floor.\n“When I say ‘one,’ go down and focus. When I say ‘two,’ come up and get ready. One!”\n“Focus!”\n“Two.”\n“Get ready!”\n“One.”\n“Focus!”\n“Two.”\n“Get ready!”\n“Two.”\n“Focus!”\n“I said TWO! Why are you going down?! Are you not focused?!”\nThis… hasn’t changed at all over the years.\nWhile watching the scene unfold, another recruit accidentally made eye contact with the instructor.\n“You, step out too.”\n“Yes, sir…!”\nThe recruit, overwhelmed by the atmosphere, stepped forward as well.\nThe situation made me want to sigh, but I knew that even the slightest exhale could instantly make me the next “motivational example.”\nI stared straight ahead, not moving my eyes an inch.\nAfter a long session of “motivation,” we were finally instructed to move to the barracks.\n“Attention!”\n“Attention!”\n“Attention!!”\n“Attention!!!”\nIt hadn’t even been a full day, yet life already felt exhausting.\n“We’re heading to the barracks now. Line up in rows, keeping pace with the person in front and beside you. Got it?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s all you’ve got?!”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“When I call for rows and columns, you shout it back loud and clear. Got it?”\n“Yes, sir!”\nIt was raining outside, so we put on our issued raincoats and headed straight to the barracks.\nMarching in step, we arrived and immediately took in the all-too-familiar sights of the barracks.\nNeatly folded uniforms and training clothes lined the locker shelves, with mats and neatly arranged blue blankets placed underneath.\nIt truly hit me—I was in the military now.\nBut the real wake-up call? That would come tomorrow morning.\n“Now, we’re going to tell you your unit. You’re part of the 3rd Company, 3rd Platoon. Understood?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“What’s your unit?”\n“3rd Company, 3rd Platoon, sir!”\nAfter assigning us to our units, they moved on to the next step: explaining how to introduce ourselves with rank and number.\n“Next, I’ll explain how to state your rank and name. Let’s say this guy’s name is Hong Gil-dong. If a superior calls on him, he needs to state his assigned number, rank, and name. Got it? You’ll also include your platoon number in front of your assigned number. You there.”\nThe instructor pointed at me.\nI was surprised; the distance between us was considerable, and I hadn’t expected to be singled out.\n“Private 315, Lee Han-gyeol!”\n“That’s how you do it. Understood?”\n“Yes, sir!”\nAfter that, perhaps because it was still the orientation phase, we weren’t given anything too intense.\nInstead, we spent the time silently filling out forms and surveys.\nThe chaotic first night as a new recruit began. With the exception of the sleeping light, all other lights were turned off.\nAs I lay down, I could hear restless shuffling and quiet sighs, likely from others feeling uncomfortable in their new beds.\nI wanted to let out a sigh myself, but I needed to fall asleep before the others started snoring.\nI thought to myself: If only I wake up tomorrow and find out this is all just a dream… and Eun-ha is right by my side.\n****\n“Wake up, wake up! All recruits of the 2nd Battalion, wake up immediately, tidy your bedding, open the windows, and report to the assembly field by 6:10 a.m. after using the communal facilities. Wake up, wake up!”\nDream? Yeah, right. The moment I opened my eyes, all I heard was the instructor’s voice echoing through the room and the sight of my fellow recruits’ defeated faces.\nSome buried their heads in their pillows, silently screaming, while others stared out the window, letting out sighs.\nAs the thought of it’s only been one day filled my mind, I found myself staring at the ceiling and muttering:\n“We’re screwed…”\nBefore I had time to fully process the reality of being in the military, time kept ticking on.\n“I know more than 500 species of grasshoppers. O / X*”\nThis question was still here.\nWhy does this even exist?\nI half-wished for a question like, “Have you served in the military twice?”\nThough I couldn’t mark “O,” it’d at least provide some kind of twisted comfort.\nThe day passed with more surveys, physical examinations, meetings with the platoon leader, and then…\n“If you’re on the parade ground, stomp your feet—HARD!”\n“You there, step out! If you think it’s you, then ALL of you, step out!”\n“You! Didn’t I tell you to wear your mask properly? Didn’t you hear me?!”\n“EVERYONE, DROP DOWN!”\nThe instructor’s shouts and “motivational sessions” continued endlessly.\nWe spent the day dropping down, standing up, and repeating the cycle over and over.\nAs the days passed, the laughter disappeared from the faces of my fellow recruits. Instead of pop songs, they began humming military songs.\nThe restroom became the communal facility.\nPutting hands in our pockets became “hand immersion.”\nTouching anything was now called “tactile engagement.”\nAfter the evening roll call, I lay down in bed, only to have the recruit next to me strike up a conversation.\n“Man… I really wanna go home. Your name’s Han-gyeol Lee, right?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I noticed you never get called out by the instructors. Have you been through boot camp before?”\n“There’s a sad story behind that, so don’t ask.”\n“Man, I wish the weekend would come already… I wanna use my phone.”\n“Can we use our phones to make calls?”\n“Calls can only be made through the public phone. You just get to use your phone for other stuff.”\n“Ah, that’s a bummer.”\n“Well, it’s better than nothing.”\n“Yeah, you’re right. Anyway, let’s get some sleep before everyone starts snoring.”\n“Yeah. Gotta sleep while we can. Night.”\n“Good night to you too.”\nI wonder how it’ll feel to finally turn on my phone this weekend.\n****\nWeekend Phone Calls\nWe couldn’t make voice calls with the phones distributed on weekends, but for an hour, I could exchange messages with Eun-ha and read the diary entries and letters she had sent me daily.\nNot being able to hear her voice was disappointing, but the abundance of selfies she sent helped ease the longing.\nWhen the second weekend came around during Chuseok*, we were granted a special five-minute call through the communal phones.\n“Attention!”\n“Attention!”\n“Attention!!”\n“Attention!!”\nThe drill instructor had us seated in the hallway outside the phone room and began giving instructions.\n“From now on, each of you will make a phone call. The five-minute timer starts the moment I tell you to dial, not when the call connects. Got it?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“And don’t laugh too loudly or giggle. Don’t forget you’re soldiers now. Understood?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“Let me hear your voices—UNDERSTOOD?”\n“Yes, sir!!”\nMy fellow recruits, clearly excited, shouted even louder.\n“If only you spoke this loud normally. Numbers 1 through 8, head into the phone room.”\nOne by one, the recruits went into the phone room in groups of eight.\nWhen they came out after their five-minute calls, not a single one left without tears streaming down their faces.\n“Next, numbers 9 through 16, go in.”\nI entered with my group and sat down in front of a communal phone. I planned to call my parents first, leaving about 2 minutes and 30 seconds to call Eun-ha.\n“Pick up the receiver and start dialing now!”\n“Yes, sir!”\nIn unison, we picked up the phones and began making collect calls. After a few rings, there was a click, and I heard my mother’s voice.\n-“Is this my son?!”\nThe moment I heard her voice, tears welled up in my eyes. I thought I’d hold it together, but the emotions were overwhelming, and I started crying.\nMost of the others were biting their lips or stuffing their fists into their mouths, struggling to keep their calls going.\nI hadn’t meant to worry her, but all the pent-up sadness hit me at once.\nThrough trembling lips, I managed to respond.\n“Yes… It’s me!”\n-“Honey! It’s our son! He’s calling!”\n-“Really? Let me talk to him! Son! How are you holding up?!”\n“I’m doing fine…! Sniff…!”\nThe conversation didn’t flow well at first, but gradually, I calmed down and continued talking with my parents for about two minutes.\n-“You should call Eun-ha too! She must be waiting desperately!”\n“Yes. Did she make it home safely that day?”\n-“Oh, she cried so much in the car. Go call her now!”\n“Yes, I will. I’ll call you again later! Have a wonderful Chuseok!”\nAfter ending the call with my parents, I steadied myself and dialed Eun-ha. My heart pounded as the phone rang, and then I heard her voice.\n-“Han-gyeol?! Is it you?!”\n“Yes, it’s me. What were you doing?”\n-“Thinking about you, of course! How are you? Are the meals okay? Are you sleeping well? Are you hurt anywhere? How long can we talk?!”\n“I think I have a little over two minutes left. Are you doing well?”\n-“Yes…! I’m doing fine… What about you? Are you really okay?”\nHer voice quivered, and it was clear she had started crying as soon as she heard me.\n“I’m fine, really. I’m eating well and sleeping fine.”\nHearing her voice felt like all the hardships of the past week were being washed away.\n-“Really?! You’re not lying, are you?”\n“Of course not. What have you been up to?”\n-“I’ve been going to college like you told me, working on lots of assignments, and doing well…! Don’t worry about me!”\n“Eun-ha, are you crying right now?”\n-“N-No, I’m not…!”\n“You sound like you’re crying~”\nWhen I teased Eun-ha, Eunwoo Hyung’s voice suddenly came through the receiver.\n-“Han-gyeol-ah! She’s totally bawling right now~”\n-“Oppa, get out! I’m on the phone with Han-gyeol!”\n-“I’m also on the phone with Han-gyeol~”\n-“Seriously, you’re the worst!”\nIt seemed she was back at her family’s house for Chuseok.\n“Are you at home?”\n-“Yeah…! I came home for Chuseok. My brother and mom both wanted to hear your voice too—”\n-“Han-gyeol, are you okay? Are you eating and sleeping well?”\nThis time, it was her mom’s voice.\n“Yes, I’m doing well, ma’am.”\n-“Eun-ha, we’ll leave you to talk. Just for a little bit, okay?”\n-“Thanks, Mom!”\nFor the first time since enlisting, a smile crossed my face.\n-“Han-gyeol!”\n“Yes, Eun-ha?”\n-“Hehe… Hearing your voice makes me so happy.”\n“You weren’t just crying, were you?”\n-“It’s all because of Eunwoo Oppa… Anyway! Did you already call your mom?”\n“Yes, I talked to her just before calling you. How was your trip back home that day?”\n-“It was fine! I got back safely!”\n“They said you cried a lot on the way home~”\n-“Ugh… I couldn’t help it, okay…! I miss you, Gyeol!”\n“I miss you too.”\n-“Really?! I’ll send you more pictures! And more letters!”\n“Don’t overdo it. I’m just glad to hear you’re doing well.”\nAs we continued talking, the instructor’s voice cut in from behind.\n“One minute left!”\nFeeling the urgency, I quickly spoke to Eun-ha.\n“Eun-ha, they said there’s one minute left. I’m doing fine, so don’t worry about me. Thank you so much for all the pictures, letters, and diary entries you’ve sent. I’m so happy to hear you’re okay. Just hold on for three more weeks until the graduation ceremony.”\n-“Okay, I’ll see you at the ceremony! I’m so thankful for all your messages, and I’m so glad you’re staying healthy…! Han-gyeol, I love you! You know I love you so much, right?!”\n“I know… I love you too.”\nI lowered my voice, embarrassed in front of my fellow recruits and the instructor.\n“I love you.”\nJust as I said it, the instructor’s voice boomed again.\n“Ten seconds left! Wrap up your calls!”\nI hurried to say my last words.\n“Eun-ha, I have to go now. Eat well and take care of yourself! I’ll call you again next week!”\n-“Okay! I love you! I love you more than anything in the world! I’ll write you even more letters—love you!”\n“I love you too. Goodbye for now.”\n-“Bye!”\nI gently placed the receiver back on its cradle.\nI never thought five minutes could feel so short.\nLike the others, I left the phone room with red, teary eyes.\nI miss her so much, it’s unbearable.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: ‘I know more than 500 species of grasshoppers.

      "content": "A new year has arrived, and January is here.\nBoth Han-gyeol and I have turned 21, and it has already been five months since Han-gyeol enlisted in the military.\nThanks to his excellent grades at the training center and specialty school, Han-gyeol was assigned to a unit in Seoul.\nI can still vividly recall the excitement in Han-gyeol’s voice when he called to tell me the news after his assignment was confirmed.\nAt first, it was challenging, but we’ve gradually adapted to our current life.\nAs promised before his enlistment, I visit Han-gyeol at least once every two weeks.\nSimilarly, Han-gyeol has kept his promise to call me daily, sharing an hour of his day as we chat about everything and anything.\nWe’re maintaining our relationship beautifully, without feeling burdened by obligations.\nThere are moments of longing, but no feelings of disappointment, and I love how balanced and fulfilling our relationship is.\nToday is the day Han-gyeol gets a leave of absence, so I woke up early in the morning.Even though he tells me not to go overboard preparing a feast for his visits, I can’t help but want to.\nWhen I ask what he’d like to eat, he always requests simple dishes, so today, I decided to make what I wanted to cook.\nI prepared a pot of braised pork ribs and also set aside some salmon for dinner.\nSince I left early, it’s almost time for Han-gyeol to arrive.\nEven though we see each other every two weeks, those two weeks feel unbearably long, making our meetings even more precious.\nBefore long, I heard the sound of the door lock turning, and the door started to open.\nHowever, it stopped partway with a clink.\n“Eun-ha, I’m here! Can you unlock the door for me?”\n“Oh, right! The safety latch. Hold on a second!”\nI unlatched the safety lock that Han-gyeol had installed during his last leave.\nAs the door opened, Han-gyeol walked in with a bright smile.\n“I missed you so much~”\nThe moment he saw me, Han-gyeol hugged me tightly and wouldn’t let go.\n“I missed you too~”\nEver since he enlisted, every time we meet, Han-gyeol greets me with a tight hug.\nThis time, he held me even more firmly than before, making my heart race.\n“How have you been?”\n“I’ve been great! How about you, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m doing really well. Have you eaten yet?”\n“I waited so I could eat with you. Unless you’d rather I eat first?”\n“Your jokes keep getting bolder every time I’m on leave~”\n“That’s just how much I’ve missed you!”\nI rubbed my face against his chest playfully.\n“Let’s eat already. You didn’t prepare a full feast again, did you?”\n“What? No way! I just made braised pork ribs.”\n“That’s so much work! I told you not to overdo it.”\n“I just want to feed you delicious food~”\n“Alright, alright. It smells amazing!”\n“Hehe. Go change your clothes first.”\n“Sure, just a minute.”\nHan-gyeol kicked off his large military boots and stepped inside.\nHe took off his uniform and placed his dog tags on the table.\nWhen he removed his inner shirt, I caught a glimpse of his abs.\nThey seemed even more defined than last time… so sexy.\n“Han-gyeol, do you work out a lot in the military?”\n“Huh? Oh, yeah. I work out daily with my senior. Why?”\n“…Your muscles look bigger compared to your last leave.”\n“Really? Looks like it’s paying off!”\n“Can I touch them?”\n“That’s embarrassing…”\n“I want to feel them!”\nI dashed into the room without hesitation.\n“I haven’t even finished changing.”\n“It’s fine. Take your time!”\nWhen I pressed my fingers against his arm, they barely sank into the firm muscles.\n“Wow, so solid…”\n“Eun-ha, this is really embarrassing.”\n“Are you overdoing it with the workouts in the military? Don’t push yourself too hard and get injured.”\n“Don’t worry~ I only work out during physical training. It’s not like I’ve gained that much muscle.”\n“You even seem a bit taller!”\n“That’d be nice. Now, let me finish changing, okay?”\n“Okay, okay. I’ll serve the food, so hurry up!”\n“Got it~”\nAfter admiring Han-gyeol’s physique, I returned to the kitchen.\nAs I scooped rice into bowls, my face felt warm.\nMuscular Han-gyeol… He’s so sexy, I think his image will linger in my mind for a while.\nTonight… hehe… just thinking about it makes me happy.\nI couldn’t stop smiling.\n“Eun-ha, I’m done changing.”\n“Ah! Oh, okay! Let’s eat quickly.”\n“What were you thinking about? You’re grinning like crazy.”\n“Nothing at all! Let’s just eat! Since you’re working out, eat a lot!”\n“Thanks. I’ll enjoy the meal!”\nWatching Han-gyeol enjoy his food made me fall in love with him all over again.\n“Is anything at the base bothering you these days?”\n“Clearing snow on snowy days is a bit annoying, but that’s about it.”\n“How about your seniors? Are they treating you well?”\n“They’re not overly kind, but they don’t pick on me for no reason either.”\n“You’re getting promoted to Corporal in May, right?”\n“Yeah. Wonder when I’ll make Sergeant~”\n“Have any new recruits joined?”\n“Yep. We’re all getting along pretty well. My peers are really nice too.”\n“What about the new recruits?”\n“They’re kind. One of them is two years older than me, but he’s still very respectful.”\n“That’s a relief.”\n“Are you still worried about me, Eun-ha?”\nHan-gyeol looked into my eyes as he asked.\n“A little~”\n“Don’t worry about me~ I’m doing fine.”\n“Okay! Oh, sorry for distracting you with questions. Eat up.”\n“Alright. You too, Eun-ha.”\nAfter breakfast, Han-gyeol cleaned up.\nI tried to help, but he kept picking me up and tossing me onto the bed, so I just watched his back as he worked.\nAt first, I was so worried about Han-gyeol being in the military, but now, I’ve gotten somewhat used to it.\nI miss him and long for him, but my emotions don’t swing wildly anymore.\n“What are you doing today, Eun-ha?”\n“I have to attend my winter semester class later.”\n“What about after that? Any plans?”\n“I’ll probably work on editing until dinner.”\n“Oh, you mean that editing job you mentioned before?”\nI’ve been working a part-time editing job with a senior from my department.\nAt first, I started it to fill the time without Han-gyeol, but it turned out to be both educational and surprisingly lucrative.\n“Yeah, if I work late, I’ll probably finish by six.”\n“Got it. Then I’ll head to campus to study and have lunch with you. Is that okay?”\n“Huh?! It’s your leave. Are you sure you’re okay studying?”\n“It’s something I do every day anyway~”\nEven in the military, Han-gyeol spends his time diligently.\nHonestly, he seems more dedicated to making good use of his time than I am.\n“Do you have plans today, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’m meeting Yujin. They said their schedule is flexible, so I’ll see them in the afternoon. Let’s have dinner together, though.”\n“Okay! What time will you be back?”\n“By six-thirty at the latest.”\n“Alright~”\n“Don’t prepare dinner in advance, okay? Let’s cook together.”\n“Sure~ I only have plans today. Starting tomorrow, let’s go on a date.”\n“Sounds perfect~”\n“I think so too!”\nWe’ve been spending time together while being mindful of each other’s needs.\nI think it was a really good decision to agree not to feel obligated to each other before his enlistment.\nBy respecting and understanding each other’s lives, we haven’t had a single argument.\n“Shouldn’t we get going? I’ll walk you there.”\n“Yeah!”\nHan-gyeol walked me to my class for the winter semester.\nAs we held hands tightly, my heart pounded wildly.\nSince we don’t have physical contact every day, these moments make me so nervous.\nStill, having Han-gyeol by my side every day would be the best.\n“Eun-ha, is there anything you want to eat? I’ll make it for you tomorrow.”\n“Then… I’d like to have your kimchi stew!”\n“Sure~ After we eat, let’s go watch a movie.”\n“Yeah! Should I book the tickets?”\n“I’ll do it since I get a military discount.”\n“Wow, you’re so frugal~”\n“Right?”\nSeeing Han-gyeol’s bright smile made me so happy.\nI couldn’t help but squeeze his hand even tighter.\n“This feels so nice! It’s been a while since I’ve gone to campus with you.”\n“Same here.”\nMatching my grip, Han-gyeol held my hand tightly as well.\n“What’s the first thing you want to do when you’re discharged?”\n“Hm~ Is it okay to think about that already?”\n“It’s just for fun~”\n“No matter how much I think about it, all I want to do is spend time with you. Just living with you again, like before I enlisted, feels like it would be enough.”\nEven though I hear his voice every day, there’s nothing better than listening to it face-to-face like this.\nWhen I look at his excited expression, his emotions reach me even more deeply.\n“Han-gyeol, you really like me, don’t you?”\n“Should I tone it down?”\n“No! Feel free to like me even more. I’m growing fonder of you, too!”\n“Even if you didn’t say that, I’m already liking you more and more.”\n“Me too! I feel even closer to you!”\nEven though Han-gyeol isn’t always physically by my side, I don’t feel lonely.\nIn high school, I used to think I needed to be with him every moment, but now, it doesn’t seem necessary.\nSome might think that this means our love has faded, but that’s not true at all.\nNow, even without words or constant proximity, I know how deeply we care for each other.\nNo matter where I am or what I’m doing, I’m certain of Han-gyeol’s love for me.\nAnd I’m sure he knows just as clearly that I’ll always love him.\nWithout saying it out loud, we understand each other’s hearts and cherish one another.\nWe’ve gone beyond simply sharing our lives—we’ve become each other’s lives.\nI feel like I’ve matured compared to my high school days.\nAnd because I’ve grown up…!\n“Han-gyeol!”\n“Yeah? What’s up?”\n“Hehe~ Let’s stay up late tonight!”\n“Guess I’ll have to skip the morning movie~”\n“Exactly! I’m going to keep you up really late~”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Eun-ha was beaming with excitement at the rare chance for a movie theater date, her face lit up with a radiant smile. Holding a tub of popcorn close to her chest, she grinned so brightly that just looking at her made me happy too.\nMoments like these were impossible to experience back in the military, so I was determined to savor it to the fullest.\nI already dreaded going back.\n“Eun-ha, you’re super excited, huh? Is going to the theater really that fun?”\n“Of course! We didn’t get to hangout properly yesterday~. It’s been so long since I’ve been to the movies with Han-gyeol, so I’m really happy. Han-gyeol, are you happy too?”\n“I am. Now, let’s head up one more floor to the screening room.”\n“Okay, okay! Let’s go!”\nWe took the escalator up one more floor, Eun-ha standing a step ahead of me. She suddenly turned around and popped a piece of popcorn into my mouth.\n“Han-gyeol, say ‘Ah~.’”\n“Ah~.”“Is it good?”\n“Yeah, it’s delicious.”\n“Then I’ll give you more.”\nShe kept feeding me piece after piece until, by the time we reached the screening room, my cheeks were puffed out like a chipmunk’s.\nSeeing this, Eun-ha giggled brightly.\n“Han-gyeol, you look like a squirrel with your cheeks all stuffed!”\nI swallowed all the popcorn in my mouth and took a sip of my drink. Then, it was my turn. I offered her a piece of popcorn, but Eun-ha kept her lips tightly shut, refusing to eat.\nWhen I playfully tapped her lips with the popcorn, she finally laughed and took a bite.\n“My tint’s going to smudge!”\n“But it’s tasty, right?”\n“Yeah, it’s been so long since I’ve had this. Give me more.”\n“Nope. The movie hasn’t even started yet, and half the popcorn is already gone.”\nI showed her the half-empty tub, and she looked up at me, pouting.\n“You’re so stingy, Han-gyeol. You’re the one eating it all!”\n“You’re the one who kept feeding me!”\n“Fine, then let’s finish this quickly and lift the armrest. I want to link arms while we watch.”\n“No way. I want to eat popcorn while watching the movie.”\n“You’ve eaten plenty~. Hand it over. I’ll finish it.”\nEun-ha reached out for the popcorn, but I quickly pulled it out of her reach.\n“I told you, you kept feeding me, so no.”\n“Huh? You’re really not going to share?”\n“Nope. Not a chance—”\n“Hey!”\nBefore I could finish my sentence, Eun-ha lunged for the popcorn, but her short arms couldn’t reach it.\n“Nice try, but no chance~.”\n“If I snatch it, it’s all mine!”\n“Go ahead and try.”\nEun-ha stretched and wiggled her arms in an attempt to grab the tub, but she couldn’t manage. Our playful tug-of-war ended with a compromise: we raised the armrest, and I kept the popcorn.\nAs soon as the armrest was lifted, Eun-ha hooked her arm around mine and rested her head on my shoulder.\n“Han-gyeol, is this uncomfortable for you?”\n“Not at all. Actually, I like it better being close like this.”\n“Hehe, I like it too. If I tap your arm, feed me popcorn, okay?”\n“Got it. The movie’s about to start. Did you turn off your phone?”\n“Of course~. If your arm gets heavy, let me know.”\n“Sure thing. Let’s enjoy the movie”\n“Don’t just look at the screen, okay?”\n“You don’t just look at me, either~.”\n“Hehe, okay. Oh, it’s starting!”\nThe theater lights dimmed, and the movie began. Since this was a film Eun-ha had been excited to see, we both focused on the screen at first.\nEvery now and then, when she tapped my arm, I’d pop a piece of popcorn into her mouth. Watching her silently take the popcorn without a word was adorable—she reminded me of a chipmunk scurrying around the base.\nAbout halfway through the movie, Eun-ha tapped my arm again. I reached for a piece of popcorn, but an amusing idea struck me: what if I didn’t feed her?\nCurious about her reaction, I ignored her signal and kept my eyes glued to the screen.\nI could feel her shift slightly, her head lifting off my shoulder. She stared at me intently, her lips pressed together as if to stifle a laugh.\nThen, she began poking my arm repeatedly, almost like tapping out a Morse code message.\nUnable to resist her persistence, I finally gave in and fed her the popcorn. Watching her cheeks puff up as she chewed made me want to grab her face and shake it out of pure affection.\nBeing with Eun-ha always brought out this playful, childish side of me—something I didn’t even know I had.\nBy the middle of the movie, I found myself watching Eun-ha’s face more than the screen. When the credits finally rolled, we exited the theater together.\n“That was such a fun movie, wasn’t it?” Eun-ha chirped.\n“The movie was great, but watching you eat popcorn was even better.”\n“Oh, right! In the middle, when you stopped feeding me, I thought you’d fallen asleep!”\n“I was curious about how you’d react if I didn’t give you any.”\n“What? Seriously? And? Were you satisfied with my reaction?”\n“Totally.”\n“Well, as long as you enjoyed it~. Now, let’s grab some food!”\n“What do you feel like eating?”\nEun-ha glanced around the area before confidently declaring, “I feel like eating… you.”\nCaught off guard, I blinked at her. “Then let’s look up a good restaurant nearby and head there.”\nEun-ha stared at me intently, a mischievous glint in her eyes.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“I think you misunderstood me, Han-gyeol.”\n“You meant you want to eat wherever I want to go—oh!”\n“Yup! What you’re thinking now is correct. I want to eat you.”\n“Are you a predator?”\n“Rawr!”\nI should’ve noticed when she was glancing around earlier.\nStill, I felt the same way she did.\n“Well then, let’s go quickly.”\n“Alright~!”\nEven though Eun-ha claimed she’d devour me, tonight I was the one who planned to take charge.\n****\nWhen we got home, I wasted no time fulfilling her bold declaration.\nAfter a passionate and fiery moment together, Eun-ha lay under the covers, pulling the blanket up to her chin as she gazed straight into my eyes.\n“Han-gyeol… you pervert…!”\n“Unfair! You were the one who said you wanted to eat me first.”\n“You’ve gotten… intense… since you started working out!”\n“Was it too much?”\nI had put in a bit more effort than usual. Worried that I might’ve overdone it, I hesitated, but Eun-ha softly mumbled under her breath:\n“It was… good…”\n“What? Really? Here I was, worrying for nothing.”\n“Even an intense Han-gyeol feels good…! You kept saying your muscles weren’t growing, but that was a total lie…! You were so... intense...”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment~.”\n“Hold me already.”\n“Come here.”\nEun-ha snuggled into my arms, burying herself against me.\n“Are your muscles bigger because of your workouts?”\nShe poked at my chest and stomach with her finger, her curiosity seemingly endless.\n“Eun-ha, you’re going to poke a hole in me.”\n“It’s just so fascinating! You’re so firm.”\n“That’s because I’m flexing right now.”\n“Oh, really? Let’s see—relax for a moment!”\n“No way. I’ll get all squishy.”\n“Just once~! Please?”\nHer playful whining made me chuckle, and for a moment, I let my guard down. She took that opportunity to jab her finger into my stomach, her fingertip sinking slightly into the soft flesh. Her eyes sparkled with delight as she laughed.\n“Hehe.”\n“Is this that fun for you?”\n“Touching Han-gyeol’s body is the best~. I want to do it every day.”\n“I’ll let you touch me as much as you want next year, so hang in there until then.”\n“You better keep that promise! I’m going to poke and prod you all the time.”\n“Can I take it back now?”\n“Too late~.”\nEun-ha smiled brightly and leaned in to plant a kiss on my cheek.\n“Han-gyeol, aren’t you hungry?”\n“I am, but I’m too drained to cook after all that effort.”\n“Same here. Should we order delivery?”\n“Sounds good. What do you feel like eating?”\n“Hm… raw beef tartare!”\n“You really are a predator, huh?”\n“I’m always a predator when it comes to you, Han-gyeol~. Oh, I should get dressed first. Turn around.”\n“Can’t I peek?”\n“You can sneak a glance~.”\nEun-ha carefully got out of bed and started putting on some clothes. She slipped into a white shirt, which looked comically oversized on her.\nWait a second—that’s my shirt.\n“Han-gyeo, look at this~! Your shirt is huge! Look how the sleeves just hang down—don’t I look like one of those balloon figures they have at events?”\nEun-ha twirled her sleeves playfully, spinning them in little circles with a bright smile on her face. She looked unbelievably adorable and yet... strangely seductive at the same time.\nHow could she make something as simple as wearing my shirt look so alluring?\n“Eun-ha, come here. Right now.”\n“Huh? Why? Why are you calling me~?”\nShe tiptoed toward me, her every step brimming with innocence. The moment she was within reach, I grabbed her and pulled her into my arms.\n“Ah—!”\nI hugged her tightly, causing her to fall onto the bed, giggling.\n“Why, Han-gyeol? Didn’t you already get enough of me earlier?”\n“I’m just wondering—was my shirt always this provocative? Did you do this on purpose?”\n“I thought you’d like it, so I tried it on. Looks like I was right~.”\n“You were. To be honest, you look incredibly sexy in it.”\n“Really? I like wearing your shirt too. It smells just like you. It makes me feel happy.”\nEun-ha brought the fabric of my shirt up to her nose, taking in its scent. I couldn’t help myself—I slipped my hand under the shirt.\n“Eun-ha, are you really hungry right now?”\n“If I say I’m starving, will you stop?”\n“I can try...”\nEun-ha broke into a mischievous smile and leaned in, pressing her lips against mine.\n“What about now? If I kiss you like this, will you stop? Will you?”\nShe started peppering my face with kisses, one after another.\n“Nope. Pretty sure I can’t stop now.”\n“Well... I am a little hungry, but...”\n“Then let’s order food firs—”\n“No, no, no. You’re hungrier. So—”\nEun-ha smiled shyly, her cheeks flushed, as she looked up at me.\n“—This time, I want to devour you. Is that okay?”\n“Go ahead. Devour me all you want.”\n“Hehe. Thank you for the meal~.”\nWith those words, she leaned in and claimed my lips again.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Life in the military has become something I’ve grown used to.\nThough, to be honest, it’s less about adapting to military life and more about accepting the fact that I’ve enlisted for the second time.\nI was working on the daily tasks assigned to the support team when the phone rang.\nSince my junior colleague had gone to handle delivery duties, I picked up the call.\n“Communications security. Corporal Han-gyeol from the support team speaking.”\n“Hey, it’s Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk from the communications squad.”\n“Jung Dong-hyuk .”\n“Han-gyeol, did you make corporal?”\n“Yes, I got promoted last Friday.”\n“Oh~ So you’re discharging this year?”I couldn’t help but feel a faint twitch under my eye.\nWell, they say the true beginning of one’s time in the Air Force starts at sergeant, so it’s not entirely wrong.\n“Unfortunately, I still have over a year left. What’s the reason for your call?”\n“I need you to approve my leave request. I’ve got to apply for TMO today.”\n“Understood. I’ll take care of it right away.”\n“Thanks~ See you later in the supply room.”\n“Yes, Jung Dong-hyuk .”\nAs I hung up the phone, Master Sergeant Han, who oversees personnel, spoke to me.\n“Who asked for leave approval?”\n“Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk from the communications squad. He needed it approved for his TMO application. I’ll log in and approve it right away.”\n“Alright. Oh, by the way, when are they giving out the travel allowances? End of June?”\n“According to Staff Sergeant Lee, it’ll be distributed in early June.”\n“Got it.”\nThough I enlisted as a financial soldier, I’m practically doing administrative work.\nAfter all, no one would entrust a unit’s finances entirely to a private, so my workload is relatively light.\nAt that moment, my junior, who is the actual administrative soldier, returned from his delivery task.\n“I’m back. Did I miss any calls?”\n“Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk called to ask for leave approval.”\n“I’ll distribute the packages I just picked up, then take care of the approval myself.”\n“It’s fine. I’ve already done it. By the way, did any of my packages arrive?”\n“Did you order a reference book? A heavy one came in.”\n“Ah, yes. Set it aside for me.”\n“Understood.”\nI processed the leave approval mentioned by Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk while my junior made calls to other departments to notify them of their packages.\nOnce the delivery tasks were wrapped up, it was time for lunch.\nThe officers headed to the cafeteria first, and my junior and I followed soon after.\n“Corporal Han-gyeol, are you not taking the tax accountant exam this year?”\n“No, I plan to take it next year.”\n“But you study every evening, even on weekends. Wouldn’t it be better to attempt it now?”\n“The registration period has already passed. You should also work on getting some certifications while in the military.”\n“I’ll try my best.”\n“What’s for lunch today?”\n“Oxtail soup with spicy squid salad.”\nOh, not bad.\n“Do you want seconds?”\n“That was my plan from the start. I’m heading to the base exchange after lunch. Do you need anything?”\n“No, I’ll come with you.”\n“Alright, sounds good.”\n****\nAfter the morning and afternoon duties, it was time for physical training.\nI grabbed the straps I had prepared and headed to the gym, where Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk greeted me.\nWe’d been working out together in the gym since my private first class days.\n“What’s the plan for today?”\n“Today’s back day for me. Aren’t you doing upper body today?”\n“Yeah. Later, help me out with the bench press. I’m planning to add 5KG plates on each side. If I yell for help, you better save me.”\n“Do you trust me?”\nSergeant Jung’s pupils widened at my joke.\n“I’ve been treating you so damn well…”\n“It’s a joke. Are we starting with the bench press right away?”\n“Of course. Just don’t let me die, okay?”\n“I won’t let you. Go ahead.”\nAfter loading plates onto both sides of the barbell, I helped him through his workout.\nAround the eighth rep, his arms began to tremble.\n“Grrr…!”\nI quickly grabbed the bar with one hand to assist him.\n“Just push through two more reps. I’ve got you. One… two…”\nWith a clatter, the barbell was racked, and Sergeant Jung Dong-hyuk sat up, breathing heavily.\n“That’s it. Let’s take off the 5KG plates.”\n“When I was a private, you said removing weights mid-set was something only weaklings do.”\n“Sh*t… I have no comeback for that. Are you turning into a total gym rat?”\n“It’s all thanks to you, Sergeant.”\n“You’ve rested enough. Get back on the bench.”\n“This little…!”\nAfter Sergeant Jung finished his bench press, he helped me with my workout.\nI loaded plates onto both sides of the barbell, braced my core, and lifted.\n“Hoo-!”\n“Good…! Tighten your back more!”\nAfter completing two sets, I lowered the barbell and sat down, but Sergeant Jung brought over two more plates.\n“You need to load up more weight too.”\n“Ah… this is already my limit. If I add more, I’m going to black out.”\n“If that happens, I’ll catch you in the most epic way possible. Now lift.”\n“I trust you, Sergeant Jung.”\n“You trust me?”\nHe twisted my words like that. What a sly guy.\n“Actually, let’s leave the heavier weights for later…”\n“Okay, fine. I’m joking. Want me to load the plates?”\n“Thank you.”\nIn the end, I added one more plate to each side and began deadlifts.\nI managed to lift the barbell but couldn’t reach my usual number of reps.\nAs my strength started to drain and I considered giving up, Sergeant Jung shouted:\n“Keep going! More! You can do it!”\n“Grrr…!”\n“Think of your parents, who raised you! Imagine this weight is their burden and lift it!”\nThis guy is unbelievable…\nI’m dying here…!\n“Don’t you want to show your girlfriend those gains?”\nI do want to show her, but…!\n“Then lift it!”\n“Raaah…!”\n“Good! Just a little more—straighten your legs! Let’s go!”\nThinking of my parents and Eun-ha, I mustered the strength to lift the barbell fully.\nThen I set it down and collapsed onto the floor.\n“Han-gyeol, that was badass…”\n“…I thought I was going to die.”\n“There are still two sets left. Get up!”\n“It hasn’t even been a minute…”\n“Get up. Today, I’m wrecking your back.”\nGod, this is so exhausting.\n****\nAt six o’clock, I returned to the barracks and retrieved my phone.\nThe first thing I always do after turning it on is call Eun-ha.\nAfter a few rings, her voice came through the line.\n-“Hello~”\n“Hey. Have you eaten yet?”\n-“Not yet…! I’ve got assignments to finish, so I’ll eat later. Is it okay if we talk from 8:30 to 9:30 today? I’ll be working on my assignment and then eating with my friends in a bit.”\n“Sure, no problem. Call me then, okay?”\n-“Yup, I will. See you later~”\n“Alright~”\nThis is how it always goes with Eun-ha—we decide when to talk, and then I get on with my tasks.\nI pulled out my tablet and books from my locker and went to study.\nWith the first round of the tax accountant exam coming up next year, I made sure to study a little every day.\nIn the unit, there were others like me preparing for professional certifications, and some were even studying for college entrance exams.\nI quietly settled in my spot and started studying.\nI was deep into my lecture when my phone rang—it was Eun-ha.\nI stepped into the hallway to answer the call.\n-“Han-gyeol~ I just got home! Were you studying?”\n“Yeah, I think I’ve finished today’s portion. What about you? How was your day?”\n-“I wish I had something fun to share, but it’s the same as yesterday. Assignments are killing me. There’s so much more now that I’m in my second year.”\n“Isn’t the college festival coming up soon?”\n-“Yeah, I’m helping out here and there. I wish you could come out on leave so we could enjoy it together. It’s such a shame.”\n“Yeah, unfortunately, it overlaps with my training period, so I can’t take leave.”\n-“This year’s festival host is the same one from last year!”\n“Just don’t end up volunteering again and getting dragged to the front!”\nAt my teasing, Eun-ha’s laughter bubbled through the phone.\n-“Should I go up and declare in front of everyone that I’m dating you?”\n“Don’t you dare. I want to quietly blend in when I return to campus.”\n-“Hehe. Got it. Oh—so, how does it feel to be a corporal now? Any changes?”\n“Not really. The only difference is that I’ve got three stripes on my badge now.”\n-“I want to see you as Corporal Han-gyeol soon~!”\n“I’ll be on leave early next month. You can see me then.”\nThese moments, talking to Eun-ha at the end of the hallway, were the highlight of my day.\nI couldn’t wait to be discharged so I could spend my days with her, enjoying campus life together. But for now, that day seemed far away.\n-“No! I’m visiting this weekend!”\n“You came two weeks ago! Isn’t coming so often tiring?”\n-“No way! Just the thought of going to see you makes me excited. I’m not tired at all, really!”\n“Thanks for saying that. Are you coming Saturday?”\n-“Yup! Do you want me to bring anything? I can pack something for you!”\n“Just you coming is enough.”\n-“Hehe. Got it!”\nEven though I couldn’t always be with Eun-ha, I didn’t feel lonely.\nEvery day, she shared her life with me and asked about mine.\nEven when there wasn’t anything special to talk about, she would listen to my routine like it was the first time hearing it and respond with genuine enthusiasm.\nAnd for my sake, Eun-ha always told me every detail of her day, no matter how small.\n“Eun-ha.”\n-“Yeah, what is it, Han-gyeol?”\nI glanced around and lowered my voice.\n“I love you.”\n-“Hehe~ Are you sure no one’s around?”\n“I checked before saying it~”\n-“I love you too, Han-gyeol. So, so much. My face is totally red right now.”\n“Now I want to see it. Send me a picture.”\n-“Okay, wait a sec~”\nA few moments later, I received a message from Eun-ha.\nHer bright smile lit up the photo, and her cheeks were just slightly flushed.\n“You’re beautiful.”\n-“What?”\n“I said, you’re so beautiful it’s killing me~”\nAh, I really can’t wait to get discharged.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Hello everyone!

      "content": "With about three weeks left until Han-gyeol’s discharge, tomorrow marks the day of his final leave before completing his military service.\nLooking back now, it feels like the time flew by without me even realizing it, as if I wasn’t really counting down the days. Maybe because I didn’t feel obligated to, or perhaps because both of us stayed so busy?\nI spent my days juggling college and work, staying occupied to the point of exhaustion. Perhaps I was trying to live too diligently.\nThe editing work I took on to distract myself from missing Han-gyeol ended up being quite profitable. I had saved enough money to buy a decent second-hand car.\nStaying home most of the time—since I’m naturally a homebody—meant my expenses were minimal, especially with Han-gyeol not around.\nShould I just buy him a car and propose on the spot? Hmm... no, that might be a bit too overwhelming. Let’s skip that.\nMaybe I’ll buy him a new computer since he loves them. But then again, he’d probably get better value for money if he picked it out himself.\nFor now, maybe I’ll just save the money for our wedding in the future. Still, I really want to get him a discharge gift… but what?\n***\n“Eun-ha, what are you thinking so hard about?”“Huh? Oh, I’m just deciding on a discharge gift for my boyfriend,” I replied, looking up at Jiyoung, who was sitting with me in the project room.\n“Why not go with something simple, like a wallet?” she suggested.\n“I’ve already given him one before, so I’d rather not repeat that. Hey, Jiyoung, can I ask you something?”\n“Sure, what is it?”\n“What do you think about getting him a car as a discharge gift?”\n“Too much. Don’t even think about it,” she said firmly.\n“Yeah… I figured as much,” I muttered, deflated.\nEven after asking Jiyoung, I still couldn’t come up with anything.\n“Still, Eun-ha, your boyfriend is about to be discharged, huh? Time flies, doesn’t it?”\n“Hmm? Not really. Waiting wasn’t that hard for me. I’m sure it was much tougher on Han-gyeol.”\n“That’s so like you to say. Are you happy he’s getting discharged?”\n“Of course! Now we can spend every day together again!” I exclaimed with a grin.\nHan-gyeol’s discharge meant the start of us living together again. From the next semester, we’d even be attending the same college.\n“But Eun-ha, you only have one semester left, right? Why not graduate early?”\n“Ugh—about that…” I trailed off.\nOver the past year and nine months, I’d taken every class I could, including intensive courses during every break. Technically, I could fulfill my graduation requirements by taking just a few more classes next semester.\nBut I wanted to spend an extra year at college with Han-gyeol.\n“Spending another year in school with your boyfriend sounds nice, but wouldn’t it also be good to graduate early and start working?” Jiyoung pointed out.\n“Yeah… but if I graduate early, I’ll only have one semester with Han-gyeol, and I want more time with him.”\n“Fair enough. It’s up to you,” she said with a shrug. “Don’t stress too much about it.”\n“Thanks for understanding,” I said warmly.\nAs we continued chatting, Yoori walked into the project room, her face clouded with gloom.\n“I’m here…” she muttered, dragging her feet.\n“What took you so long?” Jiyoung asked.\n“I was having dinner with my boyfriend,” Yoori replied as she flopped onto the sofa.\n“Then why do you look so down? Did you guys fight?”\n“My boyfriend just told me he’s enlisting next semester,” Yoori groaned.\n“Ah—” Jiyoung and I both exclaimed in sympathy.\nIt seemed Yoori was about to take on the role of a military girlfriend, a baton I had just carried.\n“Eun-ha,” Yoor called out.\n“Y-Yeah?”\n“Give me some tips…!” she pleaded desperately.\n“Tips? Uh… do I even have any? Haha…” I laughed awkwardly.\nYoori suddenly sat up straight and poured out her frustration.\n“My boyfriend is enlisting right after finishing his second try at college exams! Why couldn’t he wait a little longer?”\n“One military girlfriend retires, and another one steps up,” Jiyoung remarked with a wry smile.\n“Wait, is your boyfriend getting discharged soon, Eun-ha?” Yoori asked.\n“Um… should I even say that here?” I hesitated.\n“It’s fine! Happy news deserves celebration,” Yoori said earnestly.\n“Okay then. He’s getting discharged next month. Time really flew! Even though Han-gyeol served three extra months in the Air Force, I managed just fine. You’ll do great too, Yoori.”\n“Thanks for the encouragement,” she said, looking a little brighter. “But wasn’t it hard for you?”\n“Sure, there were tough days. But if you both care for each other, it’s manageable.”\nI smiled warmly, thinking back on the journey.\nIt wasn’t a short time by any means. There were moments when I missed Han-gyeol terribly. But I knew he felt the same way, which made it bearable.\n“Still, I wouldn’t want to go through it again,” I added with a laugh.\nOnce he’s discharged, I’m not letting him out of my sight!\n****\nDing-Dong! The doorbell rang early in the morning.\nI quickly turned off the stove and rushed to greet Han-gyeol.\n“Who’s there?”\n“Eun-ha, it’s me! Can you open the door?”\nRecognizing Han-gyeol’s voice, I immediately unlocked the front door. He walked in with a big box in his hands, smiling bashfully.\n“What’s all this?”\n“I picked up some stuff from the BX—moisturizers, face masks, and other things. Figured I’d stock up before discharge.”\n“With this much, you should’ve called me to come out and help!”\n“I’ve gotten a lot stronger than I was before enlisting. It’s fine.”\n“Of course, Han-gyeol is the strongest! You haven’t eaten yet, right? Let’s organize this and eat together.”\n“Thanks for always making me breakfast when I’m on leave.”\n“And I’m thankful you always make me dinner when you’re home!”\nOur relationship felt brighter than ever, even more than before he enlisted. I could hardly remember the stoic version of Han-gyeol anymore.\n“Come inside quickly!”\n“Wait a sec!”\nAs I turned to head back to the kitchen, Han-gyeol suddenly hugged me from behind.\n“What’s this? You’re not eating?”\n“Sorry. Just let me stay like this for a moment. It feels amazing knowing I’m on my last leave.”\n“Okay, hold on as long as you want.”\n“If I do, we might not get to eat breakfast at all.”\nHe rested his chin on my shoulder, gazing at me with warmth.\n“No skipping breakfast! Han-gyeol, you always eat breakfast, don’t you?”\n“I could just eat you instead,” he teased, his smile unusually bright today.\nI guess the reality of his discharge was finally sinking in.\n“No way! The soup will get cold. I’ll give you a kiss instead.”\nI twisted around to face him and stood on my tiptoes, pressing my lips against his.\n“Happy now?”\n“Not enough.”\nI kissed him again.\n“How about now?”\nHe didn’t answer. Assuming he still wasn’t satisfied, I showered his face with kisses.\n“Eun-ha, if you keep this up, I’m going to end up devoured.”\n“Who cares? A little indulgence in the morning won’t hurt!”\n“You’ve gotten even cooler while I was in the military, haven’t you?”\n“Hehe, well, I’m just so happy that you’re about to be discharged.”\nHis excitement seemed to transfer to me, and I felt giddy too. I hugged his waist tightly, nuzzling my face into his chest.\n“Eun-ha, if you squeeze me any harder, my waist might break. Have you been lifting weights lately?”\n“Nope, this is pure love and affection. You’ll just have to endure.”\n“Fair enough! Then I’ll pamper you back!”\n“Ahh!”\nHan-gyeol suddenly grabbed my waist and lifted me effortlessly. I didn’t expect it to be so easy for him.\n“Put me down! Am I not heavy?”\n“You’re light as a feather, Eun-ha. Have you lost weight?”\n“To be honest, I think I’ve gained a bit…”\n“No way. I can still toss you around like this.”\nHe playfully bounced me up and down in his arms.\n“This’ll be perfect for playing with our future kids.”\nLooking down at him, I couldn’t help but smile. Gosh, he’s just too adorable. I almost wanted to start making those kids right now.\n“Then you won’t do this for me anymore?”\n“I’ll do it for you sometimes too,” he replied with a bright smile.\n“You’re having fun too, aren’t you?”\n“Yeah, it feels like I’m on a ride. Are you sure I’m not heavy?”\n“Well… now that you mention it, I’m starting to hit my limit.”\n“See? I told you not to overdo it. Put me down already!”\nHe carefully set me back on the floor.\n“Alright, time for breakfast! Go change and wash your hands quickly!”\n“Got it!”\nHan-gyeol took off his military boots and headed into the room. I stood there watching his back for a moment—his shoulders looked so broad now. He was already dependable before, but now he felt even more so, like he’d brought home a whole new level of security.\nI have no idea how long he’s planning to make my heart race like this. Even more than when we first started dating, my heart felt like it could burst from my chest. But with that, my happiness had also grown proportionally.\n“This is just perfect…”\nI smiled as I set the breakfast table. Han-gyeol, now changed, sat down at the table and commented, “Looks like a feast as always.”\n“It’s just a few side dishes and beef soup.”\n“That is a feast! What do you want for dinner tonight?”\n“Your spicy stir-fried pork. Can you make it?”\n“Of course. Mind if I dig in right now?”\n“Go ahead!”\n“Thanks for the meal.”\nWatching him eat so heartily made me feel full too. Han-gyeol was still as charming, adorable, and lovable as ever.\nThis won’t do—I’m eating him up after breakfast.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "The entire barracks, where my friend was the squad leader, was pulling weeds.\nIt wasn’t even during work hours, so I asked my friend why they were doing it.\n“Why are you pulling weeds on the day before your discharge?”\n“…You know those apples we got last month?”\n“Oh, you mean the apples we each got a whole box of?”\n“Yeah, those. I mean, apples for breakfast, apples for lunch, apples for dinner—on top of that, they gave us another box of apples as part of the rations. It drove me crazy! The apples got squished, and juice started leaking all over the lockers. How did you deal with it?”\n“I just ate them all.”\n“All of them?!”\nThis year, there was a bumper crop of apples, so every soldier in our unit received a box.\nI ate them whenever I had time, but other soldiers secretly threw them in the trash.Did they get caught doing that?\n“Did you get caught throwing them in the trash?”\n“No, Han-gyeol, listen to me. Do you think what I did was such a big deal?”\n“So, what did you do?”\n“My squad members and I secretly buried them in the mountain behind the barracks.”\nI flinched for a moment at his words.\n“Did you get caught?”\n“No, the burying part went perfectly. But then wild deer came down to the battalion commander’s vegetable garden, and they trashed it. The commander was furious and went to hunt the deer himself. But guess what? Every time he followed the deer tracks, he found bits of apple pulp. That’s how we got caught.”\nThe story was so intriguing that I walked alongside him to hear more.\n“That’s hilarious. At least you didn’t end up in military court.”\n“I almost did. They said I violated the supply management regulations. But hey, wasn’t it more eco-friendly than just throwing them in the trash?”\nLaughing so hard that I clutched my stomach, I teased him.\n“It was eco-friendly, I’ll give you that. Hey, grab those weeds over there too.”\n“You jerk…! Ugh, fine. In the army, it’s always the one who gets caught that’s at fault. But whatever, I’m done tomorrow, so I’ll let it slide.”\n“You could end up doing another tour.”\n“Don’t push it…”\n“Sorry. That was a bit much.”\nThis should be my last time in the army, ever.\nSigh… From being a recruit to a sergeant, it’s been such a rollercoaster ride.\nStill, I think I lived relatively comfortably thanks to all the good people I met here.\n“By the way, isn’t your tax accountant exam this month? Aren’t you studying?”\n“I’ve studied enough. Who studies on the day before discharge?”\n“True. You should just get ready to get beaten up tonight.”\n“I’ve been a good soldier, so I have nothing to worry about. You’re the one who’s gonna get hit.”\n“We’ll see about that.”\n****\n“Attention! Evening roll call for Barracks 1. Total personnel: 4. No absences. Current personnel: 4. Evening roll call complete.”\n“Ah, good. You guys are heading home tomorrow, right?”\n“Yes, sir.”\nThe officer on duty glanced at me.\n“Han-gyeol, you should stay and re-enlist.”\n“Apologies, sir, but I have too many attachments to civilian life.”\n“Or come back as a noncommissioned officer after your discharge. I’ll take care of you.”\n“Apologies, sir, but I have no regrets about leaving the army.”\n“Is that so? Anyway, good work, all of you. Have a safe trip home. Roll call dismissed.”\nAs soon as the officer left, I could hear the heavy footsteps of my juniors approaching Barracks 1.\nTheir murderous stares were audible even from inside the barracks.\nOf course, one of my juniors walked in with a grin on his face.\n“Victory! Congratulations on your discharge!”\n“What?! You’re gonna beat me too? I’ve been so good to you guys.”\n“Han-gyeol, we’ll give you the special treatment—wrapped in a blanket, comforter, and all.”\nHearing that, my friend protested loudly.\n“Hey! Why is Han-gyeol getting special treatment?!”\n“Well, he’s been good to all the juniors.”\n“So, what, we haven’t been?!”\nSeveral juniors nodded in agreement.\nSee? You should’ve been nicer during your service.\n“Lights out~!”\nI quickly wrapped myself in the blanket, comforter, and extra padding.\nAs the lights went out, the barracks echoed with groans and cries.\nOf course, the “special treatment” directed at me was minimal, and I just lay there enjoying the sound of my friends’ suffering.\n“Good job, everyone~”\n“Congrats on your discharge~”\n“Have a safe trip home~”\nOne by one, the juniors left, and the barracks grew quiet again.\n“Ugh… I thought I was gonna die. Han-gyeol, you okay?”\n“Me? They didn’t hit me.”\n“Unbelievable. I thought I was nice enough.”\n“They hit you as a congratulatory gesture. Does it hurt a lot?”\n“It’s bearable. Ha…I can’t believe I’m finally discharged. It’s only sinking in now. I thought this day would never come.”\n“Congratulations.”\n“What are you doing tomorrow? Meeting your girlfriend right away?”\n“Yeah. I have to. I also need to give her a ring.”\nWe’d been dating this whole time without getting matching rings, so I finally bought one.\nShe’d probably like the ring more than flowers, though she’d love both.\nI was already excited imagining Eun-Ha’s reaction.\n“Man… Your girlfriend is actually waiting for you.”\n“Ha… I just want to marry her already.”\n“Seriously? How are you gonna get married at 22?”\n“Who knows~ If I do, I’ll send you a wedding invitation.”\n“Sure thing. Ugh, let’s get some sleep. I just want to go home already.”\n“Yeah. Goodnight~”\nAnd so, the second chapter of my life in the army came to an end.\n****\n“Victory! Reporting! Sergeant Lee Han-gyeol and three others have officially been discharged from the Republic of Korea Air Force as of today. Reporting, sir! Victory!”\n“Alright. Don’t get too carried away celebrating today. You’ve all worked hard. I won’t say much. Stay healthy out there. Dismissed!”\nFollowing the Personnel Officer’s command, we saluted for the last time.\n“Attention, unit! Salute the Battalion Commander!”\n“Victory!”\n“Victory.”\nThe Battalion Commander returned the salute with a kind smile, a rare sight for the day.\n“At ease. This concludes the discharge ceremony.”\nOnce the ceremony ended, I boarded the bus heading out of the base.\nOur juniors waved us off along the way, and I climbed aboard with a happy smile.\nAs I looked out the window at the barracks for the last time, I etched the scene into my memory, officially ending my military life.\n“Take care! See you later!”\n“Yeah, stay in touch! Safe travels!”\nAfter arriving at the terminal, I bid my friends farewell and headed straight home.\nEven though this was my second discharge, I couldn’t stop the corners of my lips from curling upwards.\nWith light steps, I hopped into a taxi to make my way home.\nTaking the stairs two at a time, I reached the front door and punched in the code on the door lock.\nI was so eager to see Eun-ha that I swung the door open, but it stopped midway because of the safety latch.\nHearing the rattling sound, Eun-ha came toward the door.\n“Han-Gyeol?! Are you back?!”\n“Yeah, yeah, Eun-ha! I’m home.”\n“Wait a second~!”\nShe closed the door momentarily to unlatch the safety chain, and when it opened again, she stood there with a radiant smile.\nOvercome with joy, I immediately pulled her into a tight hug.\n“Eun-ha, I’m discharged!”\n“Yeah, yeah! You’ve worked so hard! You really did!”\n“Ha… Thinking about how I can spend every day with you now makes me so happy.”\nI hugged her even tighter.\n“Me too. I’m so happy. Let’s never be apart again!”\n“Yeah, I promise. We’ll stay together every single day.”\n“I’m so glad you’re finally discharged.”\nShe snuggled deeper into my arms, and as our eyes met, we shared a kiss.\n“Hehe.”\n“Eun-ha, you seem happier than I am~?”\n“Maybe I am~? Ah, just thinking about sleeping next to you every night now makes me so happy.”\n“I feel the same, waking up next to you every morning.”\n“Exactly! You’re not going anywhere now~”\n“I’m not. I promise.”\n“Come in quickly! I’ll help you unpack~”\n“Hold on~”\nAs our hug ended, I carefully reached into my pocket and pulled out a small box.\nWhen she saw it, Eun-ha’s eyes widened in surprise. Feeling shy, I slowly opened the box.\n“What’s this?”\nIt was my first time giving a ring to a woman.\nI was nervous and embarrassed, but for Eun-ha, there was nothing I wouldn’t do.\nI’d rehearsed what to say in my head for days, but now, I couldn’t remember a word.\nNo matter—I just had to speak from the heart.\n“Eun-ha, thank you for waiting for me. I love you.”\nHer eyes welled up with tears at my heartfelt words.\nThough she was smiling happily, tears began streaming down her face.\n“It took way too long for us to get couple rings.”\nI gently took her left hand, lifting it slowly and carefully, and slid the ring onto her ring finger.\n“I spent so much time choosing, but I’m not sure if you’ll like the design—”\nBefore I could finish, Eun-ha threw her arms around me again.\n“It’s beautiful! I love it so much! I’m so happy!”\n“Really? That’s a relief. I was so worried about it.”\n“Thank you—for coming back safe and sound, and for this amazing gift!”\nThrough her tears, she thanked me again and again.\n“Alright, stop crying! It’s not like I’m leaving for basic training today!”\n“I love you, Han-gyeol. I really love you.”\n“I love you too. But hey, you still have to put my ring on me.”\nWithout missing a beat, she pulled away and slid the ring onto my finger.\nGrasping my hand in hers, she beamed with joy.\n“It looks so good!”\n“I’m glad you’re happy.”\n“Yeah, I’m overjoyed! Are you hungry?”\nShe asked with a bright smile.\n“Not for food.”\n“Then?”\n“I’m starving for you, Eun-ha.”\nAt my words, she leaned in and pressed her lips to mine.\n“Then hurry up and devour me.”\n“Don’t mind if I do~”\nFrom now on, we’d never be apart.\n“Han-gyeol, come here quickly~”\n“I’m on my way~”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "Finally, Han-gyeol completed his military service.\nAfter his discharge, the first thing we did was visit both sets of parents to greet them again. Both my parents and Han-gyeol’s parents praised and congratulated us, saying we had worked hard.\nAfterward, we met up with Harim and Jang Yujin for drinks, and we also made time to meet other people we had to see. Once we finished meeting everyone, I didn’t part from Han-gyeol for even a moment.\nFrom waking up in bed in the morning to falling asleep at night, I stuck to him like glue.\nWe did everything together—laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking meals. We made up for all the things we couldn’t do while Han-gyeol was in the military. We never parted.\nThough a bit embarrassing, we also made up for all the missed physical affection. Thanks to his consistent workouts, Han-gyeol’s stamina had improved, and… every day was just... hehe.\nI’m already wondering if the nights we’ll spend in Jeju Island, where we’re headed now, will be just as fiery. Every single day, without fail. The thought alone makes my heart race.\n“Hehe… Just thinking about it makes me happy.”\n“Eun-ha, what are you daydreaming about like that?”\n“About being with Han-gyeol every night.”“Eun-ha, you don’t have a filter anymore, do you?”\n“So what? It’s just the two of us~”\nEven though I’m like this, I do know when and where to draw the line.\n“True. It’s just the two of us~ Come here.”\n“Okay!”\nWhen Han-gyeol opened his arms, I dove straight into them.\nEver since his discharge, he’s been openly expressing his affection for me even more. I guess he also wanted to be lovey-dovey, just like me. Realizing we felt the same made me so happy.\n“Let’s have lots of fun in Jeju Island.”\n“As long as I’m with you, I’m fine with anything.”\n“Same here~ Let’s go eat something delicious.”\n“Black pork! And also gukbap noodles!”\n“Sure. Let’s eat everything~ But first, let’s head to the gate for our flight.”\n“Yep! Let’s go!”\nHand in hand, Han-gyeol and I walked to the gate.\nEven after sitting down on the plane, we didn’t let go of each other’s hands.\n“You know, this might be a weird time to ask, but you have your second exam next month. Are you sure it’s okay to be traveling?”\n“It’s rare for people to pass everything in one go anyway. I studied, of course, but honestly, I don’t feel too confident. I was planning to focus harder on next year’s exam. So, don’t worry—I didn’t push myself to come.”\n“Okay, I trust you. You always manage things well. But still, if there’s anything I can help with, just let me know.”\n“You’re already helping a lot, you know. Bringing me fruit while I study~”\n“Ah, it makes me feel like a wife. I kind of like it~”\nI grinned brightly as I spoke.\n“It felt new to me too, like I was being cared for as a husband.”\n“I’ll peel them for you often~ And I’ll peel mandarins for you in Jeju Island too!”\n“You’re spoiling me too much. Let me do something for you too.”\n“Alright, then you can peel them for me. Hehe.”\n“You’re too cute. Let’s have lots of fun.”\n“Yes, let’s have so much fun! And take lots of photos.”\nBefore long, the plane took off, and about an hour later, we arrived at Jeju Airport.\nAs soon as we stepped out of the gate, palm trees greeted us warmly.\nJeju Island was a place Han-gyeol had wanted to visit before his enlistment, and we finally made it.\nWe were steadily fulfilling all the dreams we had envisioned together.\n“Palm trees…!”\n“Eun-ha, you look so excited~ Let’s go rent a car quickly.”\n“Rent a car…! Let’s go!”\nBack when I was twenty, it had been a bit tricky to rent a car since I hadn’t had my license for a full year. But now, it was no problem.\nI suggested public transportation would be fine, but Han-gyeol insisted on renting a car, saying he knew how to drive.\nThough I agreed, my parents were initially against it.\nThey worried it’d be dangerous since he didn’t have much driving experience. But after he took them on a drive to Yeongjongdo to demonstrate his skills, they finally gave their permission.\nHonestly, there’s nothing Han-gyeol can’t do.\n“Is there anything you can’t do, Han-gyeol?”\n“Huh? What brought that up?”\n“Well, you even know how to drive, even though you weren’t a military driver~”\n“Guess I’ve got a knack for it.”\n“You’re so cool.”\n“And you’re so pretty, Eun-ha. Ah, there’s our car.”\nLike a pro, Han-gyeol started taking photos and videos of every corner of the rental car.\n“Why are you taking pictures?”\n“To document any scratches or dents that were already here. That way, we won’t be blamed when we return it.”\n“Ah, smart.”\n“Though it’s not too strict here since we can just return the car and leave. But better safe than sorry. All done—let’s get in.”\n“Yep!”\nSitting in the car with just the two of us felt fresh and exciting. It was our first time alone in a car, and the new experience made the corners of my mouth twitch up.\nNo, I had to hold it in. It’d be embarrassing to grin like a kid just because I was sitting in a car.\n“Eun-ha, you’re grinning so much.”\n“Ugh—was I that obvious?”\n“You’re adorable. Alright, time to buckle up~”\nLeaning in, Han-gyeol gently pulled my seatbelt across me.\nWith a click, he fastened it and flashed me a bright smile before settling back into his seat.\nSometimes, he’s so sly it drives me crazy. My heart was about to burst.\nNoticing my flustered expression, he teased me.\n“Eun-ha, your face is bright red. So, this works, huh?”\n“You little fox…”\n“It’s been a while since I’ve seen you so embarrassed. I like it.”\nWith an innocent smile, he radiated mischief, and I decided to retaliate.\nUnfastening my seatbelt with a click, I leaned forward.\n“Why are you unbuckling your seatbelt?”\n“To make you blush just as much.”\n“Huh? What do you me—mmph!”\nI leaned in and pressed my lips against his, slipping my tongue into his mouth.\nBy now, I knew exactly what kind of kiss he liked.\nStealing his breath away, I slowly pulled back, leaving a thin, white thread between us.\n“Now… we’re even, right?”\nAs I smiled, Han-gyeol mumbled softly.\n“You little fox…”\n****\nAfter dropping off our luggage at the accommodation, Han-gyeol and I went out for lunch together.\nThe sizzling sound of Jeju black pork filled the air, and as always, Han-gyeol was staring intently at the meat as it grilled. He always made that face whenever meat was cooking—it was so cute. I couldn’t help but stare at him with the same intensity.\n“You can eat now~”\n“Thank you.”\nThe moment the staff spoke, Han-gyeol eagerly grabbed his chopsticks.\nI picked up the most delicious-looking piece of meat and placed it in his bowl.\nHe looked at me and said,\n“This is the best-looking piece…?! Eun-ha, you eat it.”\n“No, it’s for you. I want to see you eat it!”\nAt my words, the corners of his lips lifted into a gentle smile.\n“I’m touched…”\nHis sincere gaze made me want to melt. He was just too adorable.\n“Don’t get so emotional over one piece of meat~”\n“It makes me feel so loved.”\n“Well, I love you a lot~ Now hurry up and eat.”\n“Alright, I’ll enjoy it~”\nAs always, the first piece of meat had to be dipped in salt.\nI always wondered if today might be different, but he never skipped the salt.\nThis time, too, I watched his chopsticks intently as he dipped the meat into the salt and then popped it into his mouth.\nI swear, it was so cute I could have died on the spot.\nLiving with him, I’ve come to notice so many of his little habits.\nAnd honestly, the process of learning all these small things about him is so delightful and makes me so happy.\nAfter swallowing his bite, he smiled brightly and placed a piece of meat in my bowl.\n“Eun-ha, you try it too.”\n“Is it good?”\n“It melts.”\nHearing that, I looked around quickly.\nIt was a weekday lunch, so there weren’t as many people as I’d expected.\n“Feed me.”\n“Right now?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Alright. Open up.”\nThe moment I opened my mouth, he fed me the meat.\nJust like he said, it melted in my mouth.\nAs I smiled with delight at how delicious it was, he looked at me with a satisfied expression.\n“You eat so prettily.”\nIt felt so wonderful to be loved like this.\n“Is it good?”\nI nodded enthusiastically in response to his question.\nAfter that, we ate until we were completely full.\nOnce we finished our meal and paid the bill, we moved straight on to our next plan.\nBoth of us are pretty organized people, so we had mapped out an efficient itinerary for the trip.\n“Now let’s go get some tangerine tarts!”\n“Sounds good. By the way, the meat here was amazing. Should we come back if we have time later?”\n“Was it that good~?”\n“It was unbelievable.”\n“Alright! We’ll come again if we get a chance!”\n“Okay, then shall we head out?”\n“Yep!”\nWith a beep, he unlocked the car. I immediately dashed ahead of him to the car and kindly opened the driver’s side door for him.\n“Han-gyeol, get in~!”\n“Pfft—! Did you run all the way over just to open the door for me?”\n“What do you think? Polite, huh? Are you falling for me all over again?”\nHe burst into laughter at my antics, holding his stomach as he laughed uncontrollably.\nSeeing him laugh like that made me feel so happy.\nOnce he calmed down, he came over to me with a big smile.\n“That’s really polite. I’m definitely falling for you.”\n“Really? Just wait—I’ll make you fall for me even more. Get ready~”\n“I’m falling every day.”\n“Then today, I’ll make sure you fall every hour!”\n“You can stop wooing me now, you know?”\n“I’ll woo you forever~”\nThis is just so much fun.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "We were on our way back to the lodging after finishing the day’s schedule.\nEun-ha, sitting in the passenger seat, was nodding off, clearly tired from running around all day since morning. She looked adorable as she tried to shake off her drowsiness, her head bobbing up and down.\n“Eun-ha, if you’re sleepy, just take a little nap. I’ll wake you up when we arrive.”\n“No way! Why do you think it’s called the passenger seat? I won’t sleep... not at all...!”\nDespite Eun-ha’s wide-eyed insistence, her eyelids looked heavy.\nI turned down the air conditioner a little and drove silently, and soon I could hear her breathing.\nShweeek, shweeek… The delicate sound of Eun-ha’s breaths tickled my ears, and before I knew it, the corners of my lips lifted.\nShe won’t last ten minutes. How cute can she get?\nAfter driving along the coastal road and pulling into the parking lot, I stayed in the car, waiting for Eun-ha to wake up.\nCarefully, I brushed her hair back and stared at her face.She’s beautiful when she smiles, beautiful when she cries, and even now, she’s breathtakingly beautiful asleep.\nHer porcelain skin, long lashes, sharp nose, and lips that looked soft and rosy.\nThere wasn’t a single thing about Eun-ha’s face that wasn’t perfect. Just looking at her made my face heat up.\nAs if sensing my gaze, Eun-ha’s eyes moved slightly. I quickly returned to the driver’s seat and pretended we had just arrived.\n“Eun-ha, we’re here. Time to wake up.”\n“Huh...? I didn’t mean to fall asleep. Sorry.”\n“Why are you apologizing for that?”\n“Your car is just so comfortable, Han-gyeol.”\n“Thanks for the compliment. Come on, let’s go.”\n“Okay, okay.”\nEun-ha grinned as she unbuckled her seatbelt.\nI got out too, and we stepped into the elevator to head up to the lodging.\nAs I reached to press the button for our floor, Eun-ha darted forward and pressed the button for the first floor instead.\n“Aren’t we going to the room?”\n“Nope. The sea is right in front of us. Let’s take a little walk first.”\n“Are you sure? Aren’t you tired? We can do it tomorrow.”\n“Are you tired, Han-gyeol? Then you can go up.”\n“Nope, I’m fine.”\n“Then let’s go now. We only get this one moment together today, after all.”\n“It’s not like the world is ending tomorrow.”\n“There’s a saying, you know—‘love as if today is your last.’”\nEun-ha beamed up at me with the brightest smile. Why is everything she says so sweet?\n“Eun-ha, even your words are beautiful.”\n“How’s my flirting? Did it work a little?”\n“Yeah, you got me—multiple times today.”\n“You promised to stay smitten with me forever, remember~”\nEun-ha linked arms with me, her radiant smile directed at me. Her warmth and soft presence against my arm made my face burn.\n“Wow, Han-gyeol, your face is all red!”\n“You’re making me want to skip the beach and go straight to the room.”\n“No way~ Beach first, room later!”\nJust as Eun-ha finished speaking, the elevator doors opened to the first floor.\nWe walked outside, the cool night breeze washing over us as we headed toward the beach.\n“The night air feels so refreshing!”\n“Yeah, and the breeze is nice too.”\n“Should I have worn a dress?”\n“Huh? Why?”\nEun-ha gave me a shy smile.\n“Because I want to look pretty for you, Han-gyeol.”\n“Saying you’re always beautiful might sound too cliché.”\n“Not at all! I feel thrilled every time I hear it, no matter how often.”\n“Ahh, you’re adorable~”\n“What’s that supposed to mean? You’re treating me like a little animal.”\n“Honestly, if I had to compare, you’re more of a predator than a small animal.”\n“Well, you’re no pushover either, Han-gyeol.”\nEun-ha gently slipped off her shoes.\n“Are you going into the water?”\n“Just dipping my feet. You’re coming too, right?”\nEun-ha held her shoes in both hands as she looked at me.\n“What if I say no?”\n“You wouldn’t dare—I know you too well.”\n“Looks like I better roll out the beach mat~”\nFollowing Eun-ha’s lead, I took off my shoes and rolled up my pants. Together, we stepped into the cool ocean water.\n“Wow, this feels amazing!”\n“You really love the sea, don’t you, Eun-ha?”\n“It’s not the sea—it’s being here with you, Han-gyeol. Everything’s better with you.”\n“Even a pit of fire?”\n“Okay, maybe not that.”\nEun-ha let out a soft giggle.\nWe kept walking along the beach, leaving footprints in the sand.\n“How far are we going? Let’s turn back soon.”\n“Let’s do that. My legs are starting to hurt too.”\n“Want me to carry you?”\n“What? I ate a lot today, so I’ll be heavy.”\n“Eun-ha, no matter how much you weigh, it can’t be that heavy. Want me to carry you?”\n“Hmm—nope. I’ll carry you instead! It’s been a while since I gave you a piggyback ride!”\n“I’m heavier now; it’ll be tough.”\n“I’ve gotten stronger too! Come on, hop on!”\nEun-ha confidently turned her back toward me, inviting me to climb on.\nHalf doubting, I climbed onto her back.\n“Ugh…! I can do this.”\n“Oh… you’re holding on better than I expected.”\n“I’ll carry you all the way—waah!”\nEun-ha lost her balance while carrying me.\nSuddenly, she tipped over, and we both tumbled onto the sand.\nA wave rolled in and soaked my clothes before receding, leaving me drenched.\nEun-ha stared at me with wide eyes, shocked.\n“Oh no.”\n“Eun-ha, since it’s come to this, maybe you should—”\nBefore I could finish my sentence, Eun-ha bolted, running away from me.\n“Hey, where are you going!”\n“You’re going to dunk me in the water!”\nSmart. She knew my intentions, but that’s to be expected after dating so long.\nStill…! I kicked off my shoes onto the sand and ran after her.\n“Stay right there!”\n“Kyaaah! I’m sorry!”\nEun-ha ran for her life.\nDid she train for track and field when I wasn’t looking? How is she so fast?\nJust as I was about to give up and slow down—\n“Ah—!”\nEun-ha tripped over her own feet and fell onto the beach.\n“Oh no.”\n****\nIn the end, we returned to the lodging covered in sand and took a shower together.\nBut I couldn’t stop replaying the image of Eun-ha tripping over her own feet in my mind.\n“Han-gyeol… stop laughing…!”\n“Am I laughing right now?”\n“You’re laughing a lot!”\n“At least you didn’t get hurt.”\n“My pride got hurt…”\nFor some reason, everything Eun-ha said today was hilariously funny.\nEven though I tried to hold it in, the corners of my lips kept twitching upward.\nIn the end, Eun-ha grabbed my cheeks.\n“Really… Is it that funny to see your girlfriend fall over?”\n“Sorry… you were just too cute—”\n“Fine, I’ll forgive you because I’m cute…!”\nEun-ha looked down at me with a pout.\n“Are you really sure you didn’t hurt yourself?”\n“Yeah. My clothes just got wet, that’s all.”\n“Are you mad?”\n“No, just embarrassed. Come here so I can dry your hair.”\n“I can dry it myself, you know?”\n“Just come here already.”\nShe seemed so flustered that she wouldn’t meet my gaze.\nSensing her embarrassment, I turned around and sat with my back to her.\nEun-ha began patting my wet hair with a towel, then grabbed the hairdryer.\n“Let me know if it gets too hot.”\n“Okay. I’m counting on you.”\nVrrrrr— The hairdryer buzzed softly as Eun-ha carefully dried my hair.\nWhen she was done, she wrapped her arms around me from behind.\n“What’s this? Isn’t it my turn to dry your hair now?”\n“Just… forget about me falling earlier. It’s so embarrassing.”\n“Alright. If I turn around, I’ll pretend it never happened.”\n“Ugh… I fell so clumsily too…!”\n“Honestly, it was kind of cute.”\n“Ugh… don’t call things like that cute!”\nEun-ha rubbed her face against my back.\n“Promise me you won’t tease me about it anymore?”\n“I promise. I won’t do anything you don’t like.”\n“Thanks…”\n“Now, can you let me see your face?”\nEun-ha quietly stepped away from me.\nWhen I turned around to look at her face, I saw that her cheeks were burning bright red.\nShe looked so adorable that I couldn’t help but pull her into my arms.\n“But my hair isn’t dry yet…”\n“I’m hugging you because you’re too cute to resist.”\n“I feel like I show this childish side of myself to you way too often.”\n“You do?”\nEun-ha spoke in a slightly sullen tone.\n“Yeah. I want to be the kind of mature woman you can lean on, Han-gyeol.”\nHer words carried a hint of frustration, and I froze for a moment.\nI hadn’t realized she felt this way.\nMeeting her gaze, I softly replied.\n“Honestly, I think you’re incredibly mature, Eun-ha.”\n“You’re just saying that to make me feel better, aren’t you?”\n“No, I really mean it. I’ve thought that about you for a long time.”\n“Really? In what way? Be specific.”\n“Nothing comes to mind immediately, but… you’re always so thoughtful. You plan things carefully, take responsibility, and think deeply about everything.”\n“But I learned all of that from you, Han-gyeol!”\n“That’s not true. Hmm… for example, do you remember what you told me before I went to the military?”\n“What did I say?”\nEun-ha tilted her head, curious.\n“You told me not to feel obligated.”\n“Oh—yeah, I remember. Why?”\n“You might not realize it, but that was such a mature thing to say. Honestly, it takes a lot of courage to say something like that. When I heard it, I thought, ‘Wow, Eun-ha is so grown-up.’ And honestly, I’ve never really thought of you as childish.”\nAt my words, a slow smile spread across Eun-ha’s face.\nShe seemed happy to hear the compliment.\n“Hehe… so that’s what you thought.”\n“Yeah. And I rely on you a lot, Eun-ha. When I’m having a hard time, you’re the first person I think of.”\n“Really? If anything tough happens, you have to lean on me, okay? Your Noona here will take care of everything! Just trust me!”\nEun-ha declared confidently, brimming with pride.\n“Still, don’t stop showing me this cute side of you every now and then. I love mature Eun-ha, but I love cute Eun-ha too.”\n“Okay, okay! I’ll make sure to do that!”\n“Feeling better now?”\n“Yep!”\n“...”\nLooking at Eun-ha like this, I found her both adorable and incredibly dependable.\n“In that case, Noona is going to devour you today.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“I love you.”\n“Wha—ack—!”\nEun-ha suddenly pushed me over, pinning me to the floor.\nThen she climbed on top of me, tying her hair back with slow, deliberate movements.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re staying still today.”\nHow did things escalate like this?\nWell, I guess it doesn’t really matter. Even this side of Eun-ha is too adorable to resist.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Han-gyeol and I were sitting alone on the beach, waiting for the sunrise.\nNo matter how much we looked around, there wasn’t a single person in sight.\nIt felt as if everyone had cleared the area just for us.\nMaybe, as a group, they decided to avoid this spot for our sake.\n“Han-gyeol, it feels like we’ve rented out the whole beach!”“Right? With no one around, I feel so good, too…”\nSitting here with Han-gyeol, just the two of us, made me incredibly happy.\nAs we listened to the gentle crashing of the waves, we waited for the sun to rise.\nWhy did this feel more exciting than when we watched the sunrise in Gangneung?\nMy heart was beating faster than usual, and I could feel my pulse quickening.\n“It must be because I love you even more than back then~”\nAs if Han-gyeol had read my thoughts, he answered immediately.\n“Huh?! How did you know what I was thinking?!”\n“Because there’s nothing about Eun-ha that I don’t know~ I can tell everything just by looking at your face.”\nIt was amazing…!\nHow could he read me so accurately?\nDoes love make telepathy possible?\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Because of you, I’m so happy. I think I might be the happiest person in the world.”\n“Really~? Tell me, when are you the happiest?”\n“It’s hard to pick a specific moment. I’m just always happy. Just having you by my side is more than enough.”\n“Then I’ll make you even happier from now on.”\n“No, I’ll make you happier, Eun-ha.”\n“I’m already super happy right now~ Hehe.”\nWhen I laughed, Han-gyeol looked at me lovingly.\n“Why are you so beautiful?”\n“To get all of Han-gyeol’s love!”\n“Yeah. I’ll love you more and more every day.”\nHe gently ruffled my hair.\nThat touch always made me feel good.\nIt was warm, and it filled my heart with joy.\n“I feel like I could do anything for Eun-ha.”\n“Really~? Then bring me the sun that’s about to rise.”\n“Sure. How hard could that be?”\n“What~? You’d even pluck the sun for me?”\n“Of course. How hard could it be~?”\nHan-gyeol replied with such a relaxed expression, as if he truly meant it.\nWas it a metaphor?\nOr did he have another way to “pluck” the sun?\n“Is that even possible?”\nWhen I asked again, Han-gyeol nodded confidently.\n“How?”\nI tilted my head in curiosity, and Han-gyeol pointed toward the sea.\n“First, we have to wait for the sun to rise.”\n“Oh, yeah. That makes sense, right?”\n“Eun-ha, if I bring you the sun, what will you give me in return?”\n“Hmm~ Then I’ll bring you the moon next time!”\nI answered brightly, but I still had no idea how he planned to pluck the sun.\nI couldn’t even guess.\n“That sounds great. Oh? Look, the sun is rising. Eun-ha, look quickly.”\nFollowing the direction of Han-gyeol’s pointing finger, I turned my gaze.\nThe sun was rising from below the horizon.\nIts warm rays wrapped around Han-gyeol and me as it fully emerged.\nI shifted my gaze from the sun to Han-gyeol.\n“The sun’s up now, so pluck it for me.”\n“Okay, watch closely~”\nHan-gyeol slowly stretched his arm toward the sea.\nThen, gently, as if handling something fragile, he reached out and grasped the sun.\nSo this is how he meant to “pluck” it.\nAs expected, the real sun—\n“Got it.”\n“Huh?”\nWhen Han-gyeol fully clasped his hand, the sun, which had been floating above the horizon, disappeared.\nStartled, I jumped up from the beach in shock.\n“What?! Where did the sun go?”\n“Huh? You asked me to pluck it, didn’t you? It’s in my hand.”\n“No… Han-gyeol? What are you even saying…?! Wait, what’s happening to your hand?! Why is it glowing?!”\nLight, resembling sunlight, was seeping through Han-gyeol’s fingers.\nWhat on earth was happening here…?\n“Well, if I grabbed the sun, of course it’s going to glow.”\n“No, no… I mean, how can a person even grab the sun?”\n“Huh? Like this?”\n“Wait, are you telling me the sun is actually in your hand right now?”\n“Yeah, it is.”\nI was dumbfounded.\nI couldn’t believe it.\n“Doesn’t it burn?”\n“Not really. It’s not that hot.”\n“But the surface temperature is supposed to be 6,000 degrees…”\nIt was still unbelievable.\nBut Han-gyeol smiled brightly as he spoke.\n“If you don’t believe me, do you want to hold it too?”\n“Is that… even possible?”\n“Probably. Sit down; I’ll put it in your hands.”\nSwallowing hard, I sat back down.\n“Hold out your hands. Make sure you don’t let it slip away.”\n“Okay, okay… I’m ready.”\nI stretched out both hands and held them out to Han-gyeol.\nCarefully, he opened his hand above mine, slowly revealing the sun.\nWhen his hand was fully open, I stared at the small, round sun resting on my palms.\nIt was the size of a ping-pong ball, but it was unmistakably the sun.\nYet, it wasn’t hot at all.\nInstead, it felt warm and calming, putting my mind at ease.\n“This… this makes no sense!”\n“Phew, good. It’s not leaving your hands either.”\n“Would it leave someone else’s hands?”\n“If the sun doesn’t like them, it’ll leave. Didn’t you know that?”\n“Wouldn’t it be stranger if I did…?”\nEven as I listened to Han-gyeol, my mind was spinning.\nThe sun on my hands rolled around playfully, as if it were trying to entertain me.\n“I think it likes you. Look, it’s even showing off.”\n“Ha… ha ha… I guess that’s nice…! Wait, what?”\nAs Han-gyeol and I stared at the sun, it began to emit a brighter light.\n“Han-gyeol? Doesn’t it seem like the sun is getting brighter?! Is it going to explode?!”\n“Huh? Why is it acting like this?”\nThe sun suddenly floated into the air and began to merge with me.\n“Han-gyeol, what is this…?”\n“They say it happens when it really likes someone. This is my first time seeing it too.”\n“Wha-?! Am I going to burn to death?!”\n“Don’t worry~ You won’t die.”\nHan-gyeol laughed innocently.\nStill… no matter how reassuring he sounded… this was—\n“This doesn’t make any sense—!!!”\nFinally, I screamed loudly and opened my eyes wide.\nThe scene in front of me had completely changed.\nWhat? Where am I? The sun? Am I okay? Did I already burn up? Is this heaven?\n“Eun-ha…? What’s wrong?”\n“Han-gyeol?”\nIt was Han-gyeol, standing by the bed.\nAs soon as I saw him, I shouted.\n“Han-gyeol, the sun! Where’s the sun?!”\n“The sun? What sun?”\n“You know—the one you grabbed in your hand! It was about the size of a ping-pong ball!”\n“Are you talking about the sun…?”\n“Yes, yes! The sun!”\n“The sun is outside the window…? Also, how would someone grab the sun? Its surface temperature is 6,000 degrees. Did you have a dream?”\n“A dream…?”\nCould a dream feel this vivid?\nStill dazed, I glanced out the window to see the sun floating normally above the sea.\n“Haha… of course. That scared me.”\n“What kind of dream did you have to be this startled?”\n“I don’t know… it’s the first time I’ve had a dream like that… What kind of dream even was that?”\n“You must be tired from sleeping in a different place. Come on, let’s get ready. We need to head out soon.”\n“Oh, yeah. Right… I need to get a grip…!”\nShaking my head to clear my thoughts, I headed to the bathroom.\nEven while washing my face, I couldn’t shake the memory of that dream.\nWhen I came out of the bathroom, I hesitantly asked Han-gyeol, still unsure.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Can you check if my body feels hot?”\n“Are you feverish? Let me check—!”\nHe reached to touch my forehead, but I quickly dodged.\n“Careful—!”\n“What?!”\n“Um… I might be really hot.”\nHan-gyeol looked at me with a deeply concerned expression.\n“Are you seriously sick? How hot could you even be…?”\n“Like… 6,000 degrees…?”\n“What?”\n“Uh, nothing?”\nDespite my warning, Han-gyeol touched my forehead without hesitation.\nSince he didn’t immediately pull his hand back, I figured I wasn’t 6,000 degrees after all.\n“That’s weird… You don’t seem to have a fever.”\n“Right?! Haha… hahaha…! I must’ve been out of my mind for a second.”\n“Are you sure you’re okay? Should we stop by the hospital before leaving?”\n“No, no, I’m fine now—! Phew… Thank goodness.”\n“Are you really okay? Tell me honestly. We can delay the flight if we need to.”\nHan-gyeol seemed really worried.\nI mean, of course—after all the nonsensical things I’d been saying about holding the sun and being 6,000 degrees, who wouldn’t be concerned?\n“I’m really fine—! I was just half-asleep.”\n“You’re sure?”\n“Yep! Sorry for worrying you.”\n“Phew… You really scared me.”\n“Hehe. Let’s get going! We have to hit that barbecue place you like one last time.”\n“Yeah. Let’s pack up and head out.”\nAfter reassuring him, we left our lodging.\nAs we drove out of the underground parking lot, the bright sunlight wrapped around us warmly.\nFor a moment, I panicked again, thinking I had stolen the sun.\n“Today’s the sunniest day of the trip,” Han-gyeol said, glancing out the window.\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. It’s been great all along, but today feels extra sunny. Makes me want to stay one more day.”\n“We can always come back~”\n“That’s true.”\n“Next time, should we bring our families?”\n“That sounds good—! After Gangneung, let’s hit Jeju Island next.”\nIt must’ve been such an amazing trip that it inspired that strange dream.\nStill, it was such a vivid dream that I doubt I’ll ever forget it.\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "A month had passed since we returned from our trip to Jeju Island.\nIn the past month, I took the second part of the CPA exam.\nThere were quite a few questions that confused me, so it felt like hoping to pass was a stretch.\nMeanwhile, Eun-ha spent her days working as usual, but recently, her health hadn’t been great.\n“Eun-ha, is it the same today?”“Yeah… I still feel a bit sluggish and heavy.”\nEun-ha was leaning against the headboard, resting.\nAt first, I thought it was just a temporary slump, but it had been going on for days now.\n“Should we skip visiting your parents today and go to the hospital instead?”\n“Hmm… no, it’s not like I’m in serious pain. Let’s have lunch with my parents first, and then we can go to the hospital.”\nWe had planned to have lunch today with Eun-ha’s parents at a Korean restaurant.\nIt was one of the rare days her parents were free, and they had even invited me to join.\nIt wasn’t an invitation we could easily decline, but still…\n“Don’t worry too much. I’m really okay! Other than feeling a bit off, I’m fine~”\n“But didn’t you say you felt nauseous a few days ago? Is that better now?”\n“Hmm… yeah, I think it’s okay. Let’s just have lunch with my parents first. We can go to the hospital afterward.”\n“Alright, let’s do that.”\nIn the end, Eun-ha dragged her heavy body to the bathroom.\nAfter washing up, she quickly changed and we headed to the restaurant.\nWhile waiting on a bench outside the restaurant, I saw Eun-ha’s parents and her older brother, Eunwoo Hyung, approaching.\nI quickly stood up and bowed to greet them.\n“Hello.”\n“You’re here early~? There’s still some time before our reservation.”\n“I wanted to see Mom and Dad, so I came quickly~”\nEun-ha greeted her parents with an affectionate smile.\n“Ah, I missed you too, my dear. How have you been, Han-gyeol?”\n“I’ve been doing well. How about you both?”\n“Oh, we’ve been great!”\nEun-ha’s mother replied with a bright smile.\nHer father, standing beside her, also asked how I’d been doing.\n“You two still look like you’re doing well. Everything good between you?”\n“Yes, we’ve been well.”\n“That’s good to hear.”\nAfter exchanging greetings, Eunwoo Hyung gave me a warm welcome.\n“Han-gyeol, how was your military service?”\n“I completed it well. How about you, Hyung? All good?”\n“Oh, me? I’m preparing for job applications now that I’ve graduated. Life’s manageable so far.”\n“I wish you the best with that.”\nIt seemed like everyone was doing well.\n“Alright, let’s head inside. This place serves good Korean food.”\n“Sure, let’s go in.”\n“Okay~”\nInside the reserved room, we ordered a simple course meal.\nWhile waiting for the food to arrive, we shared stories.\n“So, the new semester is starting soon, right? Han-gyeol, are you returning for your second semester as a freshman?”\n“Yes, I’m planning to graduate as soon as possible and start working, especially since Eun-ha is graduating soon too.”\n“Eun-ha said she only has one last semester left, right?”\n“Yeah. I took a lot of summer and winter courses while Han-gyeol was in the military, so I can graduate early.”\n“You kids seem so mature and capable. It’s really admirable.”\nEun-ha and I both felt a bit shy at her mother’s compliment.\n“You two have been together since high school, so it’s been four years now?”\n“Yes, that’s right.”\n“It feels like just yesterday when I first saw you two together. Time flies~”\n“Actually, if you think about it, I’m the reason these two got together,” Eunwoo Hyung chimed in.\nEun-ha and I tilted our heads in confusion.\n“What do you mean, oppa? How did you bring us together?”\n“If I hadn’t asked Han-gyeol to help me assemble my computer, would he have ever come to our house?”\n“Oh, now that you mention it, that’s true. I’m always grateful for that.”\n“See? Even Han-gyeol admits it.”\n“Well, I think we would’ve ended up together no matter what. Right, Han-gyeol?”\nEun-ha looked up at me with a bright smile.\n“Yeah, that’s true too.”\n“See? Han-gyeol agrees with me!”\n“Alright, you win this one, little sister.”\nEun-ha seemed especially cheerful, likely because it had been a while since she’d seen her family.\nSoon, the server entered the room and placed abalone porridge in front of us as an appetizer.\nAs the lid was lifted, a savory aroma filled the room.\nAnd at that moment—\n“Ugh—!”\nEun-ha clapped her hand over her mouth and rushed out of the room.\nEveryone in the room froze, staring after her in shock.\nThen, all eyes turned to me, as if waiting for me to explain the mysterious situation.\nThough I couldn’t say for sure, it felt like we were all thinking the same thing.\n“Could it be… you two…?!”\n“I’ll go check on her—!”\nI quickly got up and followed Eun-ha out.\n****\nThe Meal Was Postponed.\nThe lunch meeting was canceled, and we decided to visit the hospital with Eun-ha before contacting her parents later in the evening.\nAfter a simple check-up, we entered the consultation room together, where the OB-GYN doctor calmly spoke.\n“Congratulations. You’re pregnant. Five weeks along.”\nI had a suspicion, but hearing it confirmed still felt surreal.\nIf I were to describe my feelings before hearing this news, I’d say I was honestly a bit scared.\nI had just been discharged from the military, and I had less to my name now than before.\nGraduating from college was still far off, and financial independence seemed out of reach for the moment.\nI was overjoyed that Eun-ha and I were having a baby, but a part of me wondered if I could truly be a good husband and father.\nRather than pure happiness, my initial reaction to this sudden pregnancy was worry.\n“Here is the ultrasound photo. At five weeks, you can’t hear the heartbeat yet, but that small round spot is the gestational sac.”\nI carefully reached out for the ultrasound photo that the doctor handed over.\nAs I slowly lifted it to eye level, the image of our baby came into focus.\nIt was my first time seeing an ultrasound photo, and there it was—a tiny, round gestational sac nestled in Eun-ha’s womb.\nIt was so small yet so vivid.\nThis was our baby, mine and Eun-ha’s.\nThe moment I saw it, all the doubts I had vanished.\nThe worries that had weighed on me disappeared, replaced by an indescribable emotion.\nMy eyes welled up with tears as waves of emotion washed over me.\nIn my past, I had thought countless times about the meaning of life.\nWas it simply accepting the life you were given and living it out?\nWas it merely enduring repetitive days until they ended in monotony?\nI had often wondered what I should pursue, what I should call happiness.\nBut here, in this moment, those thoughts never crossed my mind.\nIn this place, my daily life, my choices, and my actions all had meaning, culminating in this very moment.\n“Eun-ha…”\nI could hear the tremble in my voice.\nEun-ha looked at me, her eyes widening in surprise.\n“Han-gyeol…? Why are you crying?!”\nI wasn’t sure why I was crying.\nI couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried, but now, tears wouldn’t stop flowing.\nEun-ha, half-smiling and half-confused, gently wiped my tears away.\nWhat filled my heart was a mix of overwhelming happiness and a newfound sense of responsibility.\n“I’ll… I’ll make sure you’re happy…”\nI held Eun-ha’s hand tightly as she wiped my tears.\nThough surprised at first, she quickly smiled her usual warm smile and nodded.\n“Okay!”\nAs I locked eyes with Eun-ha, a discreet cough broke the moment.\n“Ahem—!”\nStartled, both Eun-ha and I turned to look at the doctor again.\nThe doctor proceeded to explain the precautions and next steps before we left the hospital.\nHolding my hand tightly as we walked, Eun-ha looked up at me and spoke.\n“Han-gyeol, I was a little scared at first.”\n“Huh?”\n“I mean, of course, I’m thrilled to be having a baby with you! But the thought of a child growing inside me… it made me nervous and worried. It was a little scary.”\nEun-ha continued, her voice soft.\n“But the moment I saw you, I realized I didn’t need to worry. It’s my first time seeing you cry, you know.”\n“Cough… Sorry. I wanted to be dependable, but I got overwhelmed…”\n“No, no! That’s not what I meant.”\nEun-ha quickly shook her head.\nThen, she gently placed her hand on my cheek.\n“Han-gyeol, you’re such a strong person, but with me and now our baby, you’re so tender and vulnerable. It made me realize how mature and reliable you are. I’m truly happy to be having your baby. Thank you. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful blessing. I feel like meeting you was the best luck of my life. Han-gyeol, let’s have a group hug—just the three of us! Come here!”\nEun-ha confessed her love with a bright smile and opened her arms wide.\nSeeing her beaming at me, I slowly stepped forward and embraced her tightly.\n“Meeting you was the best luck of my life too, Eun-ha.”\n“Hehe, this feels so nice.”\n“Yeah, it really does.”\n“Han-gyeol, thank you for coming into my life. I love you so much.”\n“I love you too. Thank you for being with me.”\nThe meaning of my life is here, in this moment, with them.\n“Eun-ha, I’ll make sure you’re always happy.”\n“And I’ll make sure you’re happy too, Han-gyeol!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "I called both sets of parents to share the news of my pregnancy. Han-gyeol’s parents, who live in Busan, said they would come up immediately, and I held Han-gyeol’s hand as we headed home.\nTo be honest, I’m a little nervous.\nI know I’m still young to have a child.\nI was slightly anxious, fearing our parents might be furious.\nSensing my worried expression, Han-gyeol squeezed my hand tightly.“Eun-ha, don’t worry.”\n“Huh?”\n“It’s okay. I’ll explain everything.”\n“No, Han-gyeol, this isn’t just your responsibility.”\n“I know. Let’s go inside.”\n“Okay.”\nI unlocked the door and stepped into the house.\nEven though we opened the door, no one greeted us warmly.\nWe carefully took off our shoes and entered, finding my parents sitting on the couch.\nIn the corner of the sofa, my brother was also seated.\n“Sit down.”\n“Yes.”\nHan-gyeol and I cautiously sat on the floor.\nMy mother and brother stayed silent as my father began to speak.\n“So, you’re saying there’s a baby?”\nThe cold tone in my father’s voice scared me a little.\nI understood it was too much to expect a joyful reaction.\nWhile I kept my mouth tightly shut, Han-gyeol, still holding my hand firmly, responded.\n“Yes, it’s five weeks.”\n“The reason we allowed you two to live together was because we trusted this wouldn’t happen. You’re aware of that, right?”\n“Yes, we are. I’m deeply sorry for disappointing you.”\n“Haa…”\nMy father let out a deep sigh.\n“Well, what’s done is done. There’s no point in dwelling on it. What do you plan to do now?”\nI didn’t know how to answer that.\nBut Han-gyeol replied in a serious tone.\n“I will take responsibility.”\n“And how exactly? You just finished your military service, and you still have three and a half years of university left. How will you take responsibility?” ṙἈΝΟꞖÈꞨ\nMy father shot back immediately, targeting Han-gyeol.\nFeeling like Han-gyeol was being scolded too harshly, I spoke up as well.\n“I-I only have one semester left, so I could take a leave of absence, have the baby, and then return—”\n“And after you return? What then? Financial independence? Childcare? Do you think starting a family is that easy?”\nMy father cut me off sharply.\nWhen I was at a loss for words, his gaze shifted back to Han-gyeol.\n“Fine. It’s obvious Eun-ha should take a leave of absence. But what happens after that? You’re not planning to rely entirely on your parents for support, are you?”\nMy father’s harsh words made my mother interject gently.\n“Dear, don’t be too hard on them… Try to be a bit calmer…”\n“No, I need to hear it. Han-gyeol, tell me. What’s your plan moving forward?”\nMy father’s cold words seemed to pierce Han-gyeol.\nI was worried he might feel hurt, but Han-gyeol spoke calmly.\n“I plan to start working as soon as possible. However, I also know this is selfish and irresponsible to say, but I believe I must seek help from both families. As you said, I’m not in a position to take full responsibility right now.”\n“As you admitted, that’s selfish and irresponsible. Are you just asking for help without a concrete plan?”\nMy father’s coldness continued.\nFeeling like Han-gyeol was being scolded too harshly, I spoke up again.\n“Dad…! We—”\n“Stay out of this!”\nIn the end, my father raised his voice.\nI thought he might show a little warmth, but even as my eyes welled up, he didn’t waver.\nBut then, still holding my hand, Han-gyeol spoke.\n“I’m not asking for help without a plan.”\n“Then tell me your plan.”\nHan-gyeol continued speaking steadily.\n“I’ve already passed the first part of the tax accountant exam. Although I took the second part this year, I believe it would be better to prepare for the second exam next year. So, I think it’s right for me to return to school while preparing for the exam. Of course, I also plan to work part-time.”\nHan-gyeol spoke as if trying to persuade my father, but it still didn’t seem to satisfy him.\n“There’s no guarantee you’ll pass the second exam next year. And balancing studies, work, and exam preparation isn’t going to be easy.”\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, Han-gyeol replied to my father’s doubts.\n“I promise to keep my word. No matter what happens, I will take responsibility. Once I obtain the tax accountant license, I’ll immediately take a three-year leave to begin work. That way, financial independence will become feasible. Could you… could you help us for just two years?”\n“You still don’t think this is irresponsible, do you?”\nIt felt like Dad kept putting Han-gyeol down.\nThinking the conversation wasn’t going anywhere, I was about to suggest leaving the house with Han-gyeol.\nBut then, he spoke up.\n“I don’t think this is the time to cling to my pride… I know it’s shameful, selfish, and irresponsible to ask… but I believe this is the only way to ensure Eun-ha and our unborn child can be happy…”\nHearing Han-gyeol’s words, Dad’s stern gaze wavered.\n“Please… help us.”\nSlowly, Han-gyeol bowed his head to Dad.\nMoved by his action, I too bowed my head, waiting anxiously for Dad’s response.\nAn unbearable silence stretched on until Dad let out a long sigh.\n“Whew… Fine. I’ll help you. Now lift your heads.”\nAt his words, both of us slowly raised our heads.\n“Mark my words. Building a family is never easy. There will be times when you’ll have to endure hardships for the sake of your family and moments when you’ll have to swallow your pride. But no matter what, you must persevere. You’re about to become a married couple and parents. Never take that responsibility lightly. Do you understand?”\nI nodded vigorously, tears streaming down my face.\n“Yes, I’ll keep that in mind.”\n“If things had gone as planned, Eun-ha would have graduated next year, and even if you hadn’t had a child, as parents, we were prepared to support you both financially until you graduated. So, consider this the same support we would have provided. For additional expenses, cover them yourselves, but if you fall short, come to us. Do you understand?”\nDad had given us his blessing.\nMom turned her head slightly, wiping away tears.\n“So, when are the in-laws arriving?”\n“Ah—they said they’d come up right away.”\n“They likely haven’t arranged accommodations yet. Tell them to stay here for now. We’ll discuss the plans more thoroughly when they arrive.”\n“Yes…! Understood.”\nFor the first time, Han-gyeol seemed to relax, a hint of relief lighting up his face.\n“From now on, call me Father-in-law.”\n“Yes…! I will, Father-in-law.”\n“Good.”\nJust like that, Han-gyeol truly became part of our family.\nThe tense atmosphere gradually lifted, and the house returned to its usual warmth.\nAs the mood lightened, my brother asked about the baby.\n“So? Do you have a picture of the baby?”\n“It’s in my pocket. Want to see?”\n“Yeah, I do. It’s my niece or nephew now, right? Mom, Dad, aren’t you curious too?”\n“Yes, let’s see our grandchild.”\nI pulled the ultrasound picture from my pocket, and everyone gathered around to take a look.\n“Wow… it’s so tiny. This is my niece or nephew?”\n“It’s only five weeks, so of course, it’s small. They’ll grow big and strong later.”\n“Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl yet?”\n“You can’t tell at five weeks~”\n“So, have you thought of names for the baby?”\nHan-gyeol confidently answered Mom’s question.\n“If it’s a girl, we’re thinking of Eunbyul. If it’s a boy, Hanbyul.”\n“Those are beautiful names. What about you? Do you prefer a granddaughter or a grandson?”\nMom nudged Dad playfully as she asked.\n“Ahem… A grandchild is good enough for me.”\n“Come on, answer properly.”\n“A granddaughter.”\n“You’ll be disappointed if it’s a grandson then~”\n“No, as I said, I’d be happy either way.”\n“People usually pick a nickname for the baby before it’s born. Did you come up with one?”\nMy brother asked about the baby’s nickname.\nCome to think of it, we hadn’t decided on one yet.\n“We haven’t picked one yet.”\n“Really? Eun-ha, didn’t you mention having a strange dream before?”\nAt Han-gyeol’s question, I suddenly remembered a dream I had in Jeju.\n“Oh! Now that you mention it, I dreamt of holding the sun in my hands, and it kind of… merged into me.”\n“Oh my goodness. You dreamt of holding the sun? That means the baby is destined for greatness!”\nMom’s eyes widened as she reacted to my dream.\n“Then let’s call the baby Haetnim*. What do you think, Han-gyeol? Do you like it?”\nI looked at him, and he smiled his usual gentle smile as he replied.\n“Yeah, I love it.”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Haetnim (햇님) - this means sunshine.\nJoin Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord\ninvite/SqWtJpPtm9",

      "content": "Time flew by quickly, and it was already December, with the end of the university semester approaching.\nIt had been three months since Eun-ha and I became husband and wife legally.\nGiven our current situation, a wedding ceremony seemed impossible, so we settled for registering our marriage.\nThe image of Eun-ha’s joyful expression at the district office when we filed our marriage registration still lingered vividly in my mind.\nShe had smiled happily all day, her face glowing with joy, though I wasn’t sure what exactly made her so delighted.University studies, preparations for childbirth, work, and studying for the second stage of the tax accountant exam.\nFor the past three months, I had been juggling all of this without letting anything slip through the cracks.\nSince I couldn’t afford to neglect any of it, I pushed myself relentlessly, as if carving away at my very bones.\nFrom Monday to Friday, my mornings were filled with first-period classes.\nIn the afternoons, I worked at my mother-in-law’s company from 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM.\nInitially, I considered tutoring or finding another job, but my mother-in-law offered me a convenient position and promised to compensate me generously.\nIt was probably because I was her son-in-law, which made me feel a little guilty, but this wasn’t the time to be picky.\nAlthough I could rely on financial support from my parents for now, I knew that once the baby arrived, our expenses would undoubtedly increase significantly. ṟÁꞐ𝐨ʙÈș\nI had no prior experience with parenting, even in my previous life.\nFaced with such uncertainty, I needed to save as much as possible to reduce the unknowns.\nEun-ha also took on some simple video editing work while I was busy with my job.\nI was strongly against it at first, but she assured me it was just a few hours a day to pass the time and told me not to worry.\nAfter observing her for a few days, I saw that she only took on minor tasks, so I reluctantly agreed.\nStill, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy, so I threw myself even harder into my studies and work.\n“Phew… All done.”\nAfter finishing my tasks, I quickly prepared to leave.\nSince I usually left the office about 30 minutes after everyone else, I turned off the office lights and stepped out of the building.\nTaking the subway straight home, I was greeted at the door by Eun-ha, standing with her arms wide open, waiting for me.\n“Darling~ You’re back?”\n“I’m home~”\nEun-ha smiled brightly and wrapped her arms around me.\nThis moment, coming home to her after a long day, was the happiest part of my day.\n“How’s our little Haet doing~?”\n“Hehe. The baby’s movements are much stronger now. She’s growing well.”\nLegally, doctors couldn’t reveal the baby’s gender before 32 weeks, but from the ultrasound, we figured out it was a girl.\nThinking about a daughter who would take after Eun-ha filled me with an endless supply of energy.\n“Eun-ha, shall we start making dinner now?”\nEvery evening, Eun-ha and I cooked dinner together.\nSince we only got to spend time together during lunch breaks and after work, cooking dinner together was our way of catching up.\nIt was also a rare time for us to have deeper conversations.\n“You’re calling me Eun-ha again~”\nEun-ha poked my cheek playfully.\nSince our marriage, we’d decided to address each other as “darling” or “honey,” but I wasn’t used to it yet.\nHonestly, calling her “honey” still felt a little embarrassing, so I rarely said it.\n“D-Darling…! Shall we make dinner now?”\n“Hehe. Honestly, I’m more comfortable with you calling me Eun-ha too. But now that we’re married, we should get used to it, right? Don’t you think, Haet’s daddy?”\n“I’m trying! Are you hungry? Let’s hurry up and make dinner. Our Haet must be hungry too.”\n“Yeah, let’s do it together.”\n“Let me change out of these clothes first~”\n“Okay, go ahead!”\nWhen I came out of the room after changing, Eun-ha was standing there, smiling at me.\nAs I walked over, she quickly placed an apron around my neck and tied the strings.\n“You seem really happy~”\n“Hehe. It’s because I love you so much. Can I hug you one more time?”\n“Come here~”\n“Yes~”\nAs I spread my arms wide, Eun-ha snuggled into my embrace.\n“Darling. Darling. Darling.”\n“Yes, honey?”\n“Oh? You’re calling me ‘honey’ now~?”\n“I told you I’m trying!”\n“Was today’s work tough?”\nWithout hesitation, I shook my head in response to Eun-ha’s question.\n“Not at all.”\n“But you’re studying and working at the same time, even on weekends. You told me not to overwork myself, but aren’t you the one pushing too hard?”\n“Oh, come on~ I’m totally fine. I’m still full of energy!”\n“Still~ I wish you could take at least one weekday off to rest properly. Can I make dinner alone tomorrow?”\n“Nope, not a chance.”\n“Why not~”\nWhen I refused without hesitation, Eun-ha nuzzled her face into my chest.\n“Because I want to spend time with you~ Is that so bad?”\n“No, I’m happy too, but I’m worried you’re overworking yourself.”\n“I’m really not tired~ Besides, you always make lunch by yourself, don’t you?”\n“That’s just heating up leftovers from the fridge!”\nSeeing that she wasn’t going to back down, I gently stroked her head and asked:\n“Do I look worn out these days?”\n“A little? That’s why I want to help you more.”\n“Really, I’m fine~ Thinking about you and our daughter gives me strength I didn’t know I had. So don’t worry too much. But you’re not overdoing it, right?”\nAt my question, Eun-ha immediately lifted her head and responded:\n“Of course not! Thinking about you also gives me so much energy!”\n“Okay, then. Let’s make dinner now. I’m starving~”\n“Alright. But remember, if you ever feel tired, you can lean on me. We’re family.”\n“Got it. You’re the best support I could ask for.”\nEun-ha and I always remained humble about our own efforts while respecting and appreciating each other’s.\nPerhaps that’s the secret to why we haven’t had a single argument as a couple yet.\n****\nThe Next Day:\nAs usual, I had lunch with Eun-ha before heading to work.\nSince I needed to study for the tax accountant exam over the weekend, I planned to finish all my tasks perfectly by the end of the day.\nI’d never made a mistake before, but I wasn’t about to take my work lightly just because I was the son-in-law.\n“Hello, I’m here for work.”\n“Oh, Han-gyeol, you’re here. I reviewed the report you submitted yesterday and sent it out this morning.”\nHuh? Then… does that mean I have nothing to do today?\n“Thank you. Were there any issues with it?”\n“None at all~ There’s no urgent work today, so take it easy.”\n“Can I do that? Everyone else is working hard, so I should too.”\nHearing my reply, my team leader smiled warmly.\nI sat down at my desk, turned on my computer, and began my daily tasks.\nI reviewed the schedule, recorded updates, and made notes on anything unusual.\n“Huh.”\nThat’s when I realized—it had been two weeks since the tax accountant second exam results were released.\nI’d been so busy that I hadn’t even thought to check.\nWell, I was sure I didn’t pass, but I might as well look up my candidate number.\nI logged into the results page and pulled up the list of successful candidates’ numbers.\nPressing Ctrl+F, I typed in my candidate number.\nClick-click-\nMy number appeared with “1/1” in the search bar.\n“Huh?”\nI rubbed my eyes and checked my number again.\nThen I erased the digits in the search bar and re-entered them, meticulously double-checking every digit as I typed.\nEven after that, my number still showed up among the successful candidates.\n“Huh…? W-Why is this…?”\nI pinched my cheek and rubbed my eyes, but the number didn’t change—it was undeniably mine.\nAs the shock of reality sank in, my pupils widened.\nForgetting I was in the office, I suddenly leaped up and shouted.\n“Ahhhhhhhhhh!!”\n“What’s going on? Did something happen?! Which client?!”\nMy team leader stood up, startled.\nI needed to explain the situation, but words wouldn’t come out right.\n“I-I passed!”\n“Passed? Passed what?”\n“The tax accountant exam!”\nWhen I whispered my response, my team members were all taken aback.\nA brief silence hung in the air before everyone started congratulating me.\n“Wow! Really? Didn’t you say you were preparing for next year’s exam?”\n“I didn’t think I’d pass either… I still can’t believe it. Why did I pass?”\n“Still, congratulations!”\n“Han-gyeol, congrats! Eun-ha and the CEO will be thrilled!”\n“Too bad the CEO’s at a meeting—oh, wait! She’s back! CEO!”\nRight at that moment, my mother-in-law walked into the office.\n“What’s all the commotion? What happened?”\n“Mother-in-law!”\nAs soon as I saw her, I greeted her with a bright smile.\n“This is the office, so shouldn’t you be using a different title?”\n“Oh—! I’m sorry. I got too excited.”\n“No matter how good the news, it’s ‘CEO’ in the office, understand?”\n“Yes, understood.”\n“So, what’s the news?”\n“I passed the tax accountant exam!”\nWhen I said it confidently, my mother-in-law—no, the CEO—looked at me with wide eyes.\n“You passed the second exam too?!”\n“Yes! I’ve checked multiple times, and it’s confirmed!”\nHer jaw dropped, but she quickly broke into a beaming smile.\n“Really?! Oh, our son-in-law is amazing!”\n“Thank you! I just found out myself!”\n“We can’t waste time. Han-gyeol, go home immediately. You need to share the news with Eun-ha too.”\n“Yes! I’ll do that! Thank you all for the congratulations—see you tomorrow!”\n“Hurry! Take a taxi and be careful on the road!”\n“Yes—thank you!”\nI couldn’t wait a second longer to share the news with Eun-ha.\nAs soon as I left the office, I hailed a taxi and headed straight home.\nSitting in the backseat, I tapped my feet anxiously until we arrived.\nI quickly paid the fare, dashed up the stairs, and stood in front of our door.\nDing-dong!\nTaking a deep breath to calm myself, I rang the doorbell carefully, not wanting to startle Eun-ha or our little Haet.\n-Who is it?\n“It’s me, Eun-ha.”\n-Oh, honey?!\nHer voice grew louder as she neared the door, and soon it swung open.\n“Honey?! What are you doing home so early?!”\n“Darling, I passed the tax accountant exam! I passed the second exam this year!”\n“What—?! Seriously?! But you said you were sure you failed!”\n“But I passed! I came running to tell you right away.”\n“That’s amazing! You worked so hard for this—it’s really well-deserved!”\nEun-ha beamed with genuine pride, her eyes welling up as she looked at me.\n“Eun-ha.”\n“Yes…?”\n“I’m home, so you need to hug me now. Come on—hurry, with Haet too.”\nI opened my arms wide, and Eun-ha jumped right into them.\n“Honey, you’ve worked so hard…! I felt so bad seeing you push yourself so much…”\n“Oh, come on—what’s there to feel bad about? I promised to make you happy, didn’t I? I’m so happy right now! I love you, Eun-ha, and I love Haet so much!”\n“Me too! I love you so much! Seeing you happy makes me happy too!”\n“Let’s have a special dinner tonight!”\n“Okay! I’ll cook something amazing for you! What do you want?”\nI smiled brightly and replied,\n“Pork bulgogi!”\n--- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]\nSupport Author\nhttps://novelpia.com/novel/174152Join Discord",

      "content": "The new year had come, and the due date for delivery was approaching quickly.\nSince the 30th week of pregnancy, we had moved out of the house near the university and were staying at Eun-ha’s family home.\nWith Eunwoo Hyung and Hyun-joo Noona frequently visiting, Eun-ha was never left alone.\nThanks to the help of her family, the preparations for childbirth were proceeding smoothly.\nWith the delivery due next week, we planned to be admitted to the hospital as soon as the time came.\nThe doctor advised that, for a first-time birth, it would be better for the husband to stay close by to ease the mother’s anxiety.\nAlthough I was currently in the middle of my tax accountant internship, I was fortunate to be training at a tax firm run by a family acquaintance, who kindly accommodated my situation.\nAt first, I was treated a bit like a parachute hire... but well, that’s in the past now.\nThese days, they’ve been saying I should definitely join the firm after my internship ends.\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, the suggested salary they casually mentioned was enticing enough that I might just continue working there.As the due date drew near, Eun-ha became even more mindful of her health.\nShe carefully chose easily digestible meals and took light walks around the house.\nIt seemed like her way of calming her fears about childbirth.\nBecause of this, I hardly left her side, helping her more than usual.\n“Sweetheart, ah~.”\n“Ah~.”\nFeeding her meat with vegetables, Eun-ha smiled happily as she ate.\nWatching her chew thoroughly and swallow made her look incredibly lovely.\n“When you feed me, it tastes even better.”\n“That’s a relief! Want some more?”\n“Mm-hmm, just one more bite.”\nTo avoid putting too much strain on her stomach, we split her meals into smaller portions.\n“Got it. Here, ah~.”\n“Thanks, I’ll enjoy this~.”\nAfter her small meal, Eun-ha and I sat together on the couch, chatting away.\nThough I was trying to ease her worries, I wasn’t sure if my efforts were entirely getting through.\nStill, I resolved to do my best for her.\n“Honey.”\n“Yes, sweetheart?”\n“Hehe, I love it when you call me sweetheart.”\n“Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart.”\n“Yes! Honey!”\nEun-ha answered with a bright smile.\n“Do you prefer when I call you by your name or ‘sweetheart’?”\n“That’s a tough question. I like both, but if I had to choose…”\n“Mm-hmm, if you had to?”\n“I like it when you call me sweetheart.”\n“Why’s that?”\n“Well, anyone can call me by my name, but only you call me sweetheart.”\n“Got it. I’ll call you sweetheart more often.”\n“Thanks~ But honey…”\n“Yes?”\n“Suddenly, I feel like eating pineapple.”\n“I’ll get it for you~.”\nSince Eun-ha got pregnant, she had been craving fruit often.\nSometimes, even in the middle of the night, she’d ask for fruit, so I made sure to stock the fridge with a variety: apples, strawberries, peaches, Shine Muscat grapes, watermelon, pineapple—you name it. ℞ἈƝỔＢЁS\nThanks to online delivery, everything arrived within half a day.\n“Keeping the fridge stocked with fruit is so convenient and efficient!”\n“Anything else you feel like eating?”\n“Nope, just a little pineapple will do.”\nHeading to the kitchen, I grabbed a pineapple, cut it into bite-sized pieces, and brought it back to her.\nEun-ha took a bite and smiled blissfully.\n“Is it good?”\n“Mm-hmm. It tastes even better because you prepared it.”\n“There’s plenty, so let me know if you want more.”\n“This is enough~.”\nAfter finishing the pineapple, Eun-ha leaned back against the couch.\n“I’ll massage your legs and feet. Stretch them out.”\nAs she was in the final month of pregnancy, Eun-ha’s feet and legs had become slightly swollen.\nSince massages were said to help, I did it for her whenever I had the chance.\n“They’re okay for now~.”\n“I just want to do it~.”\n“Hehe, then I won’t refuse~.”\nAs I massaged her legs and feet, Eun-ha happily called my name.\n“Han-gyeol.”\n“Yes?”\n“Nothing, I just wanted to call your name. It’s been a while.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. It’s kind of amazing. At first, it was Han-gyeol, then Gyeol, and now even Honey. It makes me so happy.”\n“I’ll make you even happier.”\n“I don’t know if it’s possible to be happier than this. I’m so happy it feels unreal.”\n“That’s high praise~.”\n“I love you.”\n“I love you, too~.”\nWe gazed at each other lovingly, locking eyes.\n“We should do the same for Haet.”\n“Of course~.”\nGently, I patted Eun-ha’s belly and spoke.\n“Haet, Daddy loves you~.”\n“Mommy loves you too, Haet~.”\n****\nOn the third day of Eun-ha’s hospital stay, her labor pains began in the early morning hours, and she was promptly taken to the delivery room.\nI waited anxiously outside the delivery room with my father-in-law, mother-in-law, and Eunwoo Hyung, praying for the safe delivery to conclude.\nAlthough I had been told that labor for a first child could take longer than expected, my anxiety grew with each passing moment.\nUnable to do anything but wait silently, I couldn’t shake the feeling of guilt.\nThe thought of Eun-ha enduring unimaginable pain broke my heart.\nHours passed as I paced in front of the delivery room until finally, the door opened, and a nurse stepped out.\n“Your baby will be born soon. Could the husband come in now?”\n“Yes…! Of course!”\nI hurried into the delivery room. Following the nurse’s instructions, I washed my hands and donned a blue sterile gown.\nOnce I had put on the sterilized gloves, I entered the delivery room with my heart pounding.\nThe moment I stepped inside, the room was filled with the sound of a baby’s cry.\n“-Waaah! Waaah!-”\nThe robust cries of our baby rang out, and tears instantly welled up in my eyes.\nThrough my blurred vision, I saw my wife, exhausted but smiling as she locked eyes with me.\n“Sweetheart…! Haet is here…!”\n“Yes…! You’ve worked so hard… You’ve done so, so well…!”\nEun-ha and I let our tears flow freely, engraving this moment in our hearts forever.\nWith the help of the nurse, I cut the umbilical cord. After a quick check-up and cleaning, our baby, Haet, was gently placed in Eun-ha’s arms.\nHolding our precious, healthy, and beautiful baby, Eun-ha smiled with pure joy.\n“Hello, Haet… Say hi to Daddy too, okay?”\n“Hi, Haet. I’m Daddy… I’m… your Daddy…!”\nOur tiny, beautiful, and precious daughter.\nThe living, breathing result of our love, she was everything we had dreamed of and more.\nAfter Haet was taken to the nursery and Eun-ha completed a brief examination, she was moved to her hospital room.\nI quickly stepped out of the delivery room to inform the waiting family.\nBy then, my parents had also arrived, and everyone stood up abruptly as I appeared.\n“She’s healthy… She’s here…! And Eun-ha is healthy too…!”\nAt my words, the adults let out a collective sigh of relief.\nMy mother-in-law, her legs giving out from the tension, collapsed onto a chair.\n“Thank goodness…!”\n“You both worked so hard…!”\n“Yes… Thank you all…! Truly, thank you…!”\nThe journey to bring our baby into the world had been a long one.\nIt was only thanks to the help and support of so many that we had made it this far.\nI felt nothing but overwhelming gratitude and joy.\n****\nThe first day after the delivery passed by in such a blur that I could hardly remember anything.\nI massaged Eun-ha’s abdomen in the hospital room and helped her regain her strength.\nI only remembered holding her hand tightly as she finally fell asleep after receiving iron supplements and fluids in the early morning hours.\nThe next morning, during visiting hours, the whole family gathered and headed to the nursery to see Haet.\n“There’s Haet…!”\nThe nurse in the nursery brought Haet close to the glass window for us to see.\nEun-ha and the family all lit up with radiant smiles as they looked at her.\n“Honey, Haet’s nose looks just like yours!”\n“Oh my, you’re right. And doesn’t her mouth resemble Eun-ha’s?”\n“Wow…! This is my niece?!”\n“Shh…! She’s sleeping, so speak softly!”\nSeeing Haet sleeping peacefully made my eyes well up with tears again.\nMy heart swelled with pride and gratitude as I saw how healthy she was.\n“Oh dear, the baby’s daddy is crying again~.”\n“I’m sorry… She’s just so beautiful. Our Haet… She’s so beautiful.”\n“Oh, stop crying already~.”\n“Right, honey~ We should only show Haet our smiles.”\nAfter the brief visiting time ended, the family returned home.\nEun-ha planned to enter a postpartum care center in a few days, and I informed my workplace that our baby had been born healthy and well.\nMy colleagues sent congratulatory messages, celebrating with us.\n“Honey…!”\n“Yes, sweetheart. Do you need anything?”\n“Hehe, I just called for you. At first, I was a bit scared of giving birth, but now that Haet is here, I’m so happy.”\n“Yes, you’ve been through so much. It must’ve been so hard for you.”\nAt my words, Eun-ha placed her hand on my cheek and spoke.\n“Thinking about you helped me endure it.”\n“Thank you…! For saying that.”\nI clasped her hand in mine, holding it gently yet firmly.\n“Honey.”\n“Yes?”\n“I love you.”\n“I love you too. More than anything in the world. I love you as much as I love Eun-ha.”\n“Let’s live happily together, the three of us, from now on.”\nIn response to Eun-ha’s words, I answered with conviction.\n“Yes! I’ll make us happy! You and Haet! Because now, I’m a dad!”\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Three months have passed since Eunbyul was born.\nNow, she can hold her head up and even sucks on her fingers occasionally.\nWatching her do these little things, I couldn’t help but find her utterly adorable.\nBut… parenting was far from easy.\n“Waaahhhhh-!! Waaaahhhhh-!”\nHearing Eunbyul’s powerful cries, my husband and I rushed straight to her.\n“Our little princess, what’s bothering you to bring out those tears?”\n“We just changed her diaper a little while ago, and she’s been properly fed…”\nBoth Han-gyeol and I were first-time parents, so we were clumsy in more ways than one.\nThere were countless things we had to learn:How to change diapers, how to breastfeed properly—\nFrom A to Z, we studied everything without missing a beat.\n“Maybe she just wants to be held! Oh, come here, Eunbyul. Daddy’s got you~”\nThe moment my husband held Eunbyul in his arms, her cries began to subside.\nIt seems like she takes after me because she absolutely adores her dad.\nEven when she cries loudly, she stops as soon as she’s in his arms.\nHonestly, when she grows up and people ask her, ‘Do you like Mom or Dad better?’ she’s going to answer ‘Dad’ without a second of hesitation.\n“Our Eunbyul really loves her daddy~”\n“Looks like it. Must’ve taken after you. Wow, she’s gotten a bit heavier.”\n“She’s three months old now. They say babies double in size compared to when they’re born.”\n“Watching her grow so quickly makes me so happy~ I wonder when our Eunbyul will call me ‘Dad’ for the first time.”\nSince it was the weekend, even though my husband must’ve wanted to relax, he enthusiastically helped take care of Eunbyul with me.\n“It’s too soon for that~ Here, give Eunbyul to me. You should get some rest since it’s the weekend.”\n“No, no, you take a break. I’ll calm her down and put her to sleep.”\n“Oh, come on~ I can’t let you do all the work by yourself.”\n“It’s fine… let’s switch later. We’ll do shifts. You should conserve your energy.”\nLooking at my husband’s haggard face, I felt sorry for him, but I wasn’t exactly in great shape either.\nGetting up multiple times throughout the night had left me utterly exhausted.\nMaybe taking turns to care for Eunbyul in shifts would be more efficient…?\n“Should we do that?”\n“Yeah, I think that’s the best way.”\n“Alright then, I’ll rest for just a little bit!”\n“Okay, go ahead and rest.”\n“Hold Eunbyul on the bed with you. I want to sleep next to you too.”\n“Sure~”\nWe lay down on the bed, with my husband holding Eunbyul in his arms.\nLeaning against the headboard, he looked so happy as he rested.\nOur beautiful daughter, nestled against her dad, gazed intently at me.\n“Our little girl~”\nWhen I spoke lovingly to her, Eunbyul giggled and smiled brightly.\nShe’s so beautiful and precious.\nWhen I gently offered her one of my fingers, her tiny hand wrapped around it.\nSo small yet warm, our little Eunbyul was growing up strong and healthy.\n“Honey.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Our Eunbyul is just so lovable.”\n“Of course~ She’s our daughter, after all.”\nMy husband said that as he gently brushed my hair back with one hand.\nFeeling his warm touch, I smiled and looked up at him.\n“Are you pampering me too?”\n“Of course. Both Eunbyul and you are so precious to me.”\n“I love it when you do that.”\n“It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Did you miss it?”\nAt his question, I shook my head with a smile.\n“Not at all. I can always feel your love for me.”\n“I’m glad to hear that. Our little princess should feel that love too~”\n“Waaah-!”\nAs if understanding our conversation, Eunbyul let out a happy squeal and smiled.\n“Aww~ Do you understand what Mom and Dad are saying, Eunbyul~?”\n“Ah-goo~!”\nHearing Eunbyul’s laughter, my husband smiled like he was the happiest man in the world.\n“Honey, do you think our Eunbyul might be a genius?”\n“Maybe~ What do you think she’ll grab at her first birthday? What do you want her to pick?”\n“Anything is fine as long as she grows up healthy. That’s all I could ever ask for.”\n“What if she brings home a boyfriend?”\nAt my playful question, my husband’s face stiffened slightly as he pulled Eunbyul closer to him.\n“I hope that tragic day never comes…”\n“Really? But look at us, happily married.”\n“Still no. Eunbyul, promise me we’ll live together forever, okay?”\nAt his question, our precious daughter suddenly turned her head and looked at me instead.\n“Hey, hey?! Look at Dad! Sweetie? This isn’t the time to look at Mom~”\n“Seems like she doesn’t agree to living with you forever~”\n“Oh no… That’s troubling! Sweetie? Look at Dad. Daddy’s here.”\nMy husband’s flustered expression was so endearing.\nI have no idea how he’ll handle things when Eunbyul grows up and brings home a boyfriend.\n“Looks like our little daddy’s girl is going to be tough to handle~”\n“I already feel heartbroken…!”\nAnd so, the three of us spent our days filled with happiness.\nOf course… parenting was still incredibly challenging.\n****\nI didn’t even realize when I fell asleep.\nIt was as if someone had cut the film of my consciousness, and I was out.\nIt had been such a long time since I woke up on my own, not to Eunbyul’s cries.\nI sat up, my hair still disheveled, and next to me lay my husband, who had also passed out like me.\nI got up and went to Eunbyul’s crib. She was sound asleep, her tiny breaths steady and peaceful.\nThere was now another person in my life whose very presence brought an uncontainable smile to my face.\nOur precious and beautiful daughter.\nMy parents say Eunbyul’s eyes and mouth resemble mine, while her nose takes after my husband.\nBut if you ask me, she’s the spitting image of her dad. Or maybe that’s just my imagination.\n“Huh?”\nPerhaps sensing my gaze, Eunbyul’s eyes slowly fluttered open.\nI instinctively checked her diaper, wondering if she was uncomfortable, but the moment our eyes met, she smiled brightly.\nHer giggles and radiant smile filled me with happiness.\n“Eunbyul~ Come to Mommy~”\nI lifted her gently and held her close.\nRocking her softly in my arms, she gave me the most innocent, joyful smile.\n“Eunbyul~ Should we go see Daddy?”\n“Ahhh-!”\n“Alright, let’s go see Daddy~”\nI sat on the bed, placing Eunbyul on my lap. Together, we looked at my husband, who was still sleeping.\nEunbyul seemed to enjoy watching her dad sleep, smiling brightly at the sight.\nWithout crying or fussing, she simply watched him for a good ten minutes.\nFinally, feeling the gaze of his daughter and wife, my husband’s eyes slowly opened.\nHis sleepy eyes scanned us before a soft smile spread across his face.\n“Is this heaven…?”\n“What are you talking about, waking up like that? Did you have a dream?”\nAt my question, he replied cheerfully.\n“When I woke up, I saw not one but two angels in front of me. I must’ve been mistaken.”\nAt his compliment, both Eunbyul and I smiled brightly at him.\nSeeing us, my husband’s eyes widened slightly, and he added,\n“Wow, you two smile exactly the same.”\n“Really? But she looks more like you~”\n“No way. That smile just now—the angle and the way the corners of your mouths lifted—it’s exactly like yours. Right, Eunbyul?”\n“Whhh-!”\n“See? Even Eunbyul agrees with me! How is our little one already so smart? Say, ‘Daddy.’ Come on, say ‘Daddy.’”\n“Whhhh-!”\nEunbyul let out a spirited sound, but at just three months old, it was still a bit early for actual words.\n“She’ll need at least nine months for that~”\n“That’s way too long! I can’t wait to hear her call me ‘Daddy.’ I’ll be so happy, don’t you think?”\n“Definitely. If she calls me ‘Mommy,’ I might just float away from happiness.”\n“Trying to become an actual angel? No way. You’re staying by my side forever.”\nMy husband’s sweet words always made my heart flutter, no matter how many times I heard them.\n“Of course~ Once the kids are grown, let’s spend our golden years just the two of us.”\n“Isn’t that thinking way too far ahead? Eunbyul is only three months old~”\n“Raising kids will fly by before you know it!”\n“Will it? Alright, once the kids are grown, we’ll enjoy our time together again.”\n“Absolutely! Let’s make that happen!”\nAs I answered confidently, Eunbyul chimed in with her own sound.\n“Ahhh-!”\n“Oh dear, is our little one upset about us talking about being alone together?”\n“Aww~ Were you feeling left out, princess? Then will you live with Daddy forever~?”\nThis time, I thought she might respond, but Eunbyul simply turned her head slightly away.\n“Our little one… You’re quite decisive, aren’t you?”\n“Must’ve taken after you~ She’s going to grow up to be bold and independent.”\n“Honestly, I’d prefer if she takes after you. It’d be better, don’t you think?”\n“What’s wrong with you? You’re responsible and amazing. Lately, you’ve been even more impressive.”\nHearing my praise, my husband broke into a wide smile.\nHe’s surprisingly weak to compliments, isn’t he?\n“Really? Hearing that from you gives me so much energy.”\n“Are you hungry? Should we eat soon?”\n“Let’s order in today since we’re so tired. What do you feel like eating?”\nGrateful for his consideration, I replied confidently.\n“Pork bulgogi”\n“No, tell me what you want, not what I’d like~”\n“No, really! I’m craving pork bulgogi!”\n“Alright, then pork bulgogi it is.”\n“Whhhh-!”\nBefore I could finish, Eunbyul chimed in, stealing the spotlight.\n“Our little one doesn’t have teeth yet, so no pork bulgogi for you~”\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It’s been nine months since Eunbyul was born.\nBoth my wife and I were gradually getting used to parenting, and now we were much quicker at handling things.\nNowadays, when I return home, Eunbyul often crawls quickly toward the front door.\nJust seeing the picture of Eunbyul on one side of my work desk fills me with energy, even when I feel drained.\n“Han-gyeol, aren’t you leaving yet?”\n“Oh, yes. I’ll leave as soon as I finish this up.”\n“It’s not a busy season, so take it easy~ I’m heading out first.”\n“Alright. See you tomorrow. Have a safe trip home.”\n“Okay~”\nI hurriedly wrapped up my work and left the office.The subway ride home was as suffocating as ever.\nDuring rush hour, people crammed into every station, making it hard to stand properly in this “hell train.”\nAs always, I thought to myself, Should I just buy a car? Yeah, maybe it’s finally time—\nDing-dong!\n- The doors are opening.\n“Ah! Excuse me, I need to get off! Sorry, I’m getting off now!”\nRight when I resolved to buy a car, my stop arrived.\nDragging my tired body out of the subway station, I walked the familiar path home.\nOn the way, I stopped by a fruit store I frequent and picked up a bag of seasonal fruits before heading home.\n“I’m home! Honey, I’m back!”\nAs soon as I opened the door, Eunbyul crawled quickly from the living room to greet me.\nThe sight of my daughter welcoming me with a bright smile instantly washed away the fatigue of the day.\n“Ah-ba! Ah-ba!”\nThe moment I saw Eunbyul’s joyful smile, I dropped my bag and lifted her up.\n“Aww, my sweet girl~ Were you a good girl while Appa* was away?”\n“Ah-buuu!”\n“Really? Such a good girl~ Why is my baby so perfect~?”\nEunbyul burst into giggles, delighted at the sudden change in perspective as I held her up.\nAs I embraced her, my wife came running from the kitchen.\n“Honey~ Welcome home!”\nWith a smile as radiant as Eunbyul’s, my wife looked at me warmly.\nShe wrapped her arms around me, joining the hug, while I held our daughter.\nHappiness overflowed in an instant, and I pulled my wife into the embrace with my free hand.\n“Yeah, I’m back~ Was it tough taking care of Eunbyul?”\n“No, not at all~ You wouldn’t believe how well she’s been sleeping these days. I actually got some work done this afternoon.”\n“That’s a relief. The food smells amazing. What’s for dinner?”\n“I made your favorite—spicy pork stir-fry! And there’s doenjang-jjigae too.”\n“Wow, I can’t wait to eat. Let me just change clothes real quick. Can you hold Eunbyul for a moment?”\n“Sure, go ahead. Eunbyul, come to amma~ Appa needs to change his clothes.”\nMy wife reached out to take Eunbyul, but she clung tightly to my shirt.\n“Here we go again~ She just won’t let go of you once she’s in your arms.”\n“Eunbyul, Appa just needs to change clothes. Can you let go for a bit?”\n“Ah-buuu!”\nHer stubbornness reminded me of my wife’s personality.\n“She really is my daughter, huh? Loves Appa so much. Fine, I guess I won’t let go either~”\nEven though I needed to change, my wife couldn’t resist hugging me again.\n“Honey, hugging you is so comforting.”\n“I feel the same, holding my lovely wife and daughter. I’m so happy.”\n“Let’s stay like this for a little longer. Oh? What’s in your hand?”\n“I bought a bag of fruit on the way home.”\n“You must’ve been tired; you didn’t have to stop. Hehe, but thank you. You’re the best. I love you~”\nMy wife kissed my cheek with a soft mwah.\n“I love you too, more than anything. Now, let me really change this time.”\n“Eunbyul, come to amma now~ Appa needs to rest.”\n“Ah-buuu!”\nEunbyul clung tightly to my shirt again, refusing to let go.\nEventually, I carefully pried her little fingers off one by one and handed her to my wife before she could burst into tears. I quickly changed and came back out. ℝåＮỔ𝐁ÈŚ\n“Eunbyul~”\n“Ah-buuuu!”\nShe immediately wriggled out of her mom’s arms and toddled over to cling to my leg.\nNow I understand why people become doting parents—she’s just too adorable and lovable.\n“Honey, can you watch Eunbyul for a bit? I’ll set the table.”\n“Sure thing~ Eunbyul, let’s play with Appa! Want to fly like an airplane?”\n“Ah-buuu!”\nLying on the sofa, I lifted Eunbyul into the air, moving her around like a flying jet.\nHer laughter echoed through the room, filling my heart with joy.\nAfter a while, my wife called from the kitchen.\n“Honey, come eat!”\n“Alright~ Eunbyul, let’s go eat! Vroooom~”\nI stood up, carrying Eunbyul like a fighter jet, and placed her in her high chair at the dining table.\nAfter securing her bib and handing her a small spoon, I sat down.\nEunbyul had started eating baby food on her own since she turned eight months old.\nAt first, she couldn’t even get the spoon to her mouth properly, but now she’s gotten the hang of it. Still, food often ended up on her bib or around her mouth.\n“Look at you, Eunbyul. You’re eating so well now!”\n“Yeah, she’s definitely learning faster than other kids her age. And she eats so well too.”\n“She’s so adorable.”\nWhen I patted Eunbyul’s head, she smiled just like her mom.\n“Honey, how’s work these days?”\n“It’s not too busy right now, but it’ll pick up in March and May. I’ll probably have to work overtime then. How about you?”\n“Being a freelancer means I can control my workload, but my rates have gone up, so I’m happy. Maybe we should open another savings account? We’ve been saving more than we spend, and this month’s living expenses were even under budget.”\nBoth my wife and I are frugal.\nHer income wasn’t small, and combined with mine, we were steadily building our savings.\nAs we’d promised my father, we were now close to achieving financial independence.\n“Hmm, should we? Why don’t you start your own business? You’re talented enough. What do you think?”\n“Well, I enjoy what I’m doing now, but I’m not confident yet. For now, I want to focus on the steady work I have.”\n“Alright, but don’t overdo it, okay? Remember how you stayed up all night that one time?”\n“Oh, that? The client offered double pay if I finished by the next day, so I couldn’t resist.”\n“Even so, health comes first. You know that, right?”\n“Of course. You too, right?”\n“Absolutely.”\n“Ah-buuu!”\nEunbyul, who seemed upset that only Amma* and Appa were talking, joined in with her own babble.\n“Yes, Eunbyul, you need to stay healthy too. Let’s wipe your mouth~ amma will do it for you.”\nMy wife gently wiped Eunbyul’s mouth with a tissue as she continued to babble,\n“Amm—mmma—”\n“What’s that, Eunbyul? What are you trying to say?”\n“Amm—amma!”\nWhen Eunbyul suddenly blurted out her first word, both my wife and I froze in place.\nOur eyes widened as we looked at each other in disbelief, then immediately turned our attention to Eunbyul.\n“Eunbyul, what did you just say? amma? Say it again—amma!”\n“Amma!”\n“Honey! Eunbyul just said ‘amma’!”\n“Yes! I heard it clearly too!”\nMy wife and I jumped up from our chairs, gazing at Eunbyul with love and astonishment.\n“That’s right. Amma, it’s Amma. Want to say it one more time?”\n“Amma!”\nTears welled up in my wife’s eyes as she heard herself called “amma” for the first time.\n“Oh, my sweet girl! You did so well. Yes, it’s amma.”\nAs my wife beamed with joy, Eunbyul giggled, still clutching her little spoon.\n“Eunbyul, what about Appa? Can you say Appa? Appa!”\n“Aa!”\n“That’s right, that’s right! Let’s try again—Appa! Appa!”\n“A~”\nMy heart started pounding.\nI don’t think I’ve ever felt this excited in my life.\nWith my eyes filled with anticipation, I locked gazes with my daughter.\n“A~ppa!”\nThe moment she said “Appa,” a wave of overwhelming emotion washed over me.\nIt was a feeling too deep and profound to put into words, filling every corner of my heart.\n“Yes, that’s right! I’m Appa! Appa!”\n“Appa! Amma!”\nMy wife and I burst into laughter, soaking in the joy as we celebrated in the living room.\nWe were practically glowing with happiness, forgetting all about dinner for the moment.\n“Honey! Eunbyul called me ‘amma’!”\n“Yes! And I heard her call me ‘Appa’ too!”\n“Is our Eunbyul a genius?! Could she really be?!”\n“I think so, maybe?!”\nWhile we marveled at her brilliance, Eunbyul continued eating her meal unfazed.\n“Alright, let’s finish eating first!”\n“Yes, let’s do that!”\nAfter a meal full of laughter and smiles, we cleaned up quickly and took turns holding Eunbyul.\nI gently patted her back until she let out a small burp, then sat her down on the sofa, looking at her lovingly.\nEunbyul, seemingly puzzled by why her parents were staring at her so intently, tilted her head and looked back and forth between us.\n“Should we try one more time with her?”\n“Yes! Let’s ask her again. Eunbyul, who are we?”\n“Appa! Amma!”\nHearing it again made my heart swell with emotion.\nMy wife and I hugged each other tightly and rolled on the living room floor in sheer delight.\n“Ah~ I’m so happy today.”\n“Me too! I’m so happy!”\nIt was a day filled with endless laughter.\nWe’re Amma and Appa to the most precious daughter in the world.\nLife couldn’t be any better.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Amma & Appa are Korean words for mom and dad.\nJoin Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Eunbyul has grown so quickly and is already 21 months old.\nEvery morning, around seven o’clock, she wakes up on her own and comes to find us in our room.\nToday, she woke up a bit earlier than usual and climbed onto our bed before the alarm clock went off.\n“Amma, Appa~”\nPressing firmly on our arms to wake us, the first thing she said was—\n“I’m hungry~!”\nShe’s a lively little girl who never skips breakfast.\n“Our Eunbyul, you woke up early today~?”\n“Yeees~”\nSince my husband worked late last night, I decided to let him sleep a little longer and got up first.“Eunbyul~ Let’s leave Appa to sleep and head to the living room with Amma. Up we go~!”\nCarrying Eunbyul in my arms, I left the room. However, even as I stepped out, she waved her arms toward her sleeping father and called out,\n“Appa! Appaaaa~!”\nI carefully set Eunbyul down on the mattress in the living room.\n“Appa wants to sleep a bit more, so let’s rest here for a while. Eunbyul, wait—hey, Eunbyul?!”\n“Appa! Appaaaa!”\nAs soon as I set her down, Eunbyul dashed back into the bedroom.\nIt feels like just yesterday that she was crawling, but now she runs around the house so quickly!\nIn a flash, she grabbed the doorknob, opened the door, and climbed onto the bed to wake her father.\nPressing down on his arms and shaking them gently, Eunbyul managed to get him to open his eyes.\n“My little girl is here~?”\n“I’m here~!”\n“Appa wants to sleep a little longer, though~”\n“Nooo~”\nHearing Eunbyul’s firm response, my husband let out a small chuckle.\n“Can’t Appa sleep a little longer~?”\n“Nooo~!”\n“Alright~ Appa will get up. Let’s go~”\nIn the end, Eunbyul brought her sleepy father into the living room with her.\n“Honey, you can sleep a bit longer if you’re tired~”\n“But our daughter says no. What choice do I have? Are you preparing breakfast? Let me help.”\n“No, no~ Just play with Eunbyul in the living room.”\n“Alright. Eunbyul, let’s play with Appa~”\n“Okay~!”\n“Eunbyul, what do you want to play? Go get what you want~”\nAt his words, Eunbyul hurried back to her room and returned with a picture book in hand.\nThe book was filled with animal pictures, which she eagerly handed to her father.\n“Alright, come sit on Appa’s lap~”\n“Okay~!”\nPointing to an animal in the book, my husband asked,\n“Our smart girl, do you know what this is?”\n“Bunny!”\n“Wow~ So clever! What about this one?”\nThrilled by her father’s praise and gentle pat on her head, Eunbyul beamed and answered,\n“Cluck-cluck!”\n“Right! That’s a chicken. Another word for cluck-cluck is chicken. Can you say chicken?”\n“Chicken~!”\n“So smart! And what’s this?”\n“Star!”\n“Wow, you even know this one? You’re amazing! But I bet you don’t know this~”\nOnce again, Eunbyul answered confidently,\n“Balloon!”\n“Correct! It’s a balloon. What color is it?”\n“Red~!”\n“Wow~ You’re so good at this. Come here; Appa will give you an airplane ride!”\nPutting the book aside, my husband lifted Eunbyul into the air.\n“Whoosh~ Eunbyul is flying~ Whooooosh~”\nEunbyul giggled uncontrollably as her father carried her around the house, pretending she was soaring through the air.\nWatching the happy duo, I turned my attention back to the kitchen and quickly started preparing breakfast.\nI made fried eggs, which Eunbyul loves, and carefully plated them on her meal tray.\n“Eunbyul~ Come get your spoon! Honey, come to the table, too~”\n“Eunbyul, let’s go eat breakfast!”\n“Okay~!”\n“What do we do before eating?”\n“Wash hands!”\n“Let’s go wash hands with Appa~”\nAfter washing her hands in the bathroom with her dad, Eunbyul opened the drawer by herself and picked out a small spoon.\nShe even closed the drawer after choosing it. Once seated in her chair, Eunbyul started eating on her own.\n“Eunbyul seems to eat breakfast so well. Maybe she takes after you. You always make sure to eat in the morning.”\n“Right? She’s such a good girl. Eunbyul, is breakfast delicious?”\n“Yeees~”\n“What’s the tastiest part?”\n“The seaweed.”\nEunbyul chewed her food thoroughly as she ate. Her favorites are seaweed and eggs.\nAt first, she didn’t like zucchini, but after watching her mom and dad eat it happily, she now eats it without a fuss.\nThe saying that parents are a mirror for their children feels so true. Eunbyul mimics many of the actions and words my husband and I do.\n“Honey, do you think we should send Eunbyul to daycare next year?”\n“Hmm, some families start around this time, but I think it’s better for her to stay at home a bit longer. Let’s keep an eye on her for now. How does that sound?” ꭆᴀŊȮ₿Ɛs\n“Yeah, nothing’s set in stone anyway. When Eunbyul goes to daycare, you’re planning to go back to college, right?”\n“Of course. What about you? Aren’t you planning to go back too?”\nUnlike me, who only has one semester left, my husband has quite a bit of college left.\n“I’m going to talk to my company about it. I’m thinking of working only in the afternoons.”\n“Our whole family will be going to daycare or college, huh?”\n“Looks like it~ It might be fun going to college together with you.”\n“I think so too~ Let’s take some time off occasionally and go on trips with Eunbyul.”\n“Definitely. Let’s make it happen.”\nAfter finishing breakfast, we spent the rest of the morning playing together as a family. Exhausted from all the fun, Eunbyul eventually fell asleep for her nap.\nI carefully laid her down on the bed in her room and returned to the living room to spend some quiet time with my husband.\n“How long do you think she’ll nap today?”\n“If she naps deeply, it’ll probably be an hour. She even got an airplane ride this morning, so maybe longer. Why don’t you nap too? You worked late last night.”\n“I’m fine~ Sleeping too much makes me even more tired. Are you okay?”\n“I’m always fine when I’m with you~”\nI leaned on my husband’s shoulder, and he gently wrapped his arm around me, pulling me close.\n“Can you believe Eunbyul is already 21 months old? Time flies.”\n“Right? When I was pregnant with her, I never imagined she’d grow this fast.”\n“I know~ Before we know it, she’ll be in school and then an adult.”\n“Even when she’s 20, we’ll still be in our 40s. I’m glad we got married early.”\n“Looking back, yeah. But I was so nervous when I talked to your dad back then.”\n“Are you still scared of him now?”\n“Huh? Not at all. He treats me so well now.”\nI think my dad has felt a little bad about being so stern back then, which is why he’s so kind to my husband now.\n“You were so cool back then, though.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah! You were so cool that I fell for you all over again.”\n“That’s embarrassing~”\n“You’re still cool. So, so cool.”\n“And you’re always beautiful. Not a single moment when you’re not.”\n“Hehe. Hearing that from you makes me so happy.”\nMy husband gently stroked my hair.\nHis touch always feels so comforting and warm, no matter when.\n“You and Eunbyul both love it when I stroke your hair.”\n“Yeah, but why does it feel so nice when you do it?”\n“You’ve loved it since before we got married.”\n“True, from the very beginning and all the way to now. I just love everything Gyeol do.”\nHearing me call him by his old nickname, Gyeol, my husband flinched slightly.\n“It’s been a while since you called me that.”\n“Right? It just came to mind, so I said it.”\n“I like calling you Eun-ha, too.”\nWhen he called me by my name, my heart skipped a beat.\nIt’s just my name, but hearing it made me blush.\n“Wh-why am I embarrassed all of a sudden?”\n“Eun-ha. Eun-ha. Eun-ha.”\nMy heart raced faster.\n“S-stop! It’s bad for my heart!”\nBut my husband didn’t stop.\n“Eun-ha, you’re still as cute and beautiful as ever.”\n“Gyeol, you’re still so cool…”\n“Then why aren’t you looking at me? Look at me properly.”\nI shyly met his gaze, and my already rapid heartbeat quickened even more.\n“Gyeol…”\n“What is it, Eun-ha?”\n“When Eunbyul starts daycare and I graduate from college…”\n“Yeah? What then?”\nI cautiously brought it up.\n“Let’s have a second child…!”\n“Hmm…?! A second one?”\n“Yes! A second one! Don’t you think a three-year age gap is good?”\nHan-gyeol’s lips curled into a slight smile.\n“Really… you’re as lovable as ever.”\n“I-I’m not!”\n“Raising Eunbyul wasn’t easy, you know. Do you think we can handle it?”\n“That’s why we’ll take our time. Eunbyul might feel lonely being an only child. She might even ask for a sibling later!”\n“Alright. Once Eunbyul starts daycare and you graduate, we’ll try for a second child.”\n“Hehe. Thank you for agreeing to it.”\n“No, thank you. Raising Eunbyul made me want more kids. It’s tough, but it makes me so happy.”\nFeeling touched, I gave him a big kiss on the cheek.\n“Alright! Let’s keep going until we’re a family of six!”\n“Deal~”\nRight now, I’m so happy.\nAnd I know our happiness will only grow.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "It’s been quite some time since Eunbyul started attending daycare.\nMeanwhile, my wife and I returned to college and are currently busy with final exams, leading a somewhat hectic life.\nUnlike us, our energetic daughter wakes up leisurely every morning and places her daycare bag next to the shoe rack all by herself.\nWhen praised for her meticulous preparation, she blushes slightly and smiles shyly.\nThis morning, as always, I patted her head after seeing the bag neatly placed by the shoe rack.\n“Why is my daughter so diligent~?”\n“Because I take after Amma and Appa-!”\n“Look at how sweetly she talks. My precious daughter~.”\n“Hehe.”\nNow she flashes me a smile identical to her mother’s.“You smile just like Amma~.”\n“Honey, stop watching Eunbyul eat and come have your breakfast.”\n“It’s more fun watching my little girl than eating.”\n“Appa, hurry up and eat. You don’t want to be late, do you?”\n“Okay, okay. Even Eunbyul’s telling me to hurry.”\n“Fine, I’ll eat now~.”\nWith my wife and daughter’s love surrounding me, I finished my breakfast. After the meal, Eunbyul brushed her teeth with her mom and then came out dressed in her daycare clothes.\n“Honey, can you help Eunbyul put on her coat? I have a first-period exam, so I need to leave early.”\n“Sure, go ahead. Good luck on your exam. Fighting! Eunbyul, say goodbye to Ammaa~.”\n“Amma, do well on your exam~.”\n“Alright, my sweetie. I’m off~.”\nMy wife opened the front door and left the house first.\n“Okay, Eunbyul. Shall we get ready now?”\n“Yes~.”\n“Let’s put on your coat so you won’t be cold~.”\n“Okay~.”\nThey say four-year-olds are at the ‘terrible four’ stage, but Eunbyul was nothing but lovable.\nAfter putting her in an adorable coat, I added a cute pair of earmuffs.\n“My girl looks so pretty~.”\n“Hehe. Thank you~.”\n“Oh, right. What are you going to ask Santa Claus for this year~?”\nWith Christmas approaching, I gently asked her what she wanted.\n“I’ll keep it a secret until we write it down at daycare today.”\n“Really? Can’t you just tell Appa a little bit?”\nEven with my coaxing, Eunbyul shook her head firmly.\n“Okay~. But you’ll tell me after you get your present, right?”\n“Yes~!”\n“Alright then~. Let’s head out now~.”\nAfter changing into my clothes, I left the house with Eunbyul.\nThe daycare was a bit too far to walk, so we headed to the spot where the daycare bus picked up the kids.\nWhen we arrived, other children dressed in similar outfits to Eunbyul were already there.\n“Oh? It’s Eunbyul~! Hi, Eunbyul!”\n“Hi, Haeun!”\nEunbyul greeted her daycare friend warmly. The kids grinned brightly at each other, happy to meet in the morning. They even greeted each other’s parents with polite bows.\n“Good morning, Haeun’s dad~.”\n“Good morning, Eunbyul’s dad~.”\nThe adults responded with warm smiles to the kids’ cheerful greetings.\n“Good morning, Haeun~.”\n“Good morning~.”\nThen the parents exchanged nods as a gesture of greeting.\nSoon, the daycare bus arrived, and Eunbyul boarded it with her friend.\nThe two kids happily found seats together, waving from the window as the bus drove toward the daycare.\nAfter sending off the radiant children, we parents shared brief goodbyes and went about our day.\nBalancing parenting with returning to college left me little time to socialize with other college students.\nIt was the same for my wife. After finishing our morning exams, we met at the college cafeteria to grab a quick lunch.\nAs I entered, I heard an unusual term of endearment in the university cafeteria.\n“Honey, over here. Did Eunbyul make it to daycare okay?”\n“Yeah, she went with Haeun, holding hands. How was your exam?”\n“Mm, I think I did alright. I’m done with exams now. Are you heading straight to work after lunch?”\n“Yeah, I have to. Yesterday’s exam was in the afternoon, so I took the day off. I can’t today.”\n“Got it. I’ll make something delicious for dinner. See you then.”\n“Alright~. Wait for me with Eunbyul~. Let’s eat quickly.”\n“Okay!”\n****\nAfter finishing lunch with my wife, I headed straight to work.\nUpon arriving at the office, I quickly immersed myself in my tasks. Thankfully, work had become much smoother now.\nWith my growing experience, I had gained confidence, and my salary had steadily increased as well.\n“Han-gyeol, will you be here in the mornings starting tomorrow?”\n“Yes, since it’s break time, I’ll start coming in the mornings.”\n“You work so hard all the time. Isn’t it exhausting?”\n“Not at all~ I live happily every day.”\n“That’s good to hear~.”\n“Thank you for always being so considerate.”\nI was genuinely grateful for the kindness of my senior colleague.\n“Alright. I’m heading out for fieldwork and won’t be back. Don’t overwork yourself; take it easy. Have a good weekend.”\n“Sure. Take care, and have a great weekend, too.”\nAfter finishing the remaining tasks, I turned off the office lights and left.\nUnless it was March or May, I could usually have dinner with my family in the evenings.\nI returned home in high spirits, only to find Eunbyul absent and my wife sitting on the sofa.\n“Oh, honey, you’re back?”\n“Yeah. Where’s Eunbyul? Is she already asleep?”\n“Nope~ I asked my mom to look after her for the day.”\nI was puzzled by the sudden decision to leave Eunbyul with my mother-in-law.\nWhen I tilted my head in confusion, my wife patted the spot next to her on the sofa.\n“Come sit for a bit~.”\nThe absence of Eunbyul and the serious look in my wife’s eyes gave me an odd feeling.\nSomething about this situation triggered my male instincts—this didn’t feel like a casual talk.\n“Sit down already~.”\n“Oh, uh, okay…”\nI sat on the sofa, feeling slightly apprehensive, as my wife fixed her gaze on me.\n“I wanted to talk about Eunbyul’s Christmas present~.”\nAh, so that’s what this was about.\n“Oh, really? But did you have to leave Eunbyul with your mom just for that?”\nIsn’t this secrecy a bit over the top?\n“I thought it’d be best to prepare her birthday present today, too.”\n“Already? There’s still some time until Christmas. Did she say she wanted it early? What does she want, anyway?”\nEunbyul rarely asked for things. She wasn’t devoid of desires but never made a fuss over them either.\n“At daycare today, they asked the kids to write down what they wanted for Christmas and turn it in. When I picked her up, her teacher gave me the paper with what Eunbyul wanted. Do you want to see it?”\nMy wife pulled a small piece of paper from her pocket.\n“What did she write?”\n“Take a look yourself~.”\nShe handed me the paper, and I unfolded it.\nOn it were two neatly written characters.\nYounger sibling\n“Huh...? A sibling..?”\n“Yup, Eunbyul must feel lonely. So… honey…”\nMy wife gave me a sly smile, moving closer.\nHer breath quickened, and her eyes shimmered with a bubbling mix of desire and determination.\n“Shall we make Eunbyul’s little sibling tonight?”\n“H-Honey...? Could you ease up on the intensity? You’re looking like a predator right now.”\nThough our physical relationship wasn’t nonexistent, it had significantly decreased since having Eunbyul. It usually happened only when my mother-in-law took care of her.\n“Honey… today is my ovulation day. And you haven’t had much recently either, right? Let’s make it all count tonight.”\n“Well, we did plan for a second child, and the timing is right, but shouldn’t we talk about it more—”\nAs I hesitated and leaned back slightly, my wife’s face shifted to a pout. Her cheeks puffed up, and she looked adorably frustrated.\n“Honey?”\n“Eunbyul said she wants a sibling, and we’ve reached a stable place now, haven’t we? Financially and emotionally, we’re ready for this.”\n“That’s true. We’ve saved up quite a bit.”\n“See? You agree. Plus… we’re practically in a sexless marriage! I want you—deeply. I can’t hold back anymore with just kisses and hugs. So…”\nMy wife slowly tugged at my shirt.\n“I’m going to devour you tonight.”\nBefore I could respond, she closed the gap between us, pressing her lips against mine in a passionate kiss.\n“Mmm…!”\nIt had been a while since we’d shared such an intense, lingering kiss.\nOur tongues intertwined as the living room filled with soft, intimate sounds.\nWhen we finally broke the kiss, a thin string of saliva connected us.\n“Honey…”\n“Yes, my love?”\n“Should I take a shower first?”\nWhether it was back then or now, my wife was always the bold one.\nAnd honestly, I had been holding back for quite some time myself. With Eunbyul at her grandma’s, this was a rare opportunity.\n“Let’s shower together.”\n“Hehe, okay~! Eek!”\nI scooped her up from the sofa.\n“Hehe. It’s been a while since you’ve carried me like this.”\n“I’m going to make up for all the waiting tonight. Think you can handle it?”\nHer cheeks flushed as she whispered softly.\n“Yes. All night long.”\n“Good thing it’s the weekend tomorrow.”\n“Let’s head to the shower, honey.”\n“Alright~.”\nStill holding her, I walked us to the bathroom.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "As soon as we entered our private bedroom, my wife released all the emotions she had been holding back.\nWithout hesitation, she pulled me close, holding my face firmly as she pressed her lips to mine. Her kisses were unusually intense, carrying a sense of urgency and passion that left me breathless.\nIt wasn’t just a kiss—it was an expression of unfiltered emotion, deep and lingering, the kind that left my head spinning.\nHer movements were deliberate, every touch and motion igniting a warmth between us. The world around us seemed to fade as I wrapped my arms tightly around her waist, holding her close as she surrendered into my embrace.\n“Darling… Darling…”\n“Yes, my love?”\n“I love you so much—!”\n“Whoa—!”\nIn a playful yet heartfelt move, she pushed me onto the bed, her laughter ringing softly in the air.\nHovering above me, her gaze was filled with affection and admiration. She reached out, brushing her fingertips against my cheek with a tenderness that made my heart race.“It’s been so long since I’ve looked at you like this… You’re even more handsome than I remembered.”\n“R-Really? It feels like it’s been a while for me too. And you… you look even more beautiful tonight.”\n“Thank you. I love you, darling… more than I ever thought possible.”\n“I love you too. Every day, I find new reasons to love you even more.”\n“Hehe… thank you… I love you so much.”\nLeaning in once more, she kissed me, her lips lingering on mine.\nI slowly put my hand inside her gown and caressed her bare skin.\nI loved her heavy breathing as she twisted her body back and forth on top of me.\n“Darling… hold me closer.”\n“How close do you want me to hold you?”\n“Just… like this. Don’t let go.”\nI responded by carefully guiding her down onto the bed.\nHer robe loosened slightly as she leaned back, revealing glimpses of her elegance.\n“Ha…!”\nMy hands brushed along her back, tracing gentle patterns on her skin.\nAs I caressed her breasts slowly and loudly, my wife’s moans also became rougher in response to my touch.\n“Honey… Give me a kiss too..!”\nAs my wife requested, I carefully touched her lips with mine.\nAs we gently pressed our lips together, my wife hugged my neck as if she wanted a rough and rich kiss.\nIs it because it’s been a while? She was very active today.\nHer vagina was already soaking wet as her body was tightened.\nMy hand, which was on her chest, moved down and lightly touched her clitoris.\n“Mmm..!”\nShe flinched loudly at the slightest touch.\nWhen I stopped kissing and started to caress my hand around her clitoris, she started to become more aroused.\nThe sight of her holding her mouth and squeezing the bed sheets with her hands was so erotic and lovely.\nAs I continued to caress her, taking in her lovely appearance, my wife lifted her waist in the air.\n“Ha… !! Mmmmm…!”\nHer waist, which had been floating for a moment, fell back onto the bed.\nHer body was hotter than before and she was calming down her orgasm with her heavy breathing.\n“Honey. It feels evilly good!?”\nBefore I could finish my words, my wife tugged on my collar.\nShe spoke in a dirty voice in my ear while hugging me tightly.\n“Honey… Honey, I can’t stand it..fuck me quickly..fuck me quickly…! Honey, put it in.. fuck it deep and hard, fast…!”\nWhat she was saying was unusual.\nIt’s been a long time since she spoke so openly.\nShe must have been very excited… But that’s why I wanted to tease her even more.\n“Yes. I’ll put it in.”\nHaving said that, I inserted my finger inside her.\nAs I moved my fingers inside her drenched vagina, she lifted her chin and let out a moan.\n“Mmmm… ! Ha..! Honey… honey..”\n“Yes. I’m here now… “\n“I love it… Give me more… ! Put it deeper… “\nMy wife’s words continued to stimulate my lust.\nFinally, as I inserted my finger deeper into her, her moans filled our bedroom.\n“Hmm… ! haha! Honey..! Honey… Ahhhh!”\nHer love juice soaked the bed sheets.\nI couldn’t bear it any longer, so I stopped my fingers.\n“Baby. I can’t stand it either. I’ll put it in.”\nI held onto her waist and slowly guided my cock inside her.\nMy wife nodded her head at my words and prepared to accept me.\n“Yes..! Put it in, honey… “\n“I love you.”\nI stuck my dick inside her.\n“Ugh… !”\nIt was now inside her, and her vagina was tightly covering my dick.\nMy wife’s waist began to tremble as she climaxed at the same time.\n“Ha… ! Mmmmm… !”\n“Baby, you’re so sexy right now.”\n“It’s because of you honey… I love having sex with you… Please move…What should I do now…! I feel like I’m going crazy…! Please move quickly… “\nWhen I saw her dirty voice and expression, it was also difficult for me to bear it.\nIt was our first time in bed in a long time, and I didn’t want to endure it any longer.\nI wanted to hear more of her erotic moans and I wanted to stick my cock inside her.\n“Baby. Tell me if it hurts.”\nI grabbed my wife’s waist tightly.\n“It doesn’t hurt… Because it doesn’t hurt… ! Ahhhhhh-!”\nAnd then I moved my waist roughly.\nAs I moved my waist violently, my wife grabbed my arm tightly.\n“Haaa!! Yes-! Huh-!”\nThe facial expression she makes while letting out an intense moan.\nHer breasts moving with intense movement.\nHer temperature was also so hot.\nThere was nothing that was not beautiful.\nEverything about her was so lovely from start to finish.\n“I love you..!”\n“Me too… I love you too honey…! Kiss Me..!”\nI leaned forward and pressed my lips to hers.\nAs we continued kissing and having sex at the same time, my wife’s climax came quickly.\nShe started squeezing my cock harder.\nShe wrapped her arms around my neck and wouldn’t let me go.\n“Hmm..! Ha… !”\n“You can come…Don’t hold back.”\n“Wow… !! Mmmmm… !”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, my wife’s entire body began to tremble.\nThe intense vibrations reached me.\nHowever, before her climax could go away, I moved my waist again.\n“Ha… ! Honey… Honey now…! I’m very sensitive..! Ahhhhh-!”\nAs I stimulated her again, she bit her lower lip tightly.\nHer eyes widened and she tried to hold on to the unbearable climax, but she quickly broke down.\n“Haaa! Honey… ! Honey..!”\nHer skin and my skin clashed violently, increasing the heat.\nShe writhed her body this way and that, as if she couldn’t stand it, but the more she did it, the more I stuck my cock into her weak spots.\nShe was, after all, the one who accepted me while holding tightly to my hair.\n“Haaa! Yes-! Honey… I’m… I… again… !”\n“I think I’m going to cum too..!”\n“Yes… ! Cum it inside…! Please cum in the deepest place… !”\nJust before the feeling of ejaculation I had been holding in was about to explode, I pulled my wife’s waist towards me.\nAs I poured a lot of semen into the deepest part of her, she also shook her back and accepted me.\nShe said with a happy smile on her face as I stroked her head as she climaxed for a long time.\n“Haa..Haa..Honey.”\n“Yes. Babe.”\n“… I really like you, honey. I still get excited just by looking at you.”\nI also chuckled at her words and kissed her forehead.\n“I really like you too.”\n“Honey… “\n“Yes, yes.”\nWhen I answered, she looked embarrassed and said,\n“Honey, please one more… Fill me full of you honey.”\n“Isn’t it difficult?”\n“Not at all…I love it…I want to do it all night…I want to have sex with my honey all night long.”\n“Actually, me too. Let’s do it all night?”\n“Hehehe… good. Please continue like this… Honey, it’s still hard… “\n“Is it okay to move right away?”\n“Yes… Please do more…More… Cum a lot inside me…”\nHer tone was so erotic that I swallowed my saliva without realizing it.\nI slowly moved my waist again and my wife slowly accepted me.\n“Huh…Honey, I can feel it coming in….”\n“Do you know that today you are very sexy”\n“Yes. Know…! So please do more… Just wrap it inside… Please fill me up… I won’t let you go until you fill me up..”\nMy wife hugged me tightly.\nAnd she spoke in my ear with half air and half sound.\n“Until I get pregnant… You need to fuck me…”\nMy wife’s words were so erotic and honest that my eyes were dizzy.\n“Sometimes, when I look at you, I think you’re too sexy.”\n“Honey, I want to have another baby… Let me have it… Are you going to do it?”\n“Yes. Let’s have a second one.”\n“Hehehe… Then come quickly… !”\nAs soon as I moved my waist, a moan escaped her.\n“Hmm…!”\nAt first, lightly and slowly.\n“Ha…Ha…! Honey…”\nWith each stroke, a faint moan escaped her.\nIt was so cute to see her flinch when her weak spot was touched.\nAnd soon she moved her waist on her own and matched my movements.\nI don’t know why every single action is so lovely.\nI should make her feel better.\nI moved my waist faster and faster.\nOur movements synchronized and I thrust my cock deep inside her.\nMy wife’s body convulsed for a moment due to the sudden movement, but it did not stop.\n“Haaaaaaa-!! Aaaaaa Haaa- Mmmmm!”\nMy wife let out a loving moan at my actions.\nAs if to reciprocate, I continued to touch only her weak spots, and she looked into my eyes and said,\n“Honey…Honey..! I..I can’t do it..! This…This..! Ahhhh-!”\n“Ha…I think I’m going to cum too…I love you, baby.”\n“I…I love you too…! Cum inside me…! Everything inside me…!”\n“I’m going to cum now…!”\nI ejaculated while looking into her eyes.\nIt was she who pulled my body strongly and accepted all of my semen.\nHer whole body convulsed, and her waist shook violently for a long time as if her lingering sensation did not go away.\n.bg-ssp-10448{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:flex;justify-content:center;}\n.bg-container-10448f61e68{ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center; z-index: 2147483647 !important; } .bg-container-10448222eb6{ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center; z-index: 2147483647 !important; }\nEventually, the strength began to drain from her body, and her body fell limp.\nShe said as she looked lovingly into my eyes.\n“Honey…”\n“Huh?”\n“I’m 100% pregnant…”",

      "content": "Today was Christmas, a day for our whole family to spend together.\nLast night, on Christmas Eve, we all worked together to decorate the tree. Eunbyul had so much fun!\nIn fact, she stayed up late in the living room, staring at the tree, until she fell asleep.\nThis morning, I woke up early to check something very important for Eunbyul’s gift.\nI took a pregnancy test—and the result? As expected, two bright, unmistakable lines appeared.\n“Honey!” I called. “Honey!”\nI walked out of the bathroom, holding the test.\n“Yes, yes—what’s the result?!”\nMy husband, who had been anxiously waiting in the living room, eagerly reached for the pregnancy test. I handed him the test with the two clear lines.\nEven though we had expected this, he beamed brightly and pulled me into a warm hug.“Thank you, Sweetheart.”\n“Hehe, no, thank you!”\n“Eunbyul will be so happy.”\n“Yes, I think she’ll be overjoyed.”\nAs we hugged each other, savoring the joy, Eunbyul emerged from her room, rubbing her sleepy eyes.\n“Amma… Appa…? What are you doing?”\n“Oh, our sweet daughter~ What did you wish for as your Christmas gift?”\nMy husband picked up Eunbyul and asked her. Her big eyes sparkled as she answered.\n“A sibling! Is there a baby in Amma’s belly?!”\n“Yes, our Eunbyul is going to have a sibling~ There’s a baby in Amma’s belly!”\n“Waaaah! Appa! Put me down! Hurry!”\nWhen my husband set Eunbyul down, she darted over to me and hugged me tightly.\n“Amma!”\n“Yes, my sweet daughter~”\n“Hehe, is there really a baby in your tummy?”\n“Yes! Eunbyul’s little sibling is in my tummy.”\n“Waaaah! Can I touch it?”\n“Of course~”\nI sat on the sofa, and Eunbyul carefully placed her small hand on my belly.\n“When will my sibling come out?”\n“In about ten months~ Why? Are you that eager to meet them?”\n“Yes!”\nEunbyul answered confidently.\n“When your sibling comes, will you take good care of them?”\n“Yes! I’ll take such good care of them because I wished for this gift!”\n“It might be hard—are you sure you’ll be okay?”\n“Amma and Appa took great care of me, so I’ll do my best to take care of my sibling too.”\n“Awwwww~ How lovely! How can our Eunbyul say such sweet things~?”\n“Hehe, because I’m just like you, Amma~”\nShe was such a kind and thoughtful daughter. It felt like I could never get enough of her.\n“Eunbyul, now that there’s a baby in Amma’s belly, you have to be extra careful, okay?”\nMy husband sat next to Eunbyul and spoke gently.\n“Yes~ Don’t worry!”\n“And you, Sweetheart, take good care of yourself from now on, okay? Try to cut back on work a little, all right?”\n“Yes~”\nBoth Eunbyul and I cheerfully answered his questions in unison.\n“You two are so alike, it’s uncanny.”\n“Hehe. Oh, is my sibling going to be a baby sister or a baby brother?”\n“We don’t know yet~ But we’ll find out in a few months. Would you prefer a little brother or a little sister?”\n“Hmm~ I want a baby brother!”\n“Really~?”\n“Yes!”\nWill Eunbyul’s wish come true, and will the second baby be a boy?\nIf so, his name will probably be Hanbyul.\nWhen this little one is born, our home will undoubtedly become even happier.\n****\nSeveral weeks had passed since we confirmed the pregnancy.\nFor today’s routine check-up, we left Eunbyul with my in-laws and headed to the OB-GYN together.\nI was filled with excitement since we’d be able to see the gestational sac on the ultrasound today.\nHowever, what we heard during the appointment was far more surprising than we had anticipated.\n“Congratulations! You’re having twins~”\nThe doctor smiled brightly as she shared the news.\nBoth my husband and I were so shocked that our eyes widened in disbelief.\n“Tw-twins?”\n“Yes, twins~ See here? You can clearly see two gestational sacs.”\nThe doctor showed us the ultrasound image, and we immediately spotted them—two distinct sacs were clearly visible.\n“Wait…! If there are two sacs, does that mean they’re fraternal twins?”\n“That’s right! You’re well-informed. We can’t determine the genders yet, but they are indeed twins.”\n“Oh my goodness…”\nMy husband stared intently at the ultrasound image.\n“For fraternal twins, can their genders be different?”\n“Yes, fraternal twins result from two separate eggs being fertilized, so their genders can be the same or different. Both babies are growing healthily, so there’s not much else to mention. I’ll see you at your next appointment. Make sure to eat nutritious meals and get plenty of rest, okay?”\n“Yes, thank you so much! We’ll see you next time.”\n“Take care on your way out~”\nAfter leaving the consultation room, my husband and I scheduled our next appointment and headed toward the hospital parking lot.\nOnce inside the car, my husband kindly buckled my seatbelt for me.\n“Honey, we’re having twins! Hanbyul and Saetbyul are coming together!”\n“I’m so thrilled too. But twins… It’s still hard to believe.”\n“Right? I was so shocked too~ I think we’re incredibly blessed.”\nHearing my words, my husband, seated in the driver’s seat, smiled warmly at me.\n“Eunbyul will be so happy to have not just one sibling but two.”\n“Yes, yes! Once we have twins, we’ll only need one more baby~ Hehe.”\n“Are you scared? It was hard when you gave birth to Eunbyul, wasn’t it?”\n“No, I’m not scared! I have you, my super reliable and amazing Honey.”\nMy husband chuckled contentedly at my words and leaned toward me.\n“Let me give you a hug. Come here.”\n“Okay~”\nAs I wrapped myself in my husband’s arms, I felt his warmth.\nIt was so comforting and filled me with happiness.\n“Honey, Honey. Did you know that the chance of getting pregnant during the fertile period is only 20–30%? But for us, it happens every time~”\n“Right? I heard it’s usually not this easy to conceive.”\n“Looks like my eggs and your sperm are super healthy~!”\n“Seems like it. Anyway, let’s get going. We need to share the news with Eunbyul and our parents.”\n“Yes, yes! They’ll be over the moon. Let’s go get some congratulations!”\nI was in such high spirits, feeling incredibly excited.\n“On the way home, let’s pick up some fruit. What are you craving most?”\n“Hmm~ Strawberries today.”\n“Back when you were pregnant with Eunbyul, you ate a lot of peaches. What about peaches?”\n“Hmm~ This time, I think I’ll eat a lot of strawberries!”\n“Alright, let’s buy a whole box of strawberries~”\n“Hey~ That’s way too much~”\nOur plans to expand our family were unfolding much faster than we had imagined.\nHaah—ever since I met my husband, every single day has been pure joy.\n****\n“We’re here~”\nAs soon as we arrived at my in-laws’ house, Eunbyul, who had been sitting in the living room, came running toward us.\n“Amma! Appa!”\nMy husband scooped up the running Eunbyul and held her in his arms.\n“Our sweet Eunbyul~ Have you been listening to Grandma and Grandpa?”\n“Yes!”\nRight behind Eunbyul, my mother and father also came to greet us.\n“You’re here? So, how’s the baby?”\n“Doing really well! Oh, and we have something else to tell you too~”\n“Alright, come on in.”\nMy husband and I took off our shoes and stepped inside the house. After washing our hands, we sat down in the living room. Eunbyul quickly climbed onto her appa’s lap.\n“Oh my, look at her—sitting on her appa’s lap the moment he arrives. Does Eunbyul love her appa that much?”\n“Yes!”\n“You’re so lucky. Your adorable daughter just follows you around everywhere.”\n“Haha, it’s probably only while she’s young. She won’t do this when she grows older.”\nHearing this, Eunbyul tilted her head in confusion.\n“Why not?! I want to sit on Appa’s lap forever.”\n“Really~? Even when Appa becomes an old, bent-over grandpa?”\n“Then Appa can sit on my lap.”\n“Pfft—! Alright, I’ll count on you, my sweet daughter~”\n“Okay~”\nThe conversation veered off-topic for a bit, but my father brought it back.\n“So, didn’t you say you had something to share? What is it?”\n“We’re having twins!”\nAt my father’s question, I immediately answered.\nAfter a brief moment of silence, my in-laws’ jaws dropped, and they exclaimed.\n“What?! Twins?! Are you serious?!”\nMy husband and I nodded at my mother’s astonished reaction.\n“Honey, did you hear that? We’re getting two more grandchildren.”\n“You two surprised us when you told us about Eunbyul, and now you’ve done it again…”\n“We were just as surprised! They’re fraternal twins.”\n“Oh my~ Eunbyul, you must be so happy! You’re getting two siblings!”\nMy mother spoke to Eunbyul, who was still sitting on my husband’s lap.\n“Yes! I’m super happy!”\nEunbyul smiled brightly at Grandma’s words, clearly overjoyed.\n“Our son-in-law is going to have a lot on his plate. If it gets too much, let us know.”\nMy father gave my husband a sympathetic look, but my husband smiled sheepishly and replied.\n“It’s alright. The timeline moved up a bit, but we always planned for four kids anyway. My wife always said two would never be enough.”\n“I never thought she was serious about that…”\n“Actually, neither did I…”\nBoth my father and husband turned to look at me.\n“W-what?! I’ve always wanted four kids!”\n“Amma, Amma, am I really getting another sibling?”\n“Of course! Wouldn’t having three siblings be even better?”\n“Hehe, I love it!”\n“Alright, Amma and Appa will work even harder for you.”\n“Okay~”\nI can’t wait to have the twins and then our youngest child too.\n“The more, the!”\nWhen Eunbyul said that, everyone froze on the spot.\nWhat?\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Quite some time had passed since the twins were born.\nThe second child was a healthy baby boy, Hanbyul, and the third was a healthy baby girl, Saetbyul.\nThe twins weren’t fussy and slept well, making parenting easier than expected.\nHowever, they rarely smiled, which seemed to bother our eldest daughter.\n“Hey, you two~ Can you smile for your Unnie? Peek-a-boo!”\nDespite Eunbyul efforts, the twins barely reacted.\nThey tilted their heads with indifferent expressions, refusing to give her the smile she wanted.\n“Appa…”\n“Yes?”\n“I think the twins don’t like me…”Come on, kids, give her a smile.\nMaybe their reluctance to smile is something they inherited from me. Of all things to inherit…\nAs I pondered how to comfort her, my wife came out from the kitchen.\n“That’s not true! The twins love you so much, Eunbyul~”\n“Really?”\nSitting next to Eunbyul, my wife gently stroked her hair.\n“Of course~ Now, can you step into your room for just a moment?”\n“Okay~”\nAt her mother’s words, Eunbyul trotted off to her room.\nThe moment Eunbyul disappeared from the living room, the twins began to glance around…\n“Waaaaahhhh!”\n“Waaaaahhhh!”\nTheir loud cries echoed through the house.\n“Eunbyul~ Come back quickly!”\n“Coming~!”\nAs soon as Eunbyul returned to the living room, the twins immediately stopped crying.\nHanbyul and Saetbyul crawled toward Eunbyul and nestled next to her.\n“See? The twins cry a lot when you’re not here. So make sure to stay with them often, okay?”\nEunbyul’s smile returned as she firmly held the twins’ hands.\n“Hehe. Okay! Hanbyul, Saetbyul, let’s have lots of fun together!”\nThe three siblings sat in the middle of the living room, spending time together.\n“How did you know? That the twins cry when Eunbyul isn’t around?”\n“Well, Eunbyul takes such good care of her siblings, so they’ve grown really attached to her.”\n“It’s so nice to see them getting along.”\n“And the twins are growing so well. They’re calm, so raising them hasn’t been too difficult.”\n“Yeah, they sleep well and don’t cause too much trouble.”\n“Must take after you.”\nMy wife smiled softly and leaned her head on my shoulder.\n“If you’re tired, take a nap. I’ll watch the kids.”\n“But sitting here with you, watching the kids, makes me so happy~”\nI gently held her hand.\nShe smiled warmly at my touch and leaned closer to me.\n“I’m happy too.”\n“Should we just go ahead and have our youngest now?”\n“Maybe we should wait until the twins are in daycare?”\n“But then the age gap between Eunbyul and the youngest might be too big.”\n“You’re right.”\nWe were in a good place now, so having another child wouldn’t be a strain.\nWhile the idea of having another child brought joy, I couldn’t ignore the burden it might place on my wife.\n“Let’s think about it step by step.”\n“Okay, no rush. I wasn’t being entirely serious anyway.”\n“So, you were kind of serious~?”\n“Hehe. You caught me.”\nShe was as adorable and lovely as ever.\n“Amma! Appa!”\nAs I admired my wife, Eunbyul called out to us loudly.\n“Yes, Eunbyul? What is it?”\nMy wife and I both turned to look at the children, and the twins—\n“The twins are standing up!”\nThey were standing on their own, balancing on the floor.\nSeeing this, my wife and I immediately jumped off the sofa.\n“Wowww!”\n“Wooow!”\nWe cheered loudly, and the twins burst into laughter.\nWe clapped and encouraged the twins, who took a few steps in different directions before plopping back down.\nI scooped them up in my arms and lifted them high into the air as my wife and Eunbyul clapped and ran around the living room.\n“Oh, my precious twins~ I’m so proud of you!”\n“Appa! Me too! Lift me too!”\n“Of course~ Our amazing Eunbyul!”\nAfter setting the twins back on the floor, I lifted Eunbyul high into the air.\nThe more kids we had, the more laughter filled our home.\nI couldn’t be happier.\n****\nAfter putting all the kids to bed, my wife and I returned to the living room.\nWe hugged each other, sharing silent encouragement, grateful for surviving another day.\nStill, it felt like a waste to just go to bed on such a peaceful night.\n“Hey, want to share a can of beer before we call it a night?”\n“Ooh! Let’s do it! I’ve been feeling the same way!”\n“You sit on the sofa and relax. I’ll handle everything.”\n“Hehe, alright~”\nI left her on the sofa to rest and quickly prepared some snacks.\nAfter setting the beer and food on the coffee table, I carefully opened a can of beer.\nIf even one of the twins woke up, this heavenly moment would come to an abrupt end.\nSsssshhhhh...!\nThe sound was unbelievably soft and cautious.\nThe absurdity of being so meticulous over something so trivial made both of us stifle our laughter.\nIt was funny how two grown adults acted like teens sneaking drinks.\n“Pfft...!”\n“Shh, honey! If the kids wake up, we won’t even get a sip.”\n“I know, but this is too funny! Open mine too.”\n“Alright, watch this.”\nSsshhhk!\nI misjudged my strength, and the can popped open with a crisp sound that echoed in the living room.\nEyes wide, we instinctively locked gazes.\n“That was close!”\n“Yeah, I almost had a heart attack!”\nThankfully, the disaster was averted.\n“Cheers, honey!”\n“Yeah! Cheers!”\nWe carefully clinked our cans together with a soft tap.\nThe moment felt more thrilling and joyful than ever.\nShe took a sip of her beer, then a bite of the snacks, her face lighting up with a smile.\nHer happiness was contagious, making her all the more lovable.\nThen, she reached over to feed me a bite.\n“Say ah~”\n“Ah~”\nShe watched me eat with a look of pure delight.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Just because. How is it that you’re getting even more handsome?”\n“I think that’s just how you see me.”\nShe shook her head firmly.\n“No way. You’ve gotten even more dashing. Why are you so amazing?”\n“Ah, stop! You’re embarrassing me!”\nI turned my head and sipped my beer to hide my flushed face.\nShe giggled, enjoying my reaction.\n“Hehe, honey, do you still get shy when I compliment you?”\n“I never said I was shy.”\n“Yes, you do~”\nFrom the day we met, she’s always looked at me with such affection.\nI thought that over time, it might fade, but every time I saw that expression, my heart still fluttered.\n“How can anyone not feel shy when you look at them like that?”\n“Huh? How do I look at you?”\nShe asked, genuinely curious.\nIt felt embarrassing to explain.\n“Just look in a mirror.”\n“No, tell me! Please, honey~”\nHer playful insistence finally made me cave.\n“Then... You always look at me like I’m...”\n“Like you’re...?”\n“The most precious thing in the world.”\nHer eyebrows lifted slightly in surprise.\n“When you look at me like that, I feel like I’m someone amazing. It’s hard to explain, but that look gives me so much strength. Even when I’m tired or overwhelmed, seeing your expression lifts me up. It’s not overbearing; it’s comforting, like genuine encouragement.”\nShe smiled warmly as she responded.\n“You are amazing.”\n“That’s such an embarrassing thing to say!”\n“It’s not just empty words, you know?”\nShe shook her head, her voice filled with conviction.\n“You’re incredible—not just as my husband, but as a person. You’re someone admirable, responsible, and inspiring. I don’t just look at you that way—you make me look at you that way.”\nHer words pierced deep into my heart, as if they’d always belonged there.\n“I love you, honey.”\nHer confession filled me with so much warmth that I lowered my head, resting it in my hand.\n“Seriously… Why are you so lovable? You make me feel dizzy.”\n“Really? Have you fallen for me again? Go ahead! Fall as much as you want—I fall for you every day!”\n“What did I do today that made you fall for me?”\n“When you lifted both twins at once, I thought you were so dependable.”\n“I’ve still got muscles, you know. Want me to lift you too?”\n“Yes, please!”\n“Get on the sofa.”\n“Alright~”\nAs soon as she climbed onto the sofa, I hoisted her over my shoulder.\n“Ahhh! This is fun!”\n“Let’s make it even better!”\nI playfully lifted and spun her, pretending to give her a ride.\nWe were laughing like kids when suddenly, the bedroom door creaked open.\nOur eldest, Eunbyul, stepped out in her pajamas and looked at us sternly.\n“What if you wake the twins? Please play quietly, okay?”\nHer firm tone made us freeze for a moment before we meekly replied.\n“Okay...”\n“Yes, ma’am...”\n“Alright, goodnight.”\nWith that, Eunbyul coolly went back to her room.\nCarefully setting my wife back down, we exchanged glances and burst into silent laughter, stifling our giggles behind our hands.\nIt was another joyful, chaotic day in our happy little family.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "The twins had grown up healthy and were now attending daycare.\nOur eldest daughter had started elementary school, and we had officially entered our thirties.\nOver the years, I had become the head of a small editing team, while my husband continued working at his company, dreaming of starting his own business.\nHonestly, he could open his practice right away, but we decided to hold off until our youngest—currently growing inside my belly—was born.\n“Ammaaa—! Saetbyul is being mean!”\n“Ammaaaa—! Oppa started it!”\nThe twins often bickered, but they never got into serious fights.\nWhenever they disagreed, rather than arguing endlessly, they would come running to me or my husband to settle things.\n“What’s wrong, my little twins?”\n“You know how we’re going on a trip next week? I want to go to the zoo, but Oppa says he wants to go to the aquarium!”“The aquarium is way cooler than the zoo! You’ve never even seen a dolphin before!”\n“Well, you’ve never seen a tiger either! Tigers are way cooler!”\nBorn at the same time, yet always so different.\n“Dolphins are the best!”\n“No way! Tigers are better!”\n“Dolphins!”\n“Tigers!”\n“Dolphins!”\n“Tigers!”\nThe twins were noisy, but there was one thing that always worked like magic to quiet them down.\nClick. The sound of a door opening.\nAs soon as Eunbyul stepped out of her room, they flinched and scurried behind me.\nOur eldest daughter, eyes gleaming with authority, scanned the room until she found them.\n“Lee Hanbyul. Lee Saetbyul…! How many times have I told you not to bother Amma?! You two are older siblings now—act like it!”\n“W-We weren’t bothering her! We were just asking Amma whether we should go to the zoo or the aquarium next week!”\n“Y-Yeah! That’s all!”\n“Settle it fairly with rock-paper-scissors. No complaining afterward. Got it? Go.”\nAt Eunbyul’s firm ruling, the twins glared at each other, then raised their hands high in the air.\n“Rock, paper, scissors—shoot!”\nHanbyul threw out paper.\nSaetByul played rock.\nHanbyul clenched his fist in victory, while Saetbyeol collapsed onto the floor dramatically.\n“Yes! Aquarium it is!”\n“Hmph…! But next time, we’re going to the zoo!”\nIt was fascinating how they accepted the outcome so cleanly.\nEach child had such a distinct personality—it was truly amazing.\nAs the kids lounged in the living room, we suddenly heard the front door open.\nMy husband had returned, carrying the cake the kids had been craving.\n“Appa’s home~”\nThe moment they heard their dad’s voice, the twins bolted toward the entrance.\nBut before they could reach it, Eunbyul grabbed their collars, stopping them in their tracks.\n“Didn’t I tell you not to run in the house?”\nThe twins drooped in defeat.\n“Yes…”\n“Kids, go wash your hands. Let’s eat some cake.”\n“Okay~!”\nThe children ran off to the bathroom, quickly washing their hands before gathering in the kitchen.\n“You’re home earlier than I expected.”\n“Well, you and the kids wanted cake, so I hurried back.”\n“Seriously~ There was no need to rush! Just sit and relax. I’ll set everything up.”\n“Nope, I’ll do it.”\nAfter washing his hands at the sink, my husband set out plates and poured glasses of milk.\n“Honey, aren’t you spoiling me too much~?”\n“Then stop being so lovable. It’s your fault.”\n“What~? You’re embarrassing me~”\n“Now, go wash your hands and sit down.”\n“Yes, sir~”\nAs I settled into my chair, the kids returned.\n“We washed our hands~!”\n“Good job. You made sure they’re clean, right?”\n“Yes~!”\nOnce everyone was seated, my husband sliced the cake and placed a piece on each plate.\nWith glasses of milk in front of them, the kids eagerly dug into their treats.\n“It’s always so quiet when they’re eating.”\nEven at my husband’s amused remark, the kids only grinned, too busy enjoying their cake.\nAfterward, we all spent time together in the living room.\nI had always dreamed of peaceful weekends like this—just sitting in the living room with my family.\nAnd now, that dream had come true.\nThere was nothing better than being together.\n“Appa! Airplane ride!”\n“Yeah! You promised to give us airplane rides this weekend!”\nEven though my husband was exhausted, the twins were relentless, shaking him awake.\n“You two have an incredible memory…”\n“Come on, hurry up!”\n“Alright, alright. Airplane ride, coming up~”\nLifting his heavy body off the couch, my husband picked up the twins, one under each arm, and zoomed them around the house.\n“Vrooooom~!”\nLaughter filled the air as the twins giggled uncontrollably.\nEunbyul, however, simply watched from the sidelines without saying a word.\nNoticing this, my husband quickly set the twins down on the couch and turned to Eunbyul.\n“Come here, our Eunbyul. It’s been a while since you had an airplane ride too!”\n“Okay..!”\nDespite being responsible and mature beyond her years, Eunbyul was still just a child.\nKnowing that, my husband always made sure to include her in everything.\n“Vrooooom~!”\nAfter giving all three kids their airplane rides, my husband collapsed onto the floor in exhaustion.\n“Ahhh-! That wasn’t enough! More!”\n“My fuel’s all out…”\n“Saetbyeol! Go get some cake from the kitchen!”\n“On it! Fuel delivery coming up~!”\nIn the end, after downing another slice of cake, my husband spent over an hour playing with the kids.\nWatching them together like this, I couldn’t help but smile.\n“Really~ I love them all so much.”\nI was happy.\nNo—I was incredibly, unbelievably happy.\n****\nThere Are Many Photos on My Desk\nA picture of just my wife and me.\nA picture of my wife, Eunbyul, and me.\nA picture of my wife, Eunbyul, and the twins.\nAnd finally, a recent picture of the whole family, now including our youngest, who was born not too long ago.\nWhenever I feel exhausted from work, I glance at these photos and find myself smiling without realizing it.\n“Ahh… finally done.”\nBy the time I finished today’s work, it was already past office hours.\nI slowly packed up my things, got into my car in the underground parking lot, and drove home.\n“I wonder if the kids are playing well… I can’t wait to see them.”\nEvery day after work, my wife greets me with a warm hug, and the kids come running to the front door no matter what they’re doing.\nIt has become a part of my daily life, yet it’s something I cherish and look forward to every single day.\nAfter parking in the apartment lot, I quickly took the elevator up to our home.\nWith an excited heart, I entered the passcode at the front door.\nThe moment I stepped inside, the kids rushed toward me.\n“Daaaaad—!”\nThe twins were always the first to charge at me.\nThey raced each other to see who could reach me first, and as soon as I picked them both up in my arms, Eunbyul walked over more calmly, greeting me with a polite bow.\n“Welcome home.”\n“I’m home~”\nFinally, my wife approached me, cradling our youngest, Geumbyeol, in her arms.\nShe was as beautiful as ever, her bright smile always welcoming me home.\n“Honey, you’re back?”\n“Yeah, I’m home.”\n“Baaa~!”\nEven little Geumbyeol waved his tiny hands in greeting.\n“Oh~ Were you a good baby today, Geumbyeol~?”\n“Say ‘Yes~’ Geumbyeol~”\n“Baah~!”\n“That means yes~”\n“You must be tired from watching the kids all day. Let me take Geumbyeol.”\n“I’m fine~ Go change out of your work clothes first. Kids, let Appa go change now~”\n“Okay~”\nAt my wife’s words, the twins quickly climbed down from my arms.\nAfter changing into comfortable clothes, I came back and took Geumbyeol into my arms.\nWhile I held the baby, my wife and the kids began setting up the dinner table.\nEunbyul took out side dishes from the fridge, while the twins placed bowls and utensils on the table.\nFinally, my wife set down rice and a steaming pot of stew, and just like that, dinner was ready.\n“Our family is so well-organized. Doesn’t it feel like we’re super efficient?”\n“I think so too~ We’re really lucky to have such wonderful kids. Where else would we find children this sweet and helpful?”\nAt my wife’s praise, the kids beamed proudly, having completed their tasks.\nSometimes, our house felt chaotic, but other times, it was astonishingly systematic.\n“We just learned it from Amma and Appa~”\n“Ah! I was going to say that first—!”\nHanbyul quickly made a witty remark, and SaetByul immediately jumped in to counter it.\n“Then you should’ve said it faster—!”\n“Can’t you wait for me for once?!”\nYou’d think twins born at the same time would get along perfectly, but they were always bickering whenever they got the chance.\nEven so, even their little fights felt like a precious part of my daily happiness.\n“Hey…”\nBut of course, their quarrel ended instantly with just one word from Eunbyul.\n“Sorry, Saetbyeol.”\n“No, Oppa. I’m sorry too.”\n“Let’s make up.”\n“Okay.”\nThey fought often, but they made up just as quickly.\nIt was clear that, despite everything, they were a little scared of Eunbyul.\n“I really don’t know how you all ended up being this adorable. Must be because you take after Amma.”\n“We take after both Amma and Appa—! Aha! This time, I said it before Oppa did—!”\n“Haha, you’re all amazing. My wonderful kids.”\nWhen I smiled and praised them, all three kids grinned back at me with bright, loving smiles.\n“Baaah~!”\nEven little Geumbyeol squirmed in my arms, flashing a tiny, joyful grin.\n“That’s right. You’re amazing too, Geumbyeol~”\nMy life right now is so full of love.\nSo vibrant.\nSo beautiful.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Since it was a rare summer vacation, we decided to take a family trip to Gangneung.\nMy wife looked incredibly happy, finally going on the family trip she had promised herself back in her college days.\nOf course, the kids also beamed with excitement the moment we arrived at the beach.\n“It’s the ocean—!”\n“Wooooow—!”\nAs soon as the twins stepped onto the sandy shore, they let out excited cheers.\nAfter setting up the beach umbrella, I reminded them of the safety rules once again before we went into the water.\n“What did Appa say you absolutely must not do?”\n“Never go off alone! Never take off our life jackets! And never leave Appa’s side!”\n“That’s right! No matter what happens, you have to stay close to Appa, got it?! Eunbyul, just because you’re older doesn’t mean you can play by yourself, okay?”“Yes~”\nI couldn’t even count how many times I had drilled the safety rules into them for today.\nWhile my wife sat under the umbrella with Geumbyeol, I put the kids onto a boat tube and stepped into the water.\nEven though it was a very shallow area, I couldn’t afford to let my guard down with them.\n“Waaaah! This is so much fun!”\n“Right? Alright, now let’s take turns getting off the boat. Eunbyul goes first~”\n“Okay~”\nEunbyul was the first to get off the boat and step into the water.\nThe coolness of the sea must have felt nice because she flashed a bright smile and clung tightly to my arm.\nOnce all the twins had gotten off, the four of us held hands and enjoyed the water together.\nAll we did was float lazily, but the kids giggled and shrieked with joy as if it were the most exciting thing in the world.\n“Alright~ Let’s wave to Amma~”\nWhen we all raised our hands and waved, my wife and Geumbyeol, who were under the umbrella, waved back.\nEvery now and then, my wife dipped her feet into the water, enjoying the moment with Geumbyeol.\nThe kids were all grinning from ear to ear, but as time passed, my energy was quickly draining.\nJust when it felt like the fun would never end, our time in the water finally came to a close, and we made our way to a nearby restaurant by the beach.\n“Huh? This place turned into a barbecue restaurant?”\nAs we arrived in front of the restaurant, my wife muttered something unexpected.\n“Honey, don’t you remember? Ten years ago, we had shellfish here.”\n“Oh—! Was this that place?”\nWhen I glanced behind the restaurant, the view brought back memories—it was exactly the same as back then.\n“Amma, Appa, you’ve been here before?”\n“Yes, Amma and Appa came here when we were in college~”\n“Wow, time really flew by. That was already ten years ago?”\n“Honey, let’s go inside. Come on, kids, let’s head in. No being loud inside, okay?”\n“Yes~”\nAfter settling at a table, we ordered meat right away.\nI was busy taking care of the kids, barely touching my own food, but seeing that, the kids took it upon themselves to make me a lettuce wrap and feed me.\n“Appa, say ah~”\nI happily accepted the lettuce wrap made by my eldest daughter.\nCome to think of it, ten years ago, my wife had also fed me when we came here.\nI suddenly recalled her face as she insisted I eat all the oysters, saying they were good for men.\nAs I chuckled at the memory, my wife, who was sitting across from me, smiled warmly.\n“Honey, what’s so funny all of a sudden?”\n“I just remembered how you fed me shrimp back then.”\n“You still remember that?”\n“Of course. It was our first trip together.”\n“We were so young back then~”\n“You’re just as beautiful now as you were then.”\n“Hehe~ Hearing that makes me happy.”\nRaising kids had made a wedding ceremony impossible, and going on a trip alone as a couple was out of the question.\nAt one point, I had gently suggested we could have a wedding later, but my wife had waved it off, saying it wasn’t necessary.\nEven so, I knew she must have dreamed of that moment at some point.\nShe just never had the luxury to think about it while raising the kids.\nBut now that we had some stability and the children were growing up healthy, maybe… just maybe, it wasn’t too late.\n“Appa, say ah~”\nThis time, my youngest daughter snapped me out of my thoughts by holding up a lettuce wrap for me.\nAfter stuffing ourselves with barbecue, we left the restaurant and walked toward our lodging.\n“Kids, did you enjoy the food?”\n“Yes~ We ate so much—!”\n“Good job~”\nAfter dinner, we went to a café overlooking the beach for dessert.\nThe sunset outside was breathtaking, stealing the kids’ attention.\nEven Geumbyeol, who was snuggled in my wife’s arms, gazed at the sunset.\n“Honey, coming here with the kids makes it even better. It’s so beautiful.”\nMy wife muttered as she admired the sunset.\nBut for me, then and now, the most beautiful thing wasn’t the view outside—it was her.\n“Yes. You’re still as beautiful as ever.”\n****\nAs we walked back to our lodging after watching the sunset, the kids suddenly pointed excitedly at something.\n“Amma! Appa! That place sells lottery!”\n“How much do you win if you hit the jackpot? Can we buy a tiger?”\n“You idiot—why would you buy a tiger? Are you planning to keep it at home?”\n“Yup! I’ll buy a tiger and make it eat you, oppa!”\n“What?! Then I’ll buy a dolphin and make it eat you!”\nThe twins were at it again, bickering as usual.\nBut before I could step in, Eunbyul handled it in my place.\n“Both of you, be quiet before I eat you first.”\n“Yes…”\nWe were about to keep walking when Geumbyeol suddenly squirmed in my wife’s arms.\n“Awooo—!”\n“Oh my, is our Geumbyeol interested in the lottery too? Honey, should we buy a ticket since we’re here?”\n“Well, it is Saturday, so why not?”\nAt our conversation, the kids’ eyes sparkled with excitement.\nMaybe they took after me—they seemed to have quite the interest in money.\nIn the end, we stopped by the lottery shop and bought a 5,000-won quick-pick ticket before heading back.\nThe kids gathered around the ticket, staring at it in fascination, gently running their fingers over it as if it were some sacred artifact.\n“Be careful with that, alright? In just a few hours, this little piece of paper could be worth 1.3 billion won.”\n“1.3 billion?! What can we do with that much money?”\nAt Hanbyul’s question, I smirked and said,\n“You can do anything you want.”\n“Wooooow! That’s so cool!”\n“So, what would you all do if we won the lottery?”\nAt my wife’s question, the kids eagerly shouted their answers one by one.\nFirst, our eldest, Eunbyul, spoke up.\n“I’d buy gold.”\n“Huh? Why gold?”\n“Because currency value drops over time.”\n“…Where did you even learn that?”\n“The news.”\nShe gave such a mature response that I regretted not letting her watch more cartoons as a child.\nThe twins, on the other hand, had much more creative ideas.\n“I’d buy a giant robot to ride to daycare! One that shoots beams from its hands! And it can fly through the sky! And defeat villains!”\nLately, Hanbyul had been completely obsessed with a recent sci-fi movie, shifting his interests from cars to robots.\nAlthough I was a bit concerned about his new habit of blocking the path of our robot vacuum…\nJust the other day, he even asked me to take it apart so he could install sensors on himself.\n“What about you, Saetbyul?”\n“I want to raise a dog!”\n“Oooh~ What kind of dog? Do you have a breed in mind?”\n“A Doberman!”\n“D-Doberman…?”\n“Or maybe a German Shepherd!”\nEven though she was my daughter, I had to admit she had quite the unique taste.\nBut unfortunately, living in an apartment meant we couldn’t have a big dog.\n“That’s too bad—we live in an apartment, so we can’t raise a dog.”\n“That’s okay! If we win 1.3 billion, we can just buy a house where we can have a dog!”\nThe fact that she had already thought that far ahead left me speechless.\n“And what about our little Geumbyeol? What do you want to do if we win?”\n“Awoooo—!”\nAfter hearing all their answers, we finally arrived back at the lodging.\nI bathed the kids first before washing up myself.\n“Honey, I’m done. You should go shower too.”\n“Okay. Here, hold Geumbyeol for a bit.”\n“Alright, come here, Geumbyeol, come to Appa~”\n“Awoo—!”\nI held Geumbyeol in my arms and sat down on the bed.\n“Appa! When do we find out if we won the lottery?”\n“Hm? What time is it now?”\n“It’s 8:30!”\n“Oh—then the live draw is about to start. Alright, everyone, let’s gather around and watch with high hopes!”\nThe kids sat beside me, their eyes glued to the television.\nAfter a brief recap of the previous draw, the real lottery broadcast finally began.\n“It’s starting…!”\nAll of them went completely silent, fixated on the screen.\nEven though winning the lottery was nearly impossible, their faces were filled with hopeful anticipation.\n- We will now begin today’s draw. Regardless of the order in which the numbers appear, matching any of them makes you a winner. Let’s start the draw. The first lucky number is… 1!\n“It’s 1! Eunbyul, do we have a 1?!”\nAt Saetbyul’s question, Eunbyul stared at the ticket intently.\nBut soon, she let out a deep sigh and shook her head.\n“Nope…”\n“Aaaaah, so close!”\n“My… my robot…”\n“My Doberman…”\nAs the kids slumped in disappointment, the draw continued.\n“It’s okay~ The lottery is just for fun. Let’s win next time, okay?”\nI reassured them, thinking that at the very least, this had been a fun experience.\nBut just as the final bonus number appeared on the screen, I noticed Eunbyul’s hands trembling slightly.\n“Um… Appa…!”\n“Hm? What is it, Eunbyul?”\n“What’s the rule for the bonus number?”\n“Oh, if you match five numbers and the bonus number, you win second place.”\n“How much is second place…?”\nHer voice shook as she looked up at me, her lower eyelid quivering.\n“Sweetheart…? Why do you ask…?”\n“Am I… seeing things? I think we got second place…”\n“Come on~ That’s—”\n“Look…!”\nShe shoved the ticket into my hands, her face tense with anticipation.\nI glanced at the ticket and compared it to the numbers on the TV screen.\nA single bead of cold sweat dripped down my cheek—\nPlop.\nIt landed right on Geumbyeol’s forehead.\n“Awoo—?”\nAnd then—\nI froze.\nMy mouth fell open, my body stiffening in shock.\nThe kids, noticing my reaction, huddled around me, peering at the ticket in stunned silence.\nJust then, my wife stepped out of the bathroom, her hair wrapped in a towel, and looked at us with confusion.\n“Why do you all look like that?”\nCarefully, I lifted Geumbyeol off my lap and passed her over to Eunbyul.\nThen, I slowly got up and walked toward my wife.\n“Honey?”\n“Sweetheart.”\n“What’s wrong?”\nI looked at her, smiled brightly, and let the words slip out.\n“Let’s have a wedding.”\n“…What?! All of a sudden?!”\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release: /taylor007\nJoin our Discord for regular updates and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9 ]",

      "content": "Thanks to the little blessings that came into our lives, my husband and I decided to finally hold our wedding ceremony, even if it was a bit late.\nHonestly, I didn’t think having a wedding was all that necessary, but once we decided to go through with it, I couldn’t help but feel a little excited.\nI was curious about what kind of expression my husband would make when he saw me in my wedding dress, and I also wondered how our children would react.\nBut as it turned out, planning a wedding involved much more preparation than I had expected.\nAbove all, choosing a wedding dress was no easy task.\nStill, when I finally stepped out wearing the dress, my husband and children stood there, mouths agape, staring at me.\nSeeing them so dumbfounded was absolutely priceless.\nThey couldn’t say a word, just standing there in a daze, staring at me—oh, how I enjoyed that moment.\nThey looked so adorable, so unbelievably precious.\nAnd just like that, the dress was chosen, and our wedding day arrived.My colleagues from work and my university friends came to the bridal waiting room, and finally, Harim walked in.\n“Wow…! Eun-ha, you look absolutely stunning.”\n“Haha, you’re making me shy…! I never thought I’d be having a wedding after having kids.”\nHarim sat beside me, her face beaming as she looked at me.\n“It doesn’t matter if it’s late~ You’re the most beautiful bride today, Eun-ha.”\n“Hehe, really? This feels a little embarrassing.”\n“Haa— I can’t wait to wear my wedding dress too.”\n“Your wedding is next spring, right, Harim?”\n“Yeah. We originally planned for winter, but Jang Yujin threw such a fit about having it in spring that I had no choice but to agree.”\n“Haha, so Jang Yujin can be a little stubborn, huh?”\n“Well, it’s kind of cute in its own way~ I just hope he does a good job as the emcee today.”\n“Tell him not to be nervous~ And tell him I really appreciate it.”\nAfter many years of dating, Harim and Jang Yujin were finally set to marry next spring.\n“He’s been practicing his lines for days, so I doubt he’ll mess up. I mean, all he has to do is read them—why is he so nervous about it?”\n“My husband is really grateful, and so am I~”\n“No worries~ Besides, Lee Han-gyeol will be the emcee for my wedding anyway.”\n“Oh, really?”\n“Yep. Anyway, I should head to the hall now. I need to help Yujin relax.”\n“Alright! See you later, and thanks for coming.”\n“Of course~ And I’ll be catching that bouquet!”\nHarim left the waiting room.\nI tried not to show it too much, but my heart was racing with excitement.\nI hadn’t put much thought into it before, but now that I was sitting here in a wedding dress, ready to marry my husband, I couldn’t be happier.\nEven though I was just sitting alone in the waiting room, I couldn’t stop smiling.\nI clutched the bouquet in my hands and tapped my feet anxiously.\n“Haah…! What do I do? I’m so happy..!”\nI mean it—I was really happy.\nSo much so that I almost wondered if I even deserved to feel this much joy.\nJust then, I heard the microphone outside, signaling the start of the ceremony.\nMy heart pounded.\nThis was it—the moment I had been waiting for.\nFrom the day I met my husband until now, there had never been a single moment of unhappiness.\nEvery second spent with him had been filled with joy, and I knew that would never change.\nHiding my smile behind my bouquet, I waited for my cue when one of the staff members approached me.\n“Bride, it’s time to move.”\n“Ah—yes!”\nThere was still some time before my grand entrance, but I wanted to watch the twins make their entrance as the flower children.\nSo, I headed out a little early.\nStanding in a dimly lit corner of the wedding hall, behind the blackout curtain, I saw my father waiting for me, dressed up in his finest suit.\n“Dad~”\n“There you are, my daughter~”\n“Did you see my husband enter?”\n“I did. He looked strong and reliable.”\n“Right? He’s my husband, after all.”\n“He is. Now, the twins are about to enter. Keep your eyes on them.”\n“Got it~”\nI carefully peeked through the curtain and looked inside.\nThe hall was packed with guests, and our parents from both sides were sitting in the front.\nAnd then, at the end of the aisle, I saw my husband standing tall and proud.\nHe was always handsome, but today, he was so breathtakingly dashing that I couldn’t take my eyes off him.\nHaa… what do I do? Now I want a fifth child…\n“B-bride, please… you’re staring too much, someone might see you…!”\n“Ah…! S-sorry.”\n“Now, let us welcome the flower children who will brighten this ceremony even more! Today’s flower children are none other than the children of the bride and groom—the lovely twin siblings! Flower children, please enter!”\nUnder the dazzling lights, the twins walked down the aisle, scattering flower petals along the way.\nEven though they could have been nervous, they simply smiled happily as they walked.\nThey looked so precious, so perfect, that I couldn’t help but push the curtain open a little more.\n“Aah… they’re too adorable…! I want to run over and hug them—!”\n“B-bride..?! If you keep leaning out like that, people will see you…!”\nThe twins walked forward, flashing their sweetest smiles at the guests.\nHaa… I know I gave birth to them, but I swear, I’m not even exaggerating—they are the most precious, lovable children in the world.\nAnd then, beyond them, I saw our eldest daughter holding Geumbyeol in her arms.\nOh no. What do I do? I want to run out there right now and scoop them all up in my arms.\n“Sweetheart, you’re going to get caught if you keep peeking like that.”\n“Okay, okay, I’ll stop~ I’ll just watch the video later on repeat~”\n“-What an absolutely beautiful sight. Now, it’s time for today’s most beautiful bride, Shin Eun-ha, to make her entrance. Please welcome her with a warm round of applause! Bride, enter!-”\nAs the blackout curtain slowly drew back, I stepped into the wedding hall.\nAll eyes turned to me, and though I felt a little shy, happiness outweighed my embarrassment.\nWith my father by my side, I took slow, careful steps forward.\nWith each step, I got closer to my husband, who was watching me with so much love in his eyes.\nJust looking at him made me smile—he was already the most handsome man in the world, but today, he looked even more incredible.\nWhen I finally reached him, I moved my arm from my father’s to my husband’s.\nI smiled up at my father, and he returned the gesture with a warm, proud smile before stepping away to take his seat.\n“-Now, before our family, friends, and all the honored guests here today, the bride and groom will recite their vows. Bride and groom, please take your vows in hand and share them with everyone.”\nI’m so happy.\nHolding the wedding vows handed to me by the staff, I listened as my husband read his first.\n“I vow to love the most beautiful Eun-ha for the rest of my life.”\n“I swear to love the most wonderful Han-gyeol for the rest of my life.”\nWe locked eyes as we continued reading our vows.\n“I promise to work hard to build the happiest family in the world.”\n“I promise to be a loving wife and mother, standing by my husband and our family.”\nAnd then, together, we spoke the final line in unison.\n“We will always be each other’s pillar of strength and source of joy, loving one another until the very end of our days. Thank you.”\nAs soon as we finished, a wave of applause filled the hall.\nI glanced over and saw our children grinning widely, watching us with pure joy.\n“-Thank you for the warm applause. Now, it’s time for the bride and groom to exchange their wedding rings, symbolizing their love for one another. First, the groom, Lee Han-gyeol, will place the ring on the bride, Shin Eun-ha’s hand.”\nI slowly lifted my hand, and my husband gently slid the ring onto my finger.\nHaa… Oh my god… I love him so much. I want to throw my arms around him and kiss him right now.\nNext, I placed the ring on his finger.\nFollowing that was the declaration of marriage, warm blessings from our guests, a heartfelt wedding song performed by my colleagues, and a letter of gratitude to our parents.\nWith each moment, our wedding ceremony inched toward its end.\n“-Now, in front of all our guests, the newlyweds will take each other’s hands and make their way down the aisle together. Please give them one final, resounding round of applause as we celebrate their new journey as husband and wife!”\nAh—this might just be the happiest day of my life.\n“Honey.”\n“Hmm? Babe?”\n“I’m so happy. Today is the happiest day of my life.”\nHearing my words, my husband gave me that signature, warm smile of his before replying:\n“Then let’s be even happier tomorrow.”\nEven though I told him today was the happiest day, he still wanted tomorrow to be even better.\nSeriously… I can never win against him.\nThere’s no way I’ll ever be able to break free from him—not when he makes me fall for him all over again, every single day.\n“Okay. Let’s be even happier tomorrow—!”\n“As long as I have you, every day is happiness.”\n“And as long as I have you, I’ll always be happy. Thank you, my love.”\n“No, I should be the one thanking you~”\n“I’m so lucky to love you.”\n“That’s the best compliment ever~”\n“I mean it. Thank you… for coming into my life.”\nI beamed up at my husband, and he gave me the brightest, most radiant smile in return.\n“Thank you… for letting me be a part of your life. I love you.”\n“I love you too, my love.”\n“-Bride and groom, march forward!”\nWith the beautiful sound of a piano playing in the background, my husband and I stepped forward together.\nThe thunderous applause from our guests, the warm smiles of our family, and the sight of our children watching us with joy—it all felt so perfect.\nAs long as I have my husband and our children, I know every moment will be filled with happiness.\nI can’t wait for tomorrow.\nThe new day we’ll share together.\nA tomorrow that will be even happier than today.\n-- The End OF The Chapter --\n[TL: We have reached the end of this beautiful journey, guys.
