      "content": "Chapter 1: Acedia, Part 1: Ah, this is a Pain\nAh, this is a pain.\nI apologize for the sudden question, but do you know about the concept of otherworldly reincarnation?\nI had never heard of it until I reincarnated, and I don’t think its usage was that common in my former world, but its meaning is just as it sounds: being reincarnated into another world. In most cases, the person affected usually retains the knowledge of their past life, and gets some sort of special power or something.\nI don’t really get it, but you start a new game with new strength.\nAnd it’s not like I was strong in my former life or anything. Ah. Ha. Ha.\nFor example, on a planet called earth, in a country called Japan, in a place called Tokyo, I was born. Well, I doubt you’re really interested, so I’ll skip that part. Anyways, this world has a few people like that distributed here and there, and quite a few of them hold some important offices.\nLike Hero, or adventurer, or saint, or inventor, or noble, or stuff like that. Apparently those people often follow that pattern.\nI wonder how they manage to do such pain-in-the-ass jobs. They’re just like normal rocks on the side of the road, and I really don’t care, but I can’t help but be impressed by their motivation.\nIf you ask me why I’m saying these things…\n…\n… What? Why am I wasting energy moving my mouth to say these pointless things?\n“… The Great Demon King has given you a direct order. Please go and write a proper report!”\nLoud.\nUnable to escape the annoying voice by my ear, I stuck my elbow into the bed, and turned over.\nThe one nagging into my ear was a woman whose clothing was all made with black as the base color.\nHer disposition was as cold as a doll’s. There’s no doubt that she’s quite a beauty.\nHow useless.\nI stick my elbow into my pillow to prop myself up, and looked at the woman who was knitting her eyebrows at me—the Great Demon King, King of Destruction, 『Kanon』’s something something knight brigade’s member, I think.\n“And… what was that again?”\n“A report! I’m the one who should be angry here, right!? Even though we were dispatched at the same time to all the demon lords, why is it that I’m the only one who can’t go back yet…”\n“Ah, you sure have it rough…”\n“Please quit screwing around! Write. Your. Damn. Report!”\nI don’t get what’s she’s trying to say.\nWhy do I have to do something like that?\nAh, my arm’s tired. I once again fell into my pillow. I’ve wasted some energy on a useless thing.\nShe violently shakes my shoulders. Her shrieking voice is just way too annoying.\nI raise only me head, and look at the woman who’s supposed to be from the Great Demon Lord.\nFor Christ’s sake, if you have the time to be doing this, go do your job. Your job.\n“Oy, you. Go write the report.”\n“Wha… what!? W-why do I have… in the first place, what should I write…”\n“I’ll leave it to you. I’m busy.”\nI grabbed the cover, but the woman grabbed my arm as I wriggled into it.\nDammit this is a pain. After I’ve said this much, she still plans on annoying me?\nI’m tired. I’m sleepy. I really don’t care.\nAnd wait, what sort of report is she on about?\n“In the first place, weren’t you the one to say it, Demon Lord!? That writing was a pain so you would talk and I would write it all!?”\n“… Talking has gotten tiring, so just write whatever you want.”\nI tossed over the square box that had fallen off of the mattress.\nIt’s my official seal. It seems that I have to stamp it on reports. It’s a pain to get up to find it, so, I always keep it under the covers.\nRegardless of whether she writes what I speak, or reports whatever she wants, I can see that the contents will be fiction, so there’s no point.\nThe woman frantically moves her arm to catch it, before staring at me with a blank expression.\n“… Then, later.”\n“What!? Wai…. Again, this is… get up!”\nThis time, I just ignore her screaming voice, and pull the covers over my head.\nIn a few seconds, my conscious drifts away, and the annoying voice is merely a sound in the distance. My mind escaped my body.\nUm, I think there was something I was supposed to say. What was it again?\nAh… my name.\nMy name is… Leigie Slaughterdolls. I forgot whatever name I had in Japan long ago.\nOnce upon a time, on Earth’s Japan, I was a Salary Man who dedicated his hours to a company, and now, I’m just a poor, ordinary Demon Lord in service to some Great Demon King.",

      "content": "Chapter 1: Acedia, Part 2: I’m a Pacifist\nLet me be a little honest here. When I first noticed that I had reincarnated into this world, my first thought was that it was a pain. That was all.\nBut right now, I think that rather than being a Salary Man on Earth, my current life is much easier.\nThis must be because I’ve been a good boy. Yep. That must be it.\nIf that wasn’t the case, then I would have been forced to work for the next few decades. Just like the laborers that exist all over the place. Well, perhaps I would find it a pain, and kill myself along the way.\nIn comparison, this otherworldy life is exceedingly easy.\nGiving the specifics is a pain, so I’ll skip them, but from the moment I was born into this world, I haven’t worked for a second of my life. Even so, I’ve managed to attain quite a comfortable lifestyle.\nIt’s laziness without end. There’s no greater pleasure than this. At the very least, for someone who respects the poor, I’m satisfied with this life.\n“Unemployed!? No work experience!? How could it be that one of the Great Demon King’s arms and legs, a Demon Lord is lazing around!? You just don’t want to work, right!”\nRight now, the only headache I have is this woman the Great Demon King sent.\nI don’t know her name. She’s quite a beauty. And she screams at me. If you’re looking for her characteristics, I guess that’s about it. She’s just a bit higher than the rest of the mob.\nFor me, her screaming is quite an annoyance. For someone as calm as me, we really don’t fit together.\nI’ll bet the Great Demon King tried to send over whoever would annoy me the most as a form of harassment.\n“… And what was this about again?”\nWhen you compare the rest of the reincarnated in this world to me, who was born as a dirt-cheap devil, I guess the only saving grace is that this world was exceedingly easy to live in.\nThe value of life is just a tad bit low, but if you try a bit, you can enjoy an idle life. Even if you don’t try, it’s possible.\nI feel like an idiot for working my ass off in Japan. I can only say this in hindsight, but I wish I reincarnated earlier.\n“It’s a Hero. A Hero! A Hero’s attacking! See, now it’s finally the time for you to rise! Please get off of the bed already!”\n“… I’m a pacifist.”\nI can’t understand why she’s so energetic.\nShe raises both of her arms above her head, and makes a request to me as she looks over me with cold eyes. Change, change. Please give me a more decent one.\n(TL: A line used in… certain clubs to exchange for another woman)\nI’d really like it if she stopped waking me whenever I was peacefully sleeping. She keeps waking me at irregular hours, so I’m always sleep deprived.\nIt’s fine if she has motivation, but I’d like her to think of all the people who don’t.\nWhen you’re pointlessly brimming with spirit, you end up wasting your time pointlessly doing overtime. Ah, I just remembered a superior that worked in my division. Forgot his name, though.\n“Pacifist!? The Demon Lord’s a Pacifist!? Have maggots finally made their way to your rotten brain!? This is a direct order! The Great Demon King’s direct order!! Do you understand the meaning of that? The Great Demon King has personally dispatched you, and it’s supposed to be an honor…”\nI understand. Honor.\nI just can’t defeat this drowsy feeling.\n“… Change. Change. Go bring in the lazy attendant I had before.”\n“Eh? Change?”\n“Yes. Change. You loud. I hate.”\n“Whaaaaaaaaat?”\nThe woman opened her eyes wide in an exaggerated gesture. It’s as if I can see the veins just poping out of her forehead.\nThe woman in front of me is a demon.\nI’m also one, and so’s the Great Demon King.\nBut even if you categorize them under one name, there are various types, and we’re divided by attribute.\nThat means, I forget the number, but it’s that… you know, that thing in earth’s religion or legend, or manga or something. You’ve probably heard about it.\nUm… right, Wrath, or Decay or stuff like that… that thingy with seven or eight things. It sounds really high and mighty.\n“My predecessor retired! He said something about 『Sloth』 being pitiful to look at! Do you understand what this means!? Looking at you, the Demon Lord, he got tired of his own attribute! Hey!”\n“I see.”\n“I see!? Your impression is, ‘I see’!? Two words? Only two words!? Ah, damn it all. The hell’s with this man!”\nIt was a topic I didn’t really have interest in.\nIn the first place, I don’t really remember the past guy’s face. All that I remember is that it was a lot quieter back then than it is now.\nI am a demon. My attribute is 『Sloth』.\nDepravity and resignation, escape and decay, suspension and stagnation, inertia and dejection. A Demon Lord reigning over that sort of thing.\nFrom under the covers, I take a peek at the Great Demon King’s underling.\n“And do you think that’s enough… to make someone like me move?”\n“Ku… This man is…”\nI don’t mean to brag, but I’m a man who can sleep for as long as I want. This isn’t just because I’m a devil. It was like that before I reincarnated too.\nIn order to live, I reluctantly took up work, but on my off days, I slept the whole time. Because of that, I have no memory of when, where or how I died.\nI guess that makes me luckier than all those reincarnators who were hit by a truck or slashed by some slasher.\nWell, at this point, I don’t really care.\nThe screaming woman is still trying to issue orders.\nEven being a Demon Lord is just like being a feudal lord, so I guess it isn’t that easy.\n“Go report what I’m about to say to Kanon.”\nWith that one sentence, the woman fell silent.\nDespite everything, I guess she’s still a professional, and she was personally sent by that Great Demon King. She’s supposed to be skilled.\nHaving said what I wanted, I finally resolve myself to return to the world of dreams once more, and again, the woman tries to pull my cover off.\n“Wait… Wait a god damn second!! You haven’t said anything yet, why are you sleeping again!?”\n“… Take a guess.”\nIf I get serious, there’s no way a demon of this level would be able to get in the way of my sleep.\nI feel the futon, my arms and my hair being pulled, as I let my mind fall into the abyss. I fell into the depths of that peaceful darkness.",

      "content": "Chapter 1: Acedia, Part 3: It’s not like I’m a NEET or Anything\nI don’t mean to brag, but it’s not like the only thing I do is sleep.\nWhen I get hungry, I eat, and when it’s time for cleaning, I do get off of the bed.\nRight, I just don’t work. It’s not like I’m a NEET or anything.\n“… You really are the worst. That’s what society calls a NEET.”\n“I’m on unearned income.” (TL: Google it)\n“No, it’s not like you’re living like this for free or anything, right!?”\nNo to me, it kinda feels free.\nI’m not really worried about it, but if possible, I prefer my bed to be soft. And so, when they come to clean, I do get off of it. For a change of pace, I did think of changing my room every now and then, but I don’t want to walk in the hallway, so the idea was rejected. I’m not that desperate for a fluffy bed.\nThe greatest reason I’m grateful for having been reborn a devil, is that no matter how much I sleep, I never get a headache.\nI take a big stretch after I get off the bed, and lower myself into a sturdy chair made of wood.\nIt’s my favorite. Apparently it has quite a history behind it, and it’s quite valuable, but I’m none too knowledgeable. When I lean back and let it swing back and forth, it’s as if I’m a baby being rocked to sleep in a cradle. It makes me sleepy.\n“Oy, wrap that around me.”\n“Yes. As you wish, my liege.”\nThe maid who had come to clean has a bright smile on her face as she brings the blanket over.\nIt’s this. This is how you’re supposed to be treating the existence called the Demon Lord.\nDemon Lord isn’t just some random title. I have my own retainers, and some land.\nIt’s all what I was granted by the Great Demon King, but I don’t really care. What’s essential is that the people I’ve been granted all take good care of me.\nI don’t mean to brag, but I can’t clean, cook or do laundry. The only thing I can do is sleep.\nI say my thanks, as she wraps it around the armchair.\nAnd as I was relaxing like that, the Great Demon Lord’s subordinate sent me flying.\nShe thrust at the chair with an incredible amount of power. My body floats in the air for a while before I crash head-first into the wall.\nWhat power. Every time she hits me, I start to remember my past life as a human, and confirm the fact that this is, indeed, another world.\nIs it just my imagination, or is this woman’s treatment of me getting worse, and worse?\n“Ah… my liege!? A-are you alright!?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Quit screwing around!”\nThe woman stamps her foot in frustration. With just that action, the floor that’s supposed to be protected with a barrier of the highest class begins to creak.\nHer expression is like that of a devil. Um, when did she get here again?\nThe maid lifts me by the armpits, and sets me back on the chair.\nShe thrusts her finger at the Great Demon King’s follower.\nAs she’s my subject, of course, the maid is also a devil. I don’t know her attribute. IF I may add, I also don’t know her name.\nI’m bad at remembering people’s names. Most of the time, I just don’t have any interest.\n“The one who should quit is you, Lize Bloodcross! Even if you’re a supervisor sent directly from Kanon-sama, your attitude towards our Demon Lord goes beyond what could be called rude!”\nI see. So this woman had a name like Lize.\nNow that you mention it, I get the feeling that she introduced herself when she was first stationed here.\n“The hell are you saying!? It’s because you guys are like this, that that Demon Lord over there never has any intentions of working!”\nEven I couldn’t stay silent at such a remark.\n“No, even if they weren’t here, I have no intention of working, you know.”\n“As expected of Leigie-sama!”\nThe maid is looking at me with sparkling eyes of admiration. I wonder if she realizes that I don’t know her name.\nAnd I wonder just what part of me she’s admiring.\nWell, all of it doesn’t really matter.\nWith feelings of resignation, I closed my eyes.\n“Wait… Don’t sleep! Didn’t you just get up!?”\n“Lize, the Demon Lord is sleeping! Please be quiet!”\n“Haaaaa!? Why are all you people so soft on this Demon Lord!? And wait, why is this thing a Demon Lord anyways!? All he does is sleep!”\nAh, she’s loud.\nAh, all of this is a pain.\nThere are plenty of demons, but very few Demon Lords.\nThe method for determining a Demon Lord is simple.\nClass: 『Demon Lord』\nThe ones who have that are the Demon Lords.\nClasses are a concept that didn’t exist in my previous world, but to put it simply, it’s like your occupation.\nBy rising in Class, humans are able to access various incomprehensible superpowers… various forms of something called Skills. I don’t know the details, and I don’t know on what system they work. I don’t even know if there’s a set system. What’s important is that by dabbling in your class, you can get to use some convenient powers, and that’s all. Even without any effort.\nWhat’s more, reincarnators usually end up with some special classes. Like Hero, or Savior or Sage.\nIn my case, I was born with 『Demon』 as my class.\nAfter a few years of living a depraved life, it became 『Demon Lord』 before I even noticed it. Having Classes change is apparently something that happens all the time. I get the feeling that there was some criterion on who would advance Classes, but I don’t really remember.\nAnyways, in the end, I became a Demon Lord without putting in any effort, and I was suddenly able to use some strange powers freely.\nIn that sense, giving an answer to this woman’s question would be easy.\nI became a Demon Lord by doing nothing but sleeping. It wasn’t by my will.\nThat’s all I can say, and I don’t have any answers besides that.\nBut it’ll be a pain, so I won’t speak up.\n“Demon Lord Leigie of the Slaughter Dolls! As a member of the Great Demon King’s personal 『Order of Black』, I command you in the name of Great Demon King 『Kanon』! Lead your Legion, and head to the Prison of Flames. Bring ruin to the Demon Lord who hath gone against us, Granzer Esther!”\n“Don’t want to.”\nWhy? For what reason would I have to go to some random place for some guy I don’t know?\n“Huh? You plan to refuse a direct order under the Great Demon King’s name? Do you truly understand the meaning of such an act?”\n“…”\nI truly did not care, so I was going to answer, ‘No Idea’, but I felt that would make things complicated, so I stayed silent.\nIt’s a problem of personality. I don’t think I’m ever going to come to an understanding with this woman. I hate pointless things, and I hate troublesome things even more. What I love is sleep and spare time, and I care not for anything else.\nI call over the maid watching over us, and say a single word.\n“Iyo.”\n“… Understood.”\nThe maid respectfully bows her head.\nShe made quiet steps as she departed from the room. I finally closed my eyes once more, only to feel my head get smacked again.\nIt was an amazing display of strength. My favorite chair was smashed to pieces beneath me, and cracks spread across the ground as I crashed into it.\nThe woman’s arms were slender. About as thick as a weakling like mine’s.\nBut this is but a fantasy world, so appearance and power are disproportional.\nShe pants heavily as she raises her eyes. I take a glance at her, and since my chair had been smashed, I laid on the ground where I was.\nI can’t go back to the bed yet. It has to air. And climbing up to the top of the bed is a pain.\nThe woman stared at me with a dumbfound expression as I spread myself on the groud.\n“… Wh-what!? Y…you’re… t-that bad!? H-how about you try saying something at least?”\nShe’s an exceedingly troublesome woman.\nEspecially the part where she immediately resorts to violence. Let me add that as this woman is a direct follower of Kanon, she’s much stronger than an average devil. Devils have various ranks, and between a normal Demon and Demon Lord, there are numerous positions. Within that, the position one lower than a Demon Lord… I guess she has as much power as a General. This world is definitely a Fantasy, but because of the separation by rank, and the glass ceiling, I guess there’s not really a difference between this world and that one. Well, I guess her skill level is deserving of it, but…\nThis is a pain.\n“I’m against violence.”\nShe grabs me by the cuff of my shirt, and shakes me back and forth.\nTherein is the form of a small woman threatening a man much larger than her. But in the end, with something like this, disrupting my sleep is… impossible.\n“What? You’re going to close your eyes in a situation like this!? Impossible, irrational, what the hell is up with this Demon Lord!!?”\nShe slaps my face left and right, and gets in a few well-placed body blows.\nShe uses an uppercut on my chin to get me airborne, and continues with a beautiful combo of kicks. Her flowing movements have been heavily polished, giving me the idea that this woman is quite used to beating up humans.\nThis one… even after transferring jobs, she isn’t showing any mercy.\nThe shockwaves emanating from each blow rip apart the cover, and feathers fly everywhere in a flashy display.\nThat Kanon guy’s going to be getting an invoice for this… of course, I won’t be the one sending it.\nBut in the end, trying to disrupt my sleep with this much is… impossible.\nIt’s not like I’m strong against pain or anything. I’m not taking any damage.\nA difference between here and Japan is that a few things from that world have been systematically placed under something called HP, and as long as that doesn’t decrease, my body won’t get any wounds, and I won’t feel any pain.\nNormal kicks and skills would drop my HP, but here, by the judgement of a stat called Vitality… the higher your VIT is, the lower the damage.\nThis entire world is built off of parameters, and using them, you can make a clear calculative comparison. It’s quite a pain.\nAnd despite everything, me being a Demon Lord makes my VIT needlessly high. Every time the woman hits me, my VIT gets in the way, and my body is taking less damage than if I was being beaten up by a baby.\nThis is making me sleepy.\nBut she sure is an annoying woman. Just what is her attribute supposed to be?\nMy curiosity has been peaked ever so slightly.\n“Hey, you. What’s your…”\nAnd there, I breathed in a deep sigh. I flopped onto the floor, and rolled over as I averted my gaze.\n“Don’t. Stop. In. The. Middle. Of. Your. Sentence!!!!!”\nShe really is a noisy woman. I really don’t have that much interest in you, you know.\nI opened my mouth because I felt like it, but along the way, I realized I didn’t care.\nThe sole of her foot comes down on the defenseless me numerous times. My head is being kicked around like a soccer ball, and finally, she presses her sword against my face.\nDon’t be bringing out a blade here. Not that I plan on saying anything, but…\nA few minutes later, after overexerting herself, all that was left was the Great Demon King’s underling who had used all her energy, and me, who hadn’t taken any damage.\n“Hah… hah… This man… I’d heard about it, but… H-he’s hard…”\nOf course. As long as my VIT is high, I can sleep without paying heed to my environment.\nWith my bountiful VIT, high temperature, low temperature, poison, and even paralysis, and all other status ailments, as well as abnormalities don’t work against me.\nIt’s not like I was born this way, it’s a skill held by those of Demon Lord Class.\nBut the details are a pain to explain, so I’ll omit them.\nThe woman opened her hand, and stared at her own palm in amazement.\n“So this is… the Demon Lord of 『Acedia』…”\nWatch closely, and bear witness. Now kneel before my power.\nAnd if I may beseech you, please quiet down. I assure you that’s the only path that will make everyone happy.",

      "content": "Chapter 1: Acedia, Part 4: Sloth and Depravity\nEven if I didn’t really wish for my status, as long as I’m a Lord, I have my own men… my own retainers.\nI’m the natural enemy of humanity, and in some country or another, some something something god’s followers see me as their complete nemesis. I should add that a few other demons and Demon Lords are after me for selfish reasons as well.\nTo summarize, I have lots of enemies. Even though I haven’t done anything, I have lots of enemies. It’s all the ripple effect from that Top Kanon guy declaring world domination or heavenly domination or hell domination or some needlessly grandiose goal. If I didn’t have any men, then as I don’t like fighting, I would probably be dead.\nEvery quarter of a year, someone with a Hero or Savior Class tries an assault, and once or twice a year, heavenly soldiers come to assassinate me. Once or twice a month, I’m dragged into some war going on in Hell. It’s a pain. I myself don’t fight, so I’m seen as one of the more moderate Demon Lords. I guess the world is at its end.\nThe Great Demon King’s follower who seems to be named Lize has her arms crossed as she stares at me with an unpleasant expression.\n“Demon Lord, Leigie of the Slaughter Dolls. For your achievements at the Prison of Flames in the war against the Demon Lord Granzer Esther, under the name of the Great Demon King Kanon, you have been promoted to the Third Rank among Demon Lords, and have been awarded the mighty Demon Blade Celeste.”\n“I see.”\nIt’s not something that concerns me.\nAs she reluctantly hands over the sword, I toss it aside without looking at it.\nI don’t need a sword. But it’s not like I want a Shield or anything, and of course, I don’t want any medals. I really don’t want status either. All I want is quiet time to rest.\n“AAAAAAAH, what are you doing to the sword Kanon-sama personally sent you!?”\nIn hot haste, Lize picks up the sword, and hugs it to her body as if it were a precious artifact as she glares at me.\nI don’t even know the difference between a Demon Blade and a normal one, and I never even get off the bed, so I have no opportunities to use it. Even a kitchen knife would have been more useful.\nWell, I wouldn’t be using that either, but…\n“… I can’t accept this. Why the hell are you getting a promotion! You didn’t even do anything!”\n“No idea.”\nThat’s something you should be asking your master. I’ll bet that would be a much better usage of your time.\nJust meeting her gaze had become tiresome, so I fell face-up onto the bed.\nLize had splendidly destroyed the other one, so it’s brand new. At first, I longed for my old one, but now it doesn’t really bother me. All that’s necessary for me is simple sleep.\nI don’t even know the reason for my promotion, and I didn’t know my previous ranking in the first place. I have no idea whether Rank Three is even high or not.\nAll of it doesn’t really matter.\nBut perhaps because she was unsatisfied with my attitude, Lize began stomping her foot. I don’t know just how long has passed since she first came here, but my impression of her as a beauty has been shattered with not a trace of it left behind. I guess it’s true that you can get tired of beauty. The only thing left is her annoying portion, and I’m also getting used to that one.\n“Don’t think I don’t know! The one leading your army was Deije the Usurper! He led it as he conducted the assault on Granzer’s armies!”\n“I see.”\nWho the hell is Deije the usurper?\nWell, it doesn’t really matter. I’m not that interested.\nLize let out a sigh as she looked at my face. Just as I was getting used to her, I guess she was also getting accustomed to me. It’s that power of human adaptation.\n“It was a splendid strategy. I guess the rumors that the army of Leigie the Depraved was the strongest were true. They trampled Granzer’s forces as if they were children… I can see why Kanon-sama is permitting your current behavior.”\n“I see.”\n“… Are you even listening to me?”\n“I see.”\nI turn my body over once more, and grabbed the body pillow that was just about my height. I love to sleep, but I also love to roll around after waking up.\nLize’s eyebrows rise as she pulls the pillow away. There was no helping it, so I hugged the cover instead.\n“… Anyways, I was only sent to watch over you by the Great Demon King, but let me give you a word of advice. As a Demon Lord, you should present something unto Deije for his distinguished services.”\n“… That’s right… Who was Deije again?”\n“Haaaaaah!? Could it be that you don’t even remember the members of your own Legion?”\nThat’s the sort of thing Sloth is.\nAnd I don’t hold any interest towards the demon known as Deije.\nIt’s a bit troublesome, but… I pointed to the sword Lize was holding so preciously.\n“… I’ll give him that sword.”\n“Hah? Are you serious? No matter how distinguished he is, you’re going to give the Demon Blade granted to you by the Great Demon King to an ordinary Demon?\n“I don’t need it. If it was some bedding, then perhaps I would consider it.”\nA new mattress, or mabe a pillow, or maybe even a replacement for the armchair that was brutally destroyed. Kanon actually has a bit of a generous side to him, so I’ll bet he’ll prepare something nice.\n“Divine goods… treasures of the gods… even if you may be a Demon Lord, do you think a Demon like you could use them?”\n(TL: Bedding (寝具) sounds the same as Divine Armaments (神具))\nIt was the first time I ever saw Lize gaze at me with eyes as if she was looking at a monster.\nIt was, without a doubt, a misunderstanding, but correcting her would be a pain.\n“… That’s right.”\n“I see… so you’re not just some ordinary loafer…”\nLoafer… This woman says some interesting things.\nWell, she can say whatever she wants. I have no interest in her words.\nI turn myself over once more. The cover is warm, and heavy. It gives a sense of security.\nHaving accomplished everything I set out to do, I yawned deeply as I closed my eyes.\n“Ah, wait a sec’ boss Leigie.”\nWhat a loud person. It’s always like this. Whenever I try to sleep, everyone gets in my way.\nI’m going to sleep either way.\n“Oy, Demon Lord. That’s Deije.”\nAs I was saying, who the hell is that?\nI roll my shoulders, and forcefully lift my heavy eyelids.\nIn front of me was a single man.\nHe was a large and muscular man. His beardless face was like a smooth blank mask, and on top of it grew a large pair of curling horns.\nBut his most prominent feature was his arms, three on each side for a total of six.\nAnd on his head, a similar total of six glimmering eyes. In his disgustingly warped mouth, grew long fangs.\n“Who the hell are you?”\n“… You’re the same as always, Boss Leigie… I’m Deije Breindac. I’m in charge of your Legion’s third brigade.”\n“I see…”\nThe male demon who proclaimed himself to be Deiji had an aloof tone unbefitting of his appearance.\nSo this is the Deije Lize was talking about a while back… I see…\nYep. I don’t care.\n“And do I know you?”\n“Of course, boss. You’re the one who appointed me to take charge of the third brigade in the first place.”\n“… I see.”\nI’m a bit curious as to how many brigades I have, but anyways, it seems he’s quite an important person.\nMy instincts are telling me that the Demon called Deije possessed quite a bit of power.\n“The one who ignored that girl Medea’s opposition, and appointed me leader of the third brigade was you, boss. But I guess you’ll never change.”\nWho’s that girl Medea supposed to be? I looked in Lize’s direction, but as she didn’t seem to be confused about it, I guess that Medea girl’s a well-known one in my army.\nWell, not that it matters.\nNames, and existences, and powers and everything else. They all don’t matter to me. Just do whatever you want.\nI rubbed my head into the pillow as I spoke to Deije.\n“Iyo”\n“Yes, it is an honor that I have answered to the Boss’s expectations.”\nDeije lowers himself. On his actions, Lize tilts her head.\n“… What exactly is that 『Iyo』 supposed to mean?”\n『I』 will leave it to『yo』u.\n『I』 am satisfied with『yo』ur work.\n(TL: In the original, it’s Yoha, but it’s a combination of phrases that pretty much mean the same thing)\nIt’s a phrase that says both at the same time. Specifically thanking or ordering people got to be a pain, so it’s something I thought up. If you just say it whenever you want, they’ll interpret it however they want, so it’s quite convenient.\nBut answering her would be a pain, so I’ll just ignore her.\n“And what are you here for again?”\n“Yes, this may be presumptuous, but I was wondering whether or not the boss was deciding on a reward to bestow onto me. How about it?”’\nThere’s nothing to how about it.\nI don’t care about that. All that’s important for me is to strive for a sleep more comfortable than this one.\nI looked down on Deije with cold eyes. Of course, it was a pain, so I didn’t voice my opinion.\n“I’ll award you that sword.”\nOn my words, Deije took a glance at the sword Lize was carrying. His eyes glowed red like a carnivorous beast who had just caught sight of its prey.\nHe licked his lips before turning his eyes back to me.\n“It is an honor too great for me, boss. But there was another item I was hoping for… no, I’m not saying I don’t want the sword or anything. As you can see, I have six arms here, so…”\n“Deije, you bastard! When you’re just a run of the mill Demon, you plan on saying that the sword the Great Demon King sent is not enough for you!?”\nI hold up my hand to stop Lize, who had flown into a rage. The body pillow she’s holding is making creaking sounds, and it feels like it’s about to burst. I’d appreciate it if she were to stop.\nIt’s loud. It’s a pain. Can’t she close her mouth for a second? I just want to sleep here.\nIt looks like his attribute is Greed. It’s natural for him to want more.\nDeije of Greed and me of Sloth will never have a conflict of interest.\nI recovered my pillow from Lize, and spread it out below my head. I turn my eyes to the twisting patterns on the ceilings as I answered.\n“Ask what you will.”\n“Yes, so would it be possible for me to have another of the boss’s special 『Dolls』?”\nThat was a bit away from my expectations.\nIf it was something I had on hand, it would be fine, but making a new doll would take a bit of effort.\n“… That sounds like a pain.”\n“I beg of you, it can be the most basic type, so…”\nThis rotten greed. It seems that he won’t go away unless I do something to answer his desires, or unless I kill him.\nI wonder whether killing him or making a new doll would take more effort.\nIt was a while back, but it seems to be true that he has done some distinguished service.\nIf both options will take the same amount of effort, then I guess I’ll give him a doll.\nI look over the room, and picked up a candle holder from the closest side table.\nThe holder had a design resembling a skeleton. This is a pain, so let’s go with this.\nI tossed it over to Deije as is.\nDeije accepted it with a full smile.\nHe traced its form with all six of his hands.\n“Boss, this one doesn’t have a soul.”\nIt’s ‘cuz I didn’t give it one.\n“Would it be better if it did?”\n“… Surely you jest. A doll without a soul is but an item. What I’m requesting for is one of your Slaughter Dolls.”\n“I see.”\nI guess I really will have to put in some effort, or he won’t leave.\nThere’s no helping it. Let’s just get this over with.\nI yawned as I pointed my finger at the soul-less skeleton.\nI used a skill.\nAnd with that, a presence began to eminate from the doll.\nAmong my powers as a Demon Lord was a skill to grant life to dolls.\nIt’s a skill I specialize in. That’s where I get the Slaughter Dolls part of my title.\n“Is that good enough?”\n“Yes, I will happily accept it. Could you also grant a name onto it?”\nGiving a name is an important ceremony for a Devil. The name is carved onto the body, and it’s not an exaggeration that the name gives way to new powers.\nBut why is it that I have to do something like that?\n“… If you get some more achievements, I’ll consider it.”\n“… Ki ki ki, understood. I’ll do my best to not croak out there.”\nHe laughs in a creaky voice, before retreating. I guess it’s a manner befitting for a Demon governing over Greed, but I don’t really care.\nWith a grim expression, he took the sword from the hands of Lize, who had simply watched over the exchange like a scarecrow.\n“Well then, boss. I’ll request another audience once I get some merits.”\nAfter a single, deep bow, he left the room.\nNo, you don’t have to come again. I’ll give you whatever you want.\nYou don’t even have to ask me. I’ll leave it to you.\nAnd so, just leave me alone.\nDepravity and Sloth. Those are the only reasons for my existence, and that’s all I desire for.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Avaritia, Part 1: Pile up all the Glory and Treasure\nWell, well. I guess Boss Leigie’s the same as always.\nI had only talked to him for a few minutes, but he’s already tired me out. I took a deep sigh as I departed from the room of the Demon Lord of Acedia.\nThe same.\nThat’s my only impression of him.\nIt’s already been ten years since I enlisted in this guy’s army.\nFrom a Demon’s perspective, a measly ten years is nothing, and it’s a fact that I’ve been alive for far more than a thousand.\nI’m a demon who reigns over 『Avaritia』- Deije Breindac, and I think I’m following quite a nice path as a demon.\nI was already used to leading armies before I was appointed to one here, and my usable Mana is in the higher ranks compared to the others. From the moment I was born, I was able to keep on building up my greed, and my Class is advancing at a nice rate. I even have some confidence in regards to battle.\nThat’s why I’ve managed to thoroughly crush the armies of other lands so easily, and the targets of my desire… treasure and glory, come to me all too easily.\nBut still…\nThe amount of times I’ve had audiences is enough to count on all of my hands, but Boss hasn’t remembered my face or name. I’m putting shame to the name of Deije the Usurper.\nKi ki ki, well, I’m dealing with the Demon Lord who governs depravity and sloth, so I guess there’s no helping it.\nI mean, isn’t Boss Leigie the most depraved of all of us? I’ve been around for a long time, but I’ve never seen him leave his room once. He must have a natural disposition for this. I guess 『Demon Lords』 really are a cut above the rest.\nThough I’ve never seen a Demon Lord like this one before.\nThe Castle of Shadows.\nIt’s the base of one in service to the greatest power of the Demon World, the King of Destruction, Kanon.\nThe castle of Demon Lord Leigie of the Slaughter Dolls was also the most important point for his armies. Its width far surpasses that of Kanon’s Castle, the Palace of Rending Flames.\nIt wasn’t extravagant, but to match Sloth, who he governs over, the entire castle was built sturdy.\nIn truth, most of the men the Great Demon King dispatches are within the Castle of Shadows. Even the Great Demon Lord’s armies don’t put the vast land they have to good use.\nI open the door of the personal room granted to me. It’s quite a large door.\nThe room I was granted was much larger than the one boss uses. It’s ‘cuz he has no desires. I wonder how he keeps up as a Demon like that.\nWell, that’s why the affinities of Greed and Sloth are so good.\nWhen I stepped in, I made sure to firmly lock the door behind me before inspecting the sword I had received.\nThe Demon Blade Celeste.\nOnce a possession of the Great Demon King, it is a top class item. It’s an item with quite a history behind it. If you ask about its shape, it’s an Orthodox Longsword. Its deep crimson double-edged blade looked as if it had manifested in the flames of hell itself, and its hilt is decorated with a dragonic pattern. Its blade and handle, and even the scabbard, are died in a blood-like red.\nI don’t mean to brag, but I have quite an eye for appraising items. Ki ki ki, it’s because it’s the target of my desire. Of course I would put some effort into studying it.\nAnd from my observations, it’s definitely the real deal.\nIt’s the legendary Demon Blade said to have carved up a dragon in a single swing. I unsheathed it and trace my finger down the deep red metal.\nIts true power lies not as a sword, though it works sufficiently as one as well. However, it has more meaning when used as a magic tool.\nThe magic I can sense emanating from the body of the blade is greater than any other Demon Blade in my possession by monstrous proportions. It isn’t something a General Class Demon like me should be holding. It truly is Demon Lord Class. I guess it’s because the Great Demon King was trying to get the Boss to accept it. It has to have quite a high rank.\nAh, this is no good. Pride ain’t my territory.\nI caution myself. When feelings, when desires gets stronger, then one’s power as a demon will rise. I still haven’t fulfilled my greed. I’m not satisfied yet.\nI use one of the Greed Series Skills, Big Pocket, to store the blade in another dimension.\nAs long as my desire remains unfulfilled, the capacity of that space will continue to grow without end. From the time I came to this army, this is the third time the Boss’s given me equipment.\nAnd all of them were things Leigie received from the Great Demon King, so they’re all first-class. This isn’t the type of item I can find from digging around in the treasury of some defeated foreign lord. Of course it isn’t. Things from the Great Demon King’s cellar are literally pouring into my hands from all directions.\nThat’s why I’m glad I joined this army. Even if the other Demon Lords don’t have the attribute of 『Greed』, it would never be this easy. As I thought, I’ll work well with our drive-less lazy king. This is my perfect hunting ground.\nBut today’s main dish isn’t even the SSS Class Demon Blade. Today’s meal is the true, largest reason I joined this Legion.\nI took out the Skeleton-shaped doll I received and placed it on the Table.\nLeigie of the Slaughter Dolls.\nA lazy lord, and a rare one who governed the attribute of Sloth; uncommon among the subordinates of Kanon.\nNo one in this world has ever witnessed boss fighting on the battlefield. In the first place, the details of the Sloth Series skills aren’t really clear, but the only thing widely known about them is their skill to make these dolls of mass destruction. That, and the dolls themselves.\nI’ve met one of these dolls on the battlefield once before. At that time, our blades mingled, and I was able to confirm it. I don’t know the numbers this skill can give life to, but… it would definitely be able to control the demon world.\nThat’s just how strong the Doll is.\nThat creation was a weapon personally owned by a famous Demon Lord.\nEven if I say I have some confidence in my power, I’m nowhere near the realm of Demon lords, and I can see that the doll is the same. This one’s only just been born, but… it truly is a cut above the rest.\nIt may possess a power surpassing the sword sent personally by the Great Demon King.\nBut it’s still a child. If I continue to raise this one, it may become my right hand man.\nKi ki ki, my greed is too deep for it to be satisfied by me alone. Isn’t it time for me to get myself another body to aid me?\nWhat was once an ordinary candlestick holder now stood firmly on two legs, as it gazed at me with its hollow eye sockets.\nClass: 『Slaughter Doll』\nIt truly feels like it possesses its own will. There are numerous Demon Skills that can bring about life, but they’re nothing compared to the work of a Demon Lord.\nAnd for a skill like that, he didn’t even say the name. He activated it in the middle of a yawn.\nLeigie is quite a frightening one. It’s not his personality, but his power. The power he used as the Lazy King to continue climbing up in status without moving a finger. It’s scary.\nWe’re only a single level apart in class, but I can’t even begin to see the start of his power.\nWell, one day… I’ll be taking it, though, Boss.\nThe Skeleton doll bows and pledges its loyalty to me.\nGood good. That’s just wonderful.\nBoss Leigie doesn’t have even a speck of interest in me, and that’s why he didn’t put a single restriction on this weapon.\nI lower my gaze to the new toy I had been given and laughed.\n“Ki ki ki, it’ll be nice working with you, Slaughter.”\nIn the end, I’ll get my hands on everything.\nWell, let’s get along until then.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Avaritia, Part 2: A Hard Talk, ain’t it?\nWhen I dropped by the war council room, on time, the members were already all gathered there.\nThe forces of the King of Acedia, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls… his army is divided into three large sections.\nThe one with the most members, and the main force on the battlefield: The first Brigade.\nThe one with the least members, and the one that’s usually stationed to protect Boss’s castle: The Second Brigade.\nThe one with a moderate amount of manpower, that specializes in mobility and offense to conduct raids on the battlefield: the Third Brigade, which I lead.\nIn this castle, there’s also the Great Demon King’s dispatched forces under the lead of that Lize Bloodcross, but they won’t move in the wars involving boss, so they don‘t really matter.\nAnyways, that’s the entirety of the strongest Legion, known across the Demon World. It’s quite simple, isn’t it? That may be the case. But in the end, isn’t simple usually the most effective?\nAnd we’re winning quite a bit like this, so I guess it’ll stay this way for a while. In essence, battles between Demon armies are just two powers hitting each other upfront and skills knocking each other down.\nI feel everyone’s gaze as I lower myself into the leftmost armchair. I had my new aide Slaughter stand by my side.\nWhen I received him from the Boss, he was small enough to fit on a bedside table, but by absorbing the miasma of the demon world, it was able to 『Grow』. The dark eye sockets of a skeleton roughly two meters in height looked over the room without a word. It truly was a masterpiece.\n“Deije, slow.”\n“Ki ki ki, my bad. Well, I’m not behind schedule, right? Cut me some slack.”\nThe general of the second brigade, Medea Luxeliahart, chastised me with her usual pouty tone.\nShe’s a small, female demon. On her unsociable face lies a pair of blood-red, ruby-like eyes. Her no-nonsense hairstyle with straight cut bangs is fastened with a simple ornament.\nShe sure is a diligent girl.\nBut I can’t be looking down on her. Even like this, she’s a general. If you get deceived by her appearance, you’re in for a world of pain. Looks and ability are disproportional for demons.\nWell, if we were to fight, I’d be the one winning due to the difference in our natures and my superior equipment.\nContinuing on, the one sitting in the center is a man of delicate features. Heard Lauder- looked over everyone as he opened his mouth.\nHis height is a little lower than mine, and he’s a slim, calm-looking man. But he’s the supreme commander of this army. He’s pretty much Boss Leigie’s right hand man.\nThere are various types of people among Boss’s subordinates, but among them, this guy is especially dangerous. That means his power is probably the closest we have to Leigie’s.\n“Well, well, it seems we’re finally all here. Then I guess we’ll start.”\nWith Heard’s voice as the starting signal, a map is projected onto the table.\nIt’s a map of the demon world with Boss’s territory at the center.\nAmong all of the Demon Lords allied to Demon King Kanon, Boss’s was a largest, with a vast expanse that looked to swallow all around it. The Prison of Flames we went and obtained in the last war is included in it.\nWhile it’s charmingly vast, that also means it’s the territory that shares the largest border with the factions opposed to the Great Demon King. The foremost battle line.\nKi ki ki, that pretty much means we can go out and grab whatever land we want. On the other side, if we’re negligent, we’ll be the ones losing. They’re a few hundred years too young to think they can take anything from Deije the Usurper.\nWell, as long as I don’t have orders from the Great Demon King, it’s not like I’ll go out and fight randomly. It’s because my life is the most valuable. Kanon of Destruction… I aint’s gonna go aggravate a Demon King that governs over Wrath.\nEven for me, he’s a bit higher on the pecking order than Boss Leigie.\nHeard started calmly spreading information.\n“The Great Demon King has given out a subjugation order for the Demon Lord of Gluttony, Zebul Glaucus. Our target was once the one with the strongest alliance to our King, but due to revolts from a shortage on food, he has killed both Astell Zaabdeus and Claud Astal, both of whom were Demon Lords allied to our Great Demon King. All while slowly approaching our land.”\nTwo points on the map were circled, and as a line was drawn between them, a, expanse of land began flashing in red. Unsatisfied with its bounds, the line gradually began to encroach on the Boss’s territory.\nHere, where his castle is, there’s still a distance before it hits the Castle of Shadows, but it’s still proceeding towards it in a straight path.\nKi ki ki, he’s brought in a troublesome topic.\nThis battle’s on a different level than the one I crushed Granzer Esther in.\nOur target is… the Demon Lord himself. In Granzer’s battle, we only fought his army, and the Lord never stepped onto the battlefield. In the first place, Demon Lords aren’t things that are supposed to come out so easily.\nBut this time is different. According to what I can see, the Demon Lord is personally leading the army.\n“So the opponent’s a Demon Lord who took out two others… quite a hard talk.”\n“Yeah. But even if you say he’s taken down two, they were both fresh Lords without much power backing them. He’s no opponent to our Leigie-sama.”\nYes, Supreme Commander Heard knows this, and responds as such.\nThat’s right. It’s not like he’s wrong or anything.\nBoss Leigie’s Mana is incomparable to all those run-of-the-mill Demon Lords scattered all over the place. I mean, even though he looks like that, he’s the Third Rank, you know? Third Rank means… to put it simply, among all those loyal to Kanon, he’s the third strongest.\nBut the fact that the two killed were Demon Lords means that they were definitely stronger than me, who’s a Class below.\nThe enemy’s a strong Demon Lord who took on both of them consecutively.\nAs expected of the super conceited Heard Lauder. It must be a nice thing to be so brimming with confidence. But isn’t he estimating himself a bit too high?\nI may be greedy, but that doesn’t mean I don’t recognize the power of others.\nI’m not that knowledgeable about other Demon Lords, but even I know that Zebul of Gluttony is a big name. His moniker is the Devourer. In the Great Demon King’s faction, he took Fifth Rank, an atrocious Fiend. And our Demon Lord over here won’t lift a finger himself.\nIf I went one on one against a normal Demon, I doubt I would lose.\nI’m even confident I could crush an army.\nBut when my opponent’s a Demon Lord, despite having overcome countless battles, I’d be at a disadvantage, I guess.\nI know the answer, but let’s ask just in case.\n“What did the boss say?”\n“Iyo. I’ll leave it to you.”\nWow.\nI whistle aloud. Medea raises her eyebrows and looks at me with accusatory eyes.\nAs I thought, we’ve been thrown to the wolves. As expected of Sloth. Even when the Demon Lord comes knocking on our door, he shows no interest.\nNo interest. He’s making this prideful one look like a child. His stance never wavers.\nThat girl Medea knits her eyebrows as she flips through all the information pertaining to Zebul. She soon raises her eyes.\n“… We’re at a slight disadvantage. Do we have any other pieces?”\n“There’s always the option of dragging Leigie-sama into this.”\nHeard offered a suggestion.\nWell, well. I guess boss has it rough too. But since the Fifth Rank is coming, that’s always an option. That is, if you don’t consider his tendencies.\nMedea folds her arms and fidgets with a pouting face. She’s in a bad mood. Did something happen?\n“We cannot bring trouble to Leigie-sama’s hands.”\n“Exactly. If the opponent is a Demon Lord, we just have to dispatch an appropriate amount of force, is all.”\nOy, just what sort of force is appropriate for that?\nBut the Demon Lord of Sloth… no matter what happens, he won’t move.\nJust as one of Greed like me refuses to stake his life for some unknown treasure, his longings for rest exist around him like some inorganic immutable object.\nBut I understand. This is… but another trial on my path to glory.\nEven if I’m just leading an army, if we really take down a Demon King, then Leigie’s name will rise even further in the world.\nAt the same time, the rewards for taking out a Demon Lord who killed two others must be greater than the Demon Blade Celeste… There’s a possibility that it surpasses an SSS Class treasure, an L Rank Item. And as always, it’ll flow right from the Boss’s hands into mine.\nThe moment I obtain it, perhaps the craving sleeping within me will reach a whole new level. It’s possible… that I may even finally become a Demon Lord.\nThere’s more than enough to gain for me to risk my life.\n“Hmm. We can’t besmirch the name of our Demon Lord… Deije, do you think you can handle it like always?”\nHeard calmly sends a strong look in my direction. There is no impatience in his eyes. This guy is seriously considering it. That if I went out, a Demon Lord of this level would easily fall. The reason he directs such stuff at me is because his essence, his pride, extends not only to himself, but to the army under his command.\nIf it was as per usual, the Third Squad would be launching the first attack.\nKi ki ki, you sure say some hard things calmly, oh supreme commander.\nI’m a man who doesn’t do the impossible, you know? Though I do like the smell of achievements.\n“Ki ki ki, it’ll be a bit of a pinch for my squad alone. Not for fighting the army, but Gula Skills are known to specialize in targeting large areas, and the enemy is a powerful Demon Lord.”\n“I’ll go.”\nThe short girl stands up from her seat.\nWhat’s this about?\nWhy is that girl Medea stepping down from her duty to guard the boss?\nWill it rain spears tomorrow or something?\n(TL: A common phrase meaning something really unlikely is happening)\n“… Oy, oy, what’s with this turn of events? Medea? Don’t you have your own duty to attend to?”\nI’d really like our Supreme Commander, who has a good affinity to battle Gula, to step forward here.\nWhat about protecting this castle?\nBut her eyes were brimming with resolve, and she answered in a level tone.\n“Deije, Leigie doesn’t require protection from someone of my level.”\nOy, didn’t we promise never to bring that up?\nAnd that isn’t the problem.\nA Demon Lord’s Skills are a cut above the rest. There’s a difference in one’s usable skills based on personal skills, but regardless of our merits, I can’t even imagine what skills the Rank Three Boss has in his arsenal.\nAnd what she says implies that the boss needs neither me nor Heard here either.\nAn unrestful atmosphere taints the air of the council room.\nBut that girl’s next line cleared it away.\nShe made a rare display of emotion as she gazed at me with scorn.\n“And recently, I haven’t racked up any accomplishments. I need to move my body a bit, or…”\nAn unexpected response. That should lie outside of this girl’s domain.\nBut I see. So it’s like that.\nShe isn’t acting on logic, I see.\nSo that’s why that girl’s been so docile as of late.\nThe reason the girl who ain’t pride or greed wants merits.\nI let out a smile as I try asking.\n“Hmm. Meaning… it’s built up?”\n“…”\nOh my. This won’t do.\nHer wide eyes pierce through my body, and an immense pressure envelops the room.\nIt’s like her gaze itself would be able to kill someone.\nKi ki ki, Medea Luxeliaheart, a demon governing Lust.\nWhat? It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I can’t go against my desire for material wealth, but the girl’s doing her best to contain her appetite.\n… Well, in the first place, a Lust Demon that still has a hold of their sanity is a rare sight.\n“Deije, you don’t have to go… no, stay away. I’ll take care of it.”\nBut I can’t ignore those words.\nI’m all smiles as I offer a rebuttal.\n“No, no, no, no, offense is my squad’s role, right? I can’t pull back, you know. I’m『Greed』, am I not?”\n“Hmm, then the two of you go together.”\nHeard speaks with a condescending tone.\nIt’s as he says. If two of the generals of someone important like Boss’s army faced defeat, we’d lose face. The Demon Lord’s army is something lent out by the Great Demon King. If it were to be lost, we would be stimulating the king’s『Wrath』. We can’t be giving him any reasons to get rid of us.\nThat girl made a scornful expression at Heard’s words, but perhaps because she knows who we’re dealing with, she doesn’t say another word. She sure is loyal.\nThe map projected on the round table vanishes.\nEven if you call it a war council, Demons are all selfish beings. All that gets decided is who’s going to be dealing with the problem. Everything else is left up to the command of the individual squads.\nBefore I got up, I ask Heard just in case.\n“What about you, Supreme Commander Heard?”\n“Oh, there’ll be no chance for me to step out. I’m leaving it all to you and Medea.”\nHis words were backed by a serious tone. This guy seriously believes that a group of normal demons can take down a Demon Lord.\nThey’re twisted. Each and every one of them.\nKi ki ki, I guess pride can be quite sinful too. How scary.\nWell, all I’ve got to do is try my hardest so I don’t get disposed of is all.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Avaritia, Part 3: Looks like This One’s Interest Clashes with Mine\n“Yo, Medea–”\n“… You picking a fight? It won’t come cheap.”\nWe’ve already been deployed to the base on the frontlines.\nBoss’s forces are uncharacteristically excellent. Of course the commander, me, is also excellent, but even the quality of our standard devil soldiers is different from the rest. If you ask me, someone with experience fighting in foreign campaigns, it’s a matter of motivation. And their firepower is also high.\nKi ki ki, it’s all because our top’s got no desire. He casually hands out rewards great enough to satisfy even my Greed. From a normal demon’s standpoint, the salary is amazing.\nOn the border between territories, a vast mountainous region, we’ve been dispatched with numbers around a thousand. It’s almost all of the Third Brigade.\nCompared to a human army, the numbers may be low, but the quality makes up for it. A single demon’s skills is powerful enough to match another human a thousand fold.\nOur opponent is that Gluttony, and about three hundred of his followers. Ki ki ki, their numbers may be average, but with a Demon Lord personally leading it, it can’t be looked down upon. Zebul’s army is that of the Rank 5, and its name’s been spread a bit.\nIf you just compare numbers, we have more than three times their forces. If we clashed with them head on, we may be able to suppress them, so what’s important is their side’s Lord. Gluttony is a skillset that contains the most offensive abilities with high areas of effect. Just how large of an area can a Demon Lord attack with that? I can’t imagine it, but there’s no doubt we’ll face a large number of casualties.\nJust how far we in his grasp? Our victory will be determined by just how well we estimate his skills.\nKi ki ki, well, we aren’t going to lose in leadership. I mean, she may be alone, but we have that Medea Luxeliahart, who’s always charged with guarding the castle. Ki ki ki, at the very least, her face’s good, and she’s Lust.\nIt’s possible that she’ll look after the survivors after the battle, and that possibility raises morale.\nAnd now, the all-important Medea is wearing a tall white robe without a hint of sex appeal with her usual frown on her face. There’s not nearly enough exposure. It’s as if she’s a nun.\n“—Girly, I think you should be wearing something a bit more romantic. It’ll directly impact our troops’ morale, you know?”\nThe girl scoffed at the advice that came straight from my heart.\n“An unnecessary worry. Deije, I’ll say it time and again, but I’m… I hate being looked at with those eyes more than anything.”\nShe definitely does say that a lot. But those words really don’t seem to fit with her attribute. Are you sure this isn’t some mistake?\nA Demon’s desire is by no means a simple ornament.\nChanging class can build new pathways, but it’s not like it’s a straight road. Various paths branch out in all directions, and the final path taken is determined by an individual’s will. Naturally, the path trod down decides the available skills one has.\nCall it a Skill Tree or series, or anything, but a general concept exists. In that sense, you can say the Demon Class has 8 different trees. Sloth, Greed, Lust, Wrath, Gluttony, Envy, Pride, and one for basic abilities shared by all, for a total of 8.\nThe branches on these paths can be equated to guideposts of fate. By venturing from one to another in order, you can find more powerful skills, and on the standard Demon tree, if you store EXP points and use skills, you can naturally venture forwards. But the other trees are just a little different.\nThe other trees let you peek deeper and deeper into the abyss by fulfilling your desires. It’s all decided by the first skill on all of them… a passive skill『Longing of Original Sin』.\nBecause of that skill, we can’t increase our usable abilities just by gaining levels.\nBy fulfilling Greed for the Greed Tree, and Lust for the Lust Tree, we can advance forward.\nAnd in that sense, this girl’s being a bit too stoic.\nKi ki ki, how is she even advancing when she’s like that? For someone without that tree like me, I don’t have the slightest idea.\nWell, anyways, I’m an amateur in her field, so I’ll stay out of it. I don’t want to say something to make her go for my life or anything.\n“Ki ki ki, well, your path’s your own. At the very least, don’t hold back when fighting.”\n“I know that without you telling me. I’ll be the one getting the medals this time.”\n“… Oy, oy, I can’t keep quiet on that one. It’s my army here, you know.”\nEven if she may be strong, a lone horseman plans to monopolize the battlefield? Even a Greed like me’s surprised. In the first place, her power… isn’t for direct combat, I think.\nThe Shadow of Illusions, Medea.\nAmong Demons, of course, the most famous are the Lords, but your name can be spread regardless.\nAnd among Leigie’s army, she’s one of the most reknowned. Ki ki ki, even I knew about her before I joined Boss’s side.\nI’ve no idea why a Luxuria Attribute Demon would side with an Acedia though.\nEven if she’s not direct combat oriented, she should be able to crush any normal Demon underfoot, but this is no conventional opponent. I can only say it’s a bad matchup to put her against the Devourer.\nMedea takes a quick glance at the Slaughter Doll standing behind me.\nEven without getting a name, the Slaughter Doll’s already far transcended the ranks of an average Demon in battle prowess. If I equipped the rare equipment I hoarded onto him, he’d really be peerless.\nI guess it really does depend on the level of the caster.\nBut without a hint of interest, Medea turns back to me.\n“I don’t need any equipment. I don’t want any treasure either. I don’t want to play with dolls, and I don’t want status.”\n“Oy, oy, then what is it that you want?”\n“I am Lust. All I want is love.”\nI see… interesting.\nThat one sentence makes it clear. At the moment, this one’s far more sinful than me, who simply strives for loot and power.\nSo be it. This one’s cravings won’t go against mine. I’ll just leave it that for now.\nFor a business partner, probing any further is… unnecessary.\n“So you say your cravings won’t compete with mine. Well, fine. I’ll trust those words. It’ll be dull to croak from a shot from behind.”\nI give a warning.\nIn a Demon’s forces, just by the clashing of wills, an ally can easily become an enemy.\nKi ki ki, what’s more, Medea was the one who opposed my appointment to this position ‘til the end. You can never be too prepared.\nWell, in a straight out battle, she won’t be able to beat me with my Demon Lord Class arms.\nTry not to die a dog’s death as you show off your powers to me. You have something good enough to cut down a Demon Lord, right?",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Avaritia, Part 4: Now, Let’s Start the Usurping\nThe Demon Lord who Governed Gluttony, Zebul Glaucus—Zebul the Devourer was of the Greatest of Demon Lords.\nAmong the Demon World’s strongest forces governed by the Great Demon King Kanon Iralaude, he would even rank within the top ten. While this may not have been due to his basic fighting prowess, the ranking bestowed on him by the Great Demon King was Rank Five.\nIn a superfluous gesture, I ask the men lined up before me.\n“Do you understand what that means, men?”\n“…”\nThis may be common sense, but a Demon’s appearance doesn’t necessarily have to be in human form.\nAs they gain more and more power, quite a few of them take on human appearance, but a demon’s figure is all representative of his individual nature.\nA grotesque array of numerous forms were in formation with a sense of order rare to find in the army of a Demon Lord.\nIt’s all because of a skill the guy governing this land, Boss, has. By it, the soldiers of his army will gain power while fighting on his land.\nIt’s a skill common to all Demon Lords, and one of the most famous: 『Abyss Zone』.\nThat’s what makes advantages in a fight between demons not based on size, or geological advantage, but on the quality of the Demon Lord governing them.\nBoss Leigie never stands on the Front Lines, but an invisible battle between Demon Lords was already going on around us.\nWhile we can’t see the glutton Zebul’s zone, it should be eating into the sloth Leigie’s zone, in an attempt to give his troops an upper hand.\nKi ki ki, try your hardest.\nI’ll be doing the same. More or less.\n“That means… we are obtaining… the glory of destroying a Demon Lord Himself, what’s more, a high class one at that. Ki ki ki, Boss isn’t to be underestimated. He’s giving us a chance this big…”\nIf I may, I’d wish he’d be a little easier on us, but that’s impossible.\nThere’s no doubt the Boss doesn’t even remember the fact that Zebul’s attacking.\nBut that’s unrelated to us, the one’s fighting at the site.\nTo satisfy my Greed, I can’t be scared to take risks. Otherwise my life would have ended as a nameless demon in the countryside.\nI draw a single sword from the scabbard at my waist.\nDemon Blade Celeste.\nFor a swordsman… no, for any Demon, it’s a well-known blade of legend.\nI concentrate my gaze on the burning body of the sword.\nDark Crimson magical energy as bright as the sun surrounds its wielder, me, as it rises as a pillar of light into the demon world’s red sky. Its power is greater beyond my comprehension.\nKi ki ki, as long as I have this, I’ll be a match for a hundred.\nAdditionally, while they may fall short of Celeste, I have a number of Demon Blades just a rank or two below it in my possession.\n“Let’s go, ya bastards. All the money, the fame, the power and the women are yours for the taking. Release your desires, and prove your powers to our Demon Lord, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls, and the Great Demon King above him, Kanon Iralaude. The Demon Lord of Gluttony is nothing, and it is our duty to make him realize that. Realize just who… it is he picked a fight with.”\nThe strange-looking crowd’s applause rings out like thunder.\nThese guys aren’t fools. A strong Demon Lord draws Strong followers to himself. This isn’t about the Great Demon King’s dispatchments or anything, it’s something more to do with fate, or luck drawing them together.\nA Demon’s base instincts lead them to follow the most atrocious presences to satisfy their spirits.\nA nihilistic full moon floated in the blazing red sky.\nThis territory is still Boss’s. In the distant wastelands, I see the black shadows of Gluttony’s forces.\nMedea slowly gets up.\nAs if she was shrouded in mist, her outline isn’t clear, and it’s as if only the powerful pressure she gave off denoted she was truly there.\nMe and her rarely work alongside one another. But her single motion showed me the level of her ability.\nLust skills are pretty much an unknown world to me. I’m not saying I’ve never gone against them, but they’re not a group of demons you would often meet at General level.\nHigh class magic that pollutes the mind, and deceives the five senses.\nThe eyes of the men watching Medea begin turning lewd.\nKi ki ki, what a scary woman. I mean, she’s the only woman in this entire army squadron, and she’s the leader. If I underestimate her, I feel my soul’s going to get sucked out.\n“I’m going ahead. Objections?”\n“Ki ki ki, do whatever you want, Luxuria. You’r the guest here today.”\nIf you want the first attack, you can have it. All I care for is the result.\nFirst, let’s see through the power of the Devourer. That’s her field of expertise, right?\nMedea’s form starts blurring again. It’s like my eyes have gone blurry, but they aren’t going back. Her formed warped into two identical girls. The second one opened its mouth, and spoke with the same condescending tone.\n“Avaritia, I’m thankful.”\n“… I don’t need your thanks. Just do your best not to get killed by the first strike.”\n“Hmph…”\nShe scoffed at my words.\nAt the same moment, in no time at all, her form multiplied from two to a countless amount.\nThis is… the Lust skill tree. The proof of a demon governing temptation and delusions.\nHow unexpected. An illusion good enough to deceive my eyes… and she can deploy this amount in an instant?\nOy oy, isn’t she a monster? And resistance skills I have against mental corruption aren’t resisting anything.\nWhile my mind’s in disarray, I do my best not to show it on my face.\nCompared to her, the skills of the other Lust demons I fought look like Child’s play.\nThere’s a ranking among skills. If you don’t learn the previous skill, you can’t learn the next one. So just to what extent has she fulfilled her own lust to be able to use illusions of this level?\nMedea licks her lips in a seductive fashion. As if painted by her tongue, her lips turn the crimson color of blood. Her movements were enough to show anyone the attribute she reigned over.\n“Then, later.”\nHer pure white robe turns.\nEach and every Medea’s robe sways differently as they sprint off.\nNot a single sound resounds through the deserted land, and her actions don’t change that fact. She somehow remains inconspicuous. Even so, the group moves at a frightening speed.\nThe real one’s fleeting existence wavers like a heat haze in the desert, and it’s as if, if I turned my eyes away, I wouldn’t be able to find her again. I can’t feel her magic or perceive her with any of my other senses.\nImpossible. Impossible. Impossible. This is bad. This ability… suitable for her name?\nFitting of her reputation? Don’t screw with me. She’s exceeded it. If none of my resistances worked against her, then that Gluttony’s legion won’t sense a thing.\nAt this rate… she’s capable of deceiving and killing them all.\nThere’d be no room for me to go out.\nI’d heard that Luxuria skills become terrifying at high levels, but I never thought I’d confirm it in a place like this. I guess you never know what’s gonna happen. I’m glad we’re allies.\nWell, it’s troublesome we’re allies too. At this rate, I won’t be able to rack up any distinguished service.\n“Oy, ya’ bastards. Is this the time for you all to be playing around? Follow Medea’s lead, and launch a full-on assault! At this rate, that girly’s going to take all the limelight!”\nPerhaps they had finally noticed I had spoken. The following demons began following her lead, and running off. But their visions are now clouded with the sight of an infinite number of Medeas.\nWell, well, well, so everyone’s been captured in her illusion. It’ll be hell if they have a Lust on them too. Should I equip some resistive gear?\nNo, in the first place, can a mere magic tool go against this illusion?\nAs s cloud of dust rises as the army rushes downhill, I go over to the only demon that stayed behind.\nAn Invidia Demon. Libell Aejens. A small and powerless one, but a scholar whose knowledge is said to be second to none. He’s also a friend who accompanied me when I came over to join this army.\nIn a war between demons, seeing through your opponent’s ability is a crucial factor. Based on that, tactics can change drastically.\nI ask the wise demon. Not of our enemy, but our ally.\n“Oy, that skill. Do you have any recollection of something like it?”\nLibell’s purple eyes scrutinizingly trace the form of the countless men chasing Medea. Ki ki ki, he may have the form of a brat, but this man once earned recognition for his efforts in the wars with heaven. A renowned intellectual.\nAmong my associates, he’s the one with the most in-depth knowledge of other Demons.\n“I’ve never seen it, but I’ve heard of something like it… I high class Lust Skill… SS Class『Phantom Aliquot Dance』… A skill to birth illusions with physical substance…”\nWith a soul-less expression, Libell bit his lower lip as he raised a voice that seemed to come from the deepest depths of Hell.\nBut his expression doesn’t really matter. His answer was outside my realm of speculation.\n“… What? Oy, oy, don’t joke around. SS Class? That’s crossed the bounds of a General Class Demon, hasn’t it?”\n“… I cannot believe it. No… but, there’s no mistaking it. I have a much higher level of Mental Corruption Resistance than you, and I was unable to see through it with these eyes…”\nHis words were no lie. Due to the nature of the Envy Tree’s skillset, Libell’s resistances should be far above mine.\nIs this for real?\nAn SS Class Lust Tree Skill? That’s definitely within Demon Lord territory.\nAs a fellow general, the highest level Greed Skill I can use… I’ve only reached S.\nAnd that candid girl’s surpassed me? How the hell?\nNo, is she hiding her true nature? Stuck in the closet? A Closet pervert? No, no, as if I’d let something so idiotic pass. A Demon’s cravings aren’t something so half-assed. Just what is that girl doing in the shadows?\nNo, in the first place, after all that… Why isn’t she a Demon Lord yet?\nThat’s wrong. That’s not what I should be thinking about now.\nA Demon Lord’s skills have far transcended the skills of a normal Demon. I don’t know just how many skills they have in their repertoires, but if she can use SS Class Lust skills at will, then even a high class Demon Lord will be hard pressed. I mean, the opponent shouldn’t have much information on her. High level Lust Demons are hard to come by.\nCrap, the Demon Lord of Gluttony may get eaten up at this rate.\nI take a sword out of my storage space, and grip it in one of my left hands. I hold up Celeste, and on the edge of the wasteland… I glare a girly, who’s coming into contact with the enemy, from afar.\nHer pure white coat. Even with such a flashy color, I can’t find her.\n“Damn, there’s no helping it. I’ll also go out. Libell, you go and『Envy』 Girly’s skill.”\n… But my capacity is already full.“\nMy, my, this man doesn’t get it. You don’t often get a chance to see a high class Luxuria skill, you know?\n『Invidia』 Class Skills are picky. If you hold too much desire without fulfillment, it loses its use, and you become just a useless, average Demon.\n“Libell, throw away my『Skill Ruler』.”\n“… I see. That one was convenient.”\nBut he immediately nods. I like how he’s quick to understand.\nThat’s why I’m friends with this guy.\n“Ki ki ki, what’s the problem? Once your skilltree expands, you’ll make more space. Once you get a high class Lust skill, you’ll be able to raise it easier, right? You’ve fulfilled most of the conditions already, right?”\n“Yeah, I’ll do that.”\nEnvy skills let you learn the skills of others. They’re limited time use, and the conditions for acquiring them are harsh, but it’s a perfect imitation.\nIt’s really convenient. I mean, if you fulfill the conditions, you can even use Demon Lord Class skills.\nThis is a chance. We can’t approach a Demon Lord so easily. So the acquiring conditions won’t be met.\nWe’ll use the skill Medea just displayed. It looks to have all-purpose uses. If he learns to use it, I’ll become even stronger.\nI’ll get closer to being a Demon Lord. If Deije the Usurper, and Libell the Pursuer join forces, we’ll be the strongest.\nKi ki ki, luck’s finally going my way, it seems.\nNow, let’s start the Usurping.\n“Girly, I’m sorry. I’ll be taking your skill.”\nPower and fame and treasure, and all else. It’ll all come to me.",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Luxuria, Part 1: A Demon Lord of Lust Said, Once Upon a Time\nA Demon Lord of Lust said, once upon a time,\n“Even without assertive charm, you can still fulfill your desire.\nIf it’s just satisfying your cravings, there are no obstacles.”\nSaying that, she didn’t eat what was to be eaten, and as she continued wasting away, she gently stroked my head.\nHer refreshing appearance and enamoring charisma were enough to make even a female like me harbor certain feelings. She was beautiful enough to force one into depravity, and as I mused at how this was what a true devilish beauty was, I couldn’t help but feel envious of her.\nPerhaps she was the only『Luxuria』 I ever had my eyes on, and I wanted her to view me as a single 『Luxuria』 as well. She was an exceedingly sweet, dark, and fleeting woman.\nThat Demon Lord already fell long ago, but her teachings live on within me, and I live with them as my foundations.\nLust is said to be the most difficult to satisfy among the Original Sins.\nDemons don’t fall to charms so easily.\nMaterial wealth for Greed, Honor for Pride,\nAppetite for Gluttony, and Envy and Wrath are on a different Vector.\nSloth has his world complete with him alone, and he won’t even remember my name.\nAnd as a High Level Demon, the stronger a Demon gets, the more they must pursue their thirst, and the more they are dyed by those emotions. Once they reach Demon Lord Level, all emotions besides that one are nothing more than cheap scraps of paper lying around. They barely remain.\nAt present, my greatest enemy is not someone like the Demon Lord of Gluttony, but the Demon Lord of my own forces.\nJust how many decades, how many centuries have I sided with him? At the very least, he could remember my name.\nIs it my sin for me to think that way?\nI hate Deije of Greed. But I recognize his fighting prowess.\nThat Pride and I never thought to take the initiative and launch assaults ourselves. I may add that Leigie-sama has no such sentiments either, so for Deije, who sought powerful equipment as compensation, he continues to be a useful asset to Leigie-sama’s army.\nFor him, whose longings lead him directly to battle, he’s the only one to long to go on the offense in our army.\nI’m merely envious of him.\nEven I… have things I long for. I’ve just never pursued them directly.\nIt’s something that can’t be helped with the attribute I govern.\nI managed to come in contact with the enemy within a few seconds.\nDespite this, I’m a High Class Demon. I’m often told that I’m small, or unsociable, or that I lack any sex appeal, but that has nothing to do with battle. With the stride of a High Class Demon, I kicked the ground, and crushed the deserted land underfoot, before coming into contact with the Gluttony Legion that had been several Kilometers away.\nMore than a hundred of me are visible, but still, the Gluttony army a few hundred meters away shows no signs of having noticed us.\nA large majority of the Luxuria Skill Tree has to do with skills that corrupt the mind.\nThey range from typical charm spells to creating illusions at will, and there are even ones to put others to sleep.\nEven so, they aren’t favorable for use on Demons.\nOne of the first skills a demon gets on the basic Skill Tree is a passive that resists mental corruption. Besides Angels and Demons, other races rarely have it, but among those two, it’s quite rare to find someone without that skill.\nBecause of that, Luxuria Demons are looked down upon. The Luxuria Skill Tree, from the elementary to the higher levels, can be completely negated with one of the first skills of the basic tree.\nIn the worst cases, we’re called useless seductresses, and I’ve completely eradicated those who looked at me with such biased views. They show no interest in me when it matters, but as a joke, they try to tarnish my Pride, and incite my Wrath, even when I govern neither of those fields.\nGenerally, the Lust Attribute has nothing to do with that. They’re making a grave misunderstanding.\nIt’s not that… I’m lacking in sex appeal, and it’s not that I’m lacking in charm. My hair, and my skin, and even my clothing, I take good care of it all, and I’m trying my hardest to make my expression as bright and affectionate as possible.\nThe meagerness of my stature is by no means my fault. It’s because I didn’t get enough nutrition in my childhood. Once I began paying mind to it, I tried to get as much nourishment into my system as possible, but it was too late.\nBut I can’t go around cursing fate.\nIt’s fine. This isn’t my favorite phrase, but none of it really matters.\nIt’s not like I… want to become one who incites sexual desire from everyone, or that I want to embrace everyone.\nA majority of Zebul the Devourer’s legion consists of Demons with Gluttony as their original sin.\nThat tree specializes in ways to attack large areas. It’s the skill tree whose attack power is second only to Wrath.\nBut it’s useless if it doesn’t hit.\nThe fact that everyone has resistance to Mental Corruption means they have little ways to deal with it once their resistance is overcome.\nIn particular, the Lust Skill 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』 is not just some illusionary skill.\nEach and every one of my phantoms’ fields of visions are sent directly to my head.\nAt the head of his army, a demon finally captures sight of my flickering image and stops his feet.\nThe power I sense from his being is by no means low. Zebul’s army is quite powerful.\nThe army of Gluttony was a herd of grotesque demons. There were barely any that had complete hold of a human form. That violent animalistic nature… beastly howls echo through the desert as if to express their appetites.\nThe magic I sense from each and every one of them is slightly higher than those of the Rank Three army, but there’s not much of a difference. These men no longer have a future. They went against the Great Demon King Kanon, and now that they’ve taken down two Demon Lords, they’ve burned their bridge back. They won’t even be able to make it through with a narrow victory. Unless they completely overwhelm us, they wouldn’t be able to stand the confrontations with the fifteen other Demon Lords under Kanon.\nFrom what I’ve heard, the reason the Devourer started his revolution was a shortage of food. There is little in the nature of food provisions within the Demon World. No, from the standpoint of an average Demon, there’s plenty of food going around, but the Gluttony Attribute exponentially increases the required volume. The more they eat, the more power they can obtain. Just as Lust’s power increases the more intimate interactions one has. Just as Envy’s power increases the more one longs for the possessions of others.\nThe Demon that noticed us activated a Gluttony Skill.\nA black wave of magic expands from him in an instant and swallows me up.\nI see… a Gluttony Skill. How atrocious.\nThe magic around my body is pierced through with fangs and torn away. The magic of the Body Strengthening abilities I was using were forcefully dissipated, converted back to pure magic, and sucked away.\nThis is… a skill to eat up another’s power and use it as your own.\nIt’s likely he didn’t know where my real body was, so he tried to target all of us altogether. The scope of his ability has a bad affinity with my Lust skills.\nI already knew from the start, but this will be troublesome.\nThat’s why I went out first. I, one of the only three Generals of Leigie-sama’s army.\nNo matter how bad the affinity, no matter how unsuited I am for battle, you cannot overturn the difference in our ability.\nMy Lust draws his eyes, and they’re clouded for a moment. He’s underestimating me.\nBut he only stopped moving for a brief instant, and『Gluttony』dyes his eyes once more. These guys will even eat those of the same race. No, I don’t mean sexually, I mean it physically. That’s why I hate them. No, it’s not like I wanted to be eaten sexually or anything…\nThe claws extending from his fingers mercilessly come towards my face. Before any of my blood could scatter, I used my hand to gouge his throat out. First one down. Without looking back to see him hit the ground, I continued to kick at the ground.\nIf possible, I want to use my skills, but as long as they’re blocked by resistances, I only have hand to hand combat. But that’s more than enough.\nFangs sent forth from behind pierce through my stomach, and like that, a single one of my illusions was eaten up. The blood dancing through the empty air soon vanished.\nOne of my fields of vision disappeared. But something like that won’t inflict any damage on me. My direct attacks work, even on Gluttony Demons. It’s been my first physical battle in a while, but it looks alright. I can do this.\nDeije is an annoying man, but he definitely has an eye for war. He has some vulgar parts, but I can’t underestimate the power that got him a commanding position in a mere 10 years.\nThe role given to the one who can control the five senses definitely isn’t annihilating their army.\nMy role is to ascertain the power of the Demon Lord. Even if no one said it, I can understand that much.\nZebul the Devourer. I’ll have to use my body to take on one of the high class Demon Lord Skills we’ve heard about and see its power. And that job is perfect for an illusion user like me. Even Deije’s Third Brigade that specializes in offense and mobility would instantly get their numbers reduced if they went up against him unprepared.\nEven if you categorize him as a Lord, he should have some disparity. Attack strength, durability, dexterity, character flaws, specialized abilities. I don’t doubt that Zebul’s powerful, but there’s a need for me to determine his tendencies with my flesh.\nThe army’s casualties are Leigie-sama’s casualties. They must be avoided.\nAt that moment, Zebul’s entire army came to a halt.\nMy body shook. It felt as if my entire body had been pierced and eaten away.\nIn the center stood a shadow the size of a large hill. That’s the source of these shivers.\nA presence that sips away at the body and mind and crumbles one’s pride.\nI have a premonition of everything and anything scattering and being washed away.\nIt’s a feeling I’ve never felt before in all my years of service.\nThat shock made my hands stop for a moment.\nThis cannot be… this is…\nThe moment my mind had stopped working, my illusions dispersed.\nBut what I should be paying mind to isn’t that.\nFights between Demon Lords are struggles for territory.\nRight now, the outcome of the competing forces was decided.\n“Leigie-sama’s territory was eaten up…!?”\n“… Oy, oy, where are you popping out from, girly…”\nDeije let out an amazed voice as I materialized before him.\nIt’s fine. This area separated by a few Kilometers hasn’t been affected yet.\nMy other bodies were all destroyed and absorbed with not a trace left behind. When I turned to run, tentacle like things entangled my feet, so I flung myself into the air. At that point, black, bun-like spheres followed and released countless tentacles at me. That was the last sight I picked up from my other bodies. Without any means of resistance, the illusions went out like a light the moment they came into contact with that black shadow of mass.\nWhat strength. I didn’t even have the leisure to deceive him.\nMy General Class strength won’t get through to that.\nTruly a Demon that’s transcended demonity. A monster that’s reached the pinnacle of Original Sin… this is a High Level Demon Lord\nI thought I had known, but it’s… way too much. I can’t even tell what skill he used. No, even if I knew, I doubt I would be able to dodge.\nOur base stats are just too far apart. Our levels of longings too far detached.\nOne of my doubles had tried to lodge her fist into Zebul’s back. When I thought she had pierced him, the double was merely swallowed into his body whole. She tried to resist, but she was instantly digested, and my awareness of her was cut.\nEven if I was trying to assess the situation, even if it was just a double, I never thought a Demon Lord would be able to kill a General so easily.\nHis pure violent nature let him mow down all my Illusions of Lust without paying them any mind.\nHe may be a newcomer, but he’s swallowed two other Demon Lords. This is the result.\n“Deije, bad… He’s strong…”\n“… Well, well, well, isn’t that obvious? The opponent is… a High Ranking Demon Lord. He came with full intentions to kill boss Leigie…”\nDeige skillfully manipulated his six arms as he let out a sigh.\nWhat an irritating man. But that’s exactly right.\nHowever, Zebul’s power… is abnormal. It’s been many hundreds of years since I first breathed life, but he’s surpassed all I’ve ever seen before.\nI can’t see any means of victory. That’s my impression after having crossed blades with him.\nShould we retreat some and reorganize our forces?\n“Should we reorganize our preparations?”\n“No, no, at this rate, my army’ll be annihilated. We have no choice but to fight.”\nDeije smiled as he raised the Demon Blade in his right arm overhead.\nDemon Blade Celeste. A sword imbued with flames, named after the legendary fire dragon it struck down.\nA gift from the Great Demon King to a Demon Lord, one of the best of swords, was being shown off gaudily.",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Luxuria, Part 2: We Cannot Lose\nA red hot light fills the world.\nDemon Blade Celeste.\nIt’s a sword that contains the attribute of fire.\nIts ranking as a weapon is SSS. Besides dragons, it’s a blade that’s said to have also burned higher level Angels to death.\nAfter having been enshrined in the Great Demon King’s warehouse for many years, that weapon is now showing off its power once more.\nBy no means can High Level Demon Blades be used as nothing but swords.\n“Ki ki ki, as expected, this is some amazing magic…”\nLaughing in his annoying voice, Deije unsealed the sword’s power.\nUsually, this level of weapon would be in the hands of a Demon Lord. It should be too much to handle for a General, but Deije seems to be able to direct that ridiculously large amount of magical power at the enemy forces without much problem.\nI guess his large build isn’t just for show.\nWhat an annoying man…\nThe flaming dragon that emerged from the sword swiftly passes over the Third Brigade, before taking a taste of the enemy army a few kilometers away.\nA black light emits from their forces.\n『Surge of Starvation』\nA Gluttonous skill of Gluttony.\nThe wave of power clashes with the Demon Blade’s flames.\nThe ravenous magic that seems to want to devour anything and everything competes with the inferno so powerful I cannot even begin to comprehend it.\nWhile borrowing that sword’s power, Deije truly is able to rival that Zebul’s strength.\nHe licks his thick lips in an irritating manner.\n“When borrowing from Celeste, we’re just about equal… as expected from a Demon Lord… that power, I want it.”\nThe root of Original Sin is said to be desire.\nI want money. I want items. I want to eat good food. I want sex. I don’t want to work. I despise others. I want to make them all kneel.\nAnd both mine and Deije’s desire can be summed up as jealousy towards others.\nIn the end, stealing is, in itself, a demon’s base nature. Collecting more of something than everyone else in a land with limited resources.\nDeije grasps onto the sword emitting light with four of his hands. His expression towards the violent power he was letting forth remained a heroic smile.\nThe heat is tanning his arms red, but there’s no sign of him lessening his grip at all.\n“Ki ki ki, we really only have long range attacks, I guess. If I get closer, I feel I’ll get eaten up. I’m a bit ill-suited with Gluttony as my opponent…”\n“… But we cannot lose.”\n“Naturally. If we lost with two Generals dispatched here… that Heard will give us hell before the Boss even hears about it.”\nI touch the sword in his grasp.\nIt’s a heat great enough to scorch both the body and the soul.\nBy a skill, Friendly Fire, damage from allied troops is cut off, so I’m not hurt. But even without taking any damage, his overbearing might made me feel jealousy.\nDeije’s right hand Demon, Lebell, is making a grim face.\n“Fumu… Gluttony Skill 『Surge of Starvation』 eats any power thrown at it. Deije, if you don’t settle this soon, it’ll suck up all of Celeste’s magic, you know?”\n“I know. Ki ki ki, competition… it’s a game. How useless. Celeste’s magic power truly is terrifying. But this isn’t enough to sate my desire! If we just take down the enemy Demon Lord, then we’ll be able to achieve victory with ease!”\nAt the sight of the conquering flame, our own troops halt their advance. Even if they don’t take any damage, they don’t have the courage to jump into the fire.\nNo, right now, the war’s become a one on one with the Demon Lord and Celeste. One more step forwards, and it seems evident they’ll get devoured but Zebul. Thus is the extent of the thirst emitted by his aura of Gula.\nHis subordinates are halted as well.\n“Ki ki ki, but I’m a bit short on hands. I can’t push him back. There’s no helping it, I’ll use the Doll…”\nI turn my eyes to the skeletal doll made of silver-colored bones standing behind him.\n“… No need. I’ll do it.”\nDeije seems taken aback as he stares at me. Is it really that strange?\nIs it strange for a Luxuria to say such things?\nOur affinity is the worst. I’ll admit that. But that can’t be the end of it all. We have no time to care about something like that.\nAt this rate, Deije’s going to take all the credit.\nI close my eyes and extract power from all over my body. I wring out power from my demon heart, my soul core. Fight fire with fire. I desire flames of hell to swallow everything.\nEverything, burn the roots of hunger to the ground and eradicate it from the world.\nAnd I manifested my own 『Sword』.\n“… Oy, oy, what sort of joke is this…”\n“… Do I look like I’m joking?”\nI raise up the sword in my right hand.\nIt’s a beautiful straight sword with a flaming edge. The blade I made with almost all of the magic in my body at the base falls short of Celeste, but it’s still fitting to be held by a Demon Lord.\nIf Deije isn’t enough by himself, then just add some extra.\nThe Greed Demon’s expression warps.\n“Is that also… a Lust skill!? Like hell… what did you do!?”\n“Witness and behold the power of Luxuria, foolish heathen.”\nI swung the sword.\nPower storms out of it, and a red flash dyes the world.\nAn enormous amount of heat races up my arm.\nDemon Blades require some form of compensation. So Celeste had a feedback like this on the wielder!?\nFlames of hell envelop my arm as a similar stream of flame flows forth to mingle with Deije’s dragon.\nIt feels like my body is being torn apart. By flames. My head is spinning.\nBut Deije, who’s supposed to be taking an equivalent amount of pain stands calmly. I cant be the only one showing pain.\nEven I’m… a commanding officer. One of the leader of Leigie-sama’s army.\nMy arm was baked by the dazzling light and began to emit an ominous stench. Blisters began to cover my white skin, but those disappear just as fast, being replaced by unsightly burns.\nI grit my teeth, and do my best to endure the pain, as I direct my gaze forward.\nI continue to direct my flame at Deije’s, and the light from it glows brighter. Bright enough that I can’t open my eyes.\nAt that moment, the inferno definitely overwhelmed the Demon Lord’s power. Waves of flame came down on the Demon Lord’s army.\n“… I don’t really get it, but you’re not bad, girly. Ki ki ki, but I’m…”\nDeije let off an evil laugh. His six eyes gleamed with an uncanny sparkle.\n“… going to get even more power.”\nThe moment he said that, the intensity of the flames increased explosively.\nThis is… a Greed Skill!?\nThe black, surging power that had been pushed back the instant our flames mingled was instantly blown away with the skill Deije used.\nRed waves of light swallowed up the army of Gluttony, and spread immensely in every direction.\nThe swirls of light rain down incessantly on the area several kilos away, but the blast extends all the way here.\nIt’s a fearsome response.\n“Ki ki ki, this is Celeste’s power… I guess the fact that it was made with the heavenly flames that burned a ruler of demons to death was no lie.”\nDeije’s voice is full of excitement.\nWhat power. It’s a dangerous weapon. What’s more ,its power that pushed back a Demon Lord was further enhanced with a skill of Greed.\nLeigie-sama… this toy is too dangerous to be in Deije’s hands.\nWaves of intense heat pass over the Demon World desert, and my hair dances wildly behind me.\nBut Deije’s smile soon vanished from his face.\n“Oy, oy… is this for real…”\n“… This cannot be. There’s no way a normal Demon Lord would be able to stand that…”\nLibell has a face of shock as he faces the distant wasteland… the distance between us no longer has meaning.\nA black mass squirmed. There’s no sign of the army that had covered the region.\nWith heat of that level, they’ve probably been obliterated without even their souls left behind.\nThe mass trembled greatly, before it started to contract.\nThe Third Brigade that had come to a halt only a few hundred meters away from it raise their voices.\nThe air changes.\nIt’s not just around Zebul. Even the area where I am standing is affected.\nThe clear pitch-black changes into a swamp-like drudgy darkness.\nNoticing that, Deije raised his voice in a daze.\n“… Boss Leigie… lost… you say!?”\nIt was the feeling of him overwriting the 『Abyss Field』.\nThe proof that we had been cast into enemy territory. The power in my body truly has decreased by a noticeable level, and my magic is dropping.\nAbyss zone is a skill that is more effective the closer you are to your Demon Lord, as long as you’re on their territory.\nIt should be impossible for a higher ranking Demon Lord to have his Zone taken over by a lower one so easily.\nHowever, up until now, Leigie’s zone was one that had never been violated, no matter how vicious the wars were.\n“… Give me a break. A Demon Lord that can withstand that baptism by fire!? Isn’t that L Class…”\n“… Deije, are you able to use that skill from before again?”\n“You joking? It didn’t even work when we were on Boss’s Zone. There’s no way it would have any effect on his.”\nDeije’s eyes are in a panic as he looks over his surroundings.\nHe’s correct. Abyss Zone raises the abilities of friendly troops. It’s boost is not at an ignorable level.\n“Just how much of the zone was eaten!? Libell!”\n“… Quite a large portion! The extent is outside the range of my perception!”\nA hostility I could sense with my very being.\nA viscous and hungry aura.\nThe only one left is the Demon Lord? There doesn’t seem to be anyone else left standing around him, but that’s not even any consolation at this point.\nThe contracting black lump begins to change shape.\nFrom an uncertain slime-like blob to… Human form.\n“Zebul Glaucus… One with unsatiable hunger… the one who’ll swallow everything, the Devouring King, is it…”\nI can see it.\nThe Dark Beast that encroaches on the world, decomposing everthing in its path.\nThe human form it took was much smaller than I expected. It may even be smaller than me. Compared to Deije, who stands over two meters, I estimate he’s around four heads shorter.\nJust where did all of that mass go?\nAs if a hole had been opened in space, the overcoat he wore sucked in all light, leaving only black space.\nThe oppressive feeling he gave off made the kilometers between us feel like nothing.\nIt was something I hadn’t felt when approaching him before, that is, until I was right next to him.\n“Ki ki ki, how interesting… He’s eating up Boss’s Zone with some amazing momentum…”\nYou still have the leisure to laugh? Deije’ pluck is to be commended.\nHis bulging pectoralis muscles expand further, and he raises a fierce voice.\n“Men! What are you doing spacing out!? Our opponent is the Demon Lord alone! Forward!”\nThe air quivers.\nHaving heard Deije’s reprimand, the Third Brigade that had come to a halt dashed forward violently.\nTheir force was like a Tsunami. Even after seeing the Demon Lord’s power, even after the zone was taken, they didn’t fall back.\n“Girly, even if you’ve got power, you lack guts. I’ll bet you’ve got a lot on your mind, but to those normal folk down there, if we give up on battle, it’s the end, right? Ki ki ki, you aren’t strong enough to be able to sleep on the battlefield yet.”\n“… That’s right.”\nBut at this rate, our annihilation is inevitable.\nDeije’s words may be on the mark, but they’re also a death sentence to his men.\nEven if it’s the Third Brigade, a hoard of Normal Demons won’t even be able to buy that much time. Because I fought him myself, I can tell.\nTentacles protruded from his coat, mercilessly impaling the Demons on the front lines.\nWithout even the time to scream, they were dyed pure black, and absorbed.\nBut the Demon Lord’s mass doesn’t increase in the slightest.\nJust how do you expect me to beat an enemy like that…!?\nCountless dripping tentacles protruded from all over his body.\nHe took off the hood covering his face.\n“That one’s… a Woman…! Isn’t her appearance quite similar to yours, girly?”\nDark green hair almost black in shade, and eyes of the same color. From the look on her face, she doesn’t even see the army laid out before her.\nA Demon’s appearance is irrelevant.\nNo, the more calming one’s appearance, the more dangerous they are. Because that is but another weapon.\nZebul’s looks were gentle without a hint of the Gluttony she ruled over.\nI’m not sure what was on her mind, as she lorded over the demons around her.\nAt least we have the numerical advantage. From the Demon Lord’s blind spot—I greatly question whether such a thing even exists—anyways, from behind, a lance was stabbed into the Lord.\nIt definitely pierced the coat, but like that, it continued to be sucked into it. He had let go in time, so the wielder was spared the same fate. He dodged the tentacles that came after him with a back step, but that didn’t change the fact he was still unarmed.\nIn the gap created, another demon deployed a number of fireballs, and hurled them at the Demon Lord. But even that was just swallowed up, and all that remained was silence.\nZebul licked her lips hungrily.\n“… That’s unfair. Did Gluttony have a skill like that?”\nLibell’s expression is pale, but his voice is level as he answers.\n“It’s a mid-level Gluttony Skill. An endless stomach that sucks in any and everything. … But originally, is shouldn’t be able to indiscriminately suck in everyone’s attacks like that.”\n“So it’s a difference in refinement… Ki ki ki, this is why people who arrive at the summit are… it can’t be that Celeste’s attack was sucked into that too?”\n“I doubt it would be able to swallow something of that level… I think. But if you prevent her mid-level skills, I can’t even imagine what her high-level ones will do…”\nThe Demon Lord doesn’t have any particular expression on her face as she just looks around.\nDeije has an unpleasant expression as his lips warp. He reluctantly reaches for his sword.\nWith a single blade, I think I could beat a higher level Demon with four normal level Demon Blades. But now that he’s this equipped, I can’t see any chances of victory.\n“Crap, our eyes just met…”\n“Will you run?”\n“Don’t be stupid, against a high ranking Demon Lord… there’s no way I’ll be able to get away. Ki ki ki, prepare yourself, Libell Aijens. Think back to the War of Black and White. Compared to that… we’re still better off, right? We’re only up against one.”\nOn Deije’s words of resolution, Libell let out a deep sigh.\n“… Well, well, there’s no helping it. I’ve already given up my life once… Deije, I’m not even Envious of your resolve right now.”\n“Ki ki ki, you’re as serious as always. I’m just a little… greedier than most humans.”\n… There’s no helping it. I’ll resolve myself as well.\nWhile it may be a fake I created, the Demon Blade in my hand barely has any Magic left At most, the skills I can use now are Elementary Level.\nCQC isn’t in Lust’s territory, but I draw the knife hanging from my belt.\nIt’s something Leigie-sama bequeathed to me. Of course, it falls far short of Celeste, but it’s a Demon Blade all the same. It’ll at least buy me an instant of time.\n“Girly, you can run, you know? You’ve barely got any magic left, right?”\n“Run? Is that a joke?”\nWhy must I… I, who was picked up by Leigie-sama abandon my duty when crisis strikes?\nEven a mercenary like Deije isn’t considering fleeing this desperate situation.\nDeije blinks his eyes as if he had witnessed something mysterious.\n“Hmm… but no matter how you look at it, a dagger ain’t gonna cut it. Can you use a sword?”\n“… As much as the next guy.”\n“Ki ki ki, then so be it. I’ll lend you… a single one of my swords. The interest for this transaction is that dagger. Only if we return alive, that is.”\nInterest?\nJust how far does his greed go? I unintentionally laughed.\nFor him to make business dealings when our lives are on the line…\n“Hah… what are you saying at a time like this? Greed sure is something.”\n“Ki ki ki, when there’s a chance to get something, you just have to take it… I mean, there are way too many things I want in this world.”\n“And the most important of them is life, isn’t it?”\n“Of course, so I plan on getting my hands on that someday as well.”\nThe sword Deije tossed over was covered in a freezing aura.\nIt’s no Celeste, but I feel power within it that would be more than what a General Class Demon deserved.\nGlaring at the Lord who was tossing around the soldiers he trained like scraps of paper, Deije spoke.\n“But I have no intentions of dying, though.”\n“Neither do I.”\nThat’s right, we cannot lose. Not with so much regrets left behind.",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Luxuria, Part 3: I Cannot Understand\n“Oy, you call yourselves the Third Brigade!? How long will you waste on a single Demon!?”\nWith a line like the trigger of a death flag, Deije burst onto the front lines.\nThe force of a thousand had, by the work of a single Demon Lord, been reduced to half its size. I’m unsure whether it’s amazing or not that half of them even survived. But from a strategic standpoint, this battle is already our complete loss.\nOf course, the enemy forces have only one survivor.\nThe Celeste in Deije’s hands lets out heat again, as he lifts it, and swings it towards the ground.\nA hot wave of air is let out, raising a dust cloud.\nDeije opened his large mouth, and laughed.\n“Ki ki ki, so you’ll dodge a direct attack like that.”\n“… Enemy leader.”\nZebul’s voice was huskier, and more intellectual sounding than I expected.\nShe drew an ivory-white crescent moon-shaped blade, and began to attack. It was the first direct action that Demon Lord took.\nWhile Deije’s body was well trained, with the territorial boost, the Demon Lord greatly outclassed him. His arms continue to get cut up as he tries releasing power. The body of his sword lets off intense heat at the Lord, but her expression remains as cold as ever.\nDeije used one of his remaining arms to swing a sword at her, but the tentacles extending from her back shot it down.\nEven with six arms, he only has a single body. Compared to this Demon Lord with a seemingly endless amounts of appendages, his plight was close to mere child’s play.\n“Good skills.”\n“Ki ki ki, ‘tis an honor to be praised by you!!”\nHis Demon Blade erupts in flames, and the fires lick Zebul’s face.\nA red flash shoots at her white sword. Fire spreads down her own irregularly sparkling blade, but while it’s painful to admit, the Demon Lord calmly took the attack. It’s as if she had read all of our movements.\nBut we had also anticipated that. It’s not like we were certain the first strike would decide it.\nDeige had attacked head on.\nIn the gap he made, I lowered my body, and cut at Zebul as well.\nThere was no order to the tentacle’s movements, but they weren’t faster than my perception. I used the dagger in my left hand to clear them away, and the ice sword in my left to finish.\nFor an instant, her body greatly contorted.\nThe sword swung through empty air, and her eyes turned to me.\nHer gaze was hot. They resembled those of the Demon Lord of Lust who embraced her passions, and Deije, who hald his Demon Blade out front.\nBut these eyes were more sinful. I could only feel repulsed.\nAs Zebul governs Gluttony, the emotion she’s feeling is naturally…\n“Two of them… a little small, but they look quite tasty.”\n… Her Appetite.\nShe holds a strong desire to eat us, of the same race. Fear runs up my body, and my arm goes stiff.\nThere are plenty of demons that govern Gluttony out there, but within them, there are few who readily practice cannibalism.\nThe Devourer, Zebul Glaucus.\nThe land itself, other demons, and even Demon Lords are on her plate. One whose hunger was great enough to lead her to becoming a Demon Lord.\nA tentacle goes through my back and left breast… it pierces my Soul Core. My magic, the organization of my body being stripped away.\n“Fumu… a light taste… an illusion…this taste, so you’re a Lust-kun…”\nThe last of my doubles finally vanishes. Phantom Aliquot Dance comes to an end.\nWith this, I’ve been reduced to but a single person.\nBut I’ve done enough.\n“Ki ki ki, not bad, girly!”\nIn the moment I occupied her attention, Deije launched his attack.\nHe swung down Celeste at her unoccupied back… in front of the Demon Blade said to destroy even angels, Zebul merely turned her head, and opened her mouth wide.\nNicely lined up fangs, garnished the mouth that spread all across her face. By what order I do not know, but a completely calm response came from the back of her throat.\n“A Demon Blade… never eaten one before. It may be a delicacy.”\n“What!?”\nThe sword swung down by his strong arms were stopped by her mouth. The red steel is pierced by her fangs.\nFlames try to mow down her teeth, but since most of its power had already been devoured, Zebul doesn’t show any anguish on her face. Her teeth make a grinding sound as she begins to chew up the sword.\nDeije tries to pull it back, but there are no signs of it escaping her mouth.\nHowever, the fact that she was eating the sword meant her main body could no longer move.\nDeije lowered another sword with his upper left hand.\nZebul blocked it with her own sword, and locked it down.\nChance!\nI lower my body, and sprint towards her before stabbing my sword at her now-defenseless back.\nBut then, I heard a voice from an unexpected plase/\n“Your main body… that magic looks quite delicious.”\nThe back tears open, and a viscous black liquid stains the overcoat.\nIt was a large mouth. Each and every one of her lined up fangs was about the length of my dagger.\nI frantically withdrew my blade, but the long tongue that shot out followed me.\nWith impossible anatomy, it wound itself around the sword. The cold atmosphere around it freezes the tongue, but without paying any mind, she continues pulling it with amazing force.\n“Fufufu, the texture isn’t bad…”\nHer voice is in high spirits.\nShe shows no sway in her emotions even when up against demons swinging swords at her.\nHer desire is so incomprehensibly deep that I’m not sure it can even be summed up as appetite.\n“Ku, monster!”\nDeije brings out another sword, and swings it with his left-center arm, and Zebul caught it with her unoccupied hand.\nNo, that’s no hand. In the palm of it… another mouth sprung up.\nThose fangs easily bit through the sword’s body. Even though it was supposed to be a Demon Blade, a single bite caused countless fragments of metal to scatter.\nThe tongue from her hand mouth circled to make sure no fragment was lost, before wrapping around the broken blade.\nWith that timing, without even paying heed to Deije’s hand.\n“… You have something nice here. It’s Tasty. The consistence, and the taste… Not bad at all.”\nThe handle he let go of disappeared into the mouth.\nTo savor the taste, the hand mouth leisurely started chewing.\nHer eyes are colored with supreme bliss.\n“This one… my collection…”\n“Fufufu, so you’re a Greed-kun. I feel my stomach will be satisfied for the first time in a while.”\nThe power of the tongue I was fighting with finally plucked my sword off of me.\nI feel bad for Deije, but I back stepped to create distance.\nThe mouth crunches the sword to pieces. The grinding sound released was as if the sword itself was crying out.\nNoticing that, Deije released an exasperated scream.\n“O-oy, girly! Don’t just let her eat it! That’s mine, you know!”\n“T-there was no helping it!”\nZebul’s tongue continues to float in the air as it searches for new prey.\nRather than me, it goes for the closer Deije.\nBefore I could call out to warn him, the tongue was knocked down by a large sword.\n“… What are you?”\n“…”\nA giant skeleton… Leigie-sama’s Slaughter Doll swung its arms that were now the width of iron poles.\nA sword much larger than Zebul dug into the ground.\nThe earth rends below it, but the skeletons hands don’t stop. Those were movements that were definitely impossible for a normal Demon. The sword drew a strange line in the air as it cut forward.\nThe tongue and Tentacles tried to entwine it, but the sheer momentum of the hunk of iron brushed them off as it came at her face.\nThe skeleton didn’t exude a prescence, and its attacks didn’t give off a hint of life.\n“Good job!”\nDeije reached his hands into the air, and pulled out more swords from his special space.\nThe Skeleton’s physical strength is terrifying. Its arms probably exceed the trained mercenary Deije’s in might.\nZebul’s expression is colored by panic, and she releases Celeste as she takes some distance.\nCeleste is covered in something like mucus, and fine cracks extend along its surface.\n“… What could that be… it’s not a Demon, it has no presence.”\n“Ki ki ki, it’s just a candlestick holder, you know! Boss’s just put a little spell on it!”\nThe skeleton answers Deije’s will, and pushes the sole of its foot into the ground.\nIts explosive power rockets it forward, and Zebul blocked it with a perfect stance.\nThe bastard sword and the Demon Lord’s blade locked.\nThe swings from a body twice the size of Zebul’s were as swift as a storm, and with chaotic motions, it continued to try and mow her down.\nBut Zebul’s blade accurately repels it, and her eyes show she’s trying to aim for its neck.\n“… Doesn’t look very tasty. Though I look like this, I’m quite a gourmet.”\n“…”\nLike hell, Devourer!\nShe lightly dodges the bastard sword, and slashes forward with her ivory-white sabre.\nIt took the attack with the upper part of its left arm. The joint area snapped, and the rest of the arm flew into the sky.\nBut the Doll didn’t seem to mind that at all, as it continued to swing the sword in its right. It swiped at Zebul horizontally.\nZebul dodged the attack by lowering her body to the ground.\nEven if it doesn’t have a sense of pain, it’s just a Doll. It’s lacking in power to take on a Demon Lord.\nIt was enough to create an opportunity. The amount of arms and enemies Zebul had to concentrate on increased, and she was left with more openings.\nBut that’s all. None of our attacks even work on her, and our weapons were indiscriminately eaten up.\nThe situation is still as bad as it had been. The fact that we’re all alive is close to a miracle.\nWhat’s more, up until now, Zebul hasn’t even used any direct skills.\nHer magic power is sky high, and she hasn’t used any skill with a high output.\nZebul took a deep sigh as she jumped backwards.\n“My, my, what an annoying ingredient… Well, meals tend to taste better if you have to put in the time and effort.”\nCountless tentacles erupt out of her body. Please cut us some slack already.\nTheir number and thickness is incomparable to what she displayed before.\nI’m starting to doubt whether that small body or the tentacles are this one’s real body with how buried she is in them.\nOf her body itself, only a single mouth could be seen in the center. This is getting quite grotesque, and her voice hasn’t changed in the slightest.\n“Demons of Greed… you can get a greater depth of taste if you eat their collections first.”\nHer words came abruptly.\nHer slim figure was overflowing with power. The vague Mana that had been hanging in the air suddenly became concentrated.\n“Strangely, Demons of Lust give off an extremely sweet taste. Fufufu, I’ll teach you the greatest of pleasure. It’s fine, you all are splendid ingredients, so I won’t eat you like those other Demons. I’ll eat you in the proper way.”\nThat… doesn’t actually make me happy at all.\nTo violate as you eat. To be violated as you’re eaten.\nImagining it sends shivers down my spine.\nEven as a fellow Devil, I cannot understand it in the slightest.\nThis is bad. I’m not exactly sure what’s bad, but if keep wasting time, something bad’s going to happen.\nHowever, my feet won’t move. Immense pressure binds my body.\nIt’s a Demon Lord Series skill. While its user cannot move while using it, it can bind the movements of others. It can only bind beings lesser than the caster, but it’s more than useful enough to create preparations to use a large skill.\nPerhaps Deije is the same. His face is stiff as he opens his mouth.\n“This is no joke. Just what is your goal…?”\n“Goal…? Let’s see, if I had to say… I’m hungry.”\nThe casual words she leaked out made me doubt my ears.\nBut that line had a meaning much deeper than that.\nEndless hunger… I’m glad. Glad that I wasn’t born under Gluttony. No, perhaps this one is just abnormal.\n“I’m a bit of a heavy eater… At some point, I realized I had finished eating all of my own portion. So there’s no helping it. In order to live, I have to eat, and I had an obligation to let my people eat.”\n“… What about those people?”\n“I’ve already eaten them.”\nThe people lent to him by the Great Demon King were… eaten?\nZebul speaks as if she’s giving a simple explanation.\n“Well, they were low quality goods, but they did manage to fill my stomach somewhat. Fufufu, it seems my subordinates were satisfied with them, but for me the taste was just terrible… honestly, that Greed-kun’s sword was much tastier.”\n“…”\nEven Deije didn’t expect that one. He remains silent.\nThere’s no words to return after being told his sword tasted good.\nNo, the personality that girl has… it’ll forever be beyond my comprehension. I mean, even the Second Brigade has some Gluttony Demons, but they’re just slightly big eaters, and they haven’t leapt this far over the edge.\n“Well, I would like to give you peace of mind. You all will… continue to live on within me!”\nCountless Tentacles flew at me with a speed incomparable to the attacks she used before.\nSomething is coming.\nThat vigilance was the only thing that kept my life attached. The moment the Tentacles came, I instinctively kicked with my feet, which had regained movement, and rolled to the side.\nEach and every tentacle drips with a purple fluid, which glittered as it caught the light.\nDeije also determined he was screwed, and instead of confronting it, he jumped backwards.\nOnly the one-armed doll swung its sword to meet the tentacles.\nIt cut them down as they rained on it from all directions.\nBut the sword ‘slipped’.\nThe giant blade made a loud sound as it fell.\nThe tentacle that had successfully knocked away its obstacle wrapped itself around the skeleton, and the silver body that was supposed to be strengthened by Leigie-sama’s magic quite literally began to fall to pieces.\n“Wha…”\nIts ending was so abrupt that Deije had no choice but to raise his voice.\nThe feelers grabbed the skeletal parts as-is and brought them to a hole that opened in the dark mass.\n“… As I thought, it’s just normal metal. It isn’t even a maic tool or anything… was it controlled by some skill? It isn’t very appetizing, but it’s not inedible or anything.”\n“Dammit, in order to get that, do you know just how much trouble I went through? How many Demons I killed…!?”\n“Fufufu, it looks like I did something inexcusable. Don’t worry, you’ll meet up in my stomach soon enough.”\nHe cuts down the purple tentacles coming at him with Celeste, and gives tears of grief as he barely dodges them.\nOne of the Third Brigade Members was caught by one, and easily torn to pieces. A shower of blood disperses into the air, before he was swiftly absorbed into the tentacle.\nHe was eaten… each and every one of those tentacles… they’re mouths!?\n“Even if it isn’t the leader, aren’t they all quite tasty? Nice and powerful.”\n“…”\nThe racing tentacles go out in all directions, and I was unable to perceive them.\nMy cloak was barely pierced, but the hole made in it gradually began to grow. I immediately cast it away, and exerted myself to dodge the rest.\nShe isn’t serious. If she was, we’de have died long ago.\nThe tentacles I dodge either hit the ground, or pierce some other Demon and absorb them. Each and every time that happens, Zebul raises a cry of ecstasy.\nWhy won’t she get serious?\nNo, that’s wrong… she’s…\nUnable to dodge, my belt was grazed next.\nIt began to erode my body, so I discarded it.\nAgain. She isn’t going for me when I’m wide open. She’s…\nThey extend at me from all sides. I have no time to even counterattack.\nThis time, my metal breastplate is grazed. Again.\nThe feeler’s liquid even melts the metal easily. It was probably an item imbued with magic, but that doesn’t seem to matter.\nI take off the mail, and take some distance.\nWith attacks from all directions, where each blow would be fatal, as well as the pressure exerted by the Demon Lord, my stamina is at its limit.\nHer attack range is wide, and each time she melts down a Brigade Member, Zebul’s magic is restored.\nBut above all else, this Demon Lord is definitely going easy on me.\n“What are you planning…”\n“Fufufu, do you go as far as to crunch the shell when eating?”",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Luxuria, Part 4: But I am satisfied\nLooking back, from the moment I received life as a devil, this is the complete worst battle I’ve ever gone into.\nEven if you count the time I was powerless, huddled in a corner of the slums, I’d never experienced humiliation to this degree.\nIt’s been one hour since her Tentacles turned purple.\nDeath lingers all around. The number of Third Brigade members left is easily countable. You could even call it our complete annihilation.\nThe Demon Lord’s power is tremendous, and I’ll bet there’s no real difference to her whether she’s facing a General or any ordinary Demon.\nThere weren’t many soldiers that tried to flee, but the portion that did was instantly shot down by tentacles from behind, and dissolved.\nPutting aside Deije, who still has Demon Blades on him that allow him to attack the tentacles, the only reason I’m still alive is that Zebul doesn’t seem to have intentions to kill me yet.\nBecause the Food Preparations for me are taking her time.\nShe licks her lips. Perhaps because our numbers have decreased, the number of tentacles surrounding her has decreased, and her human form has become visible again, but that doesn’t really hold any meaning.\nThey’re too fast for me to dodge.\n“Fufufu, as expected of Lust… what pretty skin you have there. You may be lacking in physique, but you look like you’ll taste splendid. What fun.”\nThe hunger that floated in her eyes made the inside of my head burn bright red.\nThe clothing on my body had all been melted, and had disappeared into her stomach.\nIn the desert land, with nothing to cover myself, and no chance to even conceal with my hands as I ran away; the sight could only be looked on as humorous.\nMy body feels heavy as lead, and from my first extensive exercise in a long time, I’m getting light headed.\nBut I cannot give up.\n“But this is strange… for a Lust Demon, the scent of Lust on you is too weak… you, Closet Pervert?”\nShe threw out those words in a joking tone. How rude.\n“Ki ki ki, Exactly my sentiment. I’d have liked to see you like that on the bed and not in a place like this!”\nHe lets out some impudent words as he tries attacking again after tens of failures.\nThe only thing he has left is Celeste. But his sword still had powers in it beyond a normal one. Its divine flames manifest a violent maelstrom of fire, and send it at Zebul.\n“Well, well, you don’t know when to give up… honestly, the flames are tasty, but they won’t settle down in my stomach. I guess I don’t really like them.”\nBut even that doesn’t work. In a motion I’ve seen countless times by now, Zebul opens her mouth.\nAs if it were being sucked in, the flames are drawn to that small hole, where they dissapear.\n“… Damn, no matter how you look at it, that’s cheating…”\n“Fufufu, don’t mind it, you guys are… much stronger than that Demon Lord I ate the day before last. That’s truly a frightening sword.”\n“Ki ki ki, so it’s just the sword!”\n“Fufufu, in ten thousand years, perhaps you may be able to reach at least the footholds of my desire, I guess.”\n“… So do you have any intentions of letting us off?”\n“I’m too hungry for that!”\nWrapped by the tentacles, yet another Demon was sucked in.\nThe ground the purple liquid touches desolve, and many holes open up.\n“Oy, Medea…”\n“… What?”\n“Just one, there’s still something we can try.”\nDeije speaks with an expression overcome by fatigue. His treasured swords were eaten, and his eyes are filled with hostility towards the Demon Lord in front of him.\n“You… give me your 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』.”\n“…Ha? What are you talking about?”\nDeije glares at the Lord with stern eyes. Is the fact she’s not launching an attack right now due to her leisure?\n“That skill… it’s one that births illusions with physical form, right?”\n“… Yeah, to put it more specifically, it creates illusions, and the real body can freely swap to any one of them if within range.”\nWhen you’re killed, it’s a skill that can make your real body the illusion. Such is the power of the skill you have to climb up quite high on the Luxuria Skill Tree to obtain, 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』. It’s a powerful skill where, until one of them is attacked, all of them can be classified as the real body. That’s why any resistance to Mental Corruption cannot see through it.\n“Close enough. Girly, listen close. Right now, we have no means of beating Zebul. Just barely, if a chance is ever to come, our hope lies on this sword.”\nHe holds up the cracked and torn Demon Blade.\nTruly, attacks from Celeste are the only ones she takes the time to defend against. No, she’s still eating them, but there’s no doubt she has to take some sort of action. Since she does that every time, if she doesn’t she should take some damage.\nBut I doubt we’ll be able to take her out in a single strike.\n“I’ll take your 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』 with my 『Skill Ruler』, and using it, I’ll fry that bastard with Celeste from all directions.”\nThose words were something I could not believe.\nI unintentionally raised my free hand to cover my breasts. Deije’s eyes were serious.\n“That can’t be… 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』 is an SS Class Skill, you know? Using that on top of invoking Celeste’s power is… impossible.”\n“Ki ki ki, so all it means is… it’s a problem of Magical Power… even so, if we don’t do something now, we’ll just get eaten. We’ll be turned into some strange fancy dish.”\nHe’s… correct.\nEven if we nedlessly waste time here, defeat is inevitable. Then it’s not bad to make a bet.\nI give a small nod.\n“Fufufu, have you finished your discussion? My hunger is just about at its limit, guys.”\n“Yeah… Ki ki ki, we’ll roast you whole.”\nI take the hand Deije offered to me.\nThe second I touched it, a skill from the Greed Tree, 『Skill Ruler』 was activated.\n『Skill Ruler』 is, as the name sounds, a Greed Skill that steals the Skills of others. It’s the most famous skill on the tree.\nThere are various complex conditions that have to be met, so you can’t fulfill them on the battlefield to take an enemy’s skills, but you can still manipulate stolen skills freely, and you can even strengthen them. A powerful Skilll.\nThis especially goes for Class Skills that can only be unlocked by fulfilling Original Sin.\nSkill Ruler can ignore the prerequisites, and unlock limitless merits. Because the harder they are to unlock, the more powerful a Demon’s skills are.\nI felt an uncomfortable sensation as if my entire body was searched over. I somehow stomached that disgusting feeling by gritting my teeth.\nBut Deije’s face soon warped, and he muttered in amazement.\n“This can’t be… the Skill 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』… isn’t there… what the hell!?”\n“Eh!?”\nHe put in more power, and gripped my hand with force that made me question whether or not it would break.\nMy existence was probed left and right.\n“Gone… dammit… this can’t be. I should have fulfilled the conditions already!! Even if it’s an SS Class Skill, it can’t be that I can’t find it… impossible!!”\n“… Could it be that you’re not proficient enough to use it or something?”\nMy words were quickly denied.\nWith eyes as if he was looking down at a monster.\n“Nonononono, Skill Ruler isn’t… that sort of skill. Girly, are you really capable of using that skill?\n“… Didn’t you just see me using it back then?””\n“… Still… dammit, there’s no time. No helping it, I’ll lend you Celeste. You do it!”\nImpossible. That’s definitely impossible.\nThere’s a clear difference in swordsmanship level between me and Deije. It’s not just a manner of skill; muscle mass, the way we carry ourselves, and even our daily habits, the way we’ve lived our lives up until now, the small differences in movement outside of our perception.\nI cannot handle Celeste. Even if it’s just letting out flames, a Demon Blade of this level depends greatly on the wielder, and in the first place, I don’t have the magic left in me to use 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』.\n“No good… I don’t have enough Magical Energy in me to use the 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』 skill.”\n“Ku, then I guess it’s finally time… for us to be praying for a miracle.”\nHis sharp eyes turned to the aloof Demon Lord.\nMiracle?\nThat word made a light flash in my mind.\n… No, not like that, but just one… there’s just one way this’ll work.\nIt isn’t something grand enough to usher in our victory, but there was still one way I could use to recover magic.\nStill, if I did use it, my true nature would leak out. No, I’ve already used it once before.\nBeing found out is only a matter of time…\nI looked at Deije’s face. It’s not one I like at all.\nHe’s a man who’s built up more distinguished service than me.\nBut we’re not at a level where I can care about like or hate.\nI prepared myself, and opened my mouth.\n“Deije… um, I’m…”\n“… What? … What sort of miracle is this?”\nHis expression turned to one in a trance. It was the same expression as when he had scortched the desert, only to find Zebul still alive and well.\nA face that came when something outside the realm of common sense had happened.\nHe overlooks me with eyes as if he doubted whether or not he was dreaming.\n“Girly, can you feel that?”\nEh? …Ah! …Eh!?“\nA few seconds late, I noticed as well.\nThe meaning of his words.\nThe wind was blown away. The unstagnating black wind that seemed to carry everything away.\nI looked at the palm of my own hand, dumbfound. A slight bit of power returns to my exhausted body, and some magic returns to my empty tank.\nThe sticky feeling Zebul gave off was washed away.\n“Leigie-sama’s 『Abyss Zone』 was… revived!?”\n“… Why… at this point, why is Boss’s Zone…”\nRight, after all this time.\n『Abyss Zone』 wasn’t a skill that could be readily manipulated. Sure, if a Demon Lord had considerable power, the scope and output would rise, but that’s based on their base abilities, and it isn’t something they can consciously control.\nZebul noticed as well. She looks bewildered.\nIt seems her power isn’t impacted in itself, but she’s probably questioning how the territory she was able to construct without problem was suddenly broken without warning.\n“… Oy, oy, what did you guys do? Is this part of your plan?”\nAs if.\n『Abyss Zone』 is only reserved for Demon Lords. Neither me nor Deije are going awaken to it all of a sudden.\nThat in itself would take more than a miracle.\nBut the real miracle was yet to come.\nDeije suddenly opened his eyes wide.\nHis lip trembles, and his arms lose power as Celeste falls to the ground.\nAn obvious gap in defense. If that Lord over there were to attack now, we would have been bitten to death.\n“How… why, at this time… no, in the first place… that’s impossible.”\nBut I have no time to pay him any mind.\nBecause I had noticed what was in the direction he was looking.\nElegant black hair, well cared for (by the maids). Unhealthy pale skin without a single blemish. The jet-black overcoat he wore, befitting of one who reigned over the night, was said to be something handed down by the Great Demon King, but no one knows the truth of the matter.\nOf course without a blade, or a weapon of any kind. Not even a crown to honor his title. He wasn’t wearing a single ornament.\nFrom inside his black clothing, that looked to be woven with high class silk, a sloven plain shirt was visible. Since he wasn’t wearing a belt, he wasn’t going to be doing any extreme movement, but even now, his pants looked like they were about to slip off.\nIn all sense of the word, that visage wasn’t one that should be appearing on the battlefield. No, there’s no way it could have appeared.\nEven a random spear falling from the sky and accidentally killing the Demon Lord would be more believable.\n“Medea… is that your illusion?”\n“… Of course not.”\nI don’t have the time, and there would be no meaning.\nMaking an illusion of my own master? He’s too awe-inspiring for me to be able to do such a thing.\n“… I see, so it’s Zebul’s illusion… Ah, that was surprising. I mean, there’s no way Boss would appear in a place like this.”\n“… So that’s it… if it’s that, then I can believe it.”\nMy frozen thoughts were thawed by Deije bringing up a situation that was actually plausible.\nI see… just how vile is this Demon Lord? Even if we were on the brink of death, to show us an image of Leigie-sama… is this a part of her cooking?\nUsing the carrot and stick raises the flavor?\nRegardless, don’t scare me like that. I thought my heart was going to stop even before she killed me.\nMy heart is still going off like an alarm due to the impact.\nEven so, that’s really well made.\nIt’s been quite a while since I last looked upon Leigie-sama’s form. And seeing him walking around outside, just how many years has it been? Even if I look through all of my memory, the first time I met him was the first and last I ever saw him out here, and it probably won’t happen any time soon.\nThe reason his hair is so glossy despite its messiness is because the maids are hard-put keeping it in order while trying not to wake him, and his pale skin is likely a result of him not going out three hundred and sixty five days a year. His nature and each and every detail was completely reproduced.\nEven his expression was the sleepy one he made when in his room, and his swaying stance was one where I wanted to rush to him this instant to support his body.\n“That’s quite something… it really is identical. If the Boss ever actually stood up, he’d probably look like that.”\n“… Right …Ah!!”\nAt that moment, I noticed something important.\nI’m… not wearing anything right now!\nI hurriedly sit down to hide myself. Even if it may be an illusion, standing before my lord with not a cloth on my back is something that should never come to be. Even if Leigie-same isn’t interested in me in the slightest.\nThe inside of my head is burning red, as if it had been painted with embarrassment itself, and noticing there were things I couldn’t hide even in this position, I turned to Deije.\n“Deije… mantle.”\n“… Sure.”\nHe casts off his tattered mantle, and I somehow use it to cover my body. Like this, I won’t be able to move well, but this isn’t the time to be worried about that.\nDeije keeps his eyes locked, on the illusion’s actions.\n“… Oy, oy, that boss has already started sleeping. In front of Zebul.”\n“They really are identical.”\nStill with a bewildered expression, Zebul raised her voice to the illusion of Leigie-sama that had suddenly appeared.\n“… You. Who are you?”\n“… I see.”\nThe illusion, with an expression indicating he wasn’t listening at all, let out some words completely irrelevant to the flow of the conversation.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Ira, Part 1: Just Remembering it Pisses Me Off\nIn novels, I’ve read that there’s nothing more troublesome than an incompetent yet hard worker, but if you’ll let me state my personal opinion, in this world, there is nothing more aggravating than a ridiculously competent slacker.\nThe Demon Lord I’ve been dispatched to keep an eye on – The King of Sloth, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls- is perhaps the best fitting for that phrase in the world. One of these guys is more than enough.\nOf the ones who ally to the Great Demon King『Kanon Iralaude』, a total of 19 have reached Demon Lord Class, but of Demon Lords selected by the Original Sin of Sloth, there is only one.\nCompared to a normal Demon’s skills, a Demon Lord’s are exceedingly powerful, and while it changes based on the Skill Tree, all of them are extremely useful. Therefore, the Demon Lord who advanced his Sloth Skills to the limit was, quite annoyingly, classified as a precious existence, and that formed a sort of buffer zone where no one could really say anything against his behavior.\nI must follow my orders, and produce results. But he doesn’t seem to want cause any insurrections, and all he does is just lie around. How annoying.\nThe current Great Demon King, Kanon-sama is a Demon Lord that is connoted with Ira. The Ira attribute specializes in offensive power, and its single targeting power far surpasses the Gula series, which is also said to boast high offense. However, the Acedia Series, annoyingly enough, is said to be the only Skill Tree out of all of them that excels in pure stamina. All demons have some Defensive skill or another, but the Sloth Tree far surpasses common sense in that regard.\nPointless VIT that seems to have been thrown in for no real reason, on top of a presumptuously enormous amount of HP. What’s more, they have specialized resistances to attacks of every attribute, and status abnormalities. With their explosive VIT, they rarely ever feel pain.\nOn the other hand, they’re lacking in Dexterity, and Offensive power, but I doubt such a thing is necessary.\nWithout any meaning, like stones on the ground, like shellfish in the sea, those guys just exist there without doing anything.\nWhy must we waste our own power to try and chip at those existences that resemble inorganic matter? The Great Demon Kings of old probably thought along those lines.\nFrom my point of view, taking in a King of Sloth as a subordinate was one of the greatest mistakes ever committed by the first Great Demon Lord.\nThey are without a doubt detrimental existences. That’s why my stress against that indestructible wimp just continues to build up without end. I’ve collected an indescribable amount of Wrath, and while it’s been almost a thousand years since my birth, I’ve never felt this much anger against a specific something ever before.\nThose were the contents of the regular report I submitted to Kanon with the resolve that I was going to get killed. She burst into laughter. It was the first time I ever saw the Great Demon King of Wrath laugh to this extent.\nThe Great Demon King’s hand-picked corps that acts as her eyes and ears, the『Order of Black』.\nThe Demons that make it up have been filtered through by various processes, making it a prestigious and elite brigade. It’s not an exaggeration to say they’re the ones leading the Great Demon King’s Army, and that they’re the king’s personal royal guard.\nIn reality, about one fifth of the world’s Demon Kings were once part of the Order, and when you think about how the current Great Demon King Kanon originated from it as well, it’s easy to understand just how refined of a history this Order has.\nThe members that make it up are sent out in different squadrons to look over the actions of the Demon Lords allied to the Great Demon King- by the desire they held, was it likely for them to quietly obey another or not. We observe their conduct in great detail, at times delivering decrees from the King, at times, offering warnings, at times fighting alongside them, and at times searching for signs of rebellion before they can carry anything out.\nBut as we are dispatches, it’s an exceedingly dangerous mission where we have to serve another Demon Lord, and by its nature, it’s a crucial one where negligence isn’t permitted.\nEven so, after receiving top-class reports for my military service, I, Lize Bloodcross, was unable to understand why I was sent alone to do the mission that usually required teams of three, and even though I governed Wrath, just as Kanon did, I couldn’t understand the meaning behind me being sent to watch over Sloth, the complete opposite nature. It was unbearable.\nOriginally, inspections were to be carried out by Demons of the same attribute, or at least by ones of similar nature. While it may be the decision of the Great Demon King, I am completely unable to comprehend his divine will. I’m at my wits end. Thus, I cannot avoid issuing a protest. Even if that is to end in my death.\nOn a giant throne of obsidian, Great Demon King Kanon Iralaude had laughed so much that tears were coming out of her eyes, as she propped herself up with her staff.\nKanon-sama is a female Demon. Her height was close to a man’s, and the personification of her Wrath, her crimson hair the color of the flames of hell boiled and let off fumes like lava. The tips of it tickled the armrests of the throne\nEven with a few meters between us, the exalted atmosphere I sensed was proof of the unfathomable power she commanded as the Great Demon King.\nBut her authority is quite wasted. In various ways. And as I may add, todays Demon King-sama is in a rare good mood.\nShe clears her throat, and stares at me with her red hot eyes.\n“And, Lize Bloodcross. If that be the case, then what exactly is it that you want?”\n“Yes, it is my suggestion that we just kill Leigie-sama already, divide up his territory, and assign it to the other Demon Lords loyal to you.”\nI stated what was on my mind directly to the Great Demon King.\nPerhaps she had expected my objection. She immediately threw out a reply.\nMy objection was in opposition to the Great Demon King’s will, so it wouldn’t be strange for my head to fly off at any moment, but there wasn’t even a fragment of anger in her eyes.\n“I see… then who will kill him? As the sole Demon Lord that governs Sloth, he merely wastes his eternity on naught. How shall we kill a Demon Lord like that?”\n“That is…”\nThat in itself was the reason I spent several months bearing my anger and serving him.\nI do possess General level power, and my attribute is the one most suited for offense, but while he was taking such attacks, of all things… that Demon Lord started sleeping.\nAs if he was saying that there was no need to pay any mind to attacks of my measly level.\nJust remembering it pisses me off.\nHot blood circulated through my body with my Soul Core as the center, and my vision was dyed red. I took deep breathes to try and calm myself, but it didn’t have any effect.\n“Ku ku ku, by the look of it, you’ve already tried it yourself…”\n“… Yes, I understand that I have overstepped my authority, but I was unable to hold back my Wrath…”\nKanon-sama received those words with eyes filled with pleasure.\n“I’ll permit it. Ku ku ku, Lize… you resemble… the me of the past.”\n“!? Yes… ‘tis an honor.”\nJust what does she mean?\nI cannot understand Kanon-sama’s thoughts. I cannot comprehend. It’s not like I’m angry. My thought come together again, and I instantly kneel before her.\nWith an expression completely unfitting of her moniker, Kanon of Ruin, she looked at me with soothing eyes.\n“Anyways, Lize. That man won’t die… of course, if you find a way to kill him, I mind not if you carry it out, but… Lize, I’m counting on you.”\n“… Yes. I will put in my utmost effort in order to answer your expectations, my liege.”\nOn her sudden words, I hurriedly corrected my posture, and from her sudden expectations, I hid my face.\nWill I ever be able to live up to such hopes?\nThe Demon Lord of Sloth has peerless powers, and in his speech, loyalty to the Great Demon King, and his treatment of me, a direct emissary of her… towards all of it, he has not a fragment of interest.\nAgainst that Demon who’s shut himself in his own closed world, what is it that I can do?\nIs there anything I can change in the slightest? No matter the time, I’ve always cut open my own path with my own will, but I have no confidence for myself on this trial.\nOur affinity is… just too bad.\n“Good… I understand your plea. But there is a reason you were appointed Leigie’s observer. Find it out for yourself.”\nThat was something I did not expect from the King’s mouth. The weight I feel on the back of my head. An invisible pressure is holding me down. Lifting my head isn’t permitted.\nIt may be obvious, but on her statement, me questioning further would be foolish.\n“Yes. Please excuse me, Lize Bloodcross. All is as Kanon-sama wishes it.”\n“Good. Then march onwards. You have the makings of a ruler. So learn. Study it, understand it. The meaning of being a Demon.”\n“Yes… without fail.”\nThere was no playfulness in the Great Demon King’s words.\nHer each of her direct, passing words were engraved in my Soul Core.\nBut I cannot understand what she means in the slightest.\nSomething to learn from that Lazy King…?\nFrom that Demon Lord… from the Demon Lord whose sin was so strong it caused my predecessor, a Demon of Sloth, to abandon his responsibility. As someone with the polar opposite nature, just what am I supposed to learn?\nPerhaps by the time I learn that, I will have answered to the Great Demon King’s expectations.\nI lower my head greatly, and the moment I had stepped through the door, Kanon-sama spoke.\nAnother voice unbefitting the Demon King of Ruin. A tired voice.\n“Lize, once you return to the Castle of Shadows, go tell Leigie-Niisama… at least drop by now and again.”\n“… Eh!? Niisama!?”\nI definitely did not have to hear that.\nI turned around in a panic. It seems Kanon realized what it was she had just said, as she was clicking her tongue. With a grim expression, she pointed her staff at me.\nThe sin of Wrath, said to return everything in the world to ash.\nThe glint in her eyes was like a raging fire, as if to block any objection from me.\nWith this pressure, I was able to get out but a few words before my heart gave in.\n“Kanon, just now…”\n“Onwards, Lize Bloodcross! Don’t… trouble me any further!”\n“Y-yes!”\nAs if she was driving me away, she slammed the doors.\nAngry words from the Demon Lord of Wrath were definitely nothing rare. The two guards standing in front of the Great Demon King’s room remain unmoving, but they turn eyes filled with sympathy at me. I nod to them before going forward.\nI see… Even if he’s a rare Sloth Demon Lord Specimen, so this is why Kanon, who governs Wrath leaves him be…\nWrath’s direct attack ability is second to none, but on the other hand, it’s hard to keep followers unharmed.\nI get the feeling I just caught a glimpse of some of the Great Demon King’s black history. It’s a bit dejecting.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Ira, Part 2: Go to Hell!\nToday, once again, the Demon Lord I was charged with observing was at peace.\nEven though the morning sun had risen, the bed remained stuffed with the thick lump that was Leigie, and he isn’t moving in the slightest. At this point, I’m even beginning to question whether he’s still alive.\nEver since the Great Demon King gave me some words of encouragement, I’ve been carefully watching him, but no matter how you look at it, this Demon Lord is just way too much of a Sloth.\nThere are times when a Wrath like me isn’t angry, but Leigie-sama has never slacked on his duty.\nIs that supposed to be the difference between a normal Demon and a Demon Lord? No, that’s probably wrong. According to the others of the Order of Black sent to watch Demon Lords, they’re just a bit further out than normal Demons, and it seems that they’ve never run into any others stoically continuing to pursue their own attributes as much as Leigie. Really, he should just drop dead.\nIn an irritated state, I started writing in my Demon Lord Observation Diary.\nI unintentionally opened my eyes wide. This is surprising. This is quite severe.\nThere… isn’t a single thing to report.\nHe doesn’t train his skills, and without any training, I doubt he’ll go step into a battle. He doesn’t establish communication with his retainers, and he doesn’t participate in the war councils. Everything revolves around the people working outside of his watch. I am here witnessing the perfected form of a single type of monarchy. But it’s definitely something different from the phrase『The King Reigns, but Does not Govern』.\n(TL: This is apparently a line from the political doctrine of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations)\nNo, it’s just that he isn’t thinking about anything at all.\nAre you even conscious of what your role in all this is, De~ Mon~ Lord~ Sa~ Ma~?\nHow does this army hold itself together? No, seriously.\nIt was just too pitiful that my stress is building up, and that gets converted to anger. As a result, for me who had never really had too much to anger me in life, My Wrath Skill Tree experienced sudden extreme growth. I’m not happy about it at all.\nI sat irritated in my usual chair as I glared scornfully at the bed.\nEven when I’m releasing this much bloodlust, why is it that he isn’t waking in the slightest…!?\nAnd while that was happening, the clock hit a certain time, and the source of all evil appeared cart-in-hand.\nShe opened the door without making a single sound, and quietly entered with elegant bearing. In a soft voice, she alerted him of that time.\nIt was the closest connection Leigie’s army had to their Demon Lord. It was…\n“…Leigie-sama, it’s time for your meal…”\nThe maid.\nShe wore dated office worker clothing, and was a prim and proper beautiful Demon. I don’t know her Attribute, but she doesn’t look suited for battle, so I guess she might not have one.\nIn the categorization system decided by the Human Race, the category of Demons known as Wraiths, has many born with nothing but the innate instinct to cause harm to others, but occasionally, a Demon without such desires is born of them.\nIn that case, what comes out is a Demon that doesn’t reign over any Original Sin. There are also child Demons whose spirits are too immature for them to embrace any cravings, but for them to continue to grow up in that state is rare. I’ve heard that it can happen, though.\nIf that girl actually embraced some sin, then there’s no way she would be this devoted to Leigie-sama. Because this Demon Lord is trash.\nHer name is Lorna. She doesn’t have a last. Since I was dispatched here, she’s the one I’ve had to interact with the most.\nHer wide pretty blue eyes, and the golden hair that was evenly cut at her shoulders were her most notable characteristics. She’s probably my age, if not a little younger.\nAt the same time, she’s the source of all of this. Because this girl spoils that Demon Lord in every sense of the term, Leigie-sama will never work no matter how much time passes.\nI’ve protested time and again, but there are no signs of her stopping her work. For a girl like this to be wasted on a demon that does not but covet indolence, ‘tis the end of the world. If it turned out that this girl was actually the one pulling all the strings, I don’t think I would actually be surprised.\nI honestly think this world would be a better place without her. But she doesn’t die. There’s no worry of her falling in battle. Because she doesn’t go out in the battles.\nOn Lorna’s whisper of food, the Demon Lord’s head slowly began to project out of the covers. His eyes are half-closed, and he’s still lying face-down. This is the only time of day I can regularly see that man’s deplorable face. Even though he’s unarmed, if you launch an attack, Leigie-sama doesn’t take a single point of damage. I know because I’ve tried it a few times.\nJust what sort of Skills does Sloth have?\nWithin all the Skill Trees held by the Demon Class, the one with the least information about it known is without a doubt the Sloth Skill Tree.\nDemons of Sloth don’t usually use skills by choice. If you ask why, it’s precisely because they are Sloth. And so, a majority of Sloth’s skills aren’t widely known. Of course, among them, there isn’t anyone diligent enough to painstakingly record down their skills either. It’s no real mystery why it’s a mystery. Don’t. Screw. With. Me!\nJust what thoughts are going through their heads as they continue to pursue that laziness?\nJust what are they trying to do by cultivating a set of skills that they’ll never use?\nEvery time I think about that, it feels like I’m observing some sort of foreign animal. And I feel my entire body get engulfed by a feeling of weakness. Just die already.\nThe scarce information that’s been passed around denotes that Sloth skills excel in endurance, and that they have skills that allow them to slow down others’ movements. There’s also the Slaughter Dolls Leigie-sama is so known for: a skill for giving life to dolls. But that’s about it.\nThat may be all, but I also think that’s more than enough information in a sense. I mean, it’s not like that lump over there’s going to use a skill anyways.\nWith his eyes closed, Leigie-sama opened his mouth.\nLorna accepted that action with a beaming smile, scooped up some food with a spoon, and inserted it in his mouth. It was like watching a mother bird feed its young.\nOne surprising thing was that this Demon Lord didn’t even lift a finger to eat!\nJust quit it already! Like Hell this thing is a Demon Lord! Apologize to all those Demons diligently working out there!\nEven if you’re successfully fulfilling your cravings, APOLOGIZE TO ALL THOSE DEMONS WHO COULDN’T BECOME LORDS!\nI grit my teeth, and screamed only within my heart. My mental sanity was in danger. In various ways.\nAnd Lorna, you need to stop too!\nIt’s that. The more I learn of his slovenly lifestyle, my evaluation of Leigie, as well as those of the other Demons who couldn’t become Demon Lords, even though this thing somehow accomplished it is dropping. I’m included. And that makes me pissed off all the more.\nAs I stood up by reflex, Lorna turns her eyes to me.\nAs I sigh, she gently sets the spoon on the plate, and puts her hand on her hip, as if worn out.\n“Day, by day, by day. Just what is it that you’re so dissatisfied with?”\nWith that gesture, I heard something snap somewhere in my head.\nLeigie yawned.\n“What? Me, dissatisfied? There should be a limit to making fun of me!!”\nJust because he’s a Demon Lord, he’s underestimating me…\nI lose my rationality for a moment, and my Wrath blazes up. It rushes around my body along with my blood.\nJust how much must I bear with? Why must I live like this… If Kanon-sama won’t dispose of him, then I’ll settle this in her place…\nHowever, even when I’ve reached a stage like this… he won’t pay me any mind.\nWith his eyes still closed, he sways his head back and forth. I’m getting a sudden impulse to go kick that head like a soccer ball.\nDammit… I’ve already tried that one long ago. It didn’t give him a single scratch.\nThen to give him a scratch, all that’s left is my『Ira』 Skills.\nI take deep breaths, and try to manage the violent emotions running about my head.\nIt creates too much of an opening, so I can’t use it in battle, but let’s take some sweet time, and gather up power.\nWith my rage as the fuel, I’ll obliterate my enemy. That is the basis of『Ira』 skills.\n“Looking down on me… in Kanon-sama’s place… I’ll beat you to death…”\nThe『Ira』 skill I have with the highest output.\nFire born from a Demon’s heart, my Soul Core, well up from my feet, and rise into the heavens as a pillar of flames.\nOn the Skill Tree, it’s an upper class skill ranked S. Of the skills I can use, it’s the most powerful.\n『Rage Flame』\nLorna winced as she was buffeted with the high temperature with that came as a side effect.\nThe blast sends the tableware flying, and it crashes into the wall before shattering into small pieces.\nWhile it may just be an aftereffect, it’s a heat beyond what a normal Demon can stand. The skin on Lorna’s arms instantly begins to burn, and the room is filled with the unpleasant scent of roasting meat. She scowls, steps back, and covers her skin, but this isn’t a heat that can be avoided by something of that extent.\n“… Lorna, move. It’s not my problem if you’re caught up in this.”\n“… It’s useless. With『Wrath』 of that level… you won’t be able to breach Leigie-sama’s『Sloth』.”\n… Looking down on me.\nI suppress the feeling of the flames burning myself, and raise it to a heat I’d never attained before. The barrier protecting the ceiling shatters, and the stone above melts before dripping to the floor.\nWords are taken as fuel, and the inside of my head gets redder and redder. The flame wrapped around my arms change to a shade of crimson mixed with black.\nThe cuff of Lorna’s clothes ignite, and the flame starts to spread.\nBut without even trying to put it out, she continued to pat Leigie’s head. He hadn’t even opened his eyes. Her mouth approached his ear.\nAnd she voiced some unbelievable words.\n“Leigie-sama… I have a younger sister. If I’m ever to dissapear, it’s set that she will be the one to take care you you in my place.”\n“I see.”\nLorna doesn’t seem to be giving any care to her own life.\nAnd the Lord of Sloth doesn’t have a hint of interest towards that fact. Leigie doesn’t even open his eyes… He doesn’t even look at Lorna’s face.\n“Idiotic… you plan to die here?”\n“Ku… I do not have anything to block what you’ve over there, Lize. No matter what I do, it will kill me in the end. That is all.”\nWhile withstanding the pain, her words came out in a level tone, adding more fuel to my flames of wrath.\nThe flame spreads up the fabric, and the king sized bed is engulfed in it. Lorna doesn’t try to cover herself. With her body alight, she continues to gaze at the closed-eyed Leigie.\nThe flames were my anger in itself. Their nature was different than simple physical fire. They had powers fitting for them to be called flames of hell, the ability to turn all matter to ash. In this wide world, they’re perhaps what has the greatest destructive capability. They even surpass the magic fire used by the Spirit Race.\nInformation about the target of my flames enters my head.\nLorna’s body constructed of Soul only has a slight fire resistance from the basic Demon Tree. She’s easily burned through as she becomes food for the flames.\nThe reason she’s still alive is that this is only a secondary effect with not even a fraction of the skill’s power.\nIf I released the skill, then even if I didn’t aim for her, she would easily…even easier than a scrap of paper, her soul and all else would turn to ash.\n“Ask your lord to save you.”\n“You’re making… a mistake. Lize Bloodcross.”\nHer entire body burns away bit by bit, and her head dressed in charcoal made me find it amazing she was still alive. With those burnt eye sockets, she looked at me.\nWhat was in her eyes was nothingness. Her entire body disappearing, she lets out not a single scream of pain, as if she were merely waiting to greet an inevitable demise. It was more repulsing than anything I had ever seen before.\nAnd like that, Lorna smiled.\n“… Sloth is… without thinking anything… without creating anything… without saving anything… without letting your feelings be moved… just existing as you wish it.”\n“!?”\nThe all-important Leigie was, even with the flames of hell said to destroy any and everything surrounding him, not stirring at all.\nNot a single hair on his head, or a single patch of skin was burned. Even though there’s no sign of him using any sort of skill!\nIn front of his eyes… even when the loyal Demon who’s served him faithfully up until now is burning!\nEven when everything in his world is being reduced to cinders!\nThat fact made my mind leave me.\nIt felt like my head would split, that even burning everything in this world wasn’t enough. That sort of anger penetrated my head. The heat of the flames increases even further.\nAt that moment, Leigie opened his eyes for the first time, and murmured.\nFor the first time, his eyes turn towards me. His expression seems troubled.\n“… It’s hot.”\nWhat the hell is he saying… this one…\nI can see that his face is stiff. Words I cannot understand. A way of life I cannot understand.\nWithout an iota of hesitation, I activated the skill.\n“… Go to hell! Leigie!”\n“… I see.”\nWith an unpleasant expression, Leigie sighed.\nHe turned the palm of his hand to me… in the face of the black flames, he said a single word.\n“Iyo.”\nThat was the first moment I had understood that the Demon Lord had activated a skill. Even without saying the Skill name.\nRight before it hit him, with a speed much faster than my own skill.\nWhat was supposed to protect my soul, the Mental Pollution Resistance skill was instantly breached without being able to offer any resistance in the slightest. My instincts told me.\nThe impact was great enough to shake my Soul Core. My Field of vision was in chaos, and my thoughts went all over the place.\nThe heat inside of my head was instantly cut off.\nAs if those feelings had been a lie, a hole was pierced through my heart. What should have been there was the mental hell of Wrath, but the driving force that was my anger turned off, and died out. The flames that had been raging in the surroundings, the flames that had been burning Lorna, as if any and everything had been a dream.\n“What… did you…”\nI look at my palm, from which the black flame had disappeared.\nI should… have been angry. I definitely had been embracing anger and hatred great enough to burn everything to the ground.\nMy memory still remains. Until a few seconds ago, I should have been in a rage, but… now I don’t really care.\nThe disparity between my emotions and my memory become a cold wind, sending shivers down my spine. Something must have happened to create the empty gap within my mind.\nMy knees give out on me, and I kneeled on the ground that had rapidly cooled after losing its heat.\nI don’t understand. I don’t understand anything. I don’t understand my emotions of anger. How. Why was I angry? How did I get so angry? My memory won’t provide me with those answers.\nWithout paying any mind to my worries, within the ashes, and with a troubled expression, in his tattered bedding, Leigie rolled over.\nThere is only one theory that could possibly explain this abnormal situation.\n… This is… a Skill of Sloth.\nLying on his back, Leigie’s eyes turned in my direction.\n“…”\nBut without saying anything, he closed them.\nHis impudent behavior lit another spark within me.\nSay something already…",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Ira, Part 3: Who the Hell Does He Think He’s Supposed to Be?\n“Are you not going to kill me for opposing you?”\n“… If you want to die, then go do that by yourself. Ah, but first, go tell them that they should send a Sloth next time.”\nHah.\nLeigie let out a troubled sigh.\nWith those words, I became certain that my own actions had absolutely no effect on this Demon Lord.\nHe really is a man with no hopes of salvation. Kanon’s tired words float in my mind.\nA skill to overwrite one’s cravings with Sloth.\nThat’s my conjecture as to the skill this Demon Lord used only once. I don’t even know its name.\nAt that moment, the hell within my heart was completely buried up.\nAnd if that’s truly the case, then that is… the strongest skill for a Demon. I mean, a Demon’s battle ability rises in proportion to the extent of their longings. Just as my『Wrath Flames』 scaled off my anger, to rapidly increase its output.\nIt’s not something limited to Wrath, the others are the same. Without a thirst for material possessions, Greed Skills are unusable, and without hunger, Gluttony Skills won’t have any decent firepower.\nHis skill is bullshit. Normally, a skill of this type would be blocked by the Mental Corruption Resistance on the Basic Demon Tree, but this Demon Lord somehow breached it in an instant. That means that skill can’t be blocked by standard means, and that skills that can’t be withstood by it truly do exist.\nI’m not sure if it’ll work even on a Demon Lord, but if it does, then even Demon Lords would be played with like children. And I don’t want to think about it, but perhaps the one who holds the seat of Great Demon Lord, Kanon-sama, is the same.\nNo, more than that, a large majority of Wrath Skills scale directly off of anger, so his power would be even more affective against her.\nWhen I think of the anger smoldering within me, it isn’t something that will burn for eternity, but if I think about what would happen if it were suddenly extinguished in battle, I cannot help but feel fear.\nIts effect? Its range? Its scope? Its conditions?\nChallenging this Demon Lord without knowing any of that is… too dangerous. What’s more, he only showed me a single power. When you think about how I have dozens of Wrath Skills, while there’s a difference in trees, I can’t help but assume this Demon Lord has much more than that.\nLeigie-sama is… dangerous. Not because his irritating behavior is poison to my sanity, his power itself is dangerous.\nIt’s likely that Kanon-sama knows this as well. That’s why I was dispatched. This Demon Lord won’t do anything troublesome like start a rebellion, but in the million to one chance…\nIf I cannot obliterate him with Wrath Skills… the other Skill Series which fall behind in pure offensive power won’t be able to break his defense.\nHe said it was hot. That means for a split second, my power definitely had some effect on this Demon Lord. It’s impossible for the current me, but if I continue to mature, perhaps I will gain the power to inflict damage on him.\nI need to sharpen my blade.\nWhile looking at this man, who possesses unfathomable power, I’ll refine myself. That is likely Kanon-sama’s… intent.\nAnd at the same, time, make good use of this man’s resources, to benefit the Great Demon Lord’s army. He’s scary as an enemy, but having these Sloth Skills on our side is more than reliable.\nTaking on these two challenges simultaneously is my mission, and my trial.\nOnce I’ve overcome that, there is no doubt I’d have gained powers incomparable to what I’ve used up until now.\nWe were moved to another room, and on top of a bed of the same make, Leigie turned over in his sleep.\nIn my eyes his form was now that of someone I couldn’t underestimate.\nIt seems that the bedroom I burnt up is in the middle of reconstruction. None of the Demons in Leigie’s army said a word about it. Say something already.\nAt that time, the door made a loud sound as it opened, and a single Demon came in.\nIt was a girl wearing a maid uniform. Her atmosphere was a bit similar to Lorna, but she was just a little bit younger.\nShe looked at Leigie-sama, who refused to pop his face out of the covers, took a quick glance at me, and approached the bed. With a face identical to Lorna’s, she smiled.\n“Leigie-sama! Please~ Wake~ Up~!”\nOf all things, she began recklessly shaking the cover the Demon Lord had burrowed under.\nThe smile and atmosphere are definitely similar. The girl who was probably the sister she was talking about only carried a similar air, and her actions were completely different. This is a fraud.\nThat’s no way to treat that guy, I mean, isn’t he supposed to be some sort of king?\nAt her violent treatment, I unintentionally tried to restrain her when I was supposed to be on the other side.\nWhat the hell is this.\n“!? Wai… can’t you be a little quieter!?”\n“? Ah! You muct be the Lize-san oneechan told me about! I’m called Hiero. I’m the little sister of Lorna, who used to take care of Leigie-sama!”\n“Eh, ah, yes.”\nWithout stopping her hand, the girl called Hiero turned only her head to look at me.\nShe’s not displaying the appropriate attitude to the one who burnt her sister to death. No, more so, she’s giving a smile reminiscent of a blooming flower.\nEven if she’s a Demon, she should have at least a bit of affection for her family. Just like I have a sort of loyalty to the Great Demon King.\nOf all things, she started speaking in an innocent voice.\n“Thank you very much! For killing Oneechan! Because of that, it’s finally come around to my turn! Oneechan would never stop working, so I was getting worried!”\nHer feelings were just too twisted. Her lack of visible malice made it all the more menacing.\nFrom the time I served directly under the Great Demon King, to when I was assigned here, I’ve never seen emotions like these.\n“Y-you… are those the sort of words you’re supposed to direct to your sister’s killer!?”\n“Eh? Well…”\nOn my words, Hiero put her index finger to her mouth, and began to think.\nAnd the answer came soon enough. It was an answer I wasn’t expecting at all.\n“Lize-san, you’re too soft. If you’re going to try killing her, you have to do it properly…”\n“Eh…?”\nHer skirt fluttered as she sat on the edge of the bed. From under her skirt that was much shorter than Lorna’s, I saw healthy, tanned skin.\nAs if something was tickling her, she raised a laugh befitting her age.\nHow does that modest Older Sister get a younger one like this?\n(TL: This kusu is laughter. Not sobbing.)\n“Kusu kusu kusu, she was still alive… Good grief, oneechan doesn’t know when to give up… her luck sure was great. Even if it wasn’t a direct hit, for her not to die instantly after taking the『Ira』 of a General Class Demon. Even when I thought my turn had finally come, I was going to have to contain myself even longer!”\nWhat shocking news. She was burnt black, but lived!?\nNo, that’s not it. That isn’t it. This Demon… what did she just say?\n“… Contain yourself even longer… could it be, that you…”\n“Nonono, don’t misunderstand! Oneechan’s still alive, you know? Though she’s quite burnt. I mean, killing my own sister is a bit… If I did something like that, kusu kusu kusu, I would become『Invidia』, wouldn’t I? Holding onto two sins would be a pain.”\nAn unsettling cheerful voice.\nThis one is… different. She has no beauty like Lorna. No matter how close their faces, no matter how close their forms, this child is without a doubt one who spreads ill will just by staying alive, an orthodox devil. One with the personality most fit to pursue desire, a『Pure Demon』.\nI’m not sure whether she’s looking at my expression or not, she lies down face up on top of Leigie, and stares at the decorations on the canopy.\n“Oneechan was pretty, wasn’t she? She should’ve been of the same make as me, but she was nice and slim, and tall, and her eyes were wide and clear, her skin was white, and she always did the housework, but she never got a scratch on her, and her hair was glossy without any damage. Her voice wasn’t too high or too low, it was just the right level to comfort the ear, and her breasts were twice the size of mine… a beauty no male Demon would be able to leave alone, and despite her lewdness, she didn’t let a single finger touch her body, as she served Leigie-sama in chastity… Her heart was strong, and she didn’t draw back a step against『Ira』… Kusu kusu kusu, she really was the ideal woman.”\n“Le…wd?”\n“Oh? Didn’t you know? Even like that, Oneecchan’s a『Luxuria』 demon, you know? What’s more, she’s pursued desire enough to get A Class skill, quite powerful. If you look at Demon Ranks, perhaps the rank just before General… she had about as much power as a Knight, I guess.”\nThat’s something I cannot believe.\n『Luxuria』\nOf the 7 Sins that Demons can possess, it’s known as the one most unsuited for direct combat.\nAnd among all of them, it’s said to be the weakest in resisting attacks as well.\nThey are weak. Uselessly frail. Especially against Demons with Mental Corruption resistance, a majority of their powers don’t work.\nBut if so, they why…\n“Why…”\n“I don’t know if Oneechan told you, but my household… has ALWAYS served the Demon King of Sloth, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls. Probably from around ten generations ago. Within the house, there’s a rule that the strongest Demon would be the one to serve, and in this generation, that was… Lorna oneechan. Until Yesterday, that is.”\nYesterday, I burned Lorna in the flames of Wrath. If Hiero’s words are to be trusted, she survived, but has lost her power.\nAnd so the generation shifted. To this arrogant sister.\n“I’ve always had a complex against Oneechan. Especially that figure. Oneechan had my ideal form, so… that’s why I was always weaker than her.”\n“Eh? Fi… gure?”\n“With『Luxuria』, no matter how high level of a Demon you are, with only A Class skills, you can’t… be strong at all. I should have been much stronger. But even so, I couldn’t win. I’m thankful to you, Lize-san. Thank you for burning up oneechan’s beautiful face.”\nThe tone of her voice dropped for a moment.\nAnd the Demon said…\n“Because of that, I was able to…『Overrule』 her…”\nAll the puzzle pieces were in place.\nHiero forcefully opened up the covers, and shamelessly clung onto Leigie-sama’s arm as he looked at her with empty eyes.\n“Leigie-sama, nice to meet you. I think you were listening, but I’ll be taking care of you in oneechan’s place! I’m called Hiero! I’ll be whole-heartedly devoting my time to you, so I hope we get along!”\n“… I see.”\n“The Original Sin I carry is…『Pride』. I’m Hiero of『Superbia』! Please remember it!”\nAs I thought… a Pride Demon!\n『Superbia』\nA Demon that governs arrogance and superiority complexes.\nWithin this army, it’s also the attribute of Supreme Commander Heard Lauder.\nIts tree… holds some exceedingly troublesome skills. Its affinity with Gula and Ira, that were made to inflict direct damage, is particularly bad.\nOn her first conversation with the Lord, her eyes sparkled greatly.\nBut at the same time, I felt it. This girl is in no way suitable for Leigie-sama.\nThe Demon Lord wasn’t really thinking about anything. With eyes devoid of emotion, he uttered two words.\n“… Yeah. Iyo.”\n“? What’s 『Iyo』?”\nOn those words, Leigie’s expression turned stale.\nHis face spoke for itself. That explaining was a pain. He turned his eyes to me, but I decided to ignore him.\nAt first, I wondered what it was as well. I asked. But Leigie-sama never told me. In the end, I had to find it out by asking the other Demons. It truly was a waste of time.\nLeigie-sama let out a deep sigh. As if he was saying this was all my fault.\nAnd along with that sigh, Hiero’s expression clouded.\nWith a heavy voice, Leigie-sama spoke. From my point of view, it was the same as normal, but for Hiero who was having her first conversation with him, it was probably different. His voice is always full of something that could be called despair.\n“… What happened to the last one?”\n“… Eh? Y-you mean oneechan?”\n“… Yeah.”\nYeah, he definitely doesn’t know it.\nLeigie-sama has no interest in the maid’s name and origins. He probably found it a pain, so he answered as such.\nHiero’s pride is stimulated, and she answers in a shaking voice.\n“Oneechan was… burnt black by that Lize-san over there. That’s why I’m…”\nDemon Lord, you were there, weren’t you! And isn’t this your fault!?\nEven though he was completely ignoring it, he can’t even remember what happened just yesterday.\nAre you sure there isn’t any fungus growing inside of that head?\n“I see… bring her here.”\n“… he? Leigie-sama, j-just now, what are…”\nLeigie-sama frowned.\nHe’s probably thinking, ‘God, this is a pain,’ but from someone who doesn’t know him, he definitely looks displeased.\nBy the way, if Kanon-sama makes a face like that, it’s a sign that the entire area will soon be reduced to cinders. There’s no escape.\nThis Demon Lord is a wimp, so nothing like that ever happens here. I’ll even bet my life on it. Ah, dammit. This is pissing me off.\nLeigie-sama repeated himself.\n“… Bring her.”\n“… Y-yes… ahaha, but she’s just charcoal, right? … y-yes, I understand. I’ll carry Oneechan here.”\nHiero’s eyes are teary, but she immediately leaves the room, making loud footsteps.\nAs if to shout out, ‘I’m in a bad mood.’\nBut Leigie-sama probably doesn’t notice that at all.\nThe Demon Lord under the covers, who usually never moved had taken such a large action, so I tried asking.\n“What do you plan on doing?”\n“… That one’s no good.”\n“… Hiero, you mean?”\n“Yeah…”\nWithout stating a specific reason, he just painstakingly said that one word.\n… It seems that Lorna spoiling the heck out of him up until now has had a slight effect. It seems you guys really are the best under the heavens at deceiving people, Luxuria.\nIt’s because she carried out each and every conceivable services for him… though that was also the reason I snapped.\nWith loud footsteps, Hiero slams open the door.\nShe violently throws something onto Leigie-sama’s bed.\n“… It’s oneechan.”\nWhat Hiero brought was a Soul Core that could fit into the palm of your hand.\nAbout half of it had burned away, and been destroyed. Looking at it, I myself cannot call that living. It’s because I don’t have the necessary tools to determine whether or not there’s any life in that.\nAs long as a Demon’s Soul Core is safe, they can take up long years to regenerate themselves. But with this much damage, it’ll probably decay before any regeneration can happen.\nI’m actually surprised Hiero was able to find this small fragment inside the ashes. Could it be she actually had soft feelings towards her sister?\nLeigie-sama can’t seem to contain his unhappiness as he takes the core in his hands.\nHe gave a sigh of resignation, and gave a word in Hiero’s direction… once more, that word.\n“… Iyo.”\n“… Eh? U-um… I deeply apologize. I am… s-still inexperienced, but I will do my best… would you be as kind as to tell me the meaning of『Iyo』?”\nHaving been pressed with an impossible trial, as if her smile before had been a lie, Hiero’s tears fell all over the place.\nGetting a pride to say they’re inexperienced, what a frightening man. He probably isn’t thinking about anything, though. But to one who governs Pride, that is a disgrace akin to death.\nThey are just masses of pride, and they think they’re the centers of the world, so hurting their pride enough to get them to put themselves below others makes them absurdly weak.\n“… Hah…”\n“!? D-demon Lord…”\nWho the hell does he think he’s supposed to be?\nWith a sigh, Leigie-sama closed his eyes.\nIn the first place, ‘I’ll leave it to you’, and ‘I’m satisfied with your work’ aren’t specific instructions in the slightest, aren’t they?\nRight now, the Demon Lord doesn’t really wish for anything. Can’t he just tell her that?\nHiero nervously looks around the room. Her eyes met mine, but I hated her, so I ignored her.\nTrying to regain her standing, she musters up her courage to talk again. I doubt any evaluation of her has risen or fallen in the first place. In the first place, there’s no meaning in getting evaluated by that Leigie-sama.\nI’m starting to think this, but don’t Pride and Sloth have the worst compatibility?\nOne strives to be superior and worshipped by others, the other really doesn’t care. You can’t fulfill a superiority complex with the Lazy King.\nEven if there were rules, I think Lorna’s made a complete mistake when choosing her successor. Is this supposed to be some form of harassment?\n“U-um… I specialize in housework! Cooking, and cleaning, and laundry… I’m confident in it. If you wish for it… e-even sexual favors…”\n“I see.”\nHer face is red, and she’s definitely pushing herself, but Leigie simply gives his usual answer.\nNo, he’s not being cold. That’s just how he is!\nBut Hiero doesn’t know that. You can’t try and communicate with this Demon Lord.\nUnless you know what he is from the start… that’s why I’m so troubled.\nAnd having been pushed into a corner, Hiero continued to speak.\n“Um… if it pleases you, please give me an order.”\nHaving heard that, for the first time, Leigie-sama voiced his will.\n“……………… Damn, this is a pain.”\n“… Eh!?”\nSeriously, who is he supposed to be?\nLeigie-sama let out the deepest sigh he’d ever made.\nHiero looked at the Demon Lord with a blank expression. She hasn’t said anything wrong. She hasn’t made any reckless remarks, and she hasn’t asserted her selfishness.\nHaving seen this scene, a hundred out of a hundred would side with her on the matter. Even I would.\nDon’t expect the maid that was just hired today to be able to figure everything out.\nThe Demon Lord casually lifted the broken Soul Core up to the light.\nI wonder what’s going through his mind.\nAnd the moment came.\nThe presence that sprung forth all of a sudden made me choke for air.\nHaving sensed that, the face Hiero had finally put in order was suddenly overcome with fear, and after some convulsions, she took a large step back.\nPride forgot her pride, and wrath forgot her wrath. It was an amount of magic great enough to make my『Rage Flame』 seem like child’s play, enough magic to warp the world.\nIt was. Without a doubt, a wave of the strongest power I’d ever seen in my life.\nNothing seemed to matter anymore, and power seemed to seep out of my body due to the concentration of Acedia.\nWith a face on the brink of death, the Demon Lord chanted. It was definitely some sort of Spell.\n“『Ir Ir Rul Arcadia. Everything, degradation and depravity. Hah… Law of money, the black cornerstone that holds together all creation, just gather for a bit in my name. 『Sloth Minugrosz』』 Ah, I misspelled it…”\n“Wai…”\nThe overflowing magic abides the Demon Lord’s chant, and takes form.\nIn general, Skills can be activated by incantation, or skill name. Without the incantation, the difficulty increases, and the output drops.\nThis Demon Lord’s never chanted, or even said the skill name before, so with an aria that long, of the skills I’ve seen before… It’ll most definitely be the highest ranking one.\nI haven’t the slightest idea what’s going to happen, but an unpleasant feeling comes over my body. An alarm clock goes off in my head.\nThe skill activation that’s usually impossible to sense is crystal clear.\nAt the feeling of the world’s order being warped, Hiero let out a scream.\nBut a spelling error… it was definitely that sigh he threw into it, wasn’t it!?\nHe can’t even recite a Skill properly, this Demon Lord!\nThe thoughts racing around my head were just my attempt to escape reality.\nEven if the chant was a failure, the skill definitely activated.\nAll apart. Though nothing had changed, I felt something breaking.\nThe Soul Core the Demon King was holding began to change shape at the half that had been burned.\nWith the crystal at the center, a mysterious black haze started to gather, and take form. Its color changes.\nHiero mutters in a daze.\n“O nee… chan?”\n“… Haa.”\nHis sigh was filled with annoyance while, as if a clip was being played in reverse, the charcoal regains its color, and a completely scorched face is dyed white and regains its gloss. In the wide open eyesockets, large orbs take shape.\nIn just a few seconds, a completely unharmed Lorna was created. Of course, her body, but even the clothes she had been wearing are reborn without a scratch.\nIn a situation that had long transcended expectations, Hiero’s eyes are dilated as she raises a scream. Her back hits the bedside table, and her hips are shaking, but she retreats further.\nAnd Lorna slowly opens her eyes.\n… She’s alive.\nThe hell… just what is that skill?\nRegeneration? Like hell… as if regeneration can restore clothing. In the first place, Lorna should have been completely terminated. From a half-destroyed Soul Core, there’s no way she’d be brought back this perfectly!\n“Onee… chan?”\n“Hie… ro?”\nHiero unsteadily walks towards Lorna, as if she had seen a ghost.\nLorna’s eyes bink multiple times as she looks at her sister. She doesn’t seem to know what’s going on either.\nWell, that can’t be helped. Even I, who’s seen this start to finish, can’t understand what just happened.\nAt that moment, the color of Hiero’s face changed. From ghastly pale, to red panic.\nShe tilts her head as she looks over Lorna’s body.\nI also noticed it. The regeneration… wasn’t over yet. No, the wounds were already gone, but still, her time was turning back.\nThe skill hadn’t ended yet!\nThe feeling that something was broken persisted, and even though she had returned to normal, there’s no sign of it ending.\nLorna’s height ever-so-slightly reduced, and her breasts withered in a similar manner. The look on her face gets slightly more childish.\nHer clothing changes from a pure-white maid uniform to a smaller one with black as the base. Her long skirt changes to the shorter one Hiero was wearing.\nBy misspell, could he possibly…\nMy heart beats faster, as I see her body gradually shrink, the fifteen centimeter height difference between her and Hiero became ten, then five. Compared to that, the bulge in her breasts doesn’t change all that much, but her facial features slowly regress from mature to innocent.\nFor a different reason, Hiero blinked her eyes as she turned to Leigie-sama.\n“…Leigie-sama, this is…”\n“… Turned her too far back.”\nWith a face that showed he wasn’t repenting at all, Leigie-sama rubbed his head into the pillow. Even though it was his mistake, he still has absolutely no motivation.\nTurned her… too far back?\nLorna’s transformation ends.\nBy that time, there was pretty much no gap between her and Hiero. Of course, there’s personality, and Lorna’s face looks just a little more adult-like, but the appearance differences they had before, if you exclude the fact that Lorna’s a very slight bit taller, and her breasts much larger, as if they were twins, they looked identical. The difference left was that of Lust and Pride… the difference caused by attribute.\nLorna’s perplexed eyes looked over her shorter arms and legs.\nPerhaps Hiero didn’t know how to respond, but she looked around as if to throw responsibility off of herself. I want someone to help me.\nOnly Leigie-sama is without confusion, without ill will. He looks at the much-compacted, reconstructed Lorna.\n“Do you have… memories? Today’s date?”\nOn Leigie-sama’s question, Lorna casts away her hesitation, and corrects her posture. As if concerned about her now-shorter skirt, she fidgets as she gives a clear reply.\n“Eh? Ah… yes. Today is Divine Year 271C8A, Kanon Year 310 November 11th, Leigie-sama.”\nAs his question was answered with a full-on smile, Leigie-sama turned to me.\nCould it be that even though he asked, he doesn’t even know the date himself?\nHaving regained composure, Hiero answers instead.\n“Oneechan, it’s the 12th.”\n“Heh? No, today should be the 11th… Hmm? Hiero, did you get taller?”\nNo, you shrunk.\nLeigie-sama addressed Lorna, who was tilting her head, and still without a grasp on the situation, with a care-free tone.\n“I see. Got it. Iyo.”\n“??? Y-yes! Understood, my liege…”\nHer head remains tilted as she answers. She looks at her wristwatch, and compares it to the one on the wall. In a panic, she lowers her head deeply to Leigie-sama.\n“Leigie-sama, I deeply apologize. A little… your meal time will be delayed by about an hour.”\n“Iyo.”\n“Thank you. I am deeply grateful for your kindness.”\nShe instantly returned to her daily cycle, and made quiet steps as she exited the room. Behind her, she pulled the hand of her sister, who still didn’t have a grasp on anything.\nAs I looked upon it, I was so taken aback that I couldn’t say anything.\nWhat’s with that pointless loyalty? More than her own body, that had disintegrated, she worries for the mealtime of the Demon Lord that can go centuries without food or drink?\nI look towards Leigie, the culprit in all of this, but there’s no sign of him feeling satisfaction, or a sense of achievement, or even remorse.\nThis Demon Lord, who is he, really…\nWith all that’s happened, I’ve lost confidence in my own『Wrath』 that I’m supposed to govern.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Ira, Part 4: Quit. Screwing. With. Me!\nGive me a break already.\nEvery time he shows one of his Sloth skills, my stress build up.\nWhat I understand is that this Demon Lord has advanced enough to be appropriate for Rank Three. That’s about it.\nAnd while I originally would be happy upon learning such a fact, every time I’m reminded of it, I lose confidence in myself as a Demon.\nJust how much do I have to satisfy my Sin to get some bullshit skill like the ability to rewind time? To be more specific, it seems it separates stored up experience, and rewinds the body, but that doesn’t really matter.\nCompared to Wrath, which is all direct attacks, Sloth is too free, and the effects are indeterminate, or how should I put it… they’re really annoying.\nHe rarely uses them, so the damage when he does is horrendous. He’s definitely trying to piss me off. It’s a conspiracy.\nThis workplace is dangerous… my stomach hurts.\nI can now understand why my Sloth predecessor abandoned all responsibility. When a Sloth Demon gave up on this, there’s no way a Wrath like me can endure it.\nNo matter how much I try venting my anger on him, he remains peaceful, so my stress isn’t going anywhere at all.\nKanon-sama’s expectations, and the environment itself have me stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nBut if I just let him be, then there’s no workplace more peaceful than this one.\nI mean, even if I don’t observe him, in the end, he definitely won’t do something as troublesome as a revolt, and even if we don’t lend him power, it’ll work out one way or another.\nIs what I thought, but just look at this!\nI hold my aching stomach as I turn to Leigie-sama who was slouching deeply into a chair.\n“What? What did you just say?”\n“… Nothing.”\nHe’s quite clearly making a face that says repeating would be a pain, as he averts his eyes. For me to almost completely understand this mostly expressionless King, is that some sort of growth on my part? I don’t need this sort of growth…\nIt’s no good… there’s nothing we can do about this one.\nI take deep breathes to control my anger. My control has greatly increased compared to when I first came here. Without a doubt.\nI need to control my anger… even shouting at this man is more than he deserves.\n“… Do you remember that Imperial decree?”\n“…”\nDon’t… don’t close your eyes. I’m begging you, listen…\nIt’s… it’s fine… calm down… if I get angry, it’s my loss…\nI take deep breathes, and leisurely lower my voice to make it easier for Leigie-sama to hear.\n“I said it, didn’t I? This time… the enemy’s a Demon Lord.”\n“… No?”\nKu… this man…\nI firmly clench my fist. I squeeze so hard my nails break through the skin, and a hot pain runs up my arm.\nIs he making fun of me? No. Without even playing dumb, the memory’s already completely gone.\nI… said it! I definitely said it! I was the one who brought the order from Kanon, I was the one who painstakingly explained it to Leigie-sama, and the one who said that the opponent was a powerful Demon Lord so if he didn’t go out himself, he would be sending his Generals to die a pointless death was also me!\nIt’s because if I didn’t warn him, I was sure he would never go out!\nAnger splits my head, and as I felt that I was about to destroy the area, I somehow kept it contained with repeated abdominal breathing.\n“Hey, hey, oneechan. Lize-san sure has become quiet lately.”\n“Don’t mind her, just hold the end properly!”\nAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!\nNext to Leigie-sama, the annoying sisters spoke as if it were someone else’s problem.\nHiero’s master later learned of her unsightly display, and sent her in for maid training. Recently, those two have taken to coming here together.\nThe prideful younger sister, who intentionally raised her voice so I could hear, and the older one, who despite being one-sidedly killed by me, continued to show absolutely no interest towards me. By that devastating combo, my stress is swelling up twice as fast as before. This really is the worst.\nPride’s Skiltree’s nature lies in bestowing absolute adjustments to opponents they’ve Overruled.\nTo put it simply, to them, to those weaker than them, they display absolute strength, and to those that excel even a little bit more than them, they display complete weakness… that sort of skill.\nAnd so, now that the older sister Lorna’s revived, it seems that Hiero was once more forced to occupy second place. Normally, once someone’s been Overruled, it’s difficult to overturn that, but now that Lorna’s been reduced to around the same age, the clear disparity in their appearances (mainly in the chest area) beat down Hiero once more, and while she’s still a bit afraid of Leigie-sama, she obediently follows her sister’s words.\nWell, for now, that doesn’t really matter.\nThe problem is that Hiero is taking mischievous glances at me as if she had set up a prank while she practices making the bed.\nShe speaks in my direction as she makes an annoying smile.\n“Lize-san, you’re not getting angry anymore… could it be you’ve finally given up after witnessing Leigie-sama’s power?”\n“An inevitable result. No matter the case, laying hands on a Demon Lord… it was her previous behavior that was the stranger one!”\nAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!\nRage so large I felt my head would explode at any moment swelled up, fueling my power.\nBlood flows from the palm of my hand, and it trickles onto the ground.\nI unintentionally put in too much power, and cracks are spreading across it.\nI use up all of my mental fortitude fighting my own emotions.\nCalm… calm down. Lize Bloodcross.\nIn the end, this is the nonsense of a child…\nCompared to this man, who never moves by himself, despite being a Lord…\nSmile. Make a smile.\n“D-Dem on Lord? I-I said it, right? The opponent is… the Devouring Demon Lord.”\n“… Who’s that?”\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHH\nSomeone do something about this maaaaaaaaaaan!\nAmong Kanon-sama’s subordinates, there isn’t one who doesn’t know of Zebul Glaucus, the Devourer.\nBut this Demon Lord probably, in all honesty, doesn’t know. Hooray.\nThat’s why. I. Explained it. Because I thought he didn’t know, I explained it! I definitely did!\nAAAAAAAH, please save me, Kanon-samaaaaaaaaaa!\nI hit my head against the bed post in an attempt to forget my anger, and Lorna looked at me with repulsed eyes.\nThis is all your Lord’s fauuuuulllt!\n“… Fifth… The Fifth Rank, a Demon that governs Gula, my liege. He subjugated the Fifteenth Rank, and the Sixteenth rank Demon Lords in a matter of three days. An atrocious… Demon Lord.”\n“… Is that supposed to be amazing?”\n“Gu… Yes, it’s amazing! Listen here, Rank Five means that among the Demon Lords loyal to Kanon-sama, he’s the fifth strongest!”\n“… Is he stronger than you?”\nNuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\nGeneral class… and a Demon Lord. Don’t compare them!\nI shed tears of restraint as I answer. Damn, why must I go through something like this?\n“W-well… that’s right…”\n“… I see.”\nHis uninterested line finally made me snap.\nIF YOU DON’T EVEN CARE, THEN DON’T ASK!\nAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!\n“Wow, that’s amazing… Lize-san. After going through this much, you can still keep quiet…”\n“Naturally. In the first place, what was strange was the way Lize has been treating our Demon Lord up until now.”\nIn my head, how many hundreds of thousands of times have I killed him so far!?\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH. This is bad… I’ll die.\nEven within my rage, tears started flowing out. Why am I…\n“Uku… and. So. It. Would. Be. Bad. If You. Don’t. Go. Out. Demon Lord! In. The. Worst. Case. They’ll. Be. Annihilated!”\nIn the first place, having a Demon Lord confront a Demon Lord is common sense in battles between Demons.\nThis time, we even know beforehand that Zebul is personally leading his army.\nA normal Demon Lord should know the meaning of this without me having to spell it out. But I thought Leigie-sama didn’t know, so I already explained it to him!\nGive me back all of my hard work!\nHaving listened to the drawn out conversation, Leigie-sama yawned with sleepy eyes.\n“… Iyo.”\n“If the army the Great Demon King sent you is annihilated, you’ll definitely be punished, you know!? Do you understand that!?”\nBut seeing her behavior, I’m not sure about other Lords, but perhaps Kanon-sama will let this man off.\nBut of course, I won’t say that. If I did, he definitely wouldn’t go out.\nWhy is it that the man in question isn’t even thinking anything, when I, who was merely sent to watch over him, have so much on my mind!!\n“…”\nAre. You. A Child!!?\nI pull at his arm as he silently closes his eyes.\nFrom Lorna, I heard that Deije and Medea had launched an attack, and it’s been a few hours since we informed Leigie-sama.\nIf we don’t hurry, they’ll all die. No, it’s not strange it they’ve already perished.\nAnd wait, normally, shouldn’t he at least say something!? That he wanted to join them or something!?\nWith Leigie-sama showing no signs of movement, I was just about to give up, when my savior popped up from an unexpected place.\nWith eyes full of curiosity, Hiero pulled at Leigie-sama.\n“Leigie-sama, I want to see it! The place where they’re fighting!”\nNono, that wasn’t my intent, you know?\nHiero has even less restraint than me when dealing with this Demon Lord. Of all things, she climbed onto his knee, and started shaking his shoulders back and forth.\nDue to the younger sister’s sudden recklessness, the elder one quickly tried to apprehend her. Unfortunately, due to her years of training being blown away, she lacks the physical ability to pull her away.\n“Hey, stop that! What do you think you’re doing to Leigie-sama…”\n“Eh? No, but even oneechan wants to see the form of a Demon Lord fighting once in your life, right?”\n“Yes, well…”\nOn the younger’s direct question, Lorna hesitated for a second.\nDespite this and that, Lorna who serves a Demon Lord who doesn’t do anything must harbor those feelings. That’s a bit of a relief.\nAs if he had noticed a change in the behavior of the faithful maid he had rewound the time of, Leigie-sama opened his eyes, and said a word.\nIt really was just a word. It seems he’s finally started to remember the name lately.\n“Lorna.”\n“Hiero, look! Leigie-sama is tired. Stop troubling him, and come back here so we can be doing what we should!”\nLorna spilled out her opinion without restraint. She grabs Hiero’s body firmly with both arms, and pulls her off of Leigie-sama.\nEven while pulling her off, she continues to direct a charming smile at Leigie-sama before deeply lowering her head.\nBut without a hint of interest towards her smile, he closed his eyes.\nInside of Lorna’s arms, Hiero resists, and shouts out.\n“B-but oneechan! Every night, to Leigie-sama, don’t you mastur…!”\n… What?\nUpon hearing that, with movements unbefitting of Lust, Lorna locked Hiero’s face in an iron claw with speed that made me question whether she had used a skill or not.\nShe looks over her sister expressionlessly. Her eyes definitely aren’t laughing. That’s the expression of someone considering how to cook up the live fish sitting on the cutting board.\nJust what would happen if you break her usual calm temperament? It feels as if a sleeping beast had been awoken.\n“Hiero… if you say any more, fufu… you may earn some of my resentment…”\n“Hii!? Ha… hahi!!”\nAnd suddenly, there was a girl directing serious killing intent at her younger sister.\nHiero noticed she had stepped onto the beast’s tail, and nods obediently with a pale face.\nLorna’s face slowly turns red, as she turns to her lord, but as he’s already taken up a sleeping position, there’s no way he was listening. In the first place, even if he was, I doubt he would even stop to think about it.\nBut… I see. So that’s it… Luxuria. A Lewd elder sister… that’s what Hiero was trying to say.\nSeeing Leigie-sama’s behavior, Lorna put her hand to her chest in relief.\nFor once in a long time, I smiled from the bottom of my heart.\n… But don’t forget that Leigie-sama isn’t the only one here. Don’t forget me.\nI lightly tap Lorna’s shoulder.\nShe turns around, and noticing my smile, she turns pale.\nInside of her hand, Hiero’s frothing at the mouth as she loses consciousness.\n“Li… Lize?”\nI completely ignore Lorna’s pleading eyes, and casually bring up some idle chatter.\n“So that’s it… to think that under that diligent face, you were… should I say, as expected of Luxeria?”\n“Wha…!?”\n“I did find it odd when I first heard you governed Lust, but I never thought that of all things, you would use the lord you served to…”\n“Wait, wait, wait, time out!”\nWith an expression I’ve never seen on her before, she grabs my collar, and pulls me closer.\nEven if she looks a bit more innocent, being exposed to her beautiful face point blank, even though I’m of the same gender, I can’t stop the beating of my heart.\nKu ku ku Lust… lust… is it?\nWith teary eyes, she turns her face away.\nWhat should I do. I’m having a lot of fun.\n“Even if you may be a Demon of Lust, are you not a little too sinful? Did you want to look stoic, while you advanced your Luxuria class inside your heart… as expected of the girl her own sister called lewd. What’s more, every day… aren’t you going to become a Demon Lord of Lust sometime soon?”\n“Wait, that’s wrong! Lize! It’s not like that! Right, it’s Hiero’s misunderstanding!”\nShe shakes me violently.\nJust what sort of persuasive power do you think you have when your face is that red, and your eyes so teary?\nIn the first place, whether that be fantasy or reality, it doesn’t really matter to me.\n“And I doubt you even have to be so secretive about it, like Hiero, why don’t you just tell Leigie? To instruct you to do sexual favors or something, that you’d happily accept. Ku ku ku, I think even Leigie-sama’ll be surprised. That the Lorna that always did the cooking and cleaning was actually thinking such things deep down.”\n“…!!”\nShe raises a scream without any words as I thrust the final blow.\nYou won’t get any pity. I put my hand to her face that’s become as red as an apple.\n“Ah, if it’s hard to say, then do you want me to tell him for you? As an apology for killing you that one time? Fufu, Leigie-sama sure is a happy Demon Lord. For a Luxeria Demon to think of him to that extent, and even give her first to him.”\n“Huu… Uu… wrong, it’s not like… I’m…”\nShe’s lost and confused as she falls to the ground.\nBy the way, despite all the noise we’re making, Leigie-sama isn’t stirring in the slightest.\nAs she made a face as if the world was going to end, I lightly tapped her shoulder. At this rate, I’m really going to awaken to something besides Wrath.\n“Hey, Lorna. How about a trade?”\n“A… Trade…?”\nWith eyes like an abandoned puppy, she spoke as she looked up at me.\nI have things I have to do, and Lorna has things she has to do. In order to fulfill both, why don’t we help each other a bit? Ku ku ku, this is mutual aid, isn’t it?\n“Yes… Lorna. I want… to see Leigie-sama’s form in battle. Maybe if I saw the moment Leigie took down Zebul, I would completely forget everything that came to pass here.”\n“Gu… uu.. you Demon.”\nWhat are you saying, this late in the game.\nEven when I gave her hope at the last moment, Lorna continues to hesitate. She’s a perfect image of loyalty. Though she is a lewd woman who does this and that with her Lord’s image every night.\n“Ah, if it’s that, we can record his fighting form on a memory crystal, you know? Ku ku ku, won’t it make for some good… material?”\n“I-I get it! I get it, so p-please stop it!”\nShe raises the white flag.\nAs I thought, it’s nice to win. I didn’t even use my Wrath, but it’s a refreshing feeling after so long.\nNow the problem is whether or not Lorna can persuade that guy…\nCould it be that’s the greatest problem?\nLorna gently pulls the cuff of the sleeping Leigie-sama with restraint.\n“Leigie-sama…”\n“…”\nPerhaps because that was the voice that always rung out for his meal time, amazingly, after only one call, Leigie-sama opened his eyes.\nLorna began negotiations with her face dyed a deep red.\n“This may be presumptuous, but I have a small request…”\n“Don’t want to.”\n… He shows no mercy, even to the maid.\nI guess that’s right. Even when he had a revival spell, he’s a man who didn’t even use it until Hiero got to be a pain. There’s no way the presence of Lorna will do anything.\nBut perhaps because she’s even more used to dealing with Leigie, she doesn’t pay any mind to his denial.\n“Together with Lize… won’t you bring ruin to the opposing Demon Lord, Zebul?”\n“… Why?”\nWhy?\nWhy, you ask? Because it’s an order from the Great Demon King!\nI try to approach, but Lorna stops me.\nShe continued on with a kind look in her eyes.\n“Leigie-sama, is there anything special you want to eat tonight?”\n“… Curry rice.”\n“Then we’ll have Curry Rice tonight. Leigie-sama, I’ll put all my skill into making it. It will taste better if you excersize a bit first.”\n“… Unnecessary.”\n“Leigie-sama, how about dessert?”\n“… Apple pie.”\nAre you a child?\n“Then I’ll bake Apple Pie. Leigie-sama, it will take a little bit of time, so how about you move your body a bit?”\n“I hate it.”\n“Fighting, you mean?”\n“I’m a pacifist.”\nAnd what the hell’s with a pacifistic Demon Lord?\n“That’s quite amazing, Leigie-sama.”\n“Especially if the opponent’s strong, I hate it even more. It’s a pain.”\n“… Compared to you, my liege, their power amounts to nothing.”\nNono, that isn’t the case, right?\nThe opponent is Rank Five. Compared to that, Leigie-sama’s become Rank Three quite recently.\nIt’s undoubtable that he’s above Zebul, but I have to say that it’ll be difficult to win that easily. There’s a problem of affinity, and I don’t know the details of Sloth Skills.\nLeigie-sama has a troubled face as he locks eyes with Lorna.\n“… I see. Lorna… you want me to fight that badly?”\n“… Yes.”\n“For whose sake?”\n“… For my sake. Later… I’ll bear witness. I’ll have Lize… take pictures, so…”\n“Bu…!”\nI unintentionally laughed.\nLorna’s face is the shade of a boiled octopus as she glares at me. Her eyes are telling me that she doesn’t mean it like that, but from my point of view, it can be for nothing else.\nI get it. I get it. I’ll take them! Use them as material however you like.\n“… I see…”\n“… I’m very sorry.”\n“… Hah…”\n“… I’m very sorry.”\n“… For some reason, my stomach hurts…”\nWith a face devoid of any pain, the Demon Lord spoke.\nThat much!? You don’t want to fight that much!? Leigie of the Slaughterdolls!\nIf you’re going to fake illness, at least give a pained face!\n“… I truly am sorry, Leigie-sama.”\nIn response, Lorna gave a truly apologetic face as she lowered her head.\nEven after seeing that, he doesn’t seem to think anything. He turned away, and curled up into a ball.\nThis is definitely impossible…\n“… Now, Lize. Leigie-sama has given affirmation.”\n“… Eh!? Fo realz!?”\nWith that? That was enough?\nIs that really fine? No matter how you look at it, he was refusing, but…\nWithin the chair, the Demon Lord tried to shrink his body. I was right to try asking in the time his bed was being made. If he was on the bed, he would have burrowed under the covers without a doubt.\nLorna continued to say some unbelievable things.\n“… Lize, please take Leigie-sama. Even if you can do nothing else, then at the very least, you can do that, right?”\n… Even if I can’t do anything? That’s quite rude. Just how much trouble do you think I’m going through…\nBut that’s fine. That’s still fine. The problem is… will he even go?\n“… Eh? Should I take him on my back?”\n“… You will be moving my liege. That much is obvious.”\nWhat’s obvious? … Move already!\nIn the first place, the Castle of Shadows is the center of the large mass of land given to him. I understand the general distance to its borders, but I’m going to have to carry him that far…?\nI don’t want to think about it. Even if I have enough strength, is the Demon Lord’s pride really intact after being carried by a woman shorter than him?\n… It probably is.\nI swallow the rage that began to boil up. I don’t really understand why I have to do so much, but it’ll take time. Flying dragons are the main forms of transport within the Demon World.\nSo this time as well, even if I’m carrying him, it’ll only be to the Dragon Stables.\n“… I get it… I’ll carry him, so…”\n“That’s fine. Now, Leigie-sama… I’m sorry, but…”\n“… The truth is, if I’m away from the bed for more than an hour, I’ll die.”\nAt this point in time, he still knows not when to give up. He has not a scrap of pride.\nAnd wait, don’t lie with a straight face! There’s no way this thing is a Demon Lord!\nIn the first place, it’ll take longer than an hour to get there, even by Dragon.\n“… Even if we use a flying dragon, it’ll take more than an hour just to get there…”\n“What? More than an hour… you say? You, are you trying to kill me!!?”\nThat was the most motivated voice I had heard from him from the moment I was stationed here.\nDoes he really hate it that much… this man.\nA grinding pain comes from my stomach.\n“Don’t’ screw with me! I’ll give in and fight… that much is fine. Because it’ll be over after I randomly use some skill or another. But if you want me to fight, then bring that something something Demon Lord to my room, or it ain’t happening!”\n“T-there’s no way that’s happening! Now let’s go!”\nI pull at the whining Demon Lord’s arm with all my might.\n“… Don’t~ Want~ To~! I definitely won’t work!”\n“Don’t be selfish! It’s an order from the Great Demon King!”\n“Damn, why must I go through this… Being a Demon Lord… I quit!”\nThis man… he’s serious. He doesn’t want to move that badly.\nYou’re not even working in the first place!\nAnd in a time like this, this Demon Lord still hasn’t worked up any interest towards his enemy.\n“… Now then, stop screwing around! You can sleep on the way there!”\nWith Wrath being my attribute, the only one who’s made me make so many concessions is this man.\n“… Can I sleep in battle too?”\nIs his head screwed on right?\nAnd wait, you’ll die! No matter who you think you are, you’ll die! Your enemy isn’t General Class, he’s a Demon Lord like you!\nDoes this man understand that!?\n“… It’s no good. Go tell Kanon. Go fight for yourself.”\nWith eyes full of needless self-confidence, this man shows no fear even towards the Great Demon Lord.\nIf one of the Great Demon Lord’s direct subordinates saw him now, it wouldn’t be strange for him to get convicted for treason.\n“There’s no way I could say something like that! And it’s not like it has to be dragons. I just thought that would be fastest. Now warp, or do some instantaneous movement, or whatever it is you want! You’re still fighting, you know! That’s your responsibility!\n“…Hah…”\nLeigie-sama lets out a sigh.\nHe really is useless.\nAnd this conversation is a pain.\nIs what his eyes are telling me.\nWhen I thought he was about to return some more complaints, I felt a weightless feeling as if my body had been tossed into the air.\nMy field of vision instantly changed.\n“He…?”\nHaving been thrown into the air himself, as well, Leigie-sama doesn’t try to roll or even raise his voice as he flops onto the ground.\nI quickly correct my body, and land on my feet.\nA desert of darkness without a single place to take cover extended to the horizon. The pale blue moon illuminated the desolate earth without a single blade of vegetation.\n“Heh? Wai… wah… eh?”\nAm I seeing an illusion?\nI was definitely inside the castle so how did we…\nin comparison to me at the height of confusion, the Demon Lord who had been thrown on the ground isn’t panicking at all.\nThe pitch black dirt that seemed to personify darkness itself, a sign that it was soaked in the Mana of death.\n“… Zone… more, that way…”\n“What? Wait…”\nI heard an ominous voice.\nMy vision shifted once more.\nFrom an empty plain, to a plain drenched in the scent of blood and flesh and ash.\nLeigie-sama rolls on the ground in an unsightly manner.\nWhen I hit the ground, my instincts perceived it.\nMuch different from Leigie-sama’s existence…but something as great as him. And wait, the object releasing it is right before my eyes.\nAs if a hole had been cut in space, an overcoat that seemed to suck in all light draped over a small shadow.\nThe small face covered in green hair looked over with an expression of bewilderment. But if you were to compare, I was the more confused of the two of us.\nZebul Glaucus.\nThe Devouring King. Her appearance and figure match the one I had heard about.\nHow can this be… am I dreaming!?\nThe Demon Lord ignores me, and turns to Leigie, who unsteadily lifts himself.”\nIn front of Zebul, with shaking steps like that of a baby fawn, he fell onto his back, and sighed.\nWithout letting his voice out, and moving only his mouth, he began to complain.\n“… Really… impossible… no good. This one’s strong… don’t want to…I can’t hear anything lalalalala.”\nThe first thoughts that were born in my mind were retorts.\nWait, so that was you!\nI definitely said you could teleport or something, and I’ll admit that.\nIs this also a Sloth Skill? No, it’s perfect for Sloth, isn’t it!\nEven so, he gives up quickly!\nLeigie-sama takes a glance at Zebul, and swings his head from side to side.\nMy stomach instantly goes into ominous spasms of pain. Perhaps I’ll burn through my gut.\nAnyways, Quit. Screwing. With. Me!",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Gula, Part 1: This World is… Hell\nWithin the whole world, I think that the hardest feeling to bear is『Hunger』.\nThe Demon World is absurdly vast, by I doubt there exists a longing that surpasses this thirst.\nThus, after being given life as a Demon, when I was selected under Gula, I thought it to be a natural matter of course.\nThe months and years passed by favorably, and as I lived thinking of nothing but how to sate my hunger, the class I was burdened with had changed to『Demon Lord』 when I wasn’t looking.\nIf you ask whether anything changed once I became a Demon Lord, nothing changed at all. The only thing I am capable of is eating, and I was more than satisfied with that alone.\nPerhaps a change to speak of was that I became one of the strong, and therefore, the extent of what I could eat had increased.\nIt was survival of the fittest in the truest sense of the word. Because we were a bit stronger, we ate, and as a result, our classes advanced.\nIt didn’t take long for the target of that desire to shift from what the other Demons called ‘Food’, to inorganic matter, and finally those of the same race.\nThe fact that other Demons taste good is a sort of common sense among those that carry Gula. Eating them takes up too much effort, so there are few that actually do it is all… meaning as long as you take care of that single point, there is no need for hesitation.\nI lived a long time.\nI was born as a Demon, became a Demon Lord, became the Great Demon King’s subordinate, and ate all the opposing Demon Lords.\nThe stronger the targets were, the better they tasted on my tongue.\nWithin Demons, there are about five ranks.\nMeaning, starting from『Rankless』, it goes to\n『Pawn』\n『Knight』\n『General』\n『Lord』\nThese five.\nRankless have the least taste, and Lords are a delicacy.\nAdditionally, their taste changes based on the attribute they carry. If you asked me what the supreme food was, I would definitely say『Demons』.\nTo Gluttony, that is cursed with unlimited hunger, no matter how much food you have, it is never enough.\nBorn as pure predators, Gluttonies are never loved by their race. Because of their nature that rashly excels in attack power, if they act too indiscriminately, there’s always the fear that their surroundings will work to eliminate them.\nOrder was needed, so the quickest solution was to put them under the protections of someone of a high rank.\nAnd that was the Great Demon Lord. That’s all.\nWithout any real difficult reasons, and without any particular circumstances. For such simple reasons, I became a Demon who followed the Great Demon Lord, and I got retainers, and land, and… the right to devour Demons that opposed us.\nEven more time passed.\nMy power as a Demon continued to rise, and my hunger along with it.\nMy tongue matured, and normal food would no longer sate my hunger in the slightest.\nThe Great Demon Lord changed generations thrice, and one who hadn’t even existed when I was born, Kanon of Ruin, took over.\nShe was a deep crimson Demon, a beautiful personification of the flames of purgatory.\nI still remember the audience I had with her when she took office.\nThe magic I felt from her body blazed up in a manner fitting of Ira, and the surrounding air seemed to burn with tremendous heat at the might that filled it. I felt that I was going to prostrate myself at any moment against that might.\nI thought of how beautiful and strong a Devil she was.\nAnd within her, was overflowing charisma.\nIf it’s with this Great Demon King, then I’ll be able to satisfy my hunger to levels I’ve never felt before.\nI’ll be able to taste flavors I’ve never learned of.\nAnd at the same time, I thought.\nIf I could ever get a taste of her… the sensation would be good enough to send me to heaven.\nMy parents, and my friends, and my retainers, I even ate other Gluttonies.\nI ate Sloth, and Greed, and Lust, and Wrath, and Gluttony, and Pride, and Envy.\nIn tears, in anger, in laughter, in gratitude, they were eaten.\nThere is no ranking among food, and thus, everything in this world has equal value.\nWhether disgusting, or delicious, even if I knew it would never fill my stomach, I ate.\nThis world is… hell.\nIt expands. It contracts. It changes. War starts. War Ends. Things fall. Things revive. Everything is perpetually in a state of change, and what prospers must decay. But within all of that, the only thing that didn’t change at all was my hunger.\nOnly hunger remained constant.\nAlong with the endless euphoria I experienced upon sating it.\nSo me raising a revolt against the Great Demon King, Kanon Iralaude was likely not a matter of food supplies or anything. It was probably just a matter of time.\nBecause I’m a Demon. A Demon of Gluttony.",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Gula, Part 2: Let me Have a Taste\nThis level of Magic wasn’t able to satisfy my Soul Core at all.\nIt was so nice back in the day. The Demon World was simply overflowing with powerful demons who had spent long years satisfying their desires.\nPerhaps I’ve just lived too long. Perhaps I’ve just eaten too many tasty things. And within our limited resources, in order to satisfy our matured tongues, we continued to struggle like children.\nFufufu, it was so nice back in the day… is it? I’m starting to sound like an old person.\nAbout ten thousand years ago, most of the powerful Demons… in a large scale war with the invading army from heaven, most of them perished.\nWhat remains of the demons now. The Demon Lords are all youngsters who haven’t ten thousand years under their belts.\n“Zebul-zama, I’m hungry.”\nA Demon with a Wolf’s head spoke.\nHe’s General Class, and another who governs Gluttony. For someone who has yet to reach Demon Lord status, I more than understand his pain.\n“Fufufufufu, of course… I’m the same. Endure it. The meal eaten after enduring the utmost limits of starvation is the greatest of bliss. They say hunger is the best seasoning, right?”\n“Food… I wants… food.”\nThe sweet scent of blood and flesh and souls tickles my nostrils.\nWhile I may be called something like the Carrion Devourer, I’m a scholar on the journey for supreme tastes, and I don’t just devour anything out there. I don’t know where that name came about.\nI cross my feet onto the pure white throne of marble. Muffled cries are coming from the mouth of the food carrying the throne.\nFor Demons of Pride… breaking their pride before eating them creates the greatest taste.\nBut whatever the case, I don’t feel very much power from him anyways. I guess the taste will be reasonable, at least.\nOf course, my stomach is endless, so I won’t do something as foolish as wasting food. I never miss my prayers before and after a meal.\nBlood spills out like a fountain, and stains my face. At the same time, the throne begins to sway.\n“H-hey! Don’t just eat them as you please!”\n“Gu?”\nWhen I frantically look underneath it, I saw the form of my subordinate gnawing on the head of another with his massive jaw.\nAaaaaah, right when I was in the middle of food preparations…\nEven if the materials are bad, they don’t understand my sentiment of making them as tasty as possible.\nBut raising a crunching sound, the smile that bust out on that wolf face made me feel it didn’t matter anymore. It’s because I can understand how he feels.\nGood grief, what helpless children.\nI jump off of the Throne, take the right arm of the corpse that had lost its freshness, and put it in my mouth.\nThe ripe soul only gave off a sweet taste for an instant. With a few chews, it disappeared in the blink of an eye.\nWell, well, good grief. This doesn’t do anything to my hunger.\nWhen I was ripping off the left arm, the wolf head spoke.\n“Gu… Zebul-zama… yo fazt…”\n“Yeah, I’m… one who can eat a bit.”\n“Didn’t you juzt eats a Demon Lord…”\n“Yep, that was tasty.”\nAs I thought, Demon Lords are different. The depth of flavor is different. The texture is different. I can clearly tell that my body is happy when I eat them.\nEven if they’re newcomers, the magic they possess is completely incomparable to the General Class below them.\nThe Wolf finishes up the head, but when it looked through its spoils for something more, the libs were already gone.\nHe directs accusatory eyes at me.\n“Unfair…”\nWell, well.\nThe things kids say these days.\nThe endless longings he held in regards to food made me speak with admiration.\n“Not unfair, not unfair. You have to take your own food… by yourself. The one who fought Claud Astal was me, right? It’s natural that I be the one to eat him. Did you perhaps do anything?”\n“Zat demon juzt now… I killed him…”\n“… Really? Was that how it was? Fufufu, well, the achievements of the vassals are those of the King’s correct? If you hate it… you’ve got to rise up in the world.”\nIf you do, you’ll someday come to learn the taste of a Demon Lord. Well, perhaps you’ll live happier if you never learn it.\nI activate a Gluttony Skill.\nI use my magic, and my stomach shakes even further with hunger.\n『Million Dish』\nThe tentacles that grew from my back pierce the body of the former Pride Demon that had already lost its head and limbs.\nThe wolf head raises a cry.\n“Wait…”\n“Fufufu, well, I’ll leave you a bit.”\nGluttony skills are used only during meals.\nEach tentacle moves individually, and the Pride Demon’s body was eaten up in under a second.\nThe wolf head hurriedly tried to bite at it, but his teeth clicked together fruitlessly in the empty air.\nFufufu… to intrude on another’s meal, what bad eating manners, kid.\n“Aaaaaaaah, you zaid you would… leave a bit…”\n“Fufufu… thank you for the meal… it tasted decent.”\nEven if he’s General-class, I guess that’s all he’s got. As I thought, back in the day…\nNo, that was only the Fifteenth Rank Demon Lord. The Demons he’s amassed are just that level.\n“… Zebul-zama…”\n“Fufu, see, I left it, did I not?”\nThe teary-eyed wolf… he’s a General Class Demon belonging to my army, Gar Luxeed. I pointed to the pure-white throne, and offered it to him.\n“… The throne.”\n“I don’t… needs a plate.”\nGood grief, as a General Class, he lacks dignity… shouldn’t higher class Demons have a bit more elegance?\nAhaha, well, wolves are carnivorous, was it? That is… I’ve done something bad.\nBut you shouldn’t be so picky with food.\n“I see… fufu, then I guess I’ll eat it…”\n“… Edible thingz are edible.”\n“When it comes down to it, sometimes you have to get down and eat the dirt and stones as well.”\nThe mouth on the hand I pointed with… the fangs shaved at the marble.\nIt’s not a bad taste. But even if it’s made with high quality materials, in the end, it’s just a plate. It’s fine for fooling my hunger, but as I thought, it can’t rival what’s supposed to be on the plate.\nThe war’s long since finished, and this is the victory banquet.\nThe army of Pride has fallen, and all the enemy soldiers became food.\nThey definitely weren’t a match for me at all. Despite having their Demon Lord with them, in just two hours, their defeat was already decided.\nOur army only contains Gluttony Demons, but Gluttony excels in attack power, and the most basic of Gluttony Skills, 『Wave of Starvation』 is one with a large area of effect.\nAs long as I’m here, all Demons below a certain level of ability simply get caught up in the skill, and end up as nothing but food.\nOf course, I did make sure to hold back, but they were an indecisive bunch from the start.\nFufufu, there’s no meaning in an indecisive Superbia Demon. In the end, he’s just a loser who submitted himself to Kanon Iralaude.\nPride is… stronger the more arrogance one has. And that also increases the flavor.\nThere’s also the fact that the difference in rank between us was too great, but the 『Overrule』 the Demon Lord used wasn’t anything special either.\nHis screams of despair weren’t bad as a seasoning, though.\nHaving finished eating the throne, I pat my stomach.\nI’m quite slim. All the nutrition goes to feeding my Gluttony Skills.\n“Zebul-zama… I’m hungry.”\n“Hmm? Already? … I guess it’s because there was just quantity without quality…”\nWith this, I’ve barely broken even with what was used up by my skills.\nI scan the surroundings, but everything I could gnaw on had disappeared into someone’s stomach or another, and all I saw were eyes sparkling with hunger.\nWell, well, regular eating should give a better feeling of fullness, but… well, there’s no helping it if they can’t endure it.\nSince I just ate a Demon Lord, I can still hold on for a while, but answering to the expectations of his men is also a King’s duty, is it not?\nI hit the palms of my hands together, and addressed the faces of my men, who were seething in their basic desires.\n“Now, let’s go search for some more food…”\n“YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!”\nMy subordinates cry out. The ground shakes under their hunger, and the cries of beasts ring through the air.\nThey have more than enough motivation. A majority of my gluttonous followers have the forms of beast. For them, who have not the power to bite through everything, it’s a form they’ve taken on to at least be able to eat chew through some hard things.\nAnd so, my army’s members… aren’t that good at using their heads. Well, to do nothing but eat, there really isn’t the need.\nAmong them, the one who’s actually known as quite a resourceful General, Gar, has drool dripping from his mouth as he unfurls a map.\nThe Great Demon King’s Castle, the Palace of Rending Flames is surrounded by other Demon Lords’ territories, and it doesn’t look like we’ll be able to reach it so easily.\nSo before eating Kanon-sama, having the other Demon Lords as appetizers as we continue towards the Palace is a wonderful plan if I do say so myself.\nFufufu, even I… taking on multiple Demon Lords at once will be difficult. Let’s just go around eating them in order.\nAs long as the Great Demon King goes into my stomach, my abilities should rise further. I could even be the King in her place.\nIt’s because the Demon Lords are all overflowing with ambition. No one will care about a King who was weak enough to get eaten.\nOn the route Gar pointed to, was a territory divided by a line.\nA vast land along the path with the shortest distance to the Great Demon King. Its width was such that adding together the land of the Demon Lords I ate yesterday and today wasn’t nearly enough. An expanse that would take more than a day to cross, even on a Flying Dragon. If we wanted to avoid this land, we’ll have to take on quite a detour.\nUpon seeing the name marked on it, I knit my brow.\n“Oh my… what a navigation error. Why is it that with almost twenty Demon Lords out there, this guy’s name has to pop up?”\n“Hmm? Iz there a problem?”\n“A big one. BIG ONE. For god’s sake, what was Mizna and the others thinking when they thought up this route…”\n“Zebul-zama… Mizna isn’t here anymore. Setter and Grad as well.”\n“No, I know. They were tasty.”\nI understand, but, you know, I want to offer a word of complaint or two.\nI remember the three Kanon-sama dispatched to keep watch over me.\nMy own men are of no help in planning, so my invasion plans were skillfully drawn up by those three. Of course, I wasn’t honest enough to tell them it was all to eat Kanon-sama.\nAll they thought up was the route. Naturally, as they were under the direct control of Kanon-sama, they would only be in the way after that, so once they had drafted a plan, they became my dinner’s appetizer.\nIn the end, a General Class, taken by surprise at that, is no match for me.\nWell, I did savor the taste. The fact that they were much tastier than the generals of that Pride army must be a difference in basic quality.\nBut still, for it to have come to this…\nFor once in a long time, an emotion other than hunger floated up. I touched the name on the map.\nHonestly… I really don’t feel up for this one.\n“Waz the problem?”\n“… You, could it be you don’t know of the Demon Lord of Acedia, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls?”\nFormer Rank Four. After some recent achievements, he’s been promoted to Rank Three; a high ranking Demon Lord of Sloth.\nIt’s not like a Demon Lord’s strength can be determined solely by ranking, and it’s not like I’m that afraid of his strength. He isn’t some newcomer, like me, he’s an old age Demon Lord who survived the Heavenly War ten thousand years ago. But that isn’t very scary to me.\nOf course, I’ve never fought him, but the fact that he’s clung to life for this long also means that he’s stored up just that much power. Thus, it’s completely true that he won’t be as easy as those Rank Fifteen and Rank Sixteen Lords, but the essence of the problem lies elsewhere entirely.\nI let out a deep sigh.\nAnd to my cute subordinates, who didn’t understand anything, I delivered the shocking truth.\n“Demons of Sloth are… bitter, aren’t they?”\n“Bitter…?”\n“Yeah, I always honor whoever I beat by eating them whatever they may be, however… even for me, I don’t want to eat a Demon of Sloth.”\n“Eeeeeeeeeh?”\nGar jumps up in a gesture of surprise.\nYou’re overreacting… I think as I survey the surroundings, only to find my subordinates, who never think of anything besides eating, and never display a fragment of intelligence staring as if they had just seen something unbelievable.\nNononono.\nI tried to give a simple explanation. This is the knowledge of Gluttony.\n“No, it’s not, well… the lower level Demons are fine, you see. But the more they carry their Sloth to the extremes, the ways through which they can carry it out increases… Within them, in order to prevent getting eaten, there’s this skill that drops the flavor of their meat and soul, so…”\nThat’s dangerous.\nIt’s an individual skill, and quite a High Ranking one, but it’s a terrifying expression of flavor.\nThat taste is, in itself bitter enough to give permanent mental trauma with just one bite. It’s not on a level where some people who like bitter foods can partake in it. It’s not a matter of like, or dislike. It’s just plain bad.\nEven for someone called the Devourer, in eating, I only want to eat the best of foods, and from one who’s even eaten all sorts of poisons to try and fill my endless stomach… it’s bad. It’s terrible enough to kill. It was the first, and only thing in my life to ever give me a stomachache.\nThen there’s always the option of swallowing whole, you may think, but that’s wrong. Their taste resounds in their very souls. Even if you send it directly to your stomach, it’s without a doubt terrible.\nTo change taste as not to be eaten, it’s like an attribute of a fruit.\n“Lower level Sloth… has a nice affinity, and they don’t move, so they’re easy to hunt, and their flavor is unique, but not bad…but it has to be a Demon Lord of all things.”\n“Meaning?”\nIn a beat, I put power into my words, and declare.\n“The worst tasting thing in this world. There’s no question about it.”\n“Oooooooooooh.”\nI’m not sure what they’re misunderstanding, but they’ve started clapping.\n… You guys, you don’t get it at all. I guess that’s true. Gluttony’s outlook on food is excessively open minded… so not being tasty is one thing, but I’ll bet they’ve never tasted the true meaning of Terrible.\nI cannot help but bless them for their good fortune. Among my thousands of years of life, it’s a trauma that goes directly in my top three.\nWell, you don’t often get a chance to eat a Sloth Demon, and once they go above General Class, they appear on the battlefield less and less, so I’ll bet we won’t meet any.\n… Hmm?\n“… I see… You anticipated that he wouldn’t come out. Mizna…”\n“Hm?”\nI see. If you put it like that, then I understand.\nTruly, a Demon Lord of Sloth personally participating is impossible.\nIf you ask why, unlike Gluttony, their cravings do not require them to harm others, and the Demon Lord of Sloth should be the laziest existence within the entire Demon World.\nThere’s no way he would join in something as troublesome as a war. Even if the Great Demon King ordered it, it’s impossible.\nI tried looking through my memory for Leigie’s face, but I couldn’t bring it up.\nHaving served under the reigns of three different Great Demon Kings, I should be the oldest veteran within Kanon-sama’s army, but no matter how far I probe my memory, I cannot picture the image of Leigie of the Slaughterdolls.\nI frowned, as I concentrated nutrients to my brain. And I was finally able to pull out a memory.\nIt’s definitely faint, but I remember.\nHe was definitely there during the festival in which Great Demon King Kanon-sama took office. Being pulled around by his inspector.\nHe had black hair, and an unreliable slim figure. How the hell is that guy a… I remember the other Demon Lords saying such things.\n“Whatz wrong? Zebel-zama…”\n“… Wait a second. Huh? I think he was there for the previous King Ferris Craun as well…”\nMy memory traces even further back.\nThe festival when the previous Demon Lord was instated.\nMy memory is hazy, and everything looks covered up by mist, but he was definitely there.\nA black haired, and sloppy-looking man, carried on the back of his subordinate. How the hell is that guy a… I remember the other Demon Lords saying that. Just barely.\nI tilt my head.\n“… Huh? Hang on, just how long has he been there… Ferris Craun was in office for quite a while, wasn’t he…”\nFerris was inaugurated as the Great Demon King more than twenty thousand years ago.\nEven I can’t remember the Great Demon King before that, but when I first became a Demon Lord, was that man there? Wasn’t he?\nA Demon’s lifespan is exceedingly long, but for him to live this long, he must have considerable power.\nI think he wasn’t there that long ago, but I don’t have too much confidence in it.\nProbably because whether he was there or not wouldn’t change anything…\n“Zebul-zama, what shoulds we do?”\n“Hmm… Even if you ask me that. Since we’ve come all the way here, we have no choice but to go for it.”\nWe’ve already burned our bridges on the way here, so it all depends on how fast we can take down Kanon-sama.\nTaking a roundabout way is… unfavorable. We’ll have to head forward with determination and resolve.\nLuckily, Sloth is said to excel in durability. It has an exceedingly good affinity with Gluttony. As long as I can endure the taste.\nNo, for taste… it’s been a really long time since I last ate a higher rank Sloth. My memory is vague, and it could be that only the impact remained in it, and if I try eating one now, it won’t actually be so bad.\nYeah. That’s right. The past aside, there no way the current me can eat something and be repulsed by it.\nWhat’s more, there’s no way that Sloth will actually come out. If they offer any resistance, it’ll be the Sloth’s army at most. Leigie’s army is definitely known to be powerful, but at most, they’re full of Generals. No match for me.\nOn the contrary, I can’t wait to taste them.\n“Okay, then we’ll go on a direct path towards the Palace of Rending Flames!”\n“YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!”\nKanon-sama… please wait for me.\nI am, as the representative of all Gluttony Demons, going to get a taste of you.",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Gula, Part 3: Let’s Dig in\nMy regrets came all too quickly.\nThe fact that I wasn’t going to be able to eat a Demon Lord, coupled with the swiftly-dwindling motivation of my Legion.\nIt’s not that I had let my guard down. Perhaps I should say, ‘as expected of a Demon of Old.’\nGenerally, Demons get stronger the longer they age. It’s because they have more time to proceed down their tree. Of course, power doesn’t rise if you spend the whole time doing nothing, but at the same time, the Demon World isn’t the type of environment where you can spend all your time doing nothing.\nEven without Gluttony, the order of the Demon World is survival of the fittest. In a world like this, it’s a terrible move to underestimate a Demon who has perpetually carved out their existence.\nTaking the shortest path, my arm has long-since entered the territory of the Lord of Sloth.\nAnd there was something I noticed.\nGar has a rare, bewildered, expression as he turns his eyes towards me.\n“… Zebul-zama… the Zone is…”\n“Yeah, I know… damn, it isn’t breaking at all. What is this…”\nIt was frighteningly secure, and the air was stagnant.\nThat was the property of this field every Demon allied to a Demon Lord should know of.\n『Abyss Zone』.\nA battle for land between Demon Lords.\nWe were once allies, but now Leigie’s 『Abyss Zone』 is bearing its fangs at an opposing army. As the zone works with the Demon Lord at the center, I’m not affected, but even so, for my Zone not to reach Gar who’s running right alongside is more than abnormal.\nI’ve eaten for long enough that numbers are of no importance, but I don’t remember anything like this.\nMy instincts tell me there’s only a little more to go… The Zone I’m competing with is stronger than any I’ve encountered before, but with him this far away, I have the advantage.\nBut I’m just a little lacking in power. It’s been two days since we marched forth after eating that Demon Lord, so hunger is one of my problems.\nIn this state, I can’t make full use of my power of Gluttony.\n“It’s just a little further… damn, even if it took time, and we would have to take a detour, I should have eaten another Demon Lord before coming here…”\nAs expected of Rank Three. He’s really giving me trouble. From start to finish, he’s completely different than those other two.\nEven if it doesn’t matter in fights between Demon Lords, when armies are involved, 『Abyss Zone』 makes a huge difference. Rather, if a friendly Zone is broken through, it’s best to retreat.\nWell, the moment it breaks is usually the moment before defeat, so that’s quite impossible.\nAfter proceeding a while, I sensed the scent of excitement and fighting spirit drifting around.\nIt’s no Glutton Demon. It’s much sweeter, a scent that whets my appetite.\nBattle is just around the corner. I don’t know if their Demon Lord is there, but it feels that they won’t let us pass so easily.\nThat’s about right. If they did something like letting the Demon Lord who ate two others pass, their presiding Lord would get executed by Kanon-sama. That’s exactly why those past two lords launched attacks on me despite their fear.\nShould I just eat these guys already?\nI turn to my own army.\nNo, not yet. Even if I do, the power I’ll gain from it is limited. I’m not sure about General Class, but any Demons below that will go into my stomach without purpose.\nIn the first place, breaking through their Abyss Zone by eating the friendly soldiers it’s supposed to strengthen is pointless.\nWill the Demon Lord come out?\nThat’s the main problem.\nIf he isn’t there, then in the worst case, I could use a skill to eat their entire army… with Gluttony Skills, it’s possible.\nIf the Demon Lord comes to attack personally, I’ll have to concentrate on that, so I’ll have to leave Leigie’s army to my own troops. To combat Leigie’s army without the bonuses of my Zone is a bit much, even for the Gula Army that specializes in attack.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, the enemy should send their Demon Lord. Unless the army is considerably powerful, you have to send a Demon Lord to combat another if you want a chance of victory.\nBut the opponent is Sloth. With that in mind, there’s no way he’ll come out. What’s more, he should be a Demon of the same level as me. The pursuit of his cravings should have become his existence itself by now.\nAnd in order to substantiate that, Leigie has never stepped on the battlefield alongside his army. At the very least, within all my memory, Leigie hasn’t fought a single time.\nI feel my canines with my tongue, and start up a Skill.\nLet’s show off my appetite to Leigie for a bit.\nA support Skill, 『Fleeting Requiem』.\nWith me at the center, all area within a few meters is visited by 『Night』.\nThose touched by it have their magic devoured, a Skill of Gluttony. It’s a variation on 『Wave of Starvation』, and one of the ones I obtained upon become a Demon Lord so long ago.\nTo those that touch it, it inflicts damage, and all magecraft and skills that try targeting it are disassembled, and used to supplement my own magic. It truly is a manifestation of my ceaseless appetite.\nIt even devours Leigie’s Abyss Zone, and while it may only be a small radius around me, I deploy my own Zone.\nLike a slap on the face, I felt a strong bitter sensation. On the unexpected sensation, I grimaced.\nJust eating his Zone tastes this bad… this is why Sloths are…\n“Zebul-sama, something is coming.”\nAt that moment, my subordinate gave a report.\nAcross the desert, the shadow of a single person running entered my senses.\nNo, it’s wrong to say it was only one. It was one, but at the same time, many.\nThose same shadows, of a Female Demon around the same size as me, split into numerous bodies, and came closer with considerable speed.\n“… Hit her down!”\nThe entire army is late in following my orders.\nThe approaching party… was made of only one.\nMore importantly, about a few hundred meters behind her, an army more than twice our size was approaching…\nThey sure are underestimating an army led by a Demon Lord. I’m amazed that there’s a skill that can deceive my eyes, but even so, the power I sense from that girl isn’t great.\nA slight bitter scent is mixed in with the smell coming from her. She isn’t a Demon Purely aiming to fulfill a single desire.\nA sharp killing intent emanates from all the split bodies as one.\nI look through my mind for what sort of skill it could be. Through the large number of Demons I’ve eaten, my battle experience sees through it.\nIt’s probable a Luxuria high ranking Skill. I believe there was a Demon Lord Class Skill that could birth multiple phantasms with physical substance.\nWell, it doesn’t seem to be coming from her herself.\nFufu… do you not know of my Rank? Of my name?\nWhether you be a 『Knight』 or a 『General』… if you think that’s enough to beat a Demon Lord, then I sure am being looked down upon.\n… Well, you’ll have plenty of time to regret it. Within my stomach, that it.\nOne of our front line Demon’s 『Wave of Starvation』 eats up one of the illusions. Against the power that devoured her magic, I definitely witnessed the small girl knit her brow.\nShe’s inexperienced. She hasn’t been in battle long enough. No, she’s been sent to confirm our power, I see.\nFufu, so be it. How about I play with you?\nAgainst the young girl’s fleeting beauty, the Demon’s hand stopped for a moment.\nHis appetite quickly returns, but he’s too late to launch an attack. The girl easily dodges, and gouges out his throat. What refreshing skill.\nTo be bewildered by beauty… Fufu, how nice it is to be young. Go youth. Go youth.\nI reach my tentacles through the ground to eat the fallen Demon. My magic increases ever-so-slightly.\nI don’t have the time to savor the taste, but your sacrifice will not be in vain… because this world is survival of the fittest.\nGar uses his fangs to pierce the girl from behind.\nBut that body immediately fades like a dream, and it dispersed as pure magic energy.\nWithout leaving anything behind, I suck it up. It’s sweet. It’s extremely sweet magic. I see. Lust. She’s at least experienced enough to know when to use and cancel a skill.\nShe may be tastier than I first thought.\nPerhaps I have been blessed by the heavens. The moment I took in her magic, my power reached a level surpassing Leigie’s.\nAlong with the sensation of something shattering, Leigie’s Zone broke, and mine expanded. The second it came over her, the girl’s movements stopped.\nWhat’s more, all of her bodies at the same time.\nFufufu, that’s how powerful his Zone was. She’s never experienced it breaking, I’ll bet.\nBut that’s no good. You can’t stop moving at a time like this…\nI quietly snake my feelers through the ground, and skewer the ten closest bodies. The bodies that had been pierced from blind spots are all reduced to magic, as they fade like mist.\nIt seems the main body wasn’t among them. Well, she’s only scouting out the situation anyways.\nBut, even so, her magic is quite splendid. Even if I can’t eat up a Demon Lord, this flavor is plenty.\nMy stomach is growling. That girl has talent as an ingredient…\n… Okay, a gourmet like me will give you the best possible preparations before eating you up.\nJust when I had resolved myself, I had an exceedingly bad premonition.\nI immediately deployed my own 『Wave of Starvation』.\nThat was my instinct, born from all the time I’ve lived as a Lord of Gluttony, and following it was the right choice.\nFrom the distance, a power rivalling a Demon Lord came into being.\nA dragon of fire that sucked up everything in its path collided with my wave.\nHeat and light that didn’t fall short of the Demon World’s sun competed with my Wave of Starvation.\n“Zebul-zama, thiz iz…”\n“Ku… fu… could you not talk to me for a bit?”\nIt was a terrific barrage of light and flame.\nIt may even rival that weapon the heavenly soldiers used. Divine flames that might just rival Heavenly Judgement.\nThe hot wind that breaches my wave shakes my hair, but it stick to my forehead due to my sweat.\nJust what is this power!? Even if my stomach may be empty, its magic is so vast that the Rank Five’s Wave of Starvation cannot devour it!?\nWrath? No, this is… not the fire of anger. The taste is different.\nAt that moment, I remembered the gossip the late Mizuna had brought up earlier.\nQuite recently, a certain Demon Lord was awarded a legendary Demon Blade.\n… I see, so this is… Demon Blade Celeste. The blade that bosts the name of the L Class Dragon that had surpassed Demon Lords!!\nFufufu, I had forgotten…\nListen properly! Isn’t he your Rival Demon Lord?\nThe troubled face of the leader of the inspectors sent to me, Mizna, passes through my brain.\nI see, this truly is… a threat.\nMizna, it seems you were more proficient than you thought yourself.\n“Iz it the enemy Demon Lord!?”\n“Fufufu… if it was the Demon Lord using it, we would be ash by now.”\nThe heat, the light, they turn to a sublime flavoring, as they supplement me.\nA feeling of satisfaction expands through my body. What a flavor… what dense umami, this impact that simply perks you up. Splendid, so this is the power of a Demon Blade!\nOne more, I have one more thing to look forward to…\nMy wave of Starvation’s power increases, and it barely starts to push back the Demon Blade’s flames.\nIt feels that power is overflowing all over my body…\n“How tasty…! If the sword’s power can give off this much flavor, then just how delicious is the blade itself…”\n“Zebul-zama, unfair!! Having it all to yourself…”\n“With people of your caliber, you’ll die if you try eating it, you know… Fufu, polish yourselves so we can sit at the same dining table one day.”\nI look over my cute army, that’s still conscious of their hunger in a time like this.\nThey’ve really given us quite a welcoming present.\nFufu, they’ve brought a Demon Blade of this level. There’s no helping it if they’ve misunderstood that they can make it without a Demon Lord. It really can’t be helped.\nAs I thought, the Sloth isn’t here. If he had been participating, one blow would have ended it.\nBut that Great Demon Lord sure is awarding out some dangerous weapons… she could have just given it to me…\nFor Gluttony that preys on the rabble, a contest of powers is the greatest banquet.\nI lick my lips as I continue to eat the flame’s power.\nAt that moment, the wave that was definitely gaining traction was suddenly pushed back.\nSo the output can rise even further… I put my power into controlling the wave.\nBut the more time passes, the greater advantage I’ll gain. This much isn’t enough to fill my stomach.\nGluttony has a good affinity with skills that release continuous power, and Demon Blades.\nWhether it be fire or ice, of thunder or anything, I can eat it.\nDemon Blades of this type depend heavily on the user.\nAnd its output sure is… large. I’m not sure about an ordinary Demon Lord, but it lacks the power to take me down in a single strike.\nThough it’s not at the level of a sword that can spew unlimited flames, 『Wave of Starvation』 is a basic skill. I can maintain it for hours on end.\n“Fufu, how long will they keep this up? If they’re able to satisfy my hunger, I may just let them of, you know.”\nThe amazing amount of Magic, the pleasant feeling of my hunger being sated, athrobing feverish feelings spreads across my entire body, and a wave washes over my mind.\nAh, how wonderful. I’m glad we didn’t do something inelegant like taking a detour!\nI was tasting the flames in a dreamy state, and my eyes were closing as I basked in it, when the Demon Blade’s power began to swell up greatly.\nIt happened in a split second.\nThe wave that had been fighting evenly was instantly washed away, and my vision was covered with flames that burned everything.\n“Wha!?”\n“!?”\nWith a hint of resistance, of a chance to give a final scream, Gar who was standing beside me was burned away.\nI instantly extended my tentacles, and ate up that magic right before it destroy my soul.\nTo me, it was completely unexpected. MY own advantage had made me negligent.\nDespite the trance it put me in, the flame within my stomach raise a hunger that seems to devour my entire body. My instincts rage on.\nThis can’t be. This can’t be. This can’t be. This can’t be.\nI brush off the flames surrounding me with countless tentacles. My army. The Gluttony Demons, without being given an opportunity to breathe, were absorbed by my tentacles before the flames could reach them.\nThat energy. That magic. Anyone besides me would definitely be obliterated. I don’t have the time to use a skill. In the first place, Gula Skills aren’t suited to defense.\nI had already decided it. The moment my army was to be ruined… I would carry on their will.\nThat the army I trained, the army that shared my hunger would be eaten by me personally.\nWith each swing, my tentacles provided my perpetual energy. Instead of taking in the magic, I used it to strengthen my own power.\nThe 『Fleeting Requiem』 I was wrapped in faces the flames. The fire’s output rivals or exceeds what a Demon Lord of Wrath could release in might.\nBut unlike the Wave of Starvation, what I’m using right now is a Demon Lord level Skill. Well exceeding an ordinary Demon’s Skill level.\nIts scope is small, but it cuts me off from Celeeste’s flame, and saves up its energy as it sends it all to me.\nTears are escaping me. That power, that meaning, that supreme taste.\nIt was likely the enemy Demons’ trump card.\nThe stream of flame ended in only a few seconds. The heat remaining causes the wind to act up, putting the desert in disarray.\nNothing… was left. My army that numbered close to a hundred were all converted to magic, and installed into my stomach.\nCeleste’s flame was the same.\n“Haa haa haa, I’m sorry… everyone…”\nI lick my lips. The flood of emotions makes me look up to the sky.\nThe enemy army is still far. In this wade black desert, I’m all alone.\nI put my hands together. I must offer my thanks.\n“… Thank you for the meal.”\nThe power I devoured breaks down, and my own might rises.\nMy Zone, which had lost its own meaning completely surpasses Leigies, and it envelops the desert.\nPower is overflowing. More than ever before.\nFufufufufufufu. I can see everything.\nThe Rank Three Army, and the location of the General Demon who used the Demon Blade.\nSpanning several Kilometers, my Zone continued to break Leigie’s.\nMy perception tells me it has expanded explosively.\nJust as I thought, the Demon Lord’s presence isn’t anywhere.\n“I made light of you all… Fufufu, to think a normal General could push me back this far… but now I’ve had a taste of your trump card.”\nI deactivate 『Fleeting Requiem』. The power that had been dissolved by the skill converges on me all at once.\nFrom here on, it’s my… no, our turn to attack.\nAlong with the Enemy General’s voice, Demons with numbers that greatly exceed ous rush at us with bloodcurdling expressions.\nTheir stronger Demons than I had expected. For Demons below General Class, that is.\nWith you guys’ power, I will show my respect by fighting to the fullest.\nI lick my lips.\nIt’s time to dig in.\nI extend my tentacles from my back, and take a stab at the Demons coming at me.\nI sensed it the moment I pierced the first one. Tasty…\nFufufu, as I thought. Good work, Leigie of the Slaughterdolls! As expected of an old generation Demon that survived the Heavenly war! You have a good army on your hands!\nI lose myself in eating with the Tentacles. A spear impales my back, and I eat it.\nTime passed like a dream. Against a Demon Lord, their fighting spirit doesn’t die. What dauntless courage. A powerful Legion that doesn’t fall behind my own!\nA six armed muscular Demon that seems to be the leader brandishes a sword at me.\nI draw my own 『Fang Sabre』 to hit it down.\nMy ivory white fang, and the large man’s crimson edge meets.\nWhen the edges met, I understood.\nFufufu, I see. This Demon is the Wielder of Celeste. He’s giving off a tasty scent.\nIt’s not just the sword, but the Demon himself as well.\nI stifle the smile bursting forth from my heart.\n“Enemy Leader…”\nThe Demon raises a heroic laugh, as he slashes at me with the swords in his other hands. I sense that all of them Demon Blades with considerable power. I used my Tentacles to meet them.\nThis smell, and that fighting style.\nA Demon who’s amassed this many Demon Blades. He must be a Greed Demon.\nAnd he launches an attack with the flame from before.\nHe really knows how to use his own power.\n“Good skills.”\n“Ki ki ki, ‘tis an honor to be praised by you!!”\nFire flows up from his sword, but without paying heed to the flickering sword, I used my Fang Sabre to go for his neck. As expected of a Demon Blade even I’ve heard of. If I took an attack from it head on, it looks like it’ll be bad. But between a Demon Lord and a general, the basic specs are too different.\nOf course, it’s not like he’s weak. It’s not like he’s weak, but no matter how much he trains… 『Superbia』 aside, for a 『Avaritia』, the gap between General and Demon Lord isn’t a small one.\nMy Tentacles go after the small Demon attacking me from behind, and I dodge her blow.\nThere, was the courageous girl who had tried to launch the first attack.\nAn ice Demon Blade, and a dagger. Fufu, for a lust to go hand-to-hand… how brave.\nI’ve determined. These two are General Class.\nThe first is Greed-kun, the second is Lust-kun, and the others are all small fries. I see a difference in fighting ability between the two, but before me, it’s not like it matters.\nThey’re all equal food.\n“Two of them… a little small, but they look quite tasty.”\nThe girl’s movements stop for a moment. It seems this child has a bad habit where she stops moving when she gets surprised on the battlefield. She’s much too inexperienced.\nI didn’t let the chance go, and pierced her. I mean, it’s just an illusion, anyways. My eyes told me as such.\nJust as I thought, the girl’s figure fades like mist. Without wasting a bit, I absorb it, and challenged the large sword swing coming at my back by opening my mouth wide.\nThe Demon’s expression of shock. Fufufu, as I thought, to truly know the taste, I have to use my own mouth…\nThe other ones scattered around don’t tell much of a difference between Gluttony or Greed.\n“A Demon Blade… never eaten one before. It may be a delicacy.”\n“What!?”\nI stopped the blade he lowered with his strong arms with my teeth.\nThe hot metal I feel on my tongue, and the thick magic. The flames leaking out serve as a perfect accent.\nI’ll eat it… your collection.\nI mean, that’s how you cook up Greed.\nI stop another sword he swung with another hand by holding up my Fang Sabre, while making an obvious gap in defense.\nFufufu, I know you’re there. Luxeria.\nI know everything. Because right now… you’re on my territory.\nYoung. Young. Young. Young. Young Lust… Aaaaaaaah, how delicious it must be.\nI may not be able to endure it any longer.\n“Your main body… that magic looks quite delicious.”\nI surprise her, and in that gap, I used the tongue from the mouth I opened on my back to grasp her sword.\nIt’s a cold and delicious blade. The Greed Demon’s expression warps for a second.\n“Fufufu, the texture isn’t bad…”\nI move the tongue gaudily, and pull the sword from the girl’s arms.\nShe sure is powerless. You need to train your physical strength too.. fufu.\nThe Greed Demon swung another sword in panic, and I stopped it with a mouth I manifested on my hand, before crunching it.\nEverything was excellent.\nHigh battle experience. Status as a Demon. None of it even reached my feet.\nThe moment I broke one of the Greed Demon’s collection, he was wide open.\nThis is why Demons these days are… have I started sounding old again?\nI used my tongue to collect up the fragments of the sword I caught, and continued to chew it.\nGreed raises a scream. Don’t worry, your prided sword is extremely tasty.\nNo, is it about time yet?\nAs expected, the Greed Demon stopped moving, but when I extended my tongue at him, it was blown away with amazing force.\nWhat!? What is it, all of a sudden?\nA boorish Bastard Sword crashes into the ground.\nAs if it had exploded, pebbles fly everywhere. Continuing on with strange movements, the blade came at my tongue and tentacles with tremendous momentum, and blew them away altogether.\n“… What are you?”\nIt was a lead-colored skeleton. Its height was around two meters. Without any sign of emotions, or any presence, it simply boorishly continued to swing its arms.\nBut its physical strength far surpassed that Greed Demon.\nIt was just too incomprehensible. It’s no Demon. It doesn’t give off a Demon’s scent.\nI take a last lick of Celeste, and let go. No matter how weak the opponent, I’ve resolved never to be careless.\n“… What could that be… it’s not a Demon, it has no presence.”\n“Ki ki ki, it’s just a candlestick holder, you know! Boss’s just put a little spell on it!”\nThe skeleton kicks off the ground, and rushes at me like a beast.\nIt swings the giant sword taller than my body.\nIt’s definitely fast, and it has power, but still, its attacks aren’t that significant to me. I can see through them, and if I just challenge its sword head on, I’m pretty sure I can overpower it.\nI was surprised because the scent it gave off wasn’t that of a lifeform, but that’s about it.\nStill, this one… doesn’t look tasty at all, does it.\nCandlestand? That thing that holds up candles? Why can something like that move?\n“… Doesn’t look very tasty. Though I look like this, I’m quite a gourmet.”\nI parry the blade, and sever one of its arms.\nThere’s no change in its expression. Does it not feel pain? And wait, in the first place, is it even alive?\nWell, I guess none of that really matters.\nIn the previous exchange, I understood. Greed-kun and Lust-kun are definitely strong, and Candlestand-kun isn’t bad, but they’re no match for me.\nCeleste is their only means of dealing Damage to me, and I doubt they have a trump card greater than that. For a mere General to aim to annihilate a High Class Demon Lord, it’s an outrageous weapon. It’s plenty.\nI took some distance. It’s about time to get down to cooking.\nI activate one of my Demon Lord skills, 『Evil Eye』.\nIt’s a set of Demon Eyes that can bind the movements of Demons lesser than me. There’s the restriction that I can’t move either, but as a skill, it has plenty of uses.\nAnd like that, I started up a Gluttony Skill.\n『Over Table』\nI eat the magic floating around in the air.\nFrom all over my body, even my face and feet, an amount of tentacles incomparable to those before sprouted out.\nCountless feelers dripping in purple liquid.\nThey’re fresh arms that have plenty of appetite in them. Fufu, can you guys withstand them?\nAs a parting gift, I’ll explain the cooking method, as I extend my tentacles to their targets.\nIt’ll be troublesome if they think of them the same as those before.\nFufufu, this is… not Demon class. It’s a Demon Lord class Skill.\nLust and Greed dodge, and skeleton tries to take it with his sword, falling to pieces as a result.\nIn order to get a greater certainty of the taste, I pull it in with the tentacles, and chewed it with my normal mouth, but as I thought, it’s just an inanimate 『item』. Without any careful construction, just an object. It isn’t really tasty.\nBut it seems it was one of Greed-kun’s collection, so he raises quite a nice scream.\nFufu, it looks like I’ve finished one step in the cooking process.\n“Dammit, in order to get that, do you know just how much trouble I went through? How many Demons I killed…!?”\n“Fufufu, it looks like I did something inexcusable. Don’t worry, you’ll meet up in my stomach soon enough.”\nI extend my tentacles.\nOf course, I don’t do anything as boorish as hit the main dish directly.\nI snack on the other demons, while aiming for Greed-kun’s weapons, and Lust-kun’s equipment bit by bit.\nThe young tentacles are much faster than normal ones. Greed-kun is dodging them in a fine manner, but the hurdle’s too high for our precious Lust-kun, and the skin she covered up so well is showing more and more, and there was quite a bit of fun in that.\nHer eyes filled with killing intent are beautiful. Even as a fellow woman, I may develop some passion for her.\n“What are you planning…”\n“Fufufu, do you go as far as to crunch the shell when eating?”\nI swing the tentacles.\nFufufu, sorry, sorry, I had made a misunderstanding.\nAs a gourmet, let me acknowledge you. You definitely are a Luxelia. And a first-rate one at that.\nThe finest dessert. I’ll teach you true pleasure.\nCeleste is hard. But even if it may be a Demon Blade, if it keeps clashing with my power, it’ll be reduced to shambles.\nHe probably ran out of stock a while ago. Greed-kun is now just swinging around Celeste alone.\nFrom here on out, it becomes monotonous work.\nBut that’s fine. It’s a crucial process.\nI incessantly pester Greed-kun. I strip Lust-kun bit by bit.\nThings like this increase one’s appetite. There’s nothing tastier than the food I make for myself.\nBy the time Lust-kun had achieved her birthday suit, the two of them started discussing something.\nI stop my hands for a bit, and watch them. Do they still have some hand they can play?\nMy army’s been crushed too. If I don’t make you tasty enough for their share as well, I’ll be troubled.\nIf they’re going at it, you might as well show me everything you’ve got. I’ll bet that will increase the flavor.\nAfter coming this far, you’re still embarrassed? As she hides her breasts and crotch with her hands, Lust-kun and Greed-kun have somewhat grim faces as they speak.\nStill… to think something like that is fine in the presence of an enemy, they sure are young. How long ago was it that I did something like that…\nAs I was probing through a few thousand years of distant memory, I noticed is.\nMy own wind was blown away by another’s.\nThe few kilometers of territory I took were immediately reverted, and taken by another Demon Lord.\nIt was merely a quiet, tasteless, and dreadfully peaceful magic, as if it was just there to exist, and nothing else.\nAt the same time, something equivalent replaced my power that had been seeping into the earth.\nHow can this be… why, at this point in time…\n“… Oy, oy, what did you guys do? Is this part of your plan?”\nThere’s no way that’s the case. At this point, the revival of their Zone wouldn’t overturn their certain defeat.\nThe difference between us isn’t one of that low level.\nBut in an instant, none of that mattered anymore.\nWhat was in front of my eyes, wasn’t Lust-kun or Greed-kun.\nAs if I had been hit by lightning, I felt it in my soul.\nThe presence of a being great enough to rival mine self. An existence of darkness.\nA sense of exaltation that made it feel like just by him standing, something amazing would happen. The feeling of an absolute existence, where even if you added together Lust-kun and Greed-kun, it wouldn’t reach anywhere near it.\nI see… I’m really lucky. It seems even the Big Boss will come out to meet me.\nRight now, I’m in exceedingly good condition. If I eat Lust-kun and Greed-kun, I’ll probably rise even higher, but I don’t have the time to be worrying about those two.\nI’m not sure by what intent, but the black-haired slim youth, with a sluggish expression on his face, threw himself onto the ground.\nHis absurd movements have earned my admiration.\nThis one is…\nOne of those in service to the Greatest Demon King.\nA Lord of Demons, who rules over Indolence, and Depravity.\n“… You. Who are you?”\nOn my question, the Demon Lord spoke with a lazy look on his face.\n“… I see.”",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Gula, Part 4: Thanks for the Meal\n“Fufufufufu, I see… so this was you guys’ secret plan. You’re not bad. I didn’t notice it at all.”\n“… Eh? Ah, no…”\nLust-kun has a confused expression as she looks at the horizontal King of Sloth.\nHer facial expression is no lie. Eh? A Coincidence? Nono, that can’t be…\nIt’s impossible that the Lord of Laziness was just randomly passing by of all things.\nBut both Lust-kun and Greed-kun’s eyes were lost at sea.\n“Why am I…”\n“… Eh? You’re still saying that at this point in time!?”\nThe existence that had materialized at roughly the same time as Laigie, a girl with crimson hair, scowled with all her might.\nHer uniform, with black as the base, was the same as what Mizna and the others wore. She’s from the Order of Black.\nShe pulls at Leigie, and is somehow trying to get him to stand. This situation perfectly matches the image I have of him being pulled around at one of the Great Demon King’s inauguration ceremonies or another.\n… I see, so she dragged the Lord of Sloth onto the battlefield. What a skilled Ira.\nIt seems I really have been wasteful. Mizna… I should have cooked you up properly before I ate you. Sorry.\nBut even while being pulled at, Leigie shows no signs of getting up. He’s shaking his head from side to side with an extremely reluctant attitude. This deed is Sloth, without a doubt. It’s as if there’s no spirit in his eyes.\nI can only think that he’s waiting for me to eat him. At the same time, that is the nature of Sloth Demons.\nThose guys are extremely hard, but at the same time, they don’t really move.\nFufufu, how interesting. It really is interesting. To try to fight me like that…\nIn the wake of a battle between powerful Demon Lords, my fighting spirit blazes up, along with my hunger.\nI guess I should give a proper greeting to start things off.\n“Lord of Sloth. It’s a pleasure to meet you… No, it’s been a while. My name is Zebul Glaucus… a Demon Lord that governs Gluttony.”\n“I see.”\nOn my self-introduction, Leigie answered with just as little interest as before. What’s more, just two words.\nBut I can’t be fooled by his appearance or actions.\nLeigie’s Zone is definitely stronger than mine.\nHe’s just lazy, and by no means is he weak. Even after he’s clearly showing a ridiculous amount of magic, for some reason, my appetite isn’t welling up. In a sense, I think Gluttony has a bad affinity with him.\n“Leigie-sama! You finally came all the way here, so go fight already!”\n“… But that one’s…. strong…”\nOn Wrath-kun’s words, Leigie directed a reluctant face that stemmed from the very depths of his heart.\nWrath-kun’s expression is dyed with anger, and despair. Her burning hot magic is like a perfume that tickles my nostrils. It’s a really tasty scent.\nFufufufufufu, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, could it be that even when he’s taking meon, he thinks he can easily destroy me?\n“I think you’re underestimating me too much, Leigie.”\n“Yeah… Curry isn’t enough for this…”\nAlong with some incomprehensibly idiotic lines, the battle started without warning.\nAs a test, I sent my young arms to attack him from all direction. I saved a single one of them and sent it at Wrath-kun.\nEven though he’s complaining, Leigie probably hasn’t let his guard down. Wrath-kun back steps to avoid the tentacle, before emitting flame from the palm of her hand.\nThe Tentacle drinks up the flame, but it’s unable to contain it all. The tip is slightly burned. That’s quite a powerful bearer of Ira.\nBut that was quite a splendid taste… I vomited.\n“Uoo, GUEEEEEEEEH!”\nI kneel, call back my tentacles, and press both of my arms to the ground.\nIt felt as if, dreadful vigor, my stomach was dumping all of its contents left and right.\nMy head is shaken up greatly, as it’s filled with an acrid stench. The convulsions of my body won’t stop. While it felt like that, nothing actually left my mouth, though.\nHaving felt strong agony for once in a long time, tears filled my eyes.\nW-what is this!?\nWith vision made hazy be tears, I look over.\nWhat sort of disgrace am I showing in battle? But on the enemy side, none of them seem to know what’s going on either. After I had suddenly tried spitting something up, they merely looked at me with suspicious eyes. They’re not even launching any attacks.\nIn a blurring world, I looked at the one who, contrary to the swift Wrath-kun, hadn’t moved a muscle. He also had tears oozing out as he spoke.\n“… It hurts.”\nLooking closely, in all the places the tentacles should have impaled, his clothing was torn. From the skin I can see in the gaps, a small amount of blood drips.\nSo this is the extremes of 『Acedia』, said to excel in endurance.\nThe King of Sloth… how hard…\nAn overwhelming VIT incomparable to the General Class Sloth I defeated long ago. Even for the arms that could easily devour Demon Blades, they aren’t nearly strong enough.\nGufu… fufufu, i-interesting, isn’t it…!!\nI wipe away my tears, and use the Evil Eyes. Excluding Leigie, the rest of the Demons are bound. As I might add, Leigie isn’t moving either, but that’s of his own free will.\nI somehow contain the nauseous feeling, but the instant I tried to use a skill, I noticed a terrifyingly bitter scent piercing my nose. Of the Sloth Demons I fought in the past, the impact far surpassed all. It was a heinous scent that I couldn’t believe originated in this world.\nI had been so concentrated on the violent nausea, and I hadn’t noticed it at all…\nWhen I check my Magic, I see a small portion of it has restored.\nIt’s too much to have just been from eating Wrath-kun’s flames back there.\nI’m in despair. Is there no god in this world!?\nMy trauma was overwritten here and now.\nI glare at Leigie. I wiped my mouth with my sleeve, and offered a complaint.\n“… You, you taste atrocious… I can’t even believe this taste comes from this world.”\n“… It hurts.”\nWith sluggish motions, Leigie rubbed the torn spots. The blood has already vanished. And wait, even if he was bleeding, that wasn’t a level where he actually took any damage from it!!\nWrath-kun is looking at Leigie with despair in her eyes, but I should be the one despairing.\nThis is bad. Just what is that flavor…\nThe General Class Sloth doesn’t reach his footholds, it’s a flavor that blasphamizes against, and desecrates the very concept of food.\nIt really is out of this world. Just what divine providence gave birth to something like that? Up until now, I thought that any and every item in this vast world was edible, but I must take that back with all due haste. It’s a taste that even changes my outlook on life.\nIt’s far surpassed what can be endured. I don’t ever want to taste it again\n… Which means I’ll be unable to absorb power from Leigie.\nIf I tried to bear it, and suck it up, I would probably curl up and die before I could do anything to him.\nHahaha, what meaning is there in a Gula that cannot eat!!\nAll in all, what an annoying attribute.\nWith eyes blurred by tears, Leigie spoke up all of a sudden.\n“I give up.”\n“Hah? Why?”\n“I hate pain.”\n“Haaaaaaaaaaah?”\nJ-just how did this one become a Demon Lord… no, how did he survive for this long?\nIn a sense, his words were more impactful than the taste, and my mind went blank for a moment.\nThe moment I came to it, I noticed Leigie had fired off a strange power, a Skill. It was nullified by one of my passives, my Mental Pollution Resistance. Leigie’s expression hopelessly screams out, ‘this is a pain’ as he clicks his tongue.\nMy hunger becomes bloodlust, and stirs up wind as it sweeps over the desert.\n… Fu. Fu. Fu. You sure are looking down on me. To launch a surprise attack when I was negligent, that’s a disgrace to all Demons…\nSo be it. Kanon can go to hell for all I care. I’ll put my best effort into killing you. In this world, there shouldn’t exist anything that can’t be eaten.\nA majority of Gula Skills focus on eating the enemy.\nIf you exclude them, my usable skills are quite limited.\nI clench my hand with plenty of power, and wish for fang. Fangs to gnaw and reduce everything to its base.\nLeigie, with movements slower than the laziest of people, with an expression harder to read than the slothiest of sloths, searched through his pocket, before his arm lost power, and his hand fell to the ground.\n“… I forgot my piece… do you happen to have one? It can be Chess or anything…”\n“Hah? Chess? T-there’s no way I have something like that!”\nWrath-kun has an irritated expression as she rebukes him.\nAny and everything they’re doing. I can only see it as them making light of me.\nAh, it’s no good.\nFine, I’ll destroy you.\nI’ll show you the limits of Gluttony.\nDon’t think Gula is nothing but eating.\nI consume an amount of magic much greater than when I summoned the young arms, and my hunger has become almost unbearable.\nSo much that it feels like my stomach will gain its own will, and start to eat me.\nAnd I used that skill for the first time in ten thousand years.\n『Fang of Origin』\nCompletely ignoring the enemy’s attribute to eat any and everything, a Gula Skill that manifests the fangs of a Demon God.\nIt’s not like it changes my flesh, and it’s not like it summons something for me to manipulate. Pure equipment, it calls forth a sword. One of the skills known as Phantasm Armaments.\nThe blade of darkness, born of the origin of Gluttony came into being with my fingers wrapped wround it.\nA longsword with the hilt and blade and all else colored black. Its height a meter and a half.\nBut the reach doesn’t matter. This is my fang, and at the same time, an existence representing the insatiable hunger of the world.\nI discard the blade I had used when fighting that Greed-kun. With both hands, I take a stance with the long sword. I absorb back all the tentacles.\nFoolish Sloth that fails to make a single move, I glare at the Sloth who fails to feed my appetite.\n“… Fu… fufu… then let’s start the battle between Demon Lords.”\n“… Haa…”\nLeigie lets out a sigh.\nDamn you… making fun of me!\nI take a step forward. Using the physical strength of a Demon Lord, I explosively propel myself, and instantly closed the distance…\nMy body stiffens all at once. Within my head, a Mental Pollution Recovery Spell activates automatically, and the stiffness is dispelled, but in that time, everything became so slow.\nI feel heavy. Unable to bear the large burden that had suddenly been placed on top of me, I fell to my knees.\nPressure? No, this is definitely something different. My weight has physically increased.\nI can’t continue while gripping the sword.\nFrom the time he had appeared, Leigie had barely moved half a step, but he directed dispirited eyes at me as I fell to the ground.\n“You… what did you do…”\n“… Haa…”\nLeigie sighs once more.\nNo, I get it. I’ve been hit with a Sloth Skill before.\nSloth should have some skills that obstruct an enemy’s movements.\nBut… a skill great enough to bind me? That can’t be!\n“Gu… wai, Leigie-sama…”\n“Fu… ya…”\n“Gugu… B-boss!?”\nThe other three raise their own cries.\nI somehow turn my unmoving head, and see that, for some reason, Leigie’s army was on the ground as well.\nThis one… he calmly drags in his own army.\nNo, that’s wrong.\nIn a moment’ judgement, I extend my tentacles, and use them to support up my body.\nAnd finally up, I looked down at the Lord of Sloth. In his eyes, forget bloodlust, there isn’t even any fighting spirit.\nThis is… not just any obstruction skill. He’s raising gravity.\nI comprehend. I’m experiencing it first-hand. Leigie of Sloth. There’s probably a matter of affinity, but this one’s power… he’s surpassed mine.\nWith my shaking hand, I lift the sword, and point it at him.\nJust how many kilos, how many tons has it been increased by? Why is it that when there’s a weight where even I cannot move, his own army isn’t crushed to death?\nI’m going to lose to a Lord that doesn’t even have the will to fight?\n“… Fu fu fu. It’s been a while… since someone last got me to kneel.”\n“I see.”\nLeigie offers his fifty cents.\nAt the same time, I experienced a sudden impact from the side.\nWhat? What’s happening now?\nSince he didn’t have any fighting or killing intent, my reaction was delayed.\nA power great enough to rattle my entire body. My form, which was barely being supported by the tentacles, was easily blown off.\nMy field of vision shakes. But the dizziness soon disappears from a Demon Lord Level status abnormality resistance.\nThere wasn’t the slightest sign of a presence by me. Leigie didn’t move a single step either.\nI dug the sword into the ground, which was moving by me at an incredible speed. I extend more than a hundred tentacles, and dig them in as well.\nI feel myself scraping at the ground. The friction heats up the tips of the tentacles, and smoke begins to rise from the earth.\nIt was a physical attack. I didn’t receive much damage. But I cannot understand what had happened.\nA failure to comprehend is one of the scariest things that can befall you on a battlefield.\nPerhaps because we were now separated by a few hundred meters, the weight on my body disappeared.\nI have a chance!\nDemons are by no means omnipotent.\nSloth is a Skill Tree that excels in endurance. If you look at it from the other side, they don’t boast particularly high offensive power.\nEven when taking me by surprise, he didn’t manage to give me any significant damage.\nIt’s not sating my hunger, but other emotions start coming up.\nInteresting. How many millennia has it been since I fought an opponent of equal level to me?\nMy hundred tentacles dig into the ground behind me.\nI hold the sword in a low stance, and concentrate magic on my feet to enhance them.\nGravity too great to stand? Then I’ll take you out in a single stroke before it affects me.\nLeigie is definitely hard, but if I split him in two, he won’t be able to use a Skill.\nWhen I took a step forwards, alarms went off in my head.\nThe foreboding signal affected the entirety of my trained instincts as a warrior. I hurriedly jumped to the side, before a thunderous sound came from the place I had been, and a large dent appeared in the ground.\nI can’t see. I can’t see it, but… something’s there.\nFrightening speed, and weight.\nI comprehend. This is what sent me flying before.\nI detect it coming at me from the side with the flow of the air, and jump to avoid it. The weakness that you can’t move in the air doesn’t exist for me, when I have countless tentacles to propel myself. I suddenly changed course, and extended the tentacles to hit down whatever it was.\nThe tentacles dig into something invisible, and I started vomiting in midair.\nMy movements stop completely. In my direction, it comes down.\n“Guoee… gu… wai… unfai…”\nNot a small blow like before, as if the sky itself was coming down, an impact mercilessly crushed my body.\nMy skull makes some creaking sounds, and the hand I had reached upwards by instinct is making ominous cracking sounds as it bends in the wrong direction.\nIt’s not at a level where I can ignore the impact like before, I’m pressed into the ground so hard it feels my soul will go out.\nBut right now, the pain doesn’t matter. This bitterness is terrifying. While crawling on the ground, I let out tears as I vomit, but that thing continues to come down on me relentlessly.\nIts scope is even wider than before.\nWave of Starvation?\nFleeting Requiem?\nDon’t be stupid… if I used something like that, I would end up eating it. I’d be forced to absorb it.\nThat taste that comes from something beyond this world.\nPast the Demon World, a place even lower. The greatest depths of hell, a place where nothing can escape, in hades where all unthinkable things gather, where the tainted mud of despair builds up, this taste is that of a being a Demon cannot fathom as another Demon…\nThe impact comes down a second and third time without rest, beating down on my body, and hitting me into the ground. My consciousness leaves me for a moment. My vision shakes, and my Status Abnormality Resistances are working on overtime. If I didn’t have them, I would have been immobilized by the dizzy feeling long ago.\nDamn, with that absent-minded expression, he shows no mercy.\nEach one of the skills he’s using falls short of the one-hit-kill ones Demon Lords usually boast, but that just makes it all the more annoying. As if he’s playing with me, the impact that’s identity I have yet to know continues to assail my body, and the taste is the same as Leigie, making It my greatest enemy of all time. That much is true.\nThe Leigie in question hasn’t changed his location at all.\nHe’s making fun of me.\nI anticipate the moment it’s going to strike next, pierce my tentacles into the ground, and forcefully throw myself sideways. It’s not strong. Its damage definitely isn’t that high, but taking that on again and again is bad.\nI forcefully set my broken arm. Using up my stored up nutrients, I’m able to fully recover it.\nBut without relishing in that, I kicked the ground.\nThe impact hit the place I was just before.\nLet’s think.\nWhat is… this Skill?\nA homing attack Skill? Wind? Unattributed Energy?\nEach and every one of a Demon’s Skills have meaning. Naturally, they change based on a Demon’s cravings.\nJust as Gluttony is specialized in eating others, Sloth should have some specializations.\nWhat is it?\nMaking other people fellow Sloths? Wrong. No, maybe it’s not too far off, but that isn’t its basic nature.\nFar in that direction, I see Leigie lazily lowering his hand onto the ground.\nThat’s it!\nA Skill to… transmit attacks across distance.\nMeaning an 『Acedia』 skill to repel foreign enemies without moving.\nI dodge the wide-range attack that came on me from above. In the ground, was a large hand print, five meters from one end to the next.\nWhat a stupid skill. But it’s a fact that I was made a sport of by that worthless skill.\nI keep my eyes concentrated on Leigie’s hand movements, and I rush forward. The second it starts to come down, I take a large leap to the side.\nI try to capture the lowered fist with my sword. The invisible hand is easily ripped through, but it doesn’t seem that Leigie took any damage from it. Even if I damage these hands, he doesn’t get any feedback… It doesn’t have the power to finish me off, but it doesn’t have any obvious demerits either. Just the fact that he can’t use his arms for other things, I guess. What a useful Skill.\nI handle the attack aimed at me horizontally with the sword. Invisible fingers… With just that, magic surpassing that of a General’s disperses and floats through the air. It truly is a pity I cannot eat it.\n… No, is this the time to think about whether it’s edible or not?\nI have to attain victory against Kanon-sama no matter what. I have a need to triumph, and confirm her taste. For the sake of my departed men as well.\nFor that sake, the explosive magic Leigie has will be a great weapon.\nI’m sure of it. If you only compare magic, he’s far above me.\nDamn, how long has this bastard been alive?\nBut if I keep eating him, I’ll definitely die. I’ll break down from the terrible flavor, and die. As a Demon Lord of Gluttony, that is quite regrettable.\nBut… but if it’s just once more…!\nRight. Resolve myself. That is the way to victory.\nTerrible? So what?\nThe remnants of the violent acridity in my nose is still trampling over my sanity.\nGood or bad, that doesn’t matter.\nMake my resolve, and look at the enemy.\nFor my sake and mine alone. For my power and mine alone. Leigie, I’ll…\n“… Eat you.”\n“… Please give me a break already.”\nThere are no breaks on the…\nThe moment I got irritated by his mocking voice, my body was sent flying sideways.\nHis attacks really lack any form of motivation.\nJust as I eat, as Wrath rages, and Greed seeks, Leigie simply lazes around without meaning.\nThat really doesn’t excite my appetite at all, but what admirable consistency.\nThe Lord of Sloth… I see, I have a slight grasp of it.\nDiverse skills that can toss around even a Demon Lord like me.\nThis is one who dived into the abyss of Acedia, and learned it to its origins?\n… So be it. In return I’ll show you. The result of my supreme pursuit of Gula, the power I’ve obtained.\nI use the Evil Eyes. I direct it at Leigie’s attack, and easily stop it.\nI use my Wave of Starvation to absorb the flames of Wrath that came from the one trying to ambush me from behind. I’m not so weak as to fall from a surprise attack of one who isn’t even a Demon Lord.\nThe first edible magic in a while wipes away the remains of the bitterness within my body.\nI don’t care about the damage. Wrath-kun and Lust-kun and Greed-kun don’t matter to me at the moment.\nI concentrate my mind.\nI bring up my left arm, and pray. To the god of hungry souls.\nWind pressure assails me from left and right. With a groaning sound, my ribs break. My brain understands that I’m being crushed between that man’s hands.\nI don’t let go of the sword gripped in my right hand. That’s my trump card. My arm breaks. I don’t let go. My innate healing works. My body returns to normal. Every time it recovers, it’s broken once more.\nLeigie closes his hand. From all around my body, I feel an immense weight. My bones are being broken as if they were toothpicks. My body raises a scream at the sense of pain I haven’t felt in a long time.\nI can’t use any defensive skills. They’ll end up eating Leigie.\nIn the heat encroaching my body, and the surges of pain, I took a deep breath, and prepared myself.\nI fill my fangs with killing intent. I use all my might to activate that skill.\n『Eater’s Plate』\nWith a roaring sound, the ground tears, the desert rends. Against the immense magic, of which a normal person of the human race wouldn’t hold up just be being in its presence, the heavens rumble, and space distorts.\nIn hot haste, Lust-kun and Greed-kun flee. The Demon Lord sat through the maelstrom peacefully. No, he’s lying down.\nWhat I called forth was Eaters Plate.\nA large space a few hundred meters across. Without fangs, or tongue, endless hunger. A space specialized to do nothing but sate an unbearable starvation. If you looked from the sky, you would probably see a large semi-circular fissure in the earth.\nAnd I was taken aback.\nInto the hole that suddenly opened in the ground, the one I set as the target, Leigie, calmly fell. He yawned with a sleepy expression.\nSloth has a bad affinity with Wrath, Gluttony and Pride. Demons with a high attack power. The reason for this being they generally don’t move around. There’s no way an immobile Demon is a good enemy. You can leisurely prepare your skills, and as long as they don’t get to be considerably strong, they’re fated to be hunted down.\nBut even so, this conclusion is outside of my expectations.\nEh? What? Is that how it is?\nFor what reason did I fight so hard up until this point?\nI was planning to rip him to shreds with the sword once he jumped out of the way to dodge, but…\nI turn my eyes to the black longsword in my hand. Phantom Armaments don’t have a set reach. By my will, I can freely extend it up to a point. When I got a chance, it was to be my supreme trump card.\nThe giant mouth closes.\nI relax the power wrapped around my body, and release myself.\nWith my right hand, I scratch my face.\n“… That was a bit anti-climactic.”\n“… I see.”\nI heard something I shouldn’t have from behind me.\nI hurriedly turn around, and point my sword. An uninjured Leigie was sloppily sprawled out.\nEven after taking my back, he shows no signs of trying to accomplish anything.\nWai…\nI instinctively swing the blade. I don’t even have to extent it, he’s quite close. With a posture like that, this isn’t something that he can dodge. But the moment before he was split in two, Leigie’s image disappeared.\nShivers run down my spine.\nSo this is how he escaped the Eater’s Plate!?\n… Teleportation!? IS that even possible? No, the moment he had suddenly appeared like that, I should have theorized it.\nIt’s my complete mistake.\nEvasion and Sloth were too far apart for me to ever think they would go together.\nAnd wait, this is too unfair.\nThis can’t be. This can’t be. This can’t be. This can’t be!\nBetween Rank Three and Five, there’s this much of a difference!?\nDid Kanon-sama put this much thought into it when she sent Leigie against me!?\nI position the sword behind me to shake off the attack he threw at me.\nBehind, the transferred Leigie’s arm grazed the blade. Blood poured forth like a water fountain. Due to the smell that came from it, I retreated several steps.\nLeigie is crying. Probably from the pain. But by that time, the blood had already stopped, and he had regenerated as if nothing had happened. What amazing regenerative powers. He’s devoted himself to a stubborn nature. And on top of that, he’s ridiculously weak to pain.\nWhen I tried to go at him again, my body froze once more.\nI was seized by his gravity again. I notice. The moment my body freezes beforehand… it’s his Evil Eyes.\nLeigie is binding me with his Demon Eyes. The Skill that’s supposed to only work on lesser beings.\nThat made the gap in power all too clear.\n“Ah, haha, hahaha… Lei… gie. Just how many years… have you lived?”\n“… Probably about a hundred.”\nLike hell!\nI have, with you, memories that spam over ten thousand years!!\nHe’s… definitely forgotten it.\nHahahahaha, just fighting him is starting to feel stupid.\nEven my hunger that I know will never fully be sated no matter how much I eat is starting to not matter.\nWithout saying anything, Leigie closed his eyes half-way.\nI tried to think of a reason this Demon Lord had obtained such peerless power.\nUnlike Kanon-sama, who had advanced to being a Demon Lord in under ten thousand years with skill and determination, Leigie the Sloth merely amassed power naturally after living an eternal amount of time, and eventually grew to be a Demon Lord.\nWithout anything that could be called ambition, and no goal in sight. The king of idleness.\nThe desires of others are of no importance, and he’ll probably forget his fight with me soon enough. How envious I am of him.\nBefore I noticed it, Leigie’s hand was clenched so tightly that his knuckles were turning white.\nMy body was being squeezed from all directions. I feel something snapping inside of me, but there’s no pain anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to resist. There’s no means. I have no appetite.\nThe result of me living close to a hundred thousand years, my 『Fang of Origin』 turns to sand in my hand, and disappears.\nIn front of my eyes, there was Sloth. He opens his eyes lightly. His eyes that did nothing but scream that it was all a pain.\n“…Fu… fufu. Bye… bye, Acedia. It was fun.”\n“… I see.”\nIf possible, I would ask him to go beat Kanon-sama in my place, but I doubt he would ever do something so troublesome.\nIn the opening on the top of his clenched hand, he painstakingly applied pressure with his other index finger.\nAs my head was forcefully crushed under the power, I thought to myself…\nThanks for the meal.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Invidia, Part 1: Become Someone\nIt was nothing.\nFrom birth, not once have I gained anything, never have I desired anything, never have I known anything.\nNot desired by anyone, known by anyone, and even without any desire for life.\nA Life where I didn’t even embrace the Original Sin a majority of Demons carry.\nSloth and Greed and Lust and Wrath and Gluttony and Pride and all else, without a sufficient reason for life, and no will.\nBefore I could become a Plus, perhaps I had to become a Zero first.\nI am a mere Minus existence.\nIn this Demon World, governed by survival of the fittest, Demons without knowledge or power are fated to simply sit and wait for death to take them.\nDemons like that were by no means rare, and the imperial capital as well as all the provincial cities were overflowing with such existences.\nThat’s why I believe it’s just a coincidence that I escaped such a fate.\nThere are many Demons whose lives aren’t even worth taking, but if I had to say, my luck was good.\nThere was a man who took me away. There was man who, with a sluggish expression, remained silent, as he let whatever would happen, happen. His black mantle made of well-tailored velvet-like material dragged along the ground, and was always sullied white.\nThere was a woman who took me away. There was a woman who would let off burning flames that made people she passed on the street tremble, and trampled over the ground as she walked. Her walking staff banged on the ground, as if to scream out its rage in the silent woman’s place.\nThere was me. There was me who, on the roadside, without will, without meaning, gazed on them by pure coincidence from the edge of the street. And next to me, there were my comrades who looked at them just the same.\nThe man and the woman, and me, and those beside me never exchanged glances, but at the moment of passing… the man reached out his left arm, and my body… without anything to eat before me, my body that was light and frail compared to those of similar ages… was embraced.\nLight and clear hand movements as if he were merely grabbing an apple off of a roadside stand.\nMy comrades didn’t say anything as they watched me get taken away, and I didn’t say anything either.\nFrom what I heard later, he wanted a pillow. What the hell.\nAnd like that, coincidences piled onto one another, and the Lord of Sloth just happened to be searching for a pillow perfectly my size. By some strange cause and effect, I ended up enlisted in the army of Leigie of the Slaughterdolls.\nBy the way, this goes without saying, but by the time he held me to his body, Leigie-sama was already asleep.\nWhat happened next wasn’t as interesting.\nAfter returning to the Castle of Shadows, I began a struggle for existence against the inanimate normal pillow he already had in use, and at the same time, the inspector monitoring Leigie-sama, the leader of the Order of Black, Kanon Iralaude said something like, “when did you pick up something so dirty!” in an exhausted voice. When I was about to be disposed of by incineration, I was saved by the maid Lorna, who misunderstood Leigie-sama’s 『Iyo』 in a way favorable to me.\nBy the time I noticed it, I was dressed up in the sort of pretty clothes a doll would wear, and had the ‘seconds’ that were always made for the million to one chance Leigie-sama would do something as troublesome as actually ask for seconds shoved down my throat. My thoughts finally caught up to me.\nHuh? What is this, I thought.\nA Demon’s longings aren’t something they decide for themselves. They are something that is automatically obtained from harboring strong desires.\nIf you harbor multiple Sins, your desire becomes clouded, and your Class growth as a Demon is slowed. That’s why Demons generally subconsciously regulate themselves not to follow any desires besides the ones they pursue.\nWithout the leisure to seek excess desire, the worst of Demons, where it was merely a miracle I was alive. Given an environment where life was finally sustainable, and finally with some time to give consideration to it, what was the first strong desire that came over me?\nWhat were my strongest feelings?\nIt was not relief that I was saved, or happy prayers of pure gratitude, or melancholy for my comrades left behind or even self-satisfaction.\nThis may seem obvious, but it definitely wasn’t Luxuria.\nTo put it simply… Envy.\nJealousy towards typical Demons who carried on and accepted their lives up until now as if it were natural.\nEnvy toward the beautiful face of the incarnation of flames who was approaching Demon Lord level with her powerful magic, the one who was born the daughter of a Demon Lord and lead the elite Order of Black, Kanon.\nEnvy towards the one who was born into a house to serve Leigie-sama, and who received a high level education for that sake alone, Lorna.\nEnvy towards the right hand man of the Lord of Sloth who headed the army, Overruled any and all sorts of power, and took his Lord’s power to be supreme, Heard Lauder.\nIt was envy towards everything in this world.\n“If possible, I want to change…”\nThat was the origin of my Original Sin of Envy.\nAs I was never granted anything, I felt jealousy towards everything instead.\nDarker than 『Gula』.\nMore greedy than 『Avaritia』.\nMore violent than 『Ira』.\nMore whimsical than 『Luxuria』.\nWith less meaning than 『Acedia』.\nNastier than 『Superbia』.\nIt was nothing but simple, unsightly 『Envy』.\nBut the moment I obtained it, I thought to myself.\nAh, with this, I finally have a reason to exist.\nWith this, I can finally become someone.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Invidia, Part 2: Let’s Meet Again\n“Well well, after sending out as much as two commanding officers, what a sorry state you’ve come back in… to bring trouble to Leigie-sama’s hands… how shameful.”\nThe young man spoke with cold eyes, as if he were looking at kitchen waste that had fallen to the ground.\nHe was a handsome youth with eyes as black as the depths of the abyss. As if he were a king, he sat deeply in his chair. With one leg crossed over the other, perhaps he lacked some decorum, but he really was the spitting image of a king. If Leigie-sama and this man stood side by side, ten out of ten would say this man was the Demon Lord of the two.\nAt the same time, he followed his desire, and spent his time perpetually training and bettering himself. A pure military man.\nHeard Lauder. Right hand of Sloth. A Demon governing Pride.\nMy head began to hurt.\nBut it definitely wasn’t due to anger towards this prideful man.\n“No, no… that Zebul Glaucus was a prominent and powerful Demon Lord among Kanon-sama’s followers… She was too much of an opponent to deal with without the presence of another Demon Lord.”\nThe one who committed the insolent act of pulling Leigie-sama out, Kanon’s dispatch, speaks in a rebuking tone.\nHer arrogant means did end up saving our lives, so I can’t say anything, but…\nFrom the innermost depths of my brain, I feel the pain of something being stabbed. To sooth it, I stroke my forehead once more.\nHeard answered her glare with a cynical smile. His words were, as always, overflowing with himself.\n“Hmm… that would be the case for a typical, lowly Demon, correct? What I am trying to say, is that for the ones who are supposed to be leading the great Lord of Acedia’s army, it is much too shameful, Lize Bloodcross.”\n“… Well you sure know how to talk big. Especially when you were the only General who didn’t participate in the battle.”\n“That’s right. I truly never thought the other two would be this useless. The next time a Demon Lord thinks of invading, let’s have me go out alone.”\nDespite his annoyed tone, he gave an immediate reply.\nThere is not a single hint of jest in Heard’s face. An army led by two Generals was easily laid waste to by a single Demon Lord, but in his eyes there is no impatience, no nervousness.\nNothing but elegance. More prideful than all.\nSuperbia Demons are strong.\nIn truth, it is said that of the Demons that reach Lord Class, around seventy percent are Pride.\nThe losers are worse that garbage, the winners equivalent to God. And one’s self has long surpassed God.\nThat is Superbia’s Original Sin. Strength in weakness, and weakness in the strong, a highly unstable nature. Even so, they are called the strongest of Demons.\nAll they ever demand for is the result, and the no matter what step of the process resulted in defeat, they’ll show contempt.\nAnd just like the other Sins’ cravings, the stronger they get, the greater their inclinations.\nOf the four surrounding the round table, the last one… having lost a majority of his possessions, and even his army, the greatest victim Deige inspected a beat up Celeste as he spoke up.\n“… Even so, Supreme Commander Heard, it’s just as that girl Lize’s saying. Zebul the Devourer stood top class among Demon Lords, and she had an impossibly large amount of power, you know? Even for someone as prideful as you, Supreme Commander, I’ll bet it would prove difficult to 『Overrule』 her.”\n“Hmm… by that, are you comparing to the Demon Lords you’ve served up until now?”\n“Ki ki ki, yeah. If you try to find an existence more powerful than that one… I can only think of Boss Leigie, and the Great Demon King.”\nHe responds with a bitter smile.\nThe words of an old Demon like Deige held some persuasive power.\nIn the first place, the Devourer Zebul Glaucus ranks right up in my top three for most atrocious Demon Lords I’ve met. Her magic, and skills, and direction made her an absolute warrior, where normal Demons would fail to even reach her feet. She’s a 『Gula』 so strong that I can’t even laugh off the rumors that she ate up the Heavenly Army in the war with the Heavens ten thousand years ago.\nIf only I had that much power…\nJust as sand accompanies time as it falls down the hourglass, I feel something like mud collecting in the depths of my soul.\nThe weight of it is making me dizzy.\nSince reaching General Class, I have never faced defeat once. This war was the first.\nBecause of my first failure in a long time, I cannot control my impulses.\n“Hmm, but I’ve heard our Lord annihilated her all too easily, did he not?”\n“Ki ki ki, well, all I can say is, as expected of Rank Three. Boss Leigie is… a monster. He led the Devouring Lord by the nose the entire battle. I mean, Boss… didn’t even move the whole time.”\nOn Deije’s words, that Demon Lord’s, and Leigie-sama’s fight play back in my head.\nYes, Leigie-sama never even stood up… though he did use some skill I’ve never seen before to teleport.\nHeard, with a knowing face… nodded with sharp, prideful eyes.\n“… Hmm, Sloth Skills get stronger the less one chooses to move… a very Leigie-sama-esque decision.”\n“No, I doubt that man was actually thinking about something like that…”\n“Would you be kind enough as to tell me what other skills our Head used, Deije?”\nHow could it be that Heard manages to preserve his pride?\nJust by being here, I can easily feel the vast magic power of Leigie, who should be in his private room a long ways away. This amount of power, and its quality is definitely at a stage impossible to reach by a Demon. For the General Class me… if I compare it to Deije and Heard who should be stronger than me, the difference is probably not something as small as ten or twenty fold.\n“Ki ki ki, even I don’t know all the specifics. I mean, even Libell got eaten up…”\n“… So Libell the Pursuer was eaten… I had my eyes on him, but… Hmm.”\nHeard closed his eyes, as if to say, ‘how useless’.\nHe isn’t one to grieve over death. Looking at those eyes, that expression, and that posture, Deije’s face doesn’t change.\nEven if Lize’s expression gets clouded over, the face of Deije, who lost his sworn friend Libell Aijens, doesn’t change.\nThis must be the strength of Deije, one who even survived the war with the Heavens.\n… Of his strength, I can’t help but be jealous.\nDeije says Heard Lauder is a dreadful Demon. I wonder if he’s looking at something invisible to my eyes.\nAmong us, I am the youngest Demon. Generally, the older Demons get, the more intense their cravings, and their strength. It’s said that Deije experienced the Heavenly War ten thousand years ago, and Heard Lauder is said to be an ancient Demon who was the first to ever follow Leigie-sama’s lead.\nFor me, who was just born a few thousand years ago, it’s not a gap in time I can make up for.\n… And of that, I can’t help but be jealous.\nI strongly grasp my shaking arm.\nWithout responding to Heard’s words, Deije returned Celeste to its scabbard, and inserted it into his treasury space. High level Demon Blades are alive. Trivial scratches and cracks will be autonomously regenerated.\n“What I saw was… a Skill to increase gravity, an instantaneous movement Skill… also an unidentified one he used to send Zebul flying.”\n“… Hmm… he held back quite a bit then.”\nOn Deije’s words, Heard knit his brows, and took a deep breath. That was a sort of emotion that would originally never appear on a Pride Demon’s face.\nHe sticks his elbow into the table, and touches his hand to his chin as if lost in a sea of thought. His form, even seen from afar, was so well built that it could be made into a painting as is.\nSkillfully folding his six arms, Deije asks with a tone full of doubt.\n“Holding back…?”\n“… Hm. The Leigie-sama I know’s power is not of such small caliber. In the first place, he didn’t even use his renowned『Slaughter Dolls』, did he not?”\n“Ki ki ki, that’s correct. But even if it’s Boss, I doubt a Doll’d do the trick. In actuality, the Doll he gave me was ripped apart and eaten.”\n“… Deije, don’t lump that Doll he gave you with the rest. Leigie-sama’s original Slaughter Doll is… supreme.”\nHeard laughs. At Deije. At Lize. At me.\nIt’s probably a fact that only he knows of, having served Leigie-sama for much more time than me.\nAnd Heard spoke up.\n“… Even more so than the individual.”\n“Hah… Having a Doll be stronger than the man himself is impossible, right?”\n“… Hm. For a normal Demon, that is.”\nThe Slaughter Doll Skill is one possessed by Demon Lords of Sloth, so there is barely any precident.\nBut even so, to be able to make an entity with powers surpassing a Demon Lord at will is outside the scope of common sense.\nLize’s face looked as if the word ‘Lies’ had been written on it as she looked at Heard with shock.\nHeard Lauder was an honest man. At the very least, while he was prideful, his power was real. He relied not just on skills, but on wisdom, and he definitely possessed true charisma. Otherwise, there was no way he would be able to lead the First Brigade which boasts the largest numbers.\n“Ki ki ki, if that’s true then it sure is amazing. I’d like another by all means. But, well, even if that’s the case… this time’s opponent was a Demon Lord on a level where she could even wound Boss, you know? I think it would be a bit much for a Doll without any Original Sin skills.”\nOn those words, Heard opened his eyes wide.\nHe leans his body forward, and glares at Deije with strong eyes. It was a manifestation of emotion great enough to shake one’s soul.\n“… That can’t be… Leigie-sama was injured… you say!?”\n“… Yeah. Well, it was only a little bit of blood, and he healed himself up fast enough.”\n“… That’s enough… I see, so she could injure Leigie the Depraved. Zebul the Devourer… Hm, I see…”\n“Was it truly that strange? No matter how strong a Demon Lord he may be, as long as the opponent’s one as well, he’ll get at least a scratch or two… I mean, soon after he brought me there, he started crying.”\nOn Lize’s inquiry, Heard sighed as he leaned back in his chair, before returning to his previous position. As if he was thinking deeply, his attention wandered around the air.\n“… Hm, that is a natural occurrence. But still, for one to be able to give Leigie of Sloth even the slightest scratch… it’s been two thousand years.”\n“Two thousand… so two thousand years ago, there was someone who could do it?”\n“Yeah… it was even someone you know quite well. But… that doesn’t matter.”\nAs if to declare the end of the conversation, Heard stood up.\nThe oppressing air emanating from his body… Superbia magic started to condense all at once.\nHis cold eyes lorded over me and Deije. World-eroding powers great enough to freeze over my body.\nOn the change in the atmosphere, Lize frowned, and after an obvious and blunt scowl, she stood as well. If this had been the moment after her dispatch, she definitely would have gone into a rage. She’s learned how to manage her anger as of late, and she rarely burns up rooms these days.\n“Wai…”\n“… Hm. There was no problem with the final result, but I’ll have you pay compensation for your shameful displays. The verdict will come down soon enough. Have fun waiting for it.”\n“Ki ki ki, please be gentle with me.”\n“… Hm.”\nWith a loud sound, he shuts the door behind him.\nThe air returns to normal, and Lize spoke in indignation. A crimson phosphorescence flickers around her red hair.\n“Wha, that man… no matter the case, to treat allied troops like that…”\n“Ki ki ki, Lize, you sure are young. A prideful commander is pretty much always like that. Rather, the fact that we weren’t executed on the spot… means that we’ve still got a bit of luck left in us.”\nDeije laughs as he stands.\nHe’s a Demon who’s lived a far longer life than me, and his words held a weight backed by experience.\nHis six eyes watch over me. The emotion held within them was something I was unable to understand.\n“Medea, I am… going to withdraw from this army.”\nIn a sense, his words were as I had expected.\nDespite his form, Deije’s a rational Demon. His cravings, his desire, by the very nature that they’re aimed at objects apart from humans, he’s much more trustworthy than many other Demons.\nPerhaps Lize didn’t anticipate it, because as she heard those words, she rose out of her seat once more.\n“Wha… Are you serious, Deije?”\n“Yeah… if I stay here, Supreme Commander Heard will dispose of me at this rate. Leigie of Sloth’s right hand man, prideful and conceited… Ki ki ki, how troublesome.”\n“How foolish… do you think that Supreme Commander would permit such a thing?”\n“Probably. I mean, my Sin is… not something I have to be here of all places to fulfill. I’m not sure about Girly and Heard, though.”\nAn instant decision. Good discernment.\nDeije’s words were straight to the point. An Avaratia’s cravings are something that can be fulfilled no matter what banner they fight under. With Deije’s caliber, no matter what Demon Lord he worked under, he would receive a favorable evaluation. He even has a Demon Blade that Zebul praised as dreadful.\nThe later part was also quite direct.\nMy desire is…『Invidia』 can only be fulfilled as long as I’m here.\nAs if my brain was wounded, my head started to hurt.\nDeije knows when to pull out. That’s exactly why he survived the war with the Heavens. His body that had been trained like steel, his rationality, thought pattern, desire. Ah, all of it… how enviable.\nIn the ki ki ki I was used to, he laughed.\nAnd he let out some words I had never thought of.\n“Ki ki ki, I’ll ask you as one who survived the Zebul War alongside me. Just in case. Girly, do you want to leave with me?”\n“What… that is…”\n“There isn’t just one page in the book of desire. Ki ki ki, girly, you’re young. Rather than being dealt with by Supreme Commander Heard, you should be able to lead a decent life…”\nLize looks over me and Deije in a panic. Disagreement and discord in a Demon Lord’s army fall under her type’s jurisdiction. I wonder if the Great Demon King’s Wrath will befall her. Even if it isn’t her fault individually, it’s not like a monster’s Wrath has direction. No she may be scarier than any monster.\n“… Let me persuade Heard Lauder. I cannot let the Great Demon Lord’s forces be diminished.”\n“Ki ki ki, I’m grateful for the sentiment, but some things are just impossible. Heard is… stronger than your Wrath. I mean, back when I was just an average run-of-the-mill Demon… he’s a Demon who’s lived since ancient times. The longer a Superbia lives, the more powerful their『Overrule』 gets.”\n“My orders are the orders of the Great Demon King, and my words are hers. Even so, will he fail to listen?”\n“How should I know?”\nDeije resigns.\n“… But… I have a bad premonition about it. Ki ki ki, it’s best if you don’t think of him as a normal Demon. This is… some advice from your elder.”\nI’m honestly thankful for his advice.\nHis words are probably true. If I am to stay here, then in the near future, I will be taken care of by Supreme Commander Heard.\nBut, still, even so… I have a reason I must remain. No, I should have one.\nI resolve my heart, and look at Deije clearly. While it may have been for a short time, he’s a soldier who was able to properly exchange blows with Zebul.\n“… Thank you. But my desire… can only be fulfilled here.”\n“… Ki ki ki, I thought you’d say that. Well, do your best. As a former Supreme Commander, for argument’s sake, I’m praying for your survival, girly.”\nAs if to offer a handshake, Deije presented his right center hand.\nIt was rugged, and wrapped in muscle. I don’t know just how much power he has. But from it, I can feel the accumulation of many years.\nOf that, I’m jealous. Of the building of time.\nIf you compare a Demon’s character to the passing of years, it doesn’t change all too much, however this man’s personality is much more likeable than Heard’s.\nFinally, as if he had suddenly remembered something, Deije asks…\n“Girly… come to mention it, there was something I wanted to ask. Do you know of a Demon Lord of『Luxuria』?”\n“… Yes. I’ve met one before.”\nSince the 『Luxuria』 Demon Lord was destroyed, it’s been over a thousand years.\nBut just from meeting her once, the intense Envy I felt for that Lord, makes me remember the scene as if it had happened just yesterday.\nDeije lets out a sigh unfitting of himself.\n“… As I thought, you lack sex appeal. There’s no way I can steal you away… is it? Well, I’m thankful for that good fortune.”\n“…”\n“Next time, treat me to something nice.”\nWith those words, I was sure of it.\nAh, this man… he realized it. That I wasn’t a『Luxuria』, but an『Invidia』.\nPerhaps it was natural for him to notice. Because before his eyes, I envied Celeste.\nBut I didn’t let out my words. I’ll bet he thought that our interests wouldn’t clash, but at the same time, perhaps this Demon of Greed was showing some kindness.\nNo, perhaps it was me that wanted it that way.\nAnd just as Deije said, I envied him.\nI became him.\n“Ki ki ki, Leigie of Sloth and Depravity… he sure was an interesting Demon Lord. And a terrifying one… I can’t even feel any ambition towards him. Well, next we meet, I’ll pray we’ll be allies.”\nYeah, exactly. I pray we never cross again.\nI looked straight at Deije.\n“… Right, let’s meet again, 『Avaritia』.”\n“Ki ki ki, seeya, 『Luxuria』.”",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Invidia, Part 3: I Want to Become You\nEven if reason permits it, feelings aren’t as forgiving.\nThat is the nature possessed by Demons.\nAs such, Heard despises because he is Superbia, and Leigie slacks because he is Acedia. Lize angers because she is Wrath, Deije seeks because he is Avaritia, and Zebul eats because she is Gluttony. There is nothing strange about it.\nLorna is Luxuria, so lusting after Leigie-sama wouldn’t be… strange.\nAnd because I am Invidia, I must envy.\nI put all my effort into biting down on my lip… the taste of blood spreads out in my mouth. I can feel the irritating smell in the depths of my nose.\nA scene I didn’t want to see, words I didn’t want to hear.\nMuch different from the vivid flames of Wrath, the muddy fire of『Envy』 licks the insides of my head.\n『Envy Vision』\nA Skill on the Envy Tree. The power to look up the movements of those I’ve envied. It isn’t just scenery, it’s even possible to hear their voices.\nAs if the scenes were rolling out before my eyes, my vision was clear, and my sense of hearing was filled with Lorna’s tender voice.\nIt’s not like I feel any carnal desires towards Leigie-sama, I’m simply jealous.\nOf Lorna, who lusts towards her own Lord.\nOf Deije who follows his desires, and continues to pursue it.\nOf Heard, who has enough overflowing confidence to even look down on the Lord of Gluttony.\nUp until now, I’ve only ever used Envy skills within my own room.\nMy front has always been 『Luxuria』.\nGifted with both intelligence and beauty, one who stands at the forefront of the army. A single woman who governs Lust.\nI once envied the Demon Lord of Lust, Lilith Luxeliahart, and the skills I got my hands on were well over the skills of most Lust Demons.\nAs such, I am… Medea Luxeliahart.\nMy form reflected in the full body mirror was died with the unsightly emotion of Envy, and tears of blood are flowing down my eyes.\nMy mind is painted black, a clear repulsive emotion.\nAs opposed to my feelings, I was favorably proceeding down the Envy Skill Tree.\n“Haa… haa…”\nEven though I haven’t moved a single step, my chest feels tight.\nThe breath I let out is hot, and damp.\nI try to recall Deije’s words.\nAs I thought, it’s no good. As long as I don’t carry out my envy here, I have no future.\nEven if I am to be killed by Heard Lauder…\nNone… can get in the way of my jealousy.\nIf he comes at me with the intentions of disposing me, I just have to beat him at his own game.\nThe Avaritia Skills I obtained by Envying Deije.\nThe Luxuria Skills I obtained by Envying Demon Lord of Lust, Lilith.\nThe Skills I obtained myself by pursuing Invidia.\nThe Gula Skills I obtained from Zebul’s crushed corpse.\nAs a General Class, the amount of power I can Envy far exceeds that of Deije’s right hand man Libell the Pursuer.\nBut that is of no importance to me.\nMy Envy is… what triggered it? The item that was the source of all of this has to be out there somewhere.\nI’m envious.\nI’m jealous.\nI want to… become you.\n『Leigie-sama, it’s time for your meal. 』\nWith a gentle expression, Lorna calls out to Leigie.\nShe’s an attendant who has served him for many years. She’s the maid who has the most contact with Leigie-sama, and at the same time, she’s the Demon who saved me.\nHer appearance, personality, skill, loyalty. Everything about her is envious.\n… If only you weren’t there, I would be the one in your place.\nAnd again, a black fever scorches in my head.\nHow, why, in just one step will what I desire fall into my hands?\nWho is at fault? What is at fault?\nIf only I had been able to handle Zebul, if only I racked up some achievements, my daily life should have continued on as it always had, and yet…\nBut right now, what I have the least of is time. Heard will try to kill me without a doubt. That’s the type of Demon he is.\nBy just envying from afar, I won’t make it in time. My life will lose its meaning. I’ll lose everything.\nThe feelings I’ve tried so hard to restrain up until now have surpassed the extent where I can hold them back with my power.\nMy arms, my legs, even when it isn’t cold, they’re shaking.\n『Leigie-sama, your hair is disheveled.』\n『… I see.』\nHe was always burrowed into his bed, so there’s no way it could be in line.\nIn a tone as if it were just a pretext, Lorna touches Leigie-sama’s jet-black hair. His eyes remain closed, and he doesn’t say a word.\nThe moment she touched it, I saw Lorna’s face get dyed a light red.\nShe hasn’t said anything. She hasn’t said anything, but I’m jealous.\nI heard a rumor on the wind. That Leigie-sama has gotten around to remembering Lorna’s name. His ever-so-reserved attendant was likely the cause of him going out a little while ago as well.\n… Even though he hasn’t remembered my name yet.\nIt’s no good. No good anymore. It’s definitely no good.\nI take rough breaths as I wipe my eyes with a handkerchief. The white cloth, after being brushed against my eyes only once, changed to a shade of vermillion endlessly close to black.\nAh, you are… my longing.\nI understand that it’s something without meaning.\nBut if I… if I was a Demon Lord, I would be able to perfectly imitate Lorna’s form!\nThose meaningless ambitions swirled around my head.\nNo matter how many times they turned, there was no signs of the endless stream of tears stopping. The weight of the handkerchief sucking up my envy was abominable.\nI have no time. Whether I can win against Heard, honestly I do not know.\nThinking back to Deije’s warning, the probability is quite low. He’s a man whose nature I do not fully understand. I’m not sure whether he’s hiding anything or not.\nThen before that, I’ll fulfill my desire.\nI give up on wiping the tears.\nI unlock the door, and leave the room.\nMy legs shake, and I put my hand on the wall to steady myself, as I head towards Leigie-sama’s room. On the way, I passed by one of my subordinates.\nShe tried to call out greetings to me, but seeing my face, she open her eyes wide with a shocked expression.\nThere’s no need for you to worry about it. My cravings aren’t pointed at you.\nTrying to convey that, I attempted to force a smile onto my face, but seeing that, her face turned pale, and she fled.\n(TL: The gender given to the subordinate here is vague, so it can be either male or female)\nAh… if I was able to smile like Lorna, she wouldn’t have run, right?\nBut that is also a trivial matter.\nBefore, I had all the time in the world, but until time started running out, I was unable to strengthen my Envy. I am an unsightly Demon, without a doubt.\nThere are plenty of Demons who have given up on their cravings, but having once tasted being a Minus, I am unable to resign myself.\nI grit my teeth.\n“It’s no good, definitely…”\n“Kusu kusu kusu… what’s no good?”\nI was supposed to be talking to myself there.\nFrom around the turn of the passage, a single shadow showed itself.\nGolden hair, blue eyes. A Demon wearing a maid outfit equipped with a skirt shorter than Lorna’s.\nHiero. Lorna’s sister. Number two of the house in service to Leigie-sama.\nShe gives an irritating laugh. While she has an appearance similar to Lorna’s, she wears a different atmosphere.\nAt the same time, she’s a Superbia Demon like Heard, but she’s a a special one who doesn’t go out in battle.\nWhy must pride raise such irritating voices? Her expression, tone, every part of her got on my nerves.\n“I was driven away by oneechan, but in exchange, I’ve found something quite interesting.”\n“…I have no business with you.”\n“Kusu kusu kusu, Medea-san, your act is slipping off, you know?”\nOn her words, I suddenly noticed.\nThe imitation『Luxuria』 aura I always wore with a skill had been released.\nI take deep breaths, and re-cloak myself in Lust.\nWith interested eyes, she looked over me.\n“… I see, I had always been thinking it. No matter the case, your impression was too light for Lust. Kusu kusu kusu…”\nLike I care.\nI have no need to conceal it any further. In the first place, I have no interest in someone like Hiero.\nFrom the start, the one I wanted to hide myself from… was Leigie alone.\nHiero takes out a handkerchief to wipe my eyes, and looking at the black cloth, she smiled brightly.\nWithout caring about dirtying herself, she put the handkerchief into her pocket.\n“And what do you plan to do? Looking like that?”\n“… As if you have to know.”\n“Kusu kusu kusu, you’re no fun. I wonder what I should do… if I stopped you, would oneechan praise me?”\nThis one… does she want to fight?\nAgainst a General like me?\nIt’s true that Envy Skills don’t have high attack power at all. But I have all the Skills I’ve Envied so far.\nI’ll likely win. I’m not as weak as to lose to some normal mediocre Demon.\nBut even when on the receiving end of my bloodlust, Hiero smiled with an innocent face.\n“… It’s a joke. A joke! Please don’t make such a dangerous face for a simple joke. Kusu kusu, fine, I’ll let you pass. Oneechan is… still in the room, but she should leave soon enough. Good grief, she loves to take her time…”\n“… What’s your goal?”\nI cannot understand what this girl is thinking.\nShe hasn’t lived that long, and she shouldn’t have proceeded that far down the Pride Tree, but from her expression, while it may be a different type, I perceive a pride like Heard’s.\nNot that she’s making fun of me, but that she’s looking down on me by nature.\nAnd her exprecion held an unfitting amount of wisdom.\n“Nothing really~? I don’t have a goal. I mean Medea-san’s going to be killed soon so I thought that at the very least, I would let you accomplish your desires is all.”\nHey, don’t you think so as well, Medea-san?\nHiero raises her voice and laughs.\nThere’s a throbbing pain in my head. The Flame of Envy I was supposed to have restrained is raging up.\n“Well, I think you can just do whatever you want. Leigie-sama… kusu kusu, won’t try to stop you, let alone mind.”\n“…”\nIt’s no good, I have no time.\nHow much time would it take to annihilate this one? A minute? Ten? Or perhaps even more?\nI have no time to care about Hiero.\nOnce she opens the way, I turn my eyes to her just once more, before directing them back ahead.\nBlood drips, staining the carpet.\n“Kusu kusu. Ah, if you end up killing oneechan, please tell me, ‘kay? It’s my turn next.”\n“…”\nI can’t deal with her.\nEven after Hiero left, her annoying laugh resounded in my ears.\nWhat’s so strange? What’s so funny?\n… None of that matters.\nI only have one regret left here.\nLeigie-sama’s room comes into sight. Lorna has already left it.\nFrom the start, I never had any plans of killing her. I’m not sure what would happen if she got in my way, but she’s a lot busier than an average soldier, and she’s always humble when in front of Leigie-sama’s eyes. Even when she’s so surprisingly intense at night.\nI knock the large door once, before slowly opening it.\nFrom what I can see with my eyes, Leigie-sama’s room is, after having been burned through by Lize-san a couple of times, different than the one I entered long ago, but the atmosphere I felt was identical.\nIncomparable to Envy or Greed or Wrath or Gluttony, an intense air of Acedia.\n“Pardon… the intrusion… Leigie-sama.”\nOn my voice, Leigie-sama won’t raise an answer. I knew that from the start.\nI lock the door behind my back, and approach the bed Leigie-sama was buried in.\nAs if he had died, his eyes were lightly shut. His countenance was such that not a single expression lingered on his face, and I couldn’t determine whether or not he was awake.\nEven when he’s before my eyes, I don’t particularly feel anything. The King of Sloth without a single thing for me to Envy. Just like a sculpture… no more than that, like a corpse, the King of Depravity didn’t stir in the slightest.\nWhen I’m envious of everything I am unable to get my hands on, I can’t find a single thing in Leigie-sama to be jealous of.\nIt’s natural. What I was jealous of wasn’t Leigie-sama himself, but of his surroundings.\nI move the palm of my hand to Leigie-sama’s face. He’s alive.\nMy unsightly tears of blood drip down, and stain that face.\n“Leigie-sama… just what… should I long for… Why can I never be satisfied…”\n“…”\nLeigie-sama lightly opens his eyes, and his transparent gaze, without a hint of conceit, looks through me.\nBut he doesn’t say anything. That was excessively disheartening.\nThere is but a single clue.\nIn all that I’ve perceived, within my memory, Lorna is the one I hold the most Envy towards.\n… That’s why if I’m able to accomplish something Lorna cannot, my jealousy should clear up a little.\n“Leigie-sama… do you remember my name?”\n“… Yeah.”\n“Eh? Really!? Is it alright if I ask you to say it?”\n“…”\nHis eyes asked the question, ‘who is this?’\n… Just what instincts does Leigie-sama live on?\nEven looking at my streaming tears of blood, even when his face is stained, he doesn’t stir in the slightest. I am unable to move Leigie-sama’s heart.\nIt’s something I already knew, long ago.\nI lift the hem of my robe, and give a polite curtsy.\nThen in the end, I’ll adorn myself with a impression of perfect beauty.\n“Leigie-sama… I’m called Medea Luxeliahart. The Sin I govern is 『Luxuria』. It is a pleasure to be in your service.”\n“… I see.”\nHe let out a gloomy voice.\nMy soul core is beating noisily.\nBut this is strange. Even when before the man himself, my Envy isn’t satisfied in the slightest. I am… just what am I overlooking?\nWhatever the case, I have no time.\n“Leigie-sama…”\nI untie the ribbon holding the robe closed at the neck, and leave the red strip on the side table.\nOne by one, the wooden buttons are unfastened by my shaking hands.\nI withdraw my arms, and the robe falls to my feet. My bare shoulders feel a pleasant cool sensation upon coming into contact with the air.\nAll that’s protecting my body is a light one-piece, and the underwear I’m wearing underneath. I’m not even wearing my military uniform. There’s nothing to protect me.\nIt’s not like when Zebul stripped it all. The act of taking it off by myself is much more embarrassing than I had anticipated. Demons of Lust sure are amazing.\nMy lips quiver. In a shaking voice, I declare to Leigie-sama.\n“… Henceforth… I will be violating you.”\n“… I see.”\n“… Meaning, I will be completely ignoring your will, and forcefully committing sexual acts with you.”\n“… I see.”\nEven after embarrassingly declaring that much, the expression on Leigie-sama’s face hasn’t changed in the slightest, and his eyebrows don’t even shift a millimeter.\nThere isn’t a trace of human emotion. No shyness or fear. While yawning, his absentmindedly-shifting gaze makes it so I’m not even sure if he’s looking at me.\nAs I confirmed that the flow of my tears had become stronger, my shaking hands moved to remove the top-most button on the one-piece.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Invidia, Part 4: This Is Too Much…\nEven after giving up my body and feelings, my feelings of envy barely subsided at all. That was probably the portion of my envy that had been directed at Lorna.\nThe large Hell that formed the base wasn’t filled in at all.\nMy feeling of impatience isn’t lessening at all. In a daze, I cleaned myself up, and nimbly put on the clothing I had discarded.\n“Thank you… for your time…”\n“…”\nLeigie-sama shows not an iota of movement. Even during the act, he barely moved at all.\nEven when I deeply lower my head, he doesn’t give an answer. His eyes remained closed. I was on the verge of tears.\nDoes this Demon Lord even have any sexual desire? No, I’ll bet he does.\nI mean, that’s why we were able to do it in the first place.\nThe King of Idleness.\nExperiencing his abnormal way of life once more, I felt an extreme feeling of loss and despair. I can’t even raise a hollowed out laugh.\nBut if this isn’t it, then what could be the source of the Envy I obtained?\nI had always thought it stemmed from the yearning I had towards Leigie-sama. The Luxuria I obtained through my Envy was in order to catch Leigie-sama’s eye, and that’s why I always feigned being one.\nThis can’t be. I can’t follow this anymore.\nI cannot find the target of my Envy. It must have been something that birthed emotions great enough to awaken me to my Sin.\nWhat should I do from now on?\nMy swaying field of vision. Without my thoughts coming into order, my uncertain feet headed for the door.\nI undo the lock, and open it.\n“… Hm. Are you done yet?”\n“… Ah… I see…”\nThat voice enlightened me.\n… So I’m already out of time.\nLeaning his body on the wall outside, was a black haired man glaring at me.\nSupreme Commander, Heard Lauder.\nLeigie’s top follower.\nAt the same time I reached enlightenment, an intense anger stained the scene before me in red.\n… So be it. If you’ll get in my way, then seeing whether or not your 『Superbia』 is stronger than my 『Invidia』 isn’t a bad option.\nI’ve lost the trail I had been following for years, and I’m in the mood to take my anger out on someone.\nI get by breathing in order.\n“Kusu kusu, Medea-san, did you fulfill your desire?”\nNext to him stands Hiero. With a tasteless full smile, she looked down on me.\nIt’s not fulfilled. There’s no way it could be fulfilled.\nI still have regret remaining. No, my regret has only gotten deeper.\nI lick my lips. Luckily, my tears had already stopped. Well, there’s no doubt I’m making a terrible expression right now.\nI straighten my shaking legs.\nI raise my eyes to see the Demon of Pride, two heads taller than me.\nOf course, I’m not being negligent, but Pride Demons generally don’t initiate surprise attacks. Even more so when the enemy is of lower status.\nJust in case, I confirm it one last time.\n“Heard Lauder… do you plan on fighting me…?”\n“… To direct killing intent at me, you’ve grown up admirably, have you not. Fight? Wrong, this is simple… judgement.”\nThe same intolerable tone as ever.\nBut there, Heard seemed to suddenly remember something.\n“… Hm, but you have accomplished the meritorious deed of troubling Leigie-sama, and thus weakening him.”\n“… What? What are you…”\nWeakening… Leigie-sama?\nMeritorious?\nThis man… what is he…\nDeije’s lines revive in my mind.\nA bad premonition. Right, that’s what he said.\nThe pressure I can feel just by him standing there. The feeling of oppression.\nA great pressure as if the air itself was being crushed, no different from when Zebul stood before my eyes.\nSupreme Commander Heard Lauder’s supposed to be the strongest Demon in the Army next to Leigie. But did he always have this extent of power, this air about him?\nThe Prideful Kaiser.\nIn the past, he supported this army alone, the greatest veteran. This army’s dictator.\nWith eyes as if he was observing a stone on the side of the road, Heard inspected my whole body.\n“… Right, this is an exception. In accordance to your achievements, and as mercy towards a former comrade, I don’t mind keeping you around for the army’s relaxation use.”\n“What…?”\n“Kusu kusu kusu, isn’t that nice, Medea-san? To get away without dying. Kusu kusu, isn’t this your long-cherished ambition as a『Luxuria』?”\nHiero laughs annoyingly.\nAh, this is no good.\nEven if I’m not Wrath, I feel a great need to kill this one.\nStrange? Sense of discomfort? Strong?\nI know all of that.\nBut if I stayed silent here after all this, I would be a failure as a Demon.\nEven if I don’t govern Superbia, I have my pride.\nEven if I don’t govern Wrath, there are things that make me angry.\nRight now, 『Envy』 isn’t even coming to mind.\n“… Heard, I am thankful to you. Back when I was just a normal Demon, you gave me a job.”\n“… Hm, I need no thanks. All I care about is the result.”\nAnd he laughed scornfully, as if to say, ‘And you didn’t even bring about any results.’\nBut even if his eyes shined with pride, he wasn’t negligent.\nTo eliminate even the million to one chance of him slipping, to protect his pride, he performed all of his abnormal training.\nThat is the nature of the one who continues to reign over Pride, Heard Lauder.\nAs such, he has always shined as the Supreme Commander of Leigie-sama’s forces.\nFrom the depths of his existence, magic, desire is drawn out.\nIt’s been about three days since the end of the Zebul War. Physical state aside, my magic is in perfect condition.\n“… Should we change locations?”\nHe probably knew I wasn’t expecting a yes.\nWith an uninterested expression, exactly like Leigie’s, he looked down on me.\n“Location… Hm, there’s no need. No, more so, doing it here saves some effort.”\n“… Meaning?”\n“No, I was talking to myself there… Now, Medea Luxeliahart. Come at me.”\nHiero quietly moves herself to the side.\nHeard seems quite relaxed. Without a sign of him having entered a battle stance, his face continued to lord over and despise everything equally.\nI’m being taken lightly.\n… Fine. I’ll call your bet.\nWithout letting my guard down, and paying attention to Heard’s movements, I took in a deep breath…\n…I used the『Imitate』 skill.\nMy thoughts flash like lightning, and race around my body.\nWhat floats in my mind is a green-haired girl. Alone, she led her army, and turned her blade to the Great Demon King; a powerful Demon Lord.\nThe flames of Envy burn up before my eyes.\nWithout restraint, I expend the pool of magic I had been saving up.\nMy knees shake. My body falls backward for a moment. It’s a frightening Mana cost. The amount even exceeded that used up by the SS Skill of the Demon Lord of Lust, 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』.\nIt was a true Demon Lord’s Skil.\nOriginally, it’s the summit reached only by Demons who have put thousands and thousands of years into fulfilling their cravings.\nI Envied that. Without any respect or honor.\nSomething weighs down on my hand.\nIt’s an 『Invidia』 Skill to perfectly preserve the Skills of those I’ve Envied.\n『Imitate』.\nJust like 『Avaritia』’s 『Skill Ruler』, it skips the experience required to achieve it, a means reserved to Envy.\nUnlike with 『Skill Ruler』, where you can strengthen gained skills, with 『Imitate』 you can use the Skills in the state from which they were imitated.\nThe same level at which the real one used it.\n『Fang of Origin』\nIt was the skill she used in the battle with Leigie-sama.\nA curved pure white crescent-moon-shaped blade manifested before me, before being clad in the black mists of hunger.\nHeard frowned. But even after seeing me use a Skill that clearly wasn’t Lust, he wasn’t shocked.\nI’ll bet Hiero told him. By nature, Demons who govern Pride have an absolute hierarchical system among them.\nI had forgotten. No, I didn’t connect it. The Supreme Commander, and the maid apprentice.\nBut that doesn’t really matter. That won’t do anything to break a Demon Lord’s Skills.\n“That is… Hm, Zebul the Devourer… a Gula Skill, is it?”\n“…”\nPressure. Frightening starvation. The blade sucks up my nutrients, and my vision grows hazy. My footing becomes unsteady.\nCompletely ignoring that, I lowered my body to the ground, and kicked the floor.The tip of the sword grazed the floor as it made a vacuum with its swing.\nIt was something even Leigie-sama had to dodge. The skill Zebul selected from her eternity of life specifically to eliminate the Lord of Sloth.\nIn just a single step, I close in on him, and swing upwards.\nHeard, seeing that attack, smiled with obvious disdain.\nVibrations as if the building was shaking. The floor gives in. The moment before the blade was able to eat into him, his form vanished.\nThe fang easily pierces through the wall protected by a barrier.\n“… Hm, as I thought… how useless.”\nFrom behind, I heard a voice. When I hurriedly turned around, my flank was struck. Befrore I could even feel any pain, my vision was buried in a wall.\nPain. An impact that shook my entire body. Judgement. A decrease in my ability to sustain life. The sharp pain in my flank. A few of my bones are gone.\nThe back of my head is being pressed hard.\n“Even if you have a Demon Lord’s skills, a measly Invidia would never be able to master them.”\nThe right arm holding the sword was crushed. My hand is forcefully opened. The fang turns to sand, and fades.\nIt wasn’t that absurd teleportation that Leigie-sama displayed. It was pure movement based on his physical ability. It was just simple speed, but to my level of dynamic vision, it was no different than instantaneous.\nThe idle Leigie.\nThe Dynamic Heard.\nWhat physical strength. His sense of battle without a moment’s hesitation. My head is removed from the wall before it is rocked by another impact.\nA thunderous roar. My semisircular canals are shaking. I can’t even tell what happened, but I do know that damage is piling up on my body.\nMy vision is tinted red.\n“…Hm, as I thought, you’re just a lowly 『Invidia』… Just what part of this one caught Deije’s eyes… I cannot comprehend.”\n“… Dei…je…”\nOn those words, that name, my hazy conscience responded.\nI instinctively activate 『Imitate』. The target is a Demon of 『Avaritia』. The Usurper, Deije Breindac.\nI’m jealous. I can’t help but be jealous.\nOf his physical ability.\nPower returns to my powerless arms. Red hot blood. The experience of Deije, who exchanged blows with a Demon Lord.\nI grab Heard’s hand, which had grabbed me by the scruff of my neck. To the limit of my power. I try to crush it.\nBut Heard’s hand doesn’t waver in the slightest.\n“… So that’s Deije’s brute strength… hm, it’s a waste to have been lent to someone like you.”\nMy body floats. By the time I noticed it, I had been singlehandedly thrown.\nMy head experiences a shock. But that’s instantly dealt with using my Status Abnormality Resistance. My dynamic vision perfectly capture the wall closing in on me. But I’m unable to do anything.\nI protect my head before I crash. It’s an impact that cuts through my body. Perhaps due to Deije’s durability, I don’t particularly take too much damage.\nThe Demon of Pride started approaching me as if he was taking a leisure stroll.\n“Hm… not bad. 『Invidia』, I will permit you to envy Leigie-sama.”\n“… What are…”\nA warped smile floats on Heard’s mouth.\n“You envied him, right? As you swung your hips above him. Hm, I’m telling you to go use that, fool.”\nThis man… just how much will he make a fool of me?\nThe amount of rage I feel is dyeing my head red.\nSuddenly, Deije’s words revive again.\n『Well, do your best. As a former Supreme Commander, for argument’s sake, I’m praying for your survival, girly. 』\nRight, no matter what, I need to stay alive.\n… To fulfill my desire.\nI stop imitating his physical ability.\nPower drains out of my body. But I at least have enough strength to stand. And I use my magic again.\nMe small consolation was that I was unable to fully manifest the『Fang of Origin』, so I still have some magic.\nI lick my lips. Don’t look down on Envy. I yearn for everything, desire for it, even if I am unable to change myself, I Envy.\n“… Then I’ll show it to you. The power of the Lord of Sloth!”\nWhat I imagine is my lord. Always in the bed, on the floor, on the rough ground of the desert, Always sprawled out with a pained expression on his face, lazily lowering his hand as if to squash a fly. The lone King of Sloth. The Needless King.\nThink.\nOf his power. Of his way of life.\n… And I envied that Skill.\nI lightly swung my hand.\nHeard’s body was suddenly thrown against the wall.\nAs if he had been crushed by my hand.\nHow should I put this…what an idle Skill.\nUpon the lack of any resistance I felt, I looked at my own hand in amazement.\nGood grief, there isn’t a single feeling on my hand. All I did was wave it. With a loud sound, cracks spread across the barrier-protected wall.\nWithout thinking anything, I clenched my hand.\nJust with that, wrinkles spread across Heard’s black clothing as if it had been gripped.\n『Miracle Wonder Lighthand』\nThat was the Skill’s name. The name of the Skill I learned through Leigie.\nWhile it may be miraculous, or wonderful, I think there’s something wrong with that name. But it’s definitely strong. One-sidedly strong.\nOn top of having almost no demerits, you can one-sidedly attack over a distance.\nBut even after taking the skill that was enough to slaughter Zebul, the Demon of Pride doesn’t seem panicked.\n“『Sky Hand』, is it… how useless.”\nEven while being ensnared, Heard looks down on me.\nAt that moment, the skill was forcibly cancelled.\nHis floating body falls, and he lands gracefully on his feet. His body and expression haven’t taken damage.\nHe smooths out his wrinkled clothes with his hand. With a bored look.\nI can’t believe it… what did he do? He cancelled out a skill from the Lazy King?\nNo, that’s not it. I can kinda understand what he did.\nHeard Lauder is a Demon of Pride.\nThat being the case, there is but a single answer I can reach.\nThis is 『Superbia』’s 『Overrule』 Skill.\nI determined it had crossed over the depths of my heart… It has the ability to nullify Overruled Skills, and to bring about absolute status adjustment to Overruled opponents. One of the abilities of Pride.\nBut that cannot be. Even if he can Overrule most skills, this isn’t normal.\n“That can’t… how were you able to do that to Leigie-sama’s…”\n“… Hm, pointless. Invidia, I asked you you to use it, did I not? I asked you to imitate it, did I not? Leigie of Sloth’s…”\nHe hesitates for a moment.\nHe pushes the sole of his foot into the ground, and attacks by lowering his other raised leg.\nEven if I noticed, even if I knew, it was a lightning fast speed I couldn’t react to.\nMy body slams into the ground.\nHis immense power makes me unable to believe he’s of the same General Class.\nHis shoe, probably made of Dragon Leather grinds into my head as if he was treading over trash.\nEven without looking, I can tell. His cold stare like a slap to the face. His piercing sharp, honed fighting spirit.\nHeard Loader spoke as if spitting out his words.\n“…『VIT』.”\nThere was power imbued in his words. I understood.\nThis one’s… on another level.\nEven after having lived long years, there are plenty of Demons who don’t hold considerable power. I’ve seen more than enough of them. But this one’s different.\nI don’t know how old he is, but his battle experience, magic, authority, all of it numbered close to the time he spent living.\nWhy, how. Why has a Pride Demon of this rank resigned himself to be the subordinate of a Demon Lord?\n… I can’t win.\nI barely move my head that was being trampled, and looked up a Heard.\n“You… what… are you trying to do!?”\n“… I told you to 『Imitate』. I did not tell you to open your mouth.”\nAfter lifting his leg in an instant, it came down, and crushed my jaw.\nSharp pain. Blood spreads across my mouth, and the hard item I can barely feel is probably my teeth, or bone. My blood spreads across the ground, but for some reason, my vision became strangely clear.\nWithin my hazy conscious, my thoughts cannot keep up.\nMy sight is tinted a light black. Someone is looking down over me.\n“… Kusu kusu kusu… Heard-san, this child’s lost consciousness, it seems.”\n“… Hm… well it was my mistake to place expectations on her, I guess. If she could only reproduce a fraction of Leigie-sama’s power, it would still be fine… is what it means.”\n“… Well I guess that’s that. Kusu kusu kusu, in the first place, this one was said to be the weakest among the commanding officers.”\nI can’t hear anything. I can’t see anything.\nI feel my Soul Core rapidly losing power.\nI’ve taken too much damage. I used too many skills that were too much for me.\nAnd still, I wasn’t a match.\nMy vision darkens. I can’t see anything. I can’t feel anything.\nAt that time, a clear image flooded into my mind.\nIt wasn’t of the few thousand years I spent alive.\nIt was of Leigie-sama hugging me in place of his pillow, and bringing me here.\nThat sensation was vivid. His bored expression. His arms, from which I couldn’t even sense warmth. With his eyes still closed, an unmoving Leigie-sama.\nLeigie-sama roughly spreading me over the bed. Kanon-sama frowning upon finding me.\nLeigie comparing options with sleepy eyes. It was the first time anxiety had been born into my heart.\nLeigie-sama let go of me.\nAnd what he held instead was…\nAn impact jolts my head. I don’t really care that I was on the brink of death.\nI’m not sure by what logic, but color starts returning to my eyes.\nN-not even being able to die when killed… this is too much.\nPillow!? … Wai… don’t tell me the origin of my…\nI unintentionally cried out, but my mouth had been smashed so a strange voice came out.\n“Faa… hyo…”\n“… Huh? You still have consciousness? Kusu kusu, you’re a tough one. There!”\nFingers like whitebait, a pointed hand mercilessly thrusted at both of my eyes.\nMy eyes are crushed, and my vision becomes pitch black by very physical means. I managed to wring out a scream from my throat. The fingers continue to dig around inside my eyes.\nThe intense pain makes me really feel me consciousness leaving me this time.\nI really don’t care anymore. Just kill me already…\nMy senses are paralyzed. The sensation of the fingers on my eyes. I don’t even feel pain anymore. It’s just the feeling of movement there was extremely disturbing.\nThe moment my consciousness was swallowed by darkness again, I heard a faint voice.\n“Kusu kusu, Heard-san. You don’t need this anymore, right? Can I take it then?”\n“… Hm, I don’t need it, but… what do you plan to use it for…?”\nMy body sways. My sensations are out of line.\n“This… I think I’ll be able to Overrule it. I thought it would be useful for a little 『Experiment』…”\n“… Hm, so be it. That is but another way for a 『Superbia』 to advance, but let me just add this. I don’t care what you do with it, but make sure you throw it away once you’re done.”\n“Kusu kusu kusu, I know, Heard-san. Please leave the cleanup to me. Heard-san, you have to… Leigie-sama…”\n“… Correct. I don’t have the time to be wasting on trivial matters… Hm, I’ve used some time pointlessly. Leigie the Depraved… is it? My father sure has fallen. I’ll make sure to make a final greeting.”\nI’m fading, but I can still feel a faint beat in my Soul Core.\nMore importantly…\nThe words I was barely able to pick up from Heard pique my curiosity.\nAs I lose focus on my own conscious, my mind falls to hell.\nI frantically regain focus.\nFa…ther? What does that mean?\nHeard Lauder’s father is Leigie-sama?\nFirst I’ve heard of it. I’ve been here for a while, but I’ve never heard of something like that. Not even a rumor.\nSomething is wrong. Letting Heard go like that is wrong.\nBut I cannot move my body. My consciousness either.\nMy life flashing before my eyes increases my heart rate, and my mind resurface, but I’m at my limit.\nMy arms won’t even twitch. It’s like the unmoving feeling was all I could feel.\nIt felt as if I had lingering regrets.\n“Haa… oneechan’s the same, but Medea-san, you’re too durable… Do you really have that many regrets in life? Kusu kusu, really Lust and Envy are too sturdy… But Leigie-sama’s another story…”\nImpacts shake my whole body, and my breath stopped instantly.\nBefore that happened, a dim light had returned to my eyes.\nWhat was in front of me was the form of Hiero pouring the contents of a small glass bottle.\nDrops of water flow down my face. The intense pain that followed my sudden revival made me try to cry out, but Hiero stuffed a shoe in my mouth.\n“Goh…!”\n“Well, well, don’t trouble me so much, Medea-san. Kusu kusu, if Heard-san finds out, he’ll kill us all together, won’t he? Can’t you be quiet for a while?”\nAs if something was interesting, she smiled as she moved the shoe around again and again, before finally removing it.\nAfter that, she fished another glass bottle out of her pocket.\nThat marketing logo on the bottle… it’s a Potion made to restore lifeforms. It’s something I have familiarity with seeing lined up in the army’s storerooms.\nAfter removing the cap, she starts sprinkling it on me from a needlessly high altitude.\nPotions are a super high class commodity. They’re a miracle medicine that can even regenerate lost body parts.\nNormally, one doesn’t have the leisure to take one out in battle, so it’s something that’s saved for emergency situations, when they’re really needed.\nA potions effects include softening pain. My crushed jaw is repaired.\n“Arara, so even two wasn’t enough. Your HP must be really high… want a third one…?”\n“I-I don’t need one… I’m fine already!”\n“Kusu kusu, don’t be reckless. See, see.”\n“Gu…”\nHer foot tread over my ribs.\nThere’s pain as if something was broken inside of my stomach.\nI can’t even tell what’s going on anymore. Is she trying to harass me, or is she healing me?\nThe second I opened my mouth to complain, a bottle was thrust in.\nLiquid flows directly down my throat. When I thought I was about to break out into a coughing fit, her hand forcefully closed my mouth.\nFrom my nose, potion flows. Seeing that, she gives a light and refined smile.\n“Goho, goho, w-what are you scheming?”\n“Hmm? Scheme? I just saved you, so I think there’s something you should say first, right?”\nWhat an irritating phrasing.\nBut… saved?\nI hurriedly observe the surroundings. The crack in the wall, and the collapsed floor. My location hasn’t changed at all from the moment I lost consciousness.\nI feel cheated for some reason.\n“Now, now Medea… wheres~ your~ thanks~?”\nShe speaks with a sparkling smile.\nI grit my teeth.\n“… Thank you. I was saved.”\n“Kusu kusu, my pleasure. From now on, you should learn your place, and know when to run, you know? There’s no way you’d ever be able to beat Heard-san, Medea-san. In the first place, 『Superbia』 has a strong affinity against 『Invidia』.”\nShe strokes my hair as if patting a dog.\nIt irritates me, but the fact that I still have my life is lucky.\nMore importantly, my feelings of questioning how and why are stronger.\nHaving received my glance, Hiero lets out a sigh.\nThe passageway… she looked around the corner of the passage that led to Leigie-sama’s room, and looked down on me with philanthropic eyes.\n“No… isn’t there the possibility that Leigie-sama will ask to embrace Medea-san again? Only in the realm of great possibilities, in the million to one area, though… kusu kusu…”\nI… I cannot comprehend.\nIt’s too unfamiliar to me. How does that Lorna have a sister like this?\nI don’t get the meaning. I cannot comprehend.\nHeard’s power was frightening, but so is Hiero’s mentality.\nFor that reason… she didn’t even change locations, but healed me as I was?\nIf Heard returned, what did you plan on doing?\nMy thoughts swirl. Her over-the top reason made it so I could only return a sentence.\n“… I don’t think that’ll ever happen.”\n“I’m of the same opinion. I mean, your body is so scarce… if it was oneechan, I would understand, though…”\nAre you picking a fight?\n“No, but, if Leigie-sama ever invites you to his bed, you’ll respond, right? Try saying it. I was saved by Hiero of 『Superbia』, so please relish in my scarce body.”\nIt’s something with an almost one hundred percent chance of never happening, but I resolved myself to never use that line if such an opportunity did arise.\nThis isn’t about having my life saved or anything, I just won’t.\n“Kusu kusu kusu, well, let’s leave the jokes around here…”\n… So that was a joke.\nShe’s always smiling, so I can never tell whether she’s being sincere or messing around.\nWith a serious expression, Hiero looked at the passageway. A fleeting glance as if to indicate Leigie-sama’s room.\n“Heard-san intends on killing Leigie-sama. He’ll aim for the gap where he’s been weakened from fighting the Demon Lord.”\n“… Hah? Wha, why… no, that’s wrong… I see.”\nThat’s not sane.\nEven if he just defeated a Demon Lord, Leigie-sama barely got any wounds, and he barely used any Skills. He doesn’t seem weakened at all. No, he’s sleeping, so it’s not like I can tell, but…\nEven so, if Heard intends to kill him… he must have some sort of plan.\nIn the first place, killing one’s master is one form of Pride.\nIf that’s the meaning behind Heard’s incomprehensible words, then I can understand.\nContinuing on, after a large stretch, Hiero let out a sigh.\nHer eyes filled with annoyance were tinted with a color unbecoming of her young appearance.\n“I’ve made a bet with myself, you see. I’m definitely a Pride Demon like him, but unrelated to that, I bet that Heard-san will lose. Well, it’s just instinct, so if Heard-san does attain victory, then I’ll slay Medea-san right here. Kusu kusu kusu… in truth, I’m a strong ally to have you know.”\n“… I see.”\nThis one is no good. She’s natural trash.\nBut her saving my life is also a fact. I decided not to voice my opinion.\nI stand up, and move my body. My magic is pretty much empty, but the pain is gone.\nMy wounds have been completely healed.\n“… Then why did you fully heal me? You could just make it so I barely survived, or something…”\nEven if she didn’t restore my Mana, there should be a difference in ability between me and Hiero.\nIf she fully heals me, the possibility that I would run away would be high.\nOn my question, Hiero threw out a carefree answer.\n“… That~ is~ because eight out of nine times, Leigie-sama will win! Heard-san definitely is absurdly strong, but… Leigie-sama’s power is incomprehensible. Pride is extraordinarily weak towards the unknown…if his opponent was weakened, he might be able to pull through, but Leigie-sama is Demon Lord Rank Three. It would be the end once he unraveled a skill he’d never displayed before, wouldn’t it? Definitely.”\nAgain, those admirably bitter words. But as a Pride like him, her words held some persuasive power.\nI was crushed to death with worry, and alongside Hiero, I looked over the corner.\n… Pillow, desire, what should I do.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Superbia, Part 1: To the Supreme Demon Lord\nWhen compared to the human race, a Demon’s life is horribly long.\nTheir lifespans equate to eternity, and aging from the passage of time is a concept foreign to them.\nThe shape of their soul, the shape of their will, and the shape of their desires is what resolves their being, and seeds of that resolute way of being are the greatest factors that influence this absurdly large Demon World.\nAt the same time, as Demons continue to utilize their endless lives to delve into their desires, their power can grow with no limit in sight… once they become Demon Lords, they have enough strength to defile the very Heavens that would once be their natural enemy.\nThe first thing that entered my eyes the moment I was awakened, was a vigor-less man in slovenly garb. His artlessly cut hair fell over dirty clothing stained with dust. Supporting his body was a creaking armchair of faded color.\nNo life, energy or will, but what he did have was a vast amount of power.\nEven for my immature senses, I could feel it fill the world, simple deep and dark, as if it were the air, a natural and quiet magic.\n… The King of Depravity.\nSurvival of the fittest. In a world where Demon Lords elegantly competed with one another, there existed but one who did not interfere, and just by being there, he had climbed the ranks to Demon Lord. A mighty Demon.\nWithout making any blood flow, a pitiful Demon who had even been left behind by the flow of time.\nLeigie the 『Depraved』.\nIt wasn’t certain that he could grant power to those who desired it.\nBut the inverse also stood true.\nEven if he had power, it wasn’t certain if he could put it to practical use, and as Sloth, it wasn’t even certain if he could use it at all.\nThe Demon Lord who pursued 『Acedia』 looked at me. Without saying anything, without thinking anything.\nNo, while his eyes were directed in my direction, perhaps he wasn’t even looking at me. His hollow and shifting gaze held no meaning, and all I was certain of was that the thoughts that dwelled in those eyes were ones that someone like me wouldn’t possibly be able to comprehend.\nPerhaps… my origin was a miracle.\nAs a game, he had tried to use the power he had gotten his hands on for the first time, and for a reason as simple as that, I was born.\nOf course, I only realized that after much time had passed… After, without meaning, and never once having been ordered from my birth, I continued to suck up the Mana the Demon named Leigie emitted unconsciously. After I gained my own self-awareness, and even my own desires.\nEven after seeing me start moving without his orders, Leigie didn’t say anything.\nThe reason for my existence, the reason for my birth were something I couldn’t understand.\nIt wasn’t even the Demon Lord’s will. His goal was only to use his power, and he didn’t even hold any interest towards the result.\nI simply looked at my master.\nRelieving his will of Sloth,\nLooking at the pitiful legion of the Demon Lord who had not a single follower,\nWho didn’t even eat food, and who simply moved back and forth between a squalid chair he arbitrarily picked up somewhere and a damp bed. I looked at the form of my lord.\nEven so, any and all sorts of Heroes, Sages, Demons, Angels, and even Demon Lords didn’t pique his interest when they came for him. Looking at his way of life…\n“… Hm… so this is how a 『Ruler』 should be…”\nEven now, I can remember it clearly.\nThat was, those were the first words I ever vocalized.\nHow useless. How pointless.\nWithout any goal, his long life of nothingness merely built unto itself, and changed into a massive power.\nJust how unsightly, how unbearable.\nThat was the Longing I governed.\nAs such, I gained the Original Sin of 『Superbia』.\nMy deplorable creator’s form and the form of the growing number of challengers that faced defeat by his hand, had long surpassed any comedy.\nAnd at the same time, I harbored an intense jealousy.\nHis massive power that grew in proportion to the flow of time was never even polished with any form of training, but the other seeds… the other Demon Lords were simply driven away with overwhelming might.\nThat power alone was suited to my creator, and at the same time, if I could 『Overrule』 it, I wondered if I would truly become the supreme being, able to stand above not only people, but everything in existence.\nThat’s what I thought.\nThat’s what I couldn’t help but think.\nThere is no ranks among power.\nBut even in my mostly-stagnant head, I felt it. His power higher and nobler than all.\nAt the rate I was going, I knew I would never surpass it.\nI gained life as a Demon. Having spent a lifetime longer than I could even imagine, the being that reached Demon Lord level was, lifestyle aside, too strong.\nI can 『Overrule』. Those slovenly gestures, personality, and a way unbefitting a supreme ruler, it was easy enough to think of them as below me.\nBut I couldn’t win. It wasn’t on a level where good affinity or anything mattered, but a gap in life, experience, even existence.\nOverruling can increase battle ability, and bring about enough power to overturn the gap between the Demon Ranks 『General』 and 『Lord』. It’s a superior skill, but even that wasn’t enough\nI understood by instinct. The insurmountable gap was simply so great, I couldn’t help but understand by instinct.\n… Not yet.\nEven while watching me look down on him, the Lord of Sloth doesn’t say anything. It’s always silent.\n“… Hm. But if my master is like this, then people will start to see me as the same.”\n“… I see.”\nThe Lazy King let out a bored voice from under the covers. He displays not the tone variation of emotion.\nHis eyes look up at me, but even now, he holds not the slightest will.\nI declare. It is all for my own sake.\nIt was also like an oath. In order to carve my existence into the world.\n“Nominally and virtually, I shall make Father into the Supreme Demon Lord.”\n“… Do not want.”\n“… Hm, I’ll have you become one, Lazy King. Of all else, for… my sake.”\n“… I see.”\nJust do whatever you want.\nWithout letting out his voice, the Lazy King mouthed those words, before he sunk into his covers with sluggish movements.\nI was always watching. From back when I didn’t have any decent awareness.\nIt was his evident reaction.\nBut so be it.\n… As a start, let’s subjugate this region.\nI suppressed all the foolish Demon who judged, looked down on, and ignored my Master as harmless, all to make this vast land into my exalted master’s mausoleum.\nAnd by the time I have Overruled everything, perhaps I’ll have become an existence that surpasses even the Demon Lords of this hell.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Superbia, Part 2: At least leave it Supreme\nThe Demon World.\nWhere the strong are respected more than anything, Demons work to fulfill their desires, and Lords fight and steal over the limited resources.\nWithout any debate, it’s all worthless.\nGreed\nLust\nWrath\nGluttony\nEnvy\nPride\nAnd… Sloth.\nI have but one goal.\nWhile training, Overruling and struggling, I understood it clearly.\nThe territory increases. The magic I wear increases. My Pride Tree advances.\nAs if mowing down grassroots, a simple task.\nDemons of course, as well as Heavenly Assassins, and occasionally foolish warriors who come from the outside world to subjugate a Demon Lord.\nEverything yielded to me. To my power. And my master’s power.\nMy basic abilities were high from the start.\nThere’s no way that one made by the Lord of Sloth, who’s basically just a lump of power, could be weak.\nAnd I repeatedly trained.\nI forged my own power. Physical power, magic, wisdom, leadership. To eliminate the million to one chance of me tasting defeat because of some foolish reason.\nThat was my first goal, and the primary factor that increased my power with Pride at the base.\nOther Lords’ desires are fragile when compared to my lord’s Sloth.\nLike a flying arrow, time passed.\nEventually, a castle was made.\nAround the house too small to be called a house my Master lived in, ramparts extended for miles.\nThe tower built in the center pierced even the heavens.\nNamed the Castle of Shadows, the Lord of Sloth’s bedroom boasted an overwhelming width and majesty that surpassed the castles of any kind of Demon Lord.\nMy Master’s castle. I’m not satisfied. If he’s the man who will stand over me even if it be temporarily, a castle of this extent isn’t enough.\nDemons gathered.\nThe Demons that yielded, the Demons I forced to yield.\nI led the useless rabble, and put an army in order. Supreme soldiers that would surpass any Demon Lord’s armies.\nAs time passed, they came to be famous.\nLeigie of Sloth’s Strongest Legion.\nEven if I didn’t force them to submit personally, foolish Demons who lowered their own heads at us gathered.\nTheir numbers increased, and the army grew. First Brigade, Second Brigade, Third Brigade.\nBut no matter what Demon came in, none of them could even reach my feet.\nWeak. Much too weak.\nEven without me 『Overruling』 them, they had Overruled themselves, and they were all too weak to amount to an enemy of me.\nUnlosing and absolute.\nI have no losses, and as such, my master has never faced defeat either.\nThe more I defeated, the higher I rose, the more the years passed, the stronger my power became.\nA Pride Demon’s strength is proportional to their battle experience.\nStrength is the proof of having overcome. To those you’ve defeated once, you’ll never lose again.\nThe more you learn, the more you understand, the more distant defeat seems.\nThe more the years go by, the further defeat becomes. No matter how much desire they pile up, I haven’t fallen low enough to lose to any young Demon. I accumulate absolute confidence in myself.\n… But at the same time, that means I’m granting time to the Lord of Sloth.\nEventually, the Great Demon King came, seeking our surrender.\nUnlike the definite gap between Demon and Demon Lord, the Great Demon King is simply the title given to the Demon Lord in possession of the greatest territory.\nBut the fact that they lead such great forces within this Demon World means they have desires to that great of an extent.\nI met him. My Lord did not have to go out.\nThe Sin this King governed was Pride. A Demon like me with Overruling as his foundation. And at the same time, his goal was subjugating the Demon World. Putting the warring Demon World in order, and leading it, he would take in the world above, and even the Heavens. A man with large ambition unbefitting his level of power.\nAfter seeing him with my own eyes, I concluded. He wasn’t anything special.\nAt the point I met him, I 『Overruled』 that King. Meaning he was no match for Leigie of Sloth.\nIt seems it’s been a long time since he first came to be, but the King was foolish, and he didn’t even reach my level. In the end, he was just a Demon Lord that was slightly competent.\nIf I make him yield, will my Master’s position rise?\nIt was a useless notion. For a Demon Lord of this level, there’s not even any worth in annihilating him.\nAs A Demon Lord of Pride, if I make him submit, his power level will fall. There’s not even any use in taking him into the army…\nMy Master’s depraved state simply continued to deepen.\nHis authority doesn’t grow in the slightest, but his power alone continued to grow, and that form was truly befitting a Lord of all Demons.\nI ask him Questions.\nHe always returns the usual response.\nNo matter how many years pass, it never changes from those two words.\nThe Great Demon King requested a meeting with my Master.\nAnd after they met, he lost his power, and the Demon King seat shifted.\nIt was too great of a gap between him and a fellow Demon Lord. The will of the transcendent being that merely laid around like a rock was incomprehensible to those around him.\nThe Great Demon King changed. It changed time and again.\nIn the end, the Demon World never showed signs of unification.\nDemon Lords are born, and Demon Lords die.\nThe names of famous Heroes change, as they continually try and invade the Demon World.\nA large-scale invasion was launched by Heaven. A Large majority of the Demons died out.\n… But the Castle of Shadows continued to sleep.\nMy Master continues to live in his slumber. Never moving, and with that, his power continued to grow. To a height no Demon or Demon Lord would ever reach.\nAt the same time, the one born from him, my power continues to rise. Without me being able to fulfill the long-cherished desire of my Pride.\nThe Lord of Sloth who can’t be scratched at all.\nThe Doll born from his skill is peerless.\nOver months and years, the dolls he made to kill time scattered across the entire Demon World. Without knowing their master’s name, those Dolls simply moved across foreign batttlefields.\nLeigie the Depraved eventually came to be known as Leigie of the 『Slaughterdolls』.\nBy the merits of the original body.\nA clan of Demons in service to my Master sprung up. I can’t comprehend them. But let it be so.\nFor my master, having a clan like that isn’t bad. No, it’s natural for there to be one.\nInspectors from the Black Order start to be dispatched.\nLet it be so. Observe my Master however you like. In the end, people with your lowly level of power won’t be able to scratch Leigie the Depraved.\nSubordinates die. They die one after another, and our personnel continues to shift.\nBy a small bit of negligence, the man that was my right hand died. A foolish one. There can be no negligence on the battlefield.\nEven without old age, there are many casualties among Demons with the natural instinct for battle.\nDemon Lords famed for their strength are done in by other Demon Lords, and the weak climb up the ranks to Lordship.\nAll that prospers must decay.\nEnemies and allies, one after another, faces continue to change. Information about various Demons and Lords flood the library, and a second, and a third library are built.\nA majority of them are ones I Overruled long ago, unnecessary documents.\nOnce a year, the symbol carved on the wall fills the room, and covers the hallways.\nI taste the feeling of being a rock.\nAll that doesn’t change is my Master’s existence, and the Demon World’s pale blue moon.\nEven still, I’m no match. I can’t see the end.\nI selected Demons of Sloth, and launched attacks.\nMost of them were normal Demons. They were nothing to talk about. They didn’t use any skills worth noting.\nNo matter how many decades, centuries, millennia pass, another Demon Lord of Sloth doesn’t rise.\nAre they resting somewhere under the earth somewhere like Leigie the Depraved was?\nOr could it be that Sloth Demons are simply not reaching Demon Lord status?\nThat is left unknown.\nHeaps of bodies, streams of blood.\nIt’s become troublesome to even count the number of Demon Corpses that have piled up, but the impact I felt when I first saw Leigie of Sloth never dulls, no matter how much of an eternity goes by.\nInferiority. That is a 『Superbia』 Demon’s greatest enemy.\nEven more months pass.\nInformation gathers. I polish myself. I repel enemy seeds.\nBy the time I realized it, there was plenty of prey out there, but no one to be my enemy.\nAs long as there’s no one for me to Overrule, Pride’s power won’t grow. Pride without its foundations is close to worthless.\nI had reached the peak. I master my skills, draw my body to the limit, and hone my magic, but my Pride Tree stops one step before reaching Demon Lord Level.\nMy final and greatest wall. The wall known as Leigie.\n… But that ends today.\nMedea’s disposal did not even pose a warmup, let alone a rehearsal.\nIn the end, she’s just an Invidia, capable of nothing but imitating others.\nTrying to imitate my Master’s skill was pure stupidity. For a Sloth Skill with low offensive power, it barely has any power once a Greed or Envy Demon takes and uses it.\nI sigh. My soul and my gear have been raised to top class. Even the hazy combat experience from the corners of my mind have surely accumulated in a place I don’t know about.\nI open the door.\nBecause it was frequently burned up by that lass Kanon’s subordinate, the often changing room had been renewed. It gave off a faint lewd smell.\nWhile I knew this beforehand, while he should have sensed my presence already, Father doesn’t raise a single word, or stir a single inch.\nHe slept still as if he were dead.\nYou sure have fallen… Leigie the Depraved.\nYou used a skill just to help a single lowly maid.\nOn top of personally going to battle, you got a scratch from the likes of Zebul.\nMoreover, you left yourself to be defiled.\nYour recent acts have been much too wretched for my Master.\n… No, perhaps it’s about time for you.\nIt really has been a long time. A stupidly long one.\nAnd Father is supposed to have experienced an even longer time alive. Even if I pile up all my experience, I cannot predict them.\nRight now, how many are there out there who know the same Demon World as you?\nThe magic I feel from his body is immense.\nEven if you grouped together all the average Demon Lords, they won’t be a match. But I had a definite understanding.\n… Leigie the Depraved is weakening.\nA rare sight in the thousands, tens of thousands of years I’ve spent with him.\nHe went against the 『Acedia』 he governes.\nAll of it is… as expected.\nThe more time a 『Sloth』 spends in sloth, the more powerful they get. Contrarily, the more they decide to move of their own volition, the more their power will drop.\nI stand by the bed. On my master’s face, with his eyes closed as if he were dead, I see nothing besides nihility.\nI take up his limp hand. In his bony fingers in which I can’t even feel the T of Training, his white transparent corpse-like skin had light blue blood vessels running across.\n“Father… it’s been many years, hasn’t it.”\n“…”\nLeigie doesn’t give a response. But I can tell.\nFather isn’t sleeping right now. To the Lord of Sloth, whether he be awake or asleep, everything is but an ephemeral dream.\nAs such, I continued on.\nIt really was our first conversation in a long time.\nYou’ve fallen, in a way appropriate for me to call a disappointment. Leigie-sama likely has no interest in the reason, though.\nIn the first place, this was something inevitable since the moment I was born here, long, long ago.\nFather is a sharp man. While he governs Sloth, he also has parts in him aside from it.\nThat is the clear difference between him and other Sloth Demons, and that’s likely the main reason Leigie of Sloth was able to live perpetually.\nI have much that I want to say, but I don’t need words.\nOf how I increased his followers, and made them the greatest power in the Great Demon Lord’s army.\nOf how he foiled countless assassinations from Heaven, and had those assassins fall to Demonhood.\nOf how, while still sleeping, he repelled a raid launched by a dozen Human Heroes.\nOf how the former Great Demon King’s daughter, that little girl who didn’t even harbor any desires, Kanon, rose up to be the Great Demon King.\nOf how I amassed tens of thousands of deaths, and being separated from the flow of time.\nOf how not a single Demon Lord from when I was created still remain.\nOf how friends, companions, enemies died, new ones were born, only to die as well.\nWith no emotion, and ignorant to the passing of time, father was a perfect Depraved King by nature.\nAnd having been born from the Supreme Demon Lord, I can be nothing but the strongest Demon Lord myself.\nNext to father, I get down on one knee, and lower my head.\nThis is resolve. Today, I will become a Demon Lord, and never taste defeat for the rest of my life. No, even if I am to be defeated…\n… The kneeling is unnecessary.\nBut this is the only compensation I can give father as the Prideful Kaiser, Heard Lauder.\n“You’ve done enough. Let me bring an end to it. While this may sound arrogant, I will see to your end personally.”\n“… I see.”\n… So at least stay Supreme until you fall, Leigie the Depraved.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Superbia, Part 3: How Appropriate for the Curtain Call\nSloth Skills boast powers that cover a large amount of ground.\n(TL: As in usability, not distance)\nBut at the same time, it’s also said that it’s extremely difficult to acquire the sin.\nIn the first place, as long as they can fulfill their Sin without fighting, the skills they acquire are barely ever fit for battle.\nI fill up my body with power. The fact that Leigie had easily destroyed the Gluttony King only served to raise my power higher.\nThe legs supporting the large, canopied bed break.\nThe moment the bed swayed from its lost balance, I let out a rending cry as I thrust forward.\nMy fist hits Leigie’s head oh so easily. The cracking sound of something breaking rings out.\nThe impact blows away the pillars supporting the canopy, and Leigie’s body is sent flying like a scrap of paper.\nA thunderous sound.\nThe entire building shakes greatly. As if the Castle of Shadows was crying out.\nThe extra strength anti-Lize barrier is broken easily, and even the wall itself is destroyed. What’s more, it isn’t just one or two walls.\nIn the opened hole, I see unobstructed darkness. Around Leigie’s room, there are no other personal rooms.\nI fiddle with the remains of the bed with my feet.\nMy condition is perfect. There is nothing obstructing me from fulfilling my Pride. The power swelling all over my body is the compilation of all of my own research, as well as the accumulated history I spent with my Master.\nI take a deep breath, and exhale it.\nI cannot give Sloth time.\nI kicked the floor. My speed instantly reached its climax.\nSpeed faster than anyone.\nStrength stronger than anyone.\n… In order to fly higher than anyone.\nSuch is Superbia’s Original Sin.\nWeapons are unnecessary. My body itself is perfection.\nImages stream through my vision at the speed of sound.\nIt didn’t even take a second for me to reach Leigie who was sprawled out on the floor a ways away.\nWith my momentum, I kick his head. There’s no resistance. He dodged. No, he disappeared.\nThe Teleportation Skill possessed by Sloth. A skill that lets him transfer himself anywhere within his own territory.\nHis presence is behind me. Before I even sensed it, my body moved.\nIt was a high kick carrying forward all my momentum. The tip of my foot collides with Leigie’s head.\nI understand. My thoughts understand. How many years, millennium, megaannum. As a result of my service to him, reading the incomprehensible Lazy King’s movements have become possible to me.\nThe unreadable theory behind his actions was only known to me.\nMy physical strength broke the ceiling, and a large hole was opened. Blocks as big as my head start to come down.\nMy body becomes heavy. It’s a skill to convert a Demon’s Longings to weight, and bind them. A Skill of Sloth.\nI already know it. I activate 『Overrule』, and break through it without a problem.\nWhat’s frightening is his tenacity, his vitality.\nI should have delivered enough damage that it wasn’t strange if a normal Demon Lord was killed, but the VIT that let him activate a skill without issue is the characteristic of Sloth.\nThen I just have to hit him with an even greater power head-on.\n“… It hurts…”\nA slow voice leaks out of the hole that was opened.\nI concentrate my power.\nGetting into a long range battle with him is foolish. I pierce the ground with my feet, and concentrate power on my core.\n“Here I come.”\nWith my leap, the barrier breaks, and the floor caves in beneath me.\nI load my body with explosive power, and jump through the hole in the ceiling.\nWhat enters my eyes is the form of Leigie buried in a mountain of rubble. He oozes tears, as he holds his head. His injuries have already healed.\nSeeing me almost instantly close the distance between us, he directs a surprised expression. As always, killing intent, blood thirst, or anything that could be called fighting spirit is completely absent in him.\n“HaaAAAAAAAH!”\n“Ku…\nYell. Roar.\nUsing all the power in my body, I send out a strike.\nLeigie’s expression warped for the first time. At the same time, an invisible wall appeared around his body.\nA Sloth Skill to erect a defense-raising barrier.\nUseless. I already know of that one.\n(TL Useless means Muda)\nAs my fist hits it, without offering any resistance, the barrier shatters like glass.\nAs long as I’ve Overruled it before, utilizing a barrier is the height of folly.\nMy heart circulates heat around my body.\nBefore my fist could touch Leigie’s chin, his figure vanished.\nWhat a troublesome Skill. But a moving Sloth is a contradiction.\nHis use of that is one of the factors leading to his diminishing Sloth.\n“… Did I do something to you?”\nThere’s no need to ask. There’s no way our conversations will mesh.\nI swung my hand upwards at the voice that came from my side.\nLeigie used his arm to guard against it.\nI hear his bones grate.\nAmong Sloth Skills, there’s one to completely shut down their already-slow reaction to pain. Leigie’s expression doesn’t seem to look pained anymore.\nAnd even if I do injure him, with Leigie-sama’s vitality, he’ll heal it in an instant.\n“Father, please rest already.”\n“… Yeah.”\nWith eyes that conveyed, ‘What the hell is this guy saying,’ he nodded.\nHe isn’t listening. We cannot communicate.\nWith this unstable footing, kicking would be difficult. On my clenched fists, I used a body strengthening Skill before throwing it out.\nLeigie prepared his arms to take it.\nThere is no battle theory behind Leigie of Sloth. His attack techniques are laughably simple.\nIt is… suppression by pure power\nA power strong enough to rip apart a normal Demon Lord… a mass of Soul.\nIn it, ordinary technique held no meaning, and he has no thoughts to utilize such technique.\nWith every blow, Leigie’s arms let out ominous sounds.\nI’m pushing him back.\nBut there isn’t any anguish on his face, and while I may be able to make him use up power with blows of this level, it isn’t enough to deal a decisive blow.\nHe’s too hard. But I knew that from the beginning.\nThe fact that I was pushing back the Lord of Sloth served to strengthen my 『Overrule』 even further. Power flows up from the depths of my body.\nAnd finally, my kick breaks his guard, and Leigie is sent flying through the last layer of ceiling.\nA blood-red sky, and the black structure of the Castle of Shadows… the fortress expanded as far as my vision would permit.\nOnce per day, I take it to look over it from on top of the tower. We’re not as high up as the tower, but the sight from up here isn’t something to be made fun of.\nI’ve always felt a sense of resignation at the fact that this spectacle would crumble one day.\nThe soldiers keeping watch hurriedly came running to me at having the ceiling be penetrated.\n“W-what happened, Heard-sama?”\n“There is no need for the likes of you to mind it. Return to your post.”\n“Y-yes. Understood sir!”\nIt’s all a trivial talk.\nI leisurely look over the fortress, as I advance towards the falling Leigie.\n“Father, don’t you think it’s beautiful?”\n“… Yeah.”\nWithout even taking a glance at his surroundings, the motives behind his answers are something I’ll never understand.\nSo this is just self-satisfaction.\nHis suspicious eyes, his black, impure pupils look up at me.\nEmotionless eyes. The eyes of a dead fish.\nI harden the palm of my hand to create a blade shape with it.\n(TL: He’s doing tegatana, , a position usually used to chop. In this instance, he’s using it to pierce)\n“Next, I’ll be cutting.”\n“… I give up.”\n“……”\nAll of this is something I’ve seen too many times.\nThat conduct, fooled by his sloppy gesture, dozens of Demon Lords have fallen.\nBut for me, I, his son, am the only one who understands. This man actually pulls through when the time calls for it.\nHe needs no fighting spirit or killing intent. Just so that he can slack off further, Leigie uses his power.\nTherefore, he hasn’t fled yet. Even though he could have jumped far away with his teleportation by now.\n… It’s because he thinks running from me here holds no meaning.\nLet it be so.\nThus is what signifies him as the Lord of Sloth\nHe doesn’t want to fight, but I’m a pain, so he’ll try and crush me.\nHis impure motives that paint out the Fighting Spirit of most Demons is the proof of his desire.\nThe contrast between him and what most would think of Sloth is what has made many Demons, Demon Lords fall. I always observed that aspect of him in great detail.\nEven now, Leigie’s power is gradually declining. He’s accumulated enormous reserves, so it’s hard to notice, but while his power may seem close to infinite, it is infinite by no means.\nIf I retreated here, and challenged him again once my condition was perfect once more, I’ll bet I would be able to gain an even greater advantage.\nBut that choice is impossible. Leaving to gain an advantage?\nWhy must I draw back for a petty reason like that!?\n“… Hm, you have no need to offer me that treatment. There’s no way I would ever lose regardless.”\n“… Yeah, you’re the strongest.”\nThe flaming sun of the Demon World shined on us with its blood red light.\nIt was a sight that had been there from the moment I was created, and at the same time, it’s a scene Leigie has looked upon for long before that.\nLeigie speaks with a troubled voice.\nAt the same time, masses of power are lowered on me from the sky.\n『Sky Right Hand』 and 『Sky Left Hand』.\nA telekinetic power that works in tandem with his arms. It’s a worthless skill used to pick up items without having to move, but its explosive power are a threat as they try to crush me.\nBut the mass of power dispersed. I 『Overruled』 that skill in a time long passed. My preparations are perfect.\nLeigie makes an obvious frown.\n“… This is a pain.”\n“… Hm, I think you just take life too easily, Father.”\nIt’s likely that in his endlessly long life, this is one of the first times he’s had one of his Skills nullified.\nI’m the opposite. Because 『Superbia』 is a nature of pride, I already know most skills. The opponents I fight often try to make countermeasures for me, but I was able to crush them all head-on.\nFather has merely lived life without aim. Just how useless of a truth.\nIn just a step, I made contact with him. I stomp on his head. There is resistance. There is, but he hasn’t been crushed.\nI stick my hand into his shoulder.\nIt’s a dull feeling, as If I was cutting through metal. The level of hardness caused my palm to be the one creaking this time.\nA wet and cold sensation. Leigie looked up at me with meaningless eyes, and looking at his shoulder, he raised a short scream.\nIt’s working. I’m able to pierce his defense.\nI remove my hand from the hole in the shoulder, and shake off the blood on my hand before starting a series of consecutive attacks.\nLeigie disappears. But my soul hardened through battle made me perceive his next location instantly.\nTen meters behind. That’s a distance I can span almost instantaneously.\nAs I turn around, I lunge with my hand blade.\nIt pierces through Leigie’s prepared arms, and fresh blood flies.\nSlow. Way too slow.\nHe can probably follow me with his eyes. But his body that he rarely moves is unable to dodge.\nAs long as he doesn’t use that teleportation with high energy expenditure.\nI nullify the 『Sky Hand』 he sends straight at me.\nTo still try and use it after coming to this point, does he really have no other offensive skills?\nThat seems right. A Demon’s Skills have rules. It’s impossible to specialize in both offense and defense at the same time.\nAnd Sloth skills are made to spend time in Sloth. They’re mostly passives, and few can be actively called upon.\nEven without a sense of pain, thinking it was bad to take attacks consecutively, Leigie disappears again.\nI perceive. A massive power moved to the top of the tower.\nOn top of the tallest building within the Castle of Shadows.\nSprawled out on top of the conical roof, the eyes of Leigie as he looks down on me are sleepy, meaning he wasn’t leaving a break in his defenses.\nThe distance is a few hundred meters. But to me, that distance is close to Zero.\nThe second I was about to jump at him, a strange breaking sound resounded through the fortress.\nA brown object stands up.\nMuch less an expression, its brown head doesn’t even have eyes, nose or mouth.\nIts long and narrow body, as well as its long limbs were all made of dirt-like material, and by barely glancing over its body, it’s easy to see it was made to resemble human form.\nNo matter how vast the Demon World may be, I doubt there exists a Demon with this shape.\nA Skill to produce a Doll that grows.\nThe skill that constitutes the reason Leigie’s title is Slaughterdolls.\n『Slaughter Doll』.\nI remember myself when I had just been born, and frown.\n“… Hm, useless.”\nThere’s no way a freshly born Doll made by a hard-pressed Leigie would be a match for me.\nEven if…\nI look over the army of dolls being constructed around me without any emotions or sense of pain.\n… their numbers surpass a hundred.\nI bring my hand down on the closest Doll, and split it in two.\nThere was some resistance, but I don’t even need to dodge against things of this level.\nI confirm the brown substance left on my hand.\n“… Dirt… no, a Doll with sand as the base…”\nHe probably used the traces of sand that had built up on top of the fortress as the base to create them.\nTruly, to be able to birth this much at once is a threat.\nBut for him to use up his own power for such a useless skill was an option I thought he wouldn’t choose.\nEven is this skill was all he had left.\nI look up at Father standing high in the heavens.\n“… Father, is this supposed to be your final struggle…?”\nHaving been born first, there’s no way I’ll lose.\nIf you add on 『Superbia』’s characteristics, then more so.\nThe clay dolls rushing at me are definitely fast, and their power isn’t weak.\nBut that’s it. Without any desire, and no experience.\nBut still, crushing this amount will be a pain.\nI close my eyes, and activate a skill.\n『Hard Pressure』\nA higher class Pride Skill.\nIt’s a worthless skill to force others to kneel. But it’s a useful one for thinning out the weak.\nUnable to stand the pressure, the limitless Dolls fell to the ground.\nI step on the nearest Doll’s head, and crush it.\nHow useless. Or is it that he thought those numbers would be able to defeat me?\n“… I’ll be up in a moment, Father.”\nI put power into my legs. I circulate my magic. I deliver a strong kick to the stone pavement.\nMighty physical prowess. The pitiful clay dolls prostrated on the ground and everything else on earth is left behind me, and my field of vision instantly ascended.\n… In the distant past, I’ve made it so I could fly anywhere.\nEven if Father doesn’t lend me a hand.\nI grab onto the tower’s pointed tip, to kill my momentum and stuck my feet into the roof tiles.\nThe sprawled out Leigie comes at me with quick movements I’ve never seen before. But even that is too slow.\nBy that time, my hand had already pierced father’s left breast… a Demon’s heart, the place where his Soul Core lay.\nLeigie’s eyes distort in shock, as he looks at his chest.\n“Good night, Father. Please leave the rest to me.”\n“… Yeah…”\nMy hand has definitely crushed his heart.\nHis Abyss Zone fades.\nWhen I removed my hand, the Lord of Depravity leisurely fell to the ground.\nAnd like dried leaves, he began to fall down to the bottom of the tower.\nI Overruled him. But I don’t feel the slightest sense of achievement.\nHaving fulfilled the final piece of my 『Pride』, my instincts told me I had finally reached Demon Lord Level.\nAt the very least, for now, let me offer a prayer to the Great Lazy King.\nThus, I will rule over everything, and offer it up to my late Master.\nThere is nothing more appropriate for the curtain call.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Superbia, Part 4: … How Useless\nIn this world, everything is nothing but a trifle.\nThat little girl Kanon becoming the Great Demon King must be the end of the world, and with her trying to suppress not only the Heavens, but even the Demon World, this situation really is the worst.\nFor me, who even took down my Supreme Master, they’re no enemies of me. It’s obvious.\nIf it’s now, then even God can fall by my hand.\nI clench the palm of my hand. My power has increased.\nMy Pride Tree which had stagnated because I was unable to become a Demon Lord suddenly experienced frightening growth.\nEnlarging perception. The new Skill I obtained, 『Abyss Zone』 instantly spread to cover the Castle of Shadows that had lost its master.\nDiffering from the Acedia Father released, a Superbia power that seemed to push down on people from above.\nBut in it, I didn’t feel exaltation or anything. Not even a feeling of achievement.\nEven though there should be nothing standing above me anymore.\n“… Hm, everything is useless, I see.”\nNot a single enemy for me exists within this Demon World.\nEven the one selected as the most powerful Demon Lord, Kanon of Ruin… for me that’s known her since her childhood, I doubt she can rival me. For my Pride, it was an overwhelming predominance.\nThe Demons I pass look at me, and kneel as they lower their heads.\nWhat useless folk. Without even proceeding their desires, they’re fools who content themselves in naught but what is given to them by others.\nAfter fulfilling my pride, I only had one place to aim for.\nI wandered to the Lord’s Throne Room. The throne that no one had ever sat in before stood there silently.\nMetal that was exceedingly rare, even in the Demon World was skillfully worked on by artisans for many months and years to construct the jet-black throne.\nI’ll bet it’s cleaned regularly. In that space without a speck of dust, as if it were sleeping just like father, the air was filled with a quiet and tranquil atmosphere.\nWithout faltering, I lowered myself into the seat that had never been sat on once. The throne was merely hard, and cold.\nI have no suitable enemies in this Demon World. I also don’t have the incentive to go bully that little girl Kanon.\nI put my elbow on the armrest, and thought.\n“If there’s nothing for me in the Demon World… then should I go invade Heaven…”\nI recall the small, hateful, pure-white wings of God’s vanguard.\nBy nature, those ones have a large superiority complex against Demons. I’ll destroy them head-on. It’ll at least help kill some time.\nAnd even in the heavens, it will resound in every direction.\nMy name. And the name of the Great King of Depravity.\nThe door is violently thrown open.\nThe one who entered was a crimson-haired Demon by the name of Lize Bloodcross. At the same time, like Kanon once was, she’s the woman who was Father’s inspector.\nHer fiery glare that was like a raging fire incarnate, and her looks were that of an angry soul.\nShe’s a foolish female Demon who, of all things, asked a Superbia like me to preserve the lives of Deije and Medea, who had failed their mission.\n“…! Heard Lauder. What is the meaning…”\n“… Hm, Father has perished.”\n“Perished!? Leigie of Sloth!? Just what could possibly…”\nShe’s a woman who says useless things.\nThere’s no way father could be taken down by an existence apart from mine.\n“I killed him. Go tell that little girl Kanon. Leigie-sama’s authority… will be succeeded by me.”\nI use Evil Eyes.\nLize’s body goes rigid.\nI see, so this is 『Evil Eye』. This is the first I’m using it, but what a useless Skill.\nSubjugating an opposing force holds meaning only if it is by one’s hand alone.\n“You are… a Demon Lord!? Gu… Heard Lauder. Could it be that by killing your Lord…”\nKilling one’s master. That is Superbia’s long-lived desire.\nPride become pride by overruling everything superior to them.\n“You’re a slow woman, aren’t you. That’s what I just told you. There won’t be a second time. Go tell Kanon. Don’t bring trouble to my hand.”\n“… Why did Leigie-sama… to the likes of you…”\nWhat an obstinate woman.\nI stand, and use a Skill.\nThe Skills I obtained upon reaching Lord Class will definitely come into use in the upcoming war. There is nothing to be lost in training them.\nMy thoughts accelerate. The world stops for a moment.\nMy body is light.\nIn a single step, I approach her, grab her by the neck, and lift her.\nIt wasn’t until her neck was strangled that Lize showed surprise for the first time.\n“Gu… wha… go…”\n“I told you there wasn’t a second time… Hm, to be lead inspector at this level, their quality sure has dropped over the years.”\nFrail. Way too frail. Compared to Leigie-sama, just how frail is this world?\nIf I just put in a little power, it feels everything will break.\nLize’s face is tinted purple. Her Flames of Wrath lick my arms, but for me who’s even Overruled Kanon’s flames, there’s no way it would work.\n…Hm, useless. There’s not even any worth in killing her.\nWith one hand, I throw her at the wall. I did make sure to hold back. I doubt she’ll die from that.\nYou still have the crucial job of reporting my words to Kanon.\nEverything is moving slowly.\nThis is one of the Skills of a Demon Lord of Pride.\n『The Only Lord』\nIt greatly elevates one’s speed of perception, to make the world your own.\nIt’s the furthest land of pride that holds meaning only since I’ve trained my body to this level.\nMe sitting back on the throne, and Lize hitting the wall happened almost simultaneously.\nThe room shakes greatly, and pebbles fall from up high.\nThe Castle of Shadows is, in itself, father’s mausoleum.\nI’ll have to fix it up and renovate it. In place of a fortress, a splendid palace.\nI’ll also have to reorganize the army.\nNeither Medea nor Deije are here anymore.\nNaturally, there’s also the option of me venturing forth alone.\nThe reason three brigades existed was largely because father never went out himself.\n“… The world is in my hands, is it?”\nJust how much value does the world hold?\nIf I get my hands on all of it, will I understand that? Just what was the Superbia Great Demon King of old thinking of when he tried to get his hands on it?\nIt sounds to me like a completely worthless notion, but so be it.\nDominate the entire world, and making my name known across it doesn’t sound bad as a temporary goal.\n“… Heard-sama…”\n“Enter.”\nA reserved knock came from the door. I already recognize this existence. A demon Lord’s perception is far wider than a normal Demon’s. But even if I weren’t a Demon Lord, I probably would have noticed.\nThat’s just how excited that presence was.\nThe one who entered with a slightly stiff face was Hiero.\nA Demon of Pride. The younger sister of Lorna of Lust, and a woman who pursues pride with a path different to mine.\nPerhaps because the door was opened, or because a hole had been made in the wall, a cold air drifts in.\n“… You crushed Leigie-sama, didn’t you.”\n“Yeah, Leigie-sama was strong.”\n“… Congratulations, your Demon Lord Excellency. I, Hiero will serve you with all my might.”\n“… Hm, cease with the useless babble. What business do you have with me?”\n“Ye… yes!”\nHer expression as she kneeled was pale, and there are tears surfacing in her eyes. Even without looking at her, I can tell her arms and legs are shaking lightly.\nFear… is it?\nWhat a useless Demon. Even if you hold reverence for the strong, if you remain fearful, you’ll never be able to Overrule them.\nThat is the lone taboo among Pride.\n“The truth is… well…”\n“Make it short. You won’t get another chance.”\n“… Medea escaped.”\n“… I see.”\nI glare at Hiero. What a useless woman.\nTo let an Envy Demon that had weakened to that extent escape, just how incorrigible is she?\nDisgrace. That is the most unforgivable deed to me. This doesn’t change even if the other side’s a Pride Demon like me.\nI stand before her.\nI understand the true colors of the fear on her face.\nI’ve seen it countless times in my long years of life… The eyes of prey as they look upon their predator.\nA smart woman.\nShe thinks much better than her sister.\nAnd she is likely correct.\nIf she tried to run away for her failure, even if she fled to the greatest depths of hell, I would chase her down and kill her.\nKill her with all certainty. Slay her gruesomely. Make her regret being born into this world.\nBut since she reported it herself, I’ll bury her in a single blow.\n“Let’s hear your final words.”\nWhat returned from Hiero’s lips wasn’t a plea for life.\nWith a shaking voice, she looked up at me.\n“… Please tell my just one thing. After overruling even Leigie-sama, what is there left for you to do, Heard-sama.”\n“… Hm, that’s obvious, is it not? I’ll…”\n… Take the world in my hand, and have Leigie-sama’s name ring true through it.\nWhen I was about to say that, Hiero let out a light sneeze.\nI knit my brow. Seeing my expression, she hurriedly makes an apology.\n“I-I deeply apologize. It’s just that… it’s so cold…”\nHiero holds her arms, and not out of fear for me, shakes her body.\nIt definitely is cold. Before I noticed it, Frost had begun to set in on the floor. The room’s temperature is already well below freezing point.\nThe hole in the wall is quite far, and until a little while ago, it shouldn’t have been this cold.\nThis is a clearly abnormal situation.\n“… Strange. What is happening?”\nIf I look back on my few million year of existence, I don’t think something like this has happened before.\nUnlike Hiero, as a Demon Lord, I have a Resistance to cold. This level poses no problem.\nBut it’s unsettling that I don’t know the cause.\nHiero sneezes once more, and offers another excuse.\n“… T-today sure is cold, isn’t it…”\n“… Don’t be stupid, there’s no way the temperature can drop this low in the middle of the day.”\nIn the first place, even normal Demons should have enough Resistances to let them pay no mind to fluctuations in temperature on the level of natural phenomena.\nI probe through everywhere within my Zone.\nBut searching with a Skill I was using for the first time didn’t really feel right in my hands. The further I tried to look, the duller my senses became.\nAbnormal Weather? It definitely is winter, but this is…\nLize finally gets up from the crushed wall. Her hair clings to her face due to the blood flowing from it, but I can see a sharp glare coming from the gaps in it.\n“Heard Lauder. I won’t accept it. To kill your lord…”\n“… Hm. I never had the intention of getting you to accept it.”\nThe right to decide lies with Kanon alone.\nAnd even if Kanon doesn’t accept me, then I just have to rule everything and all will be settled.\nLize’s body is clad in crimson flame. The frost on the ground instantly evaporates, and disappears into the air.\nIt’s a higher class Ira Skill.\n『Breath of Flame』.\nWhat useless power. For you, who hasn’t even become a Demon Lord, you won’t even be able to scratch me.\nThat’s the simple gap in our magic. Unless the difference is great enough, you cannot overturn an Overrule.\nOur eyes clash. Compared to Kanon, just how thin is her Wrath. Diminutive. Your Wrath is lacking greatly in something called weight.\nOnto the Raging Lize’s side, Hiero shook as she walked.\nBased on her positioning, I thought she was going to ask for help, but she just began warming herself.\nI look at her dumbfounded. Lize is the same. Hiero’s eyes are open wide, and she squats.\n“… What the hell are you doing?”\n“…Uu… it’s cold…”\nThe form of her shaking as she held up the palms of her hand to the flame could only be looked on as a joke, given the situation, but the individual was quite desperate.\nBut even so… the temperature has fallen even lower than before.\nLize doesn’t matter anymore. I can kill her in an instant, and her attacks can’t even be compared to a deteriorated Kanon. I can Overrule her.\nBut this cold is dangerous. That’s what my accumulated and sharpened experience was telling me.\nAs she shakes, Hiero looks up at me.\n“… Heard-sama, did you properly deliver a finishing blow to Leigie-sama?”\n“I crushed his Soul Core. He’s perished without a doubt.”\nOnce their Soul Core heart is destroyed, a Demon cannot continue to exist.\n“Then why is it so cold… it’s definitely related in some way…”\nI understand what she’s trying to say.\nLet it be so.\nWith this timing, it’s unthinkable that there’s no correlation.\nBut there should be no Sloth Skill to drop temperature. At the very least, I’ve never bared witness to one in my many years of life. In the first place, a Demon’s Desire can take shape in the Flames of Wrath, but there is no variant that controls ice.\nThe moment I begun to frown, I sensed something unbelievable happen.\nAs if a pillar of ice had been inserted into my spine, a cold impact ran up my body.\n“… My 『Zone』 was broken, you say…”\n“… Kusu kusu, see~ it’s because you didn’t see Leigie-sama off ‘til the end… achoo.”\n“… You, I’m surprised you can laugh at a time like this…”\nThe atmosphere is repainted.\nFrom a heavy pressurized air… to a frozen, dark and gloomy one.\nIt was definitely not the familiar 『Acedia』 of my father.\nIt’s not Greed or Lust or Wrath or Gluttony or Envy or even Pride.\nLize’s face distorts.\n“Wh at… this presence is…”\n“What Demon Lord is this… no, is it even a Demon Lord?”\nThe instant I perceived it, my legs arbitrarily began to race towards it.\nMy vision flows by with great speed.\nI hold no interest in either Lize or Hiero.\nThere’s no way any interest would rise towards existences I could just kill off at any time.\nSilver curtains had been lowered on the Castle of Shadows.\nWhite piled up snow, and large pillars of ice that even extended to the ceiling.\nAnd… the suspended form of the retainers.\nWith pale expressions of fear, the hardened retainer’s body shook.\nCold… He’s been completely frozen.\n“… Hm, this definitely isn’t natural.”\nThe magic lurking here is the same as what broke my Zone.\nSloth and Greed and Lust and Gluttony and Pride, and even Wrath that had the corresponding flames to deal with it, everything had been frozen indiscriminately.\nThe closer and closer I got to the mass of power, the lower the temperature fell.\nOn the way forward, I spotted a familiar Demon, and stopped for a moment.\nLorna had been frozen with a peaceful expression as she pushed a cart.\nThere was no fear on her face. Without being given the time to fear, she had been frozen instantly.\nWhat frightening power.\nThis output rivals the flames of Ira.\nThis scope rivals the wave of Gula.\nInteresting.\nHow suitable for my first opponent as a Demon Lord.\nI’m starting to see the future my new power holds.\nI can’t help but start to see it take shape.\nHiero already said it, but for an opponent to be able to use skills with this output, if you ignore the possibility of an outside invader, there’s only one within the Castle of Shadows.\nNo… there should only be one.\nThe door had been frozen shut with pale blue ice.\nI forcefully ripped open the door to Father’s room.\nIt was as if all time in the room had stopped.\nOn the sight that entered my eyes, I felt my own heart become astir.\nEverything was covered in frost, and the temperature pierced even through my cold Resistance. Within that frozen land, a single man sat on an armchair with his knees hugged close to his body.\nIt’s definitely my father, whose Soul Core should have been crushed. It’s so quiet I cannot even tell whether he’s alive or dead.\n… I try to take a step forward, and instinctively recall my leg.\nI look down on my foot, and open my eyes wide.\n“… What… is this…”\nMy leg had been completely frozen over.\nI have no feeling in it. There’s not even any pain. As if it had been reduced to inorganic substance, its smooth and shiny surface catches the light in a dubious way.\nI try putting the palm of my hand to it. It’s extremely hard, and cold. A dim pain runs up my arm.\nResistance type skills generally grow the more you take damage from that attribute. I did have a resistance to the flames of Wrath, but I only have a low level one for ice.\nIf you ask why… of the skills permitted to Demons by the Seven Original Sins, from the start, there were no ice attribute attacks.\nI unintentionally sighed.\n“Father… for you to be hiding a trump card this severe…”\nIt’s a power I never anticipated.\nMy sigh freezes in the air, and a faint sound rings out as it falls to the floor as small beads of ice.\nI take a step into the room. A silver world close to absolute zero. Without sound, or dust or anything to exist to taint the pure air.\nBy the time my half-frozen feet had stepped forward, ice quickly began encroaching all over my body.\nIt’s as I thought. The temperature in this room is on another level from that outside. The area ahead’s sealed off with a barrier, it seems.\n“… But there is nothing more suitable for the one that is Master.”\nThat’s right. I thought I had won all too easily. I thought that there was no way that was all he had.\nI mean, when it looked like it was over, there wasn’t a single wound on my body.\nThe encroaching ice stops.\nAs if I would be done in by something like a barrier.\nMy pride alone is the only thing I’ve taken with me into this dead world.\nEvery time I take a step ahead, a wave of power burns my skin.\nIts outputs falls in no way short of Wrath. The zone doesn’t permit resistance, and this frozen-over stagnant world can be none other than Father’s perfect world.\nA cruel world where neither my speed nor my power hold any meaning.\nIf I don’t exert all of my power, I would turn to ice in an instant. Just like the Demons outside.\n“… Well, well… how useless am I…”\nBut breaking everything head on is my Superbia.\nPlans are unnecessary before my Pride.\nMy memories resurface.\nAlways alone, the one who stood above me. My absolute creator.\nNo matter how much his actions and appearance were of Sloth, that all was irrelevant.\nThe power of Sloth. Just having that was enough.\nAh, just how strong, how beautiful it is.\nIn the vast Demon World, and even the heavens, there cannot exist something this complete, this beautiful.\nAnd that’s exactly why I have meaning.\n“… I will surpass this.”\nI really know not when to give up.\nI don’t know by what theory he still lives when his Soul Core was crushed, but once more, I’ll sink you into the depths of Sheol.\nI declare to my Master, whose head is lowered into the knees he hugged to himself.\nHis unmoving arms, which were already white, have surpassed that, and they’ve become transparent like ice.\nWhite frost has descended on his hair as black as mine.\nHis form was so lifeless, I almost lost interest in attacking.\nThe distance is half a meter. If I extend my hand, I can reach him easily. But his fleeting existence was one that felt as if it would break if I set my hand on it.\nAt that moment, father’s face slowly rose.\nLike glass balls, his emotionless eyes looked at me without any meaning. The glint in them had much more color than before, and his eyes were filled with much more dark despair.\nEven for one who had served him forever, it was the first time I saw that expression.\nAnd Father’s mouth that barely did any work opened ever-so-slightly, and began to move.",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Melancholia, Part 1: I Met a Single Hero\nThis is perhaps the oldest memory I have.\nOf when I hadn’t even become a Demon Lord, and was just a bit of a Lazy Demon.\nI met a single Hero. She was a Hero with lovely silver hair, and her strength… looking back now, I can say she wasn’t particularly strong. Anyways, she had transparent courage like a diamond, and her eyes held a strong will honed like a blade. Including my past life, she was the most beautiful thing I gazed upon.\nSerge of the Silver Blue. That was the Hero’s name.\nJust a little bit stronger than others, just a little bit talented, and incidentally, a little bit courageous. The name of a girl with nothing but that to her name.\nThe name of a warrior, who, even though it was the most she could do to defeat Demons of the lowest rank, she held reckless dreams, and descended into the Demon World by her lonesome self.\nCompared to Humans, the Demon World’s Demons are transcendentally strong.\nTherefore, a teenage girl challenging the Demon World was, without any discussion, simply foolish, and it’s probable that her luck was exceedingly good for me to have been the first one she met. I won’t move.\nMy fight with Serge was the height of violence.\nAgainst me, who simply remained limp and sprawled out, the aloof Hero continued to swing her Holy Sword alone.\nHer will, and spirit were sufficient in themselves, but the difference in power was clear as day. Those attacks were only barely able to scratch me, and those wounds instantly disappeared. I didn’t have any Skills that could kill Serge, nor did I have the will, and Serge’s power was only barely able to overcome my VIT.\nIt was a foolish repetition of the same act over and over again, a death match that would never end. Perhaps it wasn’t something that could even be called a battle. If I had to say, I had the advantage, but even with it, I lacked the means to issue a decisive blow.\nEven so, the girl who didn’t take a step back even after encountering a situation that would go on for eternity’s way of life was definitely that of a Hero, and it made me recall that this was indeed another world.\nAnd at the same time, I thought. If I worked hard enough that I oozed blood, if I trained my heart out, if I became strong, I could defeat this Hero.\nThat might be fine for me.\nDemon Lords are ones who eventually have to subjugate Heroes. Even for one who rarely played any games in my past life, I at least knew that. For the Demon Lord, that was the Happy Ending. It’s not like I’m living here because I like it. It’s just because I hate death that I continue to live on…\n… But even that, if it’s for this Hero’s sake, I thought I could endure it.\nOur reunion happened five years later. I had counted the days, so I remember it clearly.\nSerge had grown.\nFrom a girl who, while strong for a human, compared to Demons, wasn’t particularly strong; who couldn’t kill a single Demon of Sloth, and where the only thing that excelled in her was her courage, to one who, could take on a General Class Demon who was born, raised and trained in this great warring era one on one. Top Class within all of humanity… their supreme blade.\nIn game terms, perhaps she was a broken character.\nNo, that would be an insult to her. I have no idea just how much training she put in. Enough to make her spit up blood, where if a constantly enervated individual like me were to undertake it, I would give in in a few minutes. There’s no doubt she repeated a training like that. In those five years, how many adventures has she had? For someone who did nothing but sleep like me, I had no ways of knowing.\nWhat I know is but two things. Two simple truths.\nShe had become a Hero who could evenly match blows with a General Class Demon.\nAnd I had become a Demon Lord.\nThis age, this world is cruel, fleeting, and useless.\nThe Demon World obeys the laws of the jungle. My Sloth had surpassed Serge’s effort. That is all.\nThe fighting spirit Serge devoted her life to, the blade that was once able to deliver the slightest of scratches to me, couldn’t even cut a strand of my hair by the time we met again. An insurmountable gap had been born between us.\nIt’s not always certain that hard work will be rewarded.\nThat miserable and desolate law from my past life applied to this world as well.\nThis is something I can only say after having seen the result.\nEven though Serge could barely scratch me in the first match, she didn’t feel she had to retreat. That as long as she could injure me in the slightest, it was her duty to kill me. That was her first, and last chance. And as she was a human, she was unable to escape the shackles of her lifespan. She had lost that opportunity for all eternity.\nShe shed tears as she held her sword aloft. That Hero’s eyes were, just as when we first met, beautiful, and ephemeral, and looking at the edge of her blade that sparkled like a shooting star, I became sleepy, and dozed off.\nWhen I awoke, what entered my eyes was the form of a kneeling Hero with large tears streaming down her face.\nThe Holy Sword had lost its light, and having been reduced to a normal hunk of iron, it had been casually pierced into the ground.\nThere wasn’t a single wound on Serge. That’s obvious. It’s because I haven’t laid a single finger on her. But the Hero who would always fight on, no matter what serious injuries she suffered, even if an arm or a leg were blown off, had been reduced to a sobbing little girl.\nNot a fragment of fighting spirit remains in her hollow eyes.\nIt was as if I had broken something within her.\nFrom the moment I first met her, what I felt probably was love. Probably. I don’t remember it anymore, but looking back, I think it might have been something like that.\nHowever, in the end, I cannot remember what became of that Hero. All I know is that the exploits of the one called the overworld’s shining star of hope, Serge of the Silver Blue came to an end that day.\n… The King of Depravity.\nIt had always been strange.\nIt was always one of the questions I had from the time I reincarnated.\nWhy do the other demons have that fiery black glint in their souls? Why do they rage and seek and despise and violate and eat and envy?\nWhy can’t they just quietly sleep?\nIf they want power as a Demon… just sleeping would be more than enough.\nWhy do they try so hard to be active?\nA Demon’s body, if it does nothing but sleep, unlike the humans who can live a hundred years at most, can live hundreds and thousands and millions of years. An endless time, it seems.\nI realized that that was a mistake a long time later.\nAn uncountable number of years passed. I put a countless number of Demons, Heroes and even Angels to sleep, and eventually, someone started calling me some useless name like the『King of Depravity』. When I had become widely acknowledged, I finally realized it.\nAh, this is their nature.\nTo them, raging, and seeking, and despising, and violating, and envying is their very reason for living, and the validation for their life.\nWhat a useless talk. It’s not that they can’t sleep. They can’t bring themselves to stay sleeping. In order to refine their souls.\nTo summarize, our resolve was different, and for the Demon Lord of Sloth who simply lived without any meaning, it was likely something he would never be able to understand in his entire overly-long life.\nI was never thinking of anything. Power never really mattered. I never had any plans to prove my existence.\nFrom the time I lived in peaceful Japan, I barely had any desire. No hobbies. In the space left by my lack of purpose, sleep was the only thing that could fill my heart.\nApparently, this isn’t an uncommon story for youths living in modern society. If they were to be reincarnated into this world, they might all end up as Sloth Demons like me.\nI never had a goal. If you forced me to say it, then Sloth itself was my goal, and compared to the Demons who were longing for the power that lay at the end of their desires, that is probably the reason I was able to become a Demon Lord more quickly.\nA Boring story.\nA world where idleness turns into hard work.\nTo me, who did nothing but sleep… to me, who did nothing but sleep meaninglessly, Demons and Humans and Angels got on their knees. Within them, there were even other Demons of Sloth.\nDepravity? Wrong. To me, this is just my life style.\nI’m one who will do what I must when the time comes. It’s just that that time never came for me.\nJust by closing my eyes, I could gradually feel my own power increasing. I didn’t care.\nThe skills I could use, the things I could do gradually increased. Proportionally, the scope of my activities gradually narrowed. With the power of my Skills, I didn’t need to eat or use the restroom. Even breathing became unnecessary. But I didn’t care about that either.\n… Please, just let me sleep.\nA break of a week can put your sense of time in a mess. At the very least, that’s how it was for me.\nA week became a day, and I started to feel them as seconds. But I didn’t need time. Only years started passing. The enemies and allies around me change.\nI wasn’t counting, but probably after around eighty years had passed.\nWhen even sleeping started to feel like a pain, I noticed. No, perhaps it’s something new I obtained at that time.\nA power to put myself to sleep.\nJust as the Sloth Skill Tree had awakened in me, like an adjoined tree of interlocking branches, a single new Skill Line.\n『Melancholia』\nOf Sloth that governs cold despair, and anxiety, a Subtree.\nAnd once more, the meaningless loser was able to lie around like garbage.\nWhere effort and training and even emotions held no meaning, a world covered in pure darkness.\nIt was, like a thin layer of ice, cold, fleeting, and beautiful.",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Melancholia, Part 2: I’m Not Satisfied With This World Yet\n“It’s really… depressing.”\nMaking a small sound, the air loses its heat and freezes.\nIt’s cold. Nothing but cold. As if from the depths of my body, the depths of my heart, heat was stolen away.\nBut at the same time, Sloth’s cold resistance isn’t one that can be breached by temperature of this level.\nIt was a lovely silver world.\nEverything was white and frozen solid, and the air that had lost any speck of dust was as serene as a high mountain peak.\nBefore my eyes, a man had completely frozen.\nA black-haired, tall man. Even from over his clothes, I could clearly see his trained body and magic. In his eyes that had been suspended in an open state, what was reflected was resignation and anxiety, and at the same time, strong delight. His mouth had curved into a smile.\nI extend my legs from the armchair, and gently stand up. From my feet, I feel a piercing cold like never before, but I grit my teeth, and endure it.\nMy power of Sloth has declined. Sloth doesn’t even permit standing.\nIt’s not that I don’t stand up. I can’t stand. I can’t move. Such is the curse of Sloth.\nBut to someone like me who doesn’t care about power, I don’t care about that concept either.\nPerhaps because the origin of my power has shifted to Melancholia, my heart was simply heavy.\nI gently put my hand on the man’s solid expression.\nIt’s a familiar face. He’s a man who’s attached himself to me since times long passed. I don’t remember his name, but his appearance had been firmly etched into my mind.\n“… Are you satisfied yet…”\n“…”\nWith a cracking sound, through my finger, the power from the right of my chest, from the second Soul Core that manifested upon me unlocking Melancholia expanded.\nAround the man whose figure had been frozen, water circles, and he’s encased in a block of ice.\nIt’s a 『Melancholia』 Skill to birth a coffin of ice.\n『Freezing Grave』.\nI walk past the man who had completely become a pillar of ice.\nI guess it’s been around a hundred years since my birth, and never have I properly fought or even trained.\nEven so, why is it that in this world where strength is everything, I have yet to face a single loss?\nI like sleeping.\nI like lying on top of the bed without any purpose, and wasting time on nothingness.\nBeing able to eat without doing anything is wonderful, and I’m relatively pleased that the cleaning gets done without me.\nIt was something I could never get my hands on back when I was living in Japan.\nEven so, I relatively like the thing called hard work. No, more than like, I believed in it.\nI’m not going to do it though.\nEven so, I can believe in whatever I want, right?\n“What a worthless world… this Demon World…”\nMore so than the Demon World, this entire world is worthless.\nThis world is harsh and cruel.\nEarth had its fair share of cruelties, but this Demon World is much more brutal.\nI just didn’t pay mind to it.\nNo, I didn’t forgive it.\nThat Serge, who repeated severe training and sharpened her fangs to take down a Demon Lord was defeated by a man who never did anything.\nMy broken Sloth Soul Core leisurely restores itself. In proportion to that, my head got heavier.\nIt’s depressing. It’s just depressing.\nThe cold darkness that had piled up in the depths of my heart.\nThat feeling I occasionally felt even while I was sleeping was probably the reason behind me unlocking Melancholia. In the past, I always felt depressed before stepping out to go to work or to school, so perhaps that could have been the cause, but I have no means of confirming that, and I don’t care.\nMy vision grows darker.\nI pass through the door that had been frozen open.\nThe floor that had been lightly dusted with frost was instantly covered in ice. With a crunching sound below me, I ran down the corridor.\nMy perception that extended over my entire territory was extremely troublesome, and no matter how much time passes, I’ll never get used to it.\nBecause of my muddy stream of emotions, I slumped with my arm against the wall. Centered around the point I touched, a white power expands. Without a single sound, everything is covered in perpetually constant ice.\nIn the past, when I first reincarnated into this world, there was one who taught me about Skills.\nIf you’ll let me be honest for a moment, I didn’t know what they meant.\nOf the powers Demons possessed, there were ones that, of Skills themselves, they stole and copied and nullified and ate and annihilated, and other incomprehensible stuff, it seems. There were unfathomable powers with which in one hit, everything would be over. It was too much.\nI thought it was impossible.\nNonsense. I don’t want to die yet.\nAnd there shouldn’t be anyone out there that wants to. I mean, it’s not like the world of hell is certain to be easier than the one we live in.\nThose feelings were ones I held in my previous life, at least up to the point I died, and even after having lived a long life as a Demon, they haven’t changed a bit.\nAnd so, I didn’t lose. And so, I’m still alive. Without thinking anything, I took down those incomprehensible powers.\nSeparated from the flow of time, I shut myself in with nothing but the Acedia Card to protect my body, and the one that would indiscriminately suspend my functioning and bring me into that dark world, the Melancholia Card.\nI’ve only ever wished one thing from those two trump cards.\n… Please, just let me sleep. In silence. In sloth.\n“Wha… Leigie…sama? What… is…”\nThe one who appeared around the corner was the Ira Demon. Lize Bloodcross.\nShe’s probably the greatest anti-thesis to my being. An attribute that scatters shining flames.\nOne incompatible with me, who likes to hide away in damp and dark places.\n“Why… Leigie-sama is… walking…”\n“There… are even times when I want to walk.”\nEven like this, I generally commuted in the swaying train to work every day.\nIt’s stranger to… think I can’t stand. In the first place, it’s common sense that all Demons have basic physical abilities surpassing humans, so when the human me could walk, there’s no way the Demon me would be unable to.\nHer body is cloaked in an armor of flame.\nShe’s using her mysterious Wrath Powers to stand against this freezing land.\nI turn my gaze to the left. A golden-haired Demon who’s trying to stay hidden in the shadows.\nStep by step, I quietly move my legs forward.\nWe’re about thirty centimeters apart. In a trance-like state, Lize continued to look at me.\n“Wai… Lize-san! It’s danger…”\n“Eh…?”\nShe’s thrust away, and my hand touches air.\nBut in her place, my hand brushes the gold-haired Demon’s hair.\n“Why are… moving… it’s a fraud… kusu kus…”\nIn an instant, that girl’s time stopped.\nWith eyes that were about to burst into tears, and warped lips as if she was forcing herself to laugh.\n“… I see.”\nEven me, based on how I feel… there are even times I think about going out for a stroll.\nIs that a fraud? Why a fraud?\nWho out there decided that it’s no good for Demons of Sloth to move?\nLize hurriedly runs up to the frozen Demon.\n“Hiero!? Leigie-sama w-why… to an ally…”\nWhy? For what reason? That’s simple.\n“Because I want to sleep peacefully.”\n“Hah!? Eh? You want… to sleep?”\n“… Also, this… I can’t actually control it.”\n“Eh? What an annoying…”\nMy outstretched hand grazed Lize’s shoulder.\nHer flames go out in an instant, and like that, she ceases.\nWith an idiotic expression unthinkable for one who governed Wrath, she doesn’t move anymore.\nAnd even if it’s something I brought about myself, I feel endless sorrow and emptiness. At the same time, I feel the Melancholy Tree advancing onwards.\nJust how fleeting is this world…\nJust how fragile is it…\nIs that the very reason why the Melancholy Tree within me slowly continues to advance?\nAn unsightly emotion. For me who lived in nothing but depravity, I should have no right to despair for the world.\nIn some quiet place, I just want to be alone.\nWithin this fortress, there are no longer any Demons that can move. But even the icy pillars of their existences are annoying.\nRight… I’ll climb the tower.\nThe highest place in this castle.\nIn the past, someone once carried me to its top. Perhaps about ten years ago?\nThe uninterrupted sight of the black fortress expanding to a bright red horizon in the distance.\nIf I were to look at it now, I’m certain I would experience a sentimental feeling.",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Melancholia, Part 3: Something Good will Definitely Happen Tomorrow\nFor some reason, tears came out.\nBefore something that truly moves them, can people truly do nothing but let the tears flow out?\nEven those tears turn to ice the moment they touch my skin, and fall to the ground in beads.\nClad over the black earth, a ridiculously large structure. Limitlessly sturdy, boorish and glass smooth stones were stacked up to make the fortress, and even for me who hasn’t the slightest familiarity with architecture, I can see it wasn’t built in a matter of a few years.\nDiffering to what I had become accustom to on Earth, the Demon World’s pale blue moon, and red sky were frighteningly captivating, and simply beautiful.\nAs if to clearly speak that this was a Fantasy World, and without any discussion, I knew it spoke the truth.\nThe top of the tower was constructed so that from it, you could look out in all directions.\nThe large four glass windows installed in a circle looked down upon the ground, but for me, one window was more than enough.\n“… Hah…”\nUpon being exposed to my sigh, the window’s glass cracks without a sound.\nThe fortress without the presence of a single lifeform was cruelly quiet, and cruelly empty.\nWhite grains start falling from the sky.\nEven if I didn’t reach out to catch one in my hand, I understood. There is no snow in the Demon World.\nSo for me, it was my first snow in several decades.\nLooking at it like this, I’m forced to remember.\n“I want to get under a kotatsu…”\nAS if in correspondence with my feelings, the glass froze over, and shattered into even smaller pieces. The snow starts falling harder, and a snowstorm overtakes the castle.\n… It’s not like I’m wishing for any of this, you know.\nSnow falls. The Sloth Core that should have been crushed into small pieces has mostly recovered.\nFor someone like me who possesses Sloth Skills, something like the coldness of snow isn’t enough to affect me. But perhaps the fact that a cold sensation comes over me when I touch it is due to my memories from back on Earth.\nThe moment I thought that, the momentum of the snow increased further. Gray and ominous clouds swirl in the sky, and a vast number of beads of ice knock against the ground. From here, I can’t even see over the Fortress anymore.\nAnd that was sorrowful.\nAs I thought that, the clouds become heavier, and the gray completely turns to black. As if a blackout had descended, the world was wrapped in darkness.\n… And of that, I simply felt extreme sorrow.\nPiercing cold wind circles.\nThe Melancholia Tree… was the guy who created this world a complete idiot? This is an infinite loop, isn’t it?\nNo matter how you look at it, this isn’t a desire, or a longing, or anything…\nThe power of Sloth starts to mix in with Melancholy.\nWell, that’s yet another thing I don’t care about.\nAll things in creation are equally a pain, and all action holds no meaning.\nPerhaps because it was the first time I had walked on my own feet in a while, my legs felt heavy.\nI sat down on the spot.\nDrowsiness soon came over me. It was, continuing on from when I was a human, my greatest companion.\nMy heart is heavy. My eyelids are heavy.\nWhen I opened my mouth, a small voice leaked out.\n“… I’m becoming quite sleepy…”\nReturning to the bed is a pain. In the first place, a bed sealed in ice is nothing but hard.\nI lied down, and took a big yawn.\nThere is neither a trace of movement, nor a presence anywhere. For the time being, I should be able to sleep at ease.\nI folded my arms, and closed my eyes.\nThe black darkness I had become accustom to. If I may pray, then I hope that by the time I open my eyes once more, peace and repose will have fallen onto the Demon World.\nAS those noble and pure intentions filled my chest, I heard a strange voice.\n“… Without any interest for anything in creation, the Lord of Depravity who merely lies at the top… is it? Leigie’s past redemption, is he not?”\n“Yes. But… I wonder why it is that this man never turns Friendly Fire off…”\n“It’s exactly because he is Sloth, Lize. I’ll… talk with Leigie for a little. You go check the others. If you find anyone still sealed in ice, free them. With your Ira!”\n“… Yes, understood.”\nOf the two powers, the smaller one separated away.\nBut that doesn’t matter. What has captured my senses isn’t the large presence before me, but the the countless number of ones appearing within the fortress.\nSimply annoying presences.\nWhat suddenly appeared before me as if it had abruptly come into being was definitely one I had completely frozen.\nAt some point… no, that doesn’t matter either. It matters not when it happened.\n… Yeah, it’s nothing but depressing.\nWhy is it that whenever I try to sleep, everything tries to get in my way?\nEverything should be in a distant hell, in the depths of a silent ice.\nI forcefully open my heavy eyelids.\nI was shocked. I slowly observed the surroundings.\n… This can’t be…\n“… It’s… morning…?”\nWhen I closed my eyes, it was definitely night. At the very least, it wasn’t a time of day where it could have become morning in the next few minutes. That didn’t change from that world to this one. A shared system.\nFor night and day to flip instantly, someone able to accomplish such an absurd act shouldn’t exist in this vast Demon World.\n“… I see, so even before me, you can take on such an attitude…”\n… Great Demon King, Kanon.\nThe strongest Demon Lord who governs Wrath and destruction.\nWith my memory space that falls a bit short when compared to humanity, it’s one of the few names I remember.\nI turned onto my back, and looked up at her shadow.\n“Could it be… you…”\n“… Ku… you haven’t changed in the slightest, Leigie. Even when we’re meeting for the first in a long time… Well, fine. So be it. Right, I was the one who liberated the world you sealed.”\n“… By turning night to day!? … when did you get that sort of…”\nWhat a dreadful Skill…\nWhile I’ll sleep regardless of whether it be night or day, if I had to say, I’m a night person. It’s nothing but my natural enemy.\nI cover my eyes with my arm to intercept the sun’s light.\n“W-wait. What are you even talking about?”\nWith my arm not being enough to block it all, I rolled my body to the wall, and closed my eyes again.\nNow I can finally take a rest.\n… No, if you think about it calmly, I’ve been doing just that for quite a while…\n“No, it’s nothing…”\n“Nonono, as if it could be nothing! Ku why is it that Leigie-niisama’s always like this!”\nThe room temperature rises all at once.\nIt’s just a bit hot. To get as much shade as possible, I pressed my body to the wall.\nKanon annoyingly lowered her staff onto the ground, letting out quite a nostalgic sound.\n“… And what business do you have… Kanon of Ruin?”\nThe first response that came to my question was the sound of the floor breaking.\nJust what is getting this girl so angry…\n“What business… you say? Leigie, you… do you even understand what it is you’ve done?”\n“Nope.”\nI’m Sloth. There’s no way I would do anything.\n“Ku… ah, fine. Fine. Leigie. That’s just the sort of man you are. Let me give you a special explanation of just what it is you’ve perpetuated.”\n“No, I’m not particularly interested.”\n“Just shut up and listen!”\nCountless fist-sized balls of fire impact my body. I don’t take any damage.\nFor some reason, I’ve been attacked by Demons of Wrath quite frequently, so of the many resistances I have, my resistance to flame is the greatest.\n“Listen, Leigie-niisama. You… You completely froze over the entire territory you had been granted! … In perpetual ice that would never melt by natural means.”\n“… I see.”\nMy sadness, my despair is higher than mountains, wider than the sky, and deeper than the oceans.\nThat’s all it means.\nWell, for the time being, I’ll apologize.\n“It wasn’t on purpose, please forgive me.”\n“… Forgive!? How many years did you think it takes to thaw frozen soil?”\n“…”\nThere’s no way I would know something like that.\nThinking about it was pointless, so I gave up, and rolled around. I have no pillow to hold, so my arms are feeling exceedingly lonely.\nKanon’s staff pierced the cuff of my clothing. I kept rolling back and forth regardless, so the edge of my shirt was ripped.\nI blankly looked up at the Great Demon King.\nFlaming crimson hair, and deep red eyes like pigeon’s blood. The King of Destruction.\nSeriously, just what did she come here for?\n“Kanon.”\n“… Be quiet. Talking to you drains my energy.”\n“… Were you my sister?”\n“!? … Ah!”\nKanon’s face is dyed bright red. I feel Wrath from her.\nI shouldn’t have any siblings. Now and in the past.\n… No, could it be I’ve just forgotten them? Come to think of it, perhaps they existed.\n“L-Leigie… what you’re thinking right now is probably wrong.”\n“… I see.”\nThen why am I a niisama?\nI closed my eyes, and started to think, but it became a pain, so I gave up. That doesn’t really matter.\nCall me whatever you like.\n“Ahem.”\nKanon awkwardly clears her throat, and bends her hips to match my eyelevel.\n“Leigie, I came to clean up after you. No, in the first place, I came because of a report that Heard was going to dispose of your army’s generals, but… finding the entire territory covered in ice was unexpected…”\nIt’s more unexpected to me that you personally came for such a trivial reason.\nIs the Great Demon King really just bored? Please share your good fortune with me.\n“Why did you seal your territory, the Castle of Shadows, your people in ice? Why did Leigie-niisama, who left everything to Heard Lauder, and never actively moved perpetuate something like this at this point in time?”\n“…”\nAnything and everything doesn’t matter. Talking is a pain.\nBut if you force me to say it, what sealed them may have been me, but it wasn’t me.\nThe only ones I actively froze were Lize, and that gold-head, and that single man who’s served me since times long past.\nThe rest of them… simply received the side-effects of Melancholia.\nThey were merely frozen by that. They couldn’t withstand the very fact that I existed there.\nI don’t care about the surroundings, but how sad of a truth it must be.\n“Leigie-niisama, I’ve heard that Father was in your care in the past. Father’s father as well, and even the father before that were in your care. I myself, when I was a child, I’m aware that you often looked after me. So if possible, I don’t want to have to dispose of you.”\n“Thank you?”\n“Your welc… w-wrong. I wasn’t looking for your thanks! The army is yours, niisama, and it’s not like I came to ask you what you would do after losing your generals or anything. The freezing, and the skill you used that I have no recollection of, right now, that doesn’t really matter. All I want to ask is but one, a single simple question…”\nKanon has a serious expression as she looks into my eyes. As if the answer was lying somewhere deep inside of them.\nBut that’s probably a mistake. I’m sure my eyes are as empty as ever. Looking for it is a waste of time.\n“Niisama… do you plan on rebelling against me, against Kanon?”\nThose words triggered a vivid flashback from the depths of my memory.\nKanon of Ruin.\nOne who was able to injure me, a rare Demon Lord of Wrath specializing in attack power.\nRegardless of enemy or ally, all that came into contact with her Wrath were reduced to ash; the King of Destruction.\nAnd that was something from quite a while ago. Her current power should be greater than it was back then.\nPerhaps even great enough to pierce through my Sloth.\nWhat… a pain.\nI’m in despair.\n“Wha… niisama!?”\nKanon hurriedly lifts her face.\nOn her beautiful Glossy hair, and her ruby-like eyes, and everything else, a thin layer of frost descended.\n“Could it be… you really plan on opposing me!?”\nFlames dance, and cover her figure. Through the flickering crimson flames, I see an expression of shock.\nThe frost instantly melts and disappears. Flames to melt the ice. Meaning this was what melted the ice on this land, is it?\nKanon’s eyebrows lift for a moment, before going back down. She spoke, as if to reassure herself.\n“No… that’s wrong. There’s no way a Lord of Sloth would ever do something so troublesome… right, of all things, niisama wouldn’t do anything that required so much activity.”\nThat train of thought is strange. Why does everyone keep saying its so strange for Sloth to move.\nThat’s wrong. The reason I don’t move is, considering the merits of moving, and the merits of not, the latter offers a higher strategic advantage.\nAnd so, if an enemy comes, I’ll fight, and it ends up that moving will get rid of troublesome things easier, I will move. In Tokyo, I would die if I didn’t work, so I worked. To summarize, everything… depends on the situation.\nIt seems that among Sloth Demons, there are many who will quietly let themselves get destroyed.\nCould it be that they’re idiots? Resist, man. Are you guys supposed to be shellfish or something?\nNo, even a shellfish would offer some resistance.\nIn particular, Melancholia offers some offensive power to the defensive Acedia. As if to offer that melancholy, that dark depression onto others. It covers Sloth’s weak points quite nicely.\nI reach out my hand, and touch Kanon’s.\nOn that gesture, Kanon’s movements stopped.\n… Just like this.\n“Freezing Grave.”\n“Eh…?”\nKanon raises a stupid sound, before being sealed in a coffin of ice in the same position she was in.\nHer expression was somewhat innocent, and it’s hard to think of her as the Great Demon Lord, the recipient of everyone’s awe.\nEven if you call her the Great Demon King, she’s only at this level.\nAnd of that, I felt sorrow. I let out a sigh.\nJust what is to become of this world.\n“Hah… how depressing…”\n“Wai… W-what the hell are you doing! K-kanon-sama!?”\nLize, who had just come through the door, frantically runs over to the sealed Kanon.\nShe touched the transparent high-quality ice that enclosed the suspended Great Demon King. Her cramped face looked down on me.\n“Leigie… of Sloth. Like hell… this is a fraud. Even the one who dominates destruction and flames, Kanon-sama was… even if it was a surprise attack, in a single blow!? Lord of Sloth, why is it that you continue to resign yourself to Rank Three!!?”\n“…”\nHow troublesome.\nI don’t want status. I don’t plan on becoming some Great Demon King, and I don’t need the world. If I can continue living without it, then I don’t even need power.\n… I merely ask for a rest deeper than all.\nMy mood lowers. Nothing matters at all.\nIt was Sloth along with Melancholy. Nihility is truth, and depression.\nThat is the longings that I govern.\nDepravity and resignation, escape and decay, suspension and stagnation, inertia and dejection.\nThe Melancholy Soul Core that had grown within me some day or another covers my body in a chilling, cold power.\nSomething like this has never happened before. Is it because my Sloth has grown dim, or that they’re out of balance? Well, that is yet another thing that doesn’t matter.\nWhat’s done is done. The power that had flowed out once, as if the dam had been broken, sinks everything into a hell of depression.\nAnswering to my feelings, ice spreads out, and the fortress Kanon thawed was iced over once more. The moisture solidifies, and the air turns cold.\nThe Flames of Wrath Lize had hurriedly let out wrap around my body, but without being able to break through my Sloth’s resistance, they disappear without giving me a single wound.\nIn this annoying world, at least a little peace and quiet.\nI manifest a fist-sized ball of white light on the palm of my hand.\nIt’s a Skill I’m using for the first time, but I can understand. The power coming from it is incomparable to before. Melancholy Skills can’t even save the User from being part of their target.\nI guess even I’ll be locked in Ice that will never melt. But I won’t die from it. Perhaps that’s fine, in and of itself.\nOh world, fall into depraved suspension.\nThe ball of light lets off a silvery flash as it’s deployed.\nNow sleep if you will.\n『Absolute Requiem』\n“Wait… nu…”\nLize, who tried to deploy flames, was sucked in by the power, and frozen in the same posture.\nThe silver arrows pouring out from the rising ball of light spread over the world like shooting stars. Its scope far surpasses the extent of my Zone.\nWherever the arrow sticks into, the cold air deployed around it automatically takes control of the area without a sound, and changes it into a white world.\nIt didn’t take long for all moving things to have disappeared from the world.\nIt’s not like I can perceive the outside of my Zone, though, but its influence should extend beyond it.\nThe only thing I didn’t expect was…\n“… So my Sloth’s resistance is the stronger of the two…”\n… In a world where all creation was put to sleep equally, I was the only one who didn’t experience the effects.\nWell, so be it.\nIf that’s the case, then I’ll just sleep normally.\nAlone, in solitude, I’ll sleep quietly.\nWhen I was about to close my eyes, I noticed.\nIt seems the world won’t let me sleep so easily.\n“… I. Get. It… I got it, I understand, niisama. Your goal is…”\n“…”\nThe ice that Kanon was locked in had silently melted. The Great Demon King’s slim figure was wrapped in a thin layer of high heat. It’s a heat that even exceeds my Melancholy.\nBut in her eyes, there’s no anger. Kanon’s Wrath is only ever pointed at enemies.\nDoes she not see me as an enemy yet? Well, that’s true. I have no enemies.\n… No allies either.\nTo escape from reality, I turn my face away.\nBut what a pain.\nShe broke it. The ice seal.\nSo she can break it by herself. My power.\nAs I thought, Wrath is the power to deal with Sloth and Melancholy. I myself have no enemies, but Wrath can be called the natural enemy of the Sins that I govern, I guess.\n“Niisama… you just want to sleep, right?”\nThose were eyes filled with pity. A transparent voice.\nNothing really matters.\nAnd her niisama, niisama is getting annoying. She has no intentions of healing that habit, does she.\n“… Niisama…?”\n“T-that doesn’t matter right now, does it!? Ah, dammit. Why is it that after all this, I don’t feel any hostility or killing intent from him!? Niisama always has to… dull my Ira.”\n“… I see.”\nIf it really feels that way to you, then it’s simply because I have no hostility or killing intent.\nUp until now, I have never killed another of my own distinct will. Probably, it should be like that.\nI mean, in order to spend days in Sloth, I don’t need to kill others.\nHaving completely recovered, Kanon stabbed her staff into the ground. Her body has no injuries.\nAnd after hesitating for a moment, she made an announcement with a clear voice.\nHer tone held a strong will in it. Just like the Flames of Wrath she governed, with bright energy, power on the level that I could understand why she was the Great Demon King.\nAnd miraculously, it was what Serge possessed, long ago.\n“… Leigie of the Slaughterdolls… As the Great Demon King, I hereby declare. You are a failure as a Demon Lord. Even if you may be a Demon, doing something as outrageous as freezing over your own land, and covering it in ice and snow is something difficult to forgive.”\n“… I see.”\n“As punishment… niisama’s rank will be demoted to the very lowest.”\n“… I see.”\n“Your land will also be confiscated. All you’ll keep is this Castle of Shadows.”\n“… I see.”\nFrom the start, that was all unnecessary to me. I don’t have any particular feelings for it.\nRanking and place, go give it to someone worthy who actually wants it.\nWithout a sound, golden flames flow out of her staff. It isn’t hot. But the Fortress’s ice melts, and it touches all the earth as it expands. It’s a volume of power worthy of the Great Demon King. I feel power equal to or exceeding the Demon Lord I fought not too long ago.\nIn a voice tinged with fatigue, but without letting it spread to her expression, Kanon continued on.\n“The seized land will go to the new Demon Lord, Heard Lauder… The Prideful Kaiser… I thought it wouldn’t be strange if he became a Demon Lord at any moment, but it sure took a while. That’s just how strong he built up his 『Superbia』, I guess…”\n“… Yeah…”\nExactly. That’s exactly how it should be. Not that I really know.\nHe’s a Demon that could keep up with me over the years. There’s no doubt his way of life is a cut above other Demons.\n“So just sleep in silence, Lord of Sloth.”\n“Yeah.”\nI’ll do just that.\nAnd there, I quietly closed my eyes. Within my sinking conscious, it felt like I heard the Great Demon King’s Voice…\n… Something good will definitely happen tomorrow.",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Melancholia, Part 4: Iyo\nAnd once more, my daily life continued.\n“Leigie-sama, it’s time for your meal.”\n“Yeah…”\nI eat the food Lorna made, and let her clean the room.\nOnce the room has been cleaned, she makes the bed, and in that time, I leisurely doze off in the armchair.\nMy soul is at peace, and I barely have any stress.\nWithout a need to work, even the enemies that had invaded at regular intervals stopped coming. It sure is nice.\n“Eh? Hya…? L-Leigie-sama… this is…”\nBut today, Lorna raises a rare scream.\nShe had cleared away the covers, and her facial expression had become stiff. Her body had solidified in that position.\nNo, this isn’t my Melancholy at work.\nOn the bed was a small girl. Stark naked at that.\nEmbracing my pillow, she slept with a peaceful expression.\nI don’t know her name.\n“W-why is Medea… inside Leigie-sama’s bed…”\n“… No idea.”\nNo, I have a vague recollection of her coming in, but I didn’t have any interest, so I let her be.\nIt’s not like she was going to harm me, or do anything, and the bed is more than large enough. I had no reason to refuse. No wait, it was just a pain.\nI don’t know the reason, but just go wherever you want.\n“Medea? Medea!? Wai… Wake up!!”\n“Nyaa…”\nBeing shaken left and right, the female Demon named Medea painstakingly opened her eyes.\nHer eyes were quite clouded and stagnant. She rubbed them in a sleepy gesture.\n“…W … what?”\n“D… don’t what me! W-w-why are you in Leigie-sama’s room…”\n“I’m a pillow. That’s all. Sleepy. Good night.”\n“Hah? Wai… wake up~!”\nThe form of her embracing the pillow again as she tried to sleep no longer held a fragment of her pride as a Demon.\nLorna tries shaking her again, but this time she shows no signs of getting up. And from her body, I feel a deep and quiet presence.\nIt’s one that I know all too well.\nIt’s nothing other than the power of 『Acedia』.\nAnd as long as that’s true, I doubt Medea will be waking any time soon.\nSloth gives bonuses to sleep. No, it isn’t a Resistance, just…\n“Lorna, leave her be.”\n“Eh? A-are you serious?”\n“… Yeah.”\nI can understand the feeling of Sloth Demons all too well.\nWaking her up forcefully won’t work. And it’s not like she’s causing any trouble.\nAfter shifting her gaze between me and Medea for a while, Lorna eventually let out a deep sigh.\nIt was quite a rare expression from her.\n“Understood. Leigie-sama… but as I thought, for a man and woman not in a relationship to sleep in the same bed, I cannot recommend it…”\n“I see.”\nThis Demon sure says some ethical things.\nWell, I don’t have any particular objections to those words. I’m not approving either, but to me, it was actually something that didn’t really matter all too much.\n“I will be carrying Medea to another room’s bed. Is that alright?”\n“… Yeah.”\nIt was a bloodcurdling expression I couldn’t say came from the living.\nShe’s not letting out any anger by any means, but her rare words backed by a strong will made me nod immediately.\nAs if she were carrying a large package, She hoisted up the unmoving Medea, and bowed before departing from the room.\nIt must be hard, being a maid.\nAs I faintly considered such things, I shrunk my body inside the chair.\nIt’s a new chair Kanon sent over. The previous one suffered too much ice-related damages, and became unusable, but this one isn’t bad in itself.\nAt that moment, the door opened, and yet another Demon stepped in. It was an everyday occurrence.\nA Demon that governed Wrath, and one that seems to be observing me: Lize Bloodcross.\nI don’t get what’s so fun about observing me, but if you’re just going to quietly watch, then observe all you want.\n“Leigie-sama, so you were awake…”\n“Yeah.”\nShe usually moved around with a suprising amount of vigor, but now, on her face, there were some rare signs of fatigue.\nAnd as if her body was collapsing, she lowered her body into the chair by the table. Without saying anything, she slumped down.\n“… You look tired.”\n“… Yes. Observing both you and Heard Lauder simultaneously is going to make my bones break some day…”\nI see. It seems she’s been charged with two subjects this time.\nMy deepest condolences.\n“… Can I complain?”\nDo whatever you want. I doubt there’s any meaning in complaining to me, but I’ll at least quiet down and listen to your words.\nIt’s not like I’ll take it to heart, and rather than listening, it’ll just be entering my ears, though.\n“That Heard Lauder is a monster. Perhaps more so that Leigie-sama… on top of that, he moves around way too much. Even though he’s barely become a Demon Lord, He’s managed to annihilate all Demon Lords who set even a foot in his territory without fail… Even if they may have just wanted to rile him a little, he personally marches to the enemy headquarters, and perfectly destroys them.”\n“…”\n“On top of that, he seems to be intent on finding a chance to aim for Kanon-sama’s neck… He never gives me a single moment’s rest. Do you know just how many inspectors have been dispatched to his place? Ten. Ten people! Even if Pride is the most dangerous by nature… this is too much. It’s as if I can just see the anxiety on Kanon-sama’s face…”\n“…”\n“And he’s really loud, protesting to get her to raise Leigie-sama’s rank.”\n“…”\n“I mean, in an instant, he overruled all the Demons above him, and he’s already Rank One.”\n“…”\n“For the unmoving Leigie-sama, there was barely anything I had to do in the means of inspection, but having this much to do is troubling…”\n“…”\nI see. You’ve got it rough.\nThen you don’t really have to come observe over here, you know.\nI mean, I don’t have any enemies, and I don’t do anything but sleep. I don’t even move.\nEven though I didn’t say it, as if she felt my will, she directed a tired, and stiff smile at me.\nThe power I sense from her body is incomparable to the Lize of my oldest memory of her. It’s truly increasing.\n“… No, I’m just here for a little rest, so…”\n“… I see.”\nThen do whatever you want.\nIf you’re not going to get in the way of my sleep, then I mind not whatever you do.\nNo, if there’s something you have that can get in my way, then just try it.\n“… I’ll ask just in case, but have there been any problems on your side?”\n“… None.”\n“I see… that sounds about right.”\nHer face changes in relief.\nthat’s a lie. Just a single one, it’s not really a problem, but a bit of a change. A single thing has happened to the stagnant me.\nI only noticed it quite recently. I don’t know exactly when it happened, but it was probably after I was deprived of my territory, and I returned to my quiet life.\nThe truth is, I’m not a Demon Lord anymore.\nClass: 『Evil God』\nMy Demon Lord Class changed, and that’s my new one.\nI never thought that was what came after Lord, and Evil God isn’t even a governmental position anymore.\nWell, even if my class changes, what I’ll be doing stays the same.\nI just live by existing as I am. Up ‘til now, and probably from here on as well.\nUntil the day someone annihilates me.\nTo change the topic, Lize spoke.\n“… Come to think of it, recently there’s been a strong one among the Assassins Heaven’s been sending to provoke the Demon World.”\n“…?”\nAnd so?\nAs if she sensed a change in my thoughts, Lize shook her head.\nI don’t even have to let out words anymore. The perception ability to be able to pick up everything. Lize is quite a hard-to-get existence for me.\n“No, well… it seems they have the frightening power to even be able to annihilate those of Demon Lord Class… additionally, they can use their wings to soar through the sky. Their mobility is high, so perhaps even that Heard would let them slip by. Right now, Kanon-sama is preparing countermeasures, but I thought I would at least spread what’s become common knowledge…”\n“An angel strong enough to kill Demon Lords…”\nThat definitely is a frightening existence.\nIn the first place, an Angel’s powers are the natural enemy of Demons. The magic wafting around the Demon World is said to give high enhancements to a Demon’s abilities, but even so, there are angels strong enough to kill Demons repeatedly. It’s a pain. That’s also the reason why, while Heaven occasionally invades the Demon World, Demons rarely go up and attack Heaven.\nOn my words, Lize slumped her body over the table, and turned her head to look at me.\n“No, it’s not an Angel… Well, they’re still classified as angels, but… do you know about 『Valkyries』?”\nNope. Never heard of it.\nWell, I may have heard the word once or twice in my previous live, but… It was a terminology from the fantasy genre, I think.\nOn my attitude, Lize let out a sigh.\n“『Valkyries』 are a form of Angel, and a special type of unit that comes when the 『Einherjar』 called to Heaven experience an aberration. Compared to Demons and normal Angels that store up power over many years, they’re born with a vast amount of battle experience, so they can be quite troublesome… well, there shouldn’t be that many fallen warriors that can knock down a Demon Lord, though…”\nHmm, so there are things like that.\nGood for them.\nSeeing I had absolutely no motivation, Lize shrugged her shoulders.\n“The Blade of the Silver Blue, Serge Serenade. She’s confirmed to be the strongest 『Valkyrie』 up to date. I think it would be best if you at least store the name in your memory banks.”\n“… Yeah.”\nAn unexpected name. I try to lift my body for a second, but it won’t move, so I give up.\nBut the sight of battles long past revive in my head all at once.\nI can’t believe it. Why is she still alive?\nDammit. So unlike Japan, the Dead can come back to haunt you in this world.\nEven death is reversible. No, this time might be a bit different from reversal, but whatever the case, what a Fantasy.\nI looked at my own class once more.\n『Evil God』\nIt’s probably the highest class a Demon can attain.\n“? You seem happy.”\n“… No.”\nBut so be it.\nI’ll wait here for you no matter how long it takes. That’s my field of expertise, and probably, as a single Demon Lord, as the Last Boss, my obligation.\nCan you match up to the Evil God?\nShow me your gallant figure.\nIyo.\nSatisfied, I close my eyes. I dozed off soon enough.\nI am the Lord of Depravity.\nWho lives just by being there, a Needless King.\nAnd I bring Depravity unto others, an incarnation of evil who will sink all of God’s creation into an abyss of despair\nBy the time I realized it, I had reincarnated into another world.\nI kept sleeping, and at some point I became a Demon Lord.\nEven though I never wished for it.\nBut for me to not have to work, this world is the best. It must be true that good things happen to good people.\nThe flavor of Sloth is as sweet as honey. Glory, diligence, virtue, or honor. I have no interest in anything like that.\nWhat’s there to hide? The Lazy king is… none other than me.\n_______________________________________________________________\nEnd of Part 1",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 1: Avaritia’s Usurping, Part 1: It Reeks\n‘Twas but a simple unfounded rumor.\nThat in this vast Demon World, there existed but a single Demon Lord who reigned over the forces over ice and snow, a force that didn’t exist among the original sins.\nNot a single thing could stand before him, but without paying mind to the legions of Demons brought to their knees, he simply spent his perpetual existence on naught.\nAnd of that supreme Demon Lord, the Demons whispered, and spoke of exaggerated tales.\n… Of the Lazy King.\nSeeing the young Demon nervously speaking on as if each work he spoke was true, I snorted.\n“Ki ki ki, how pointless a story…”\nA goblet dyed in a blood-like red.\nI downed all of the viscous liquid within it in a single swig. It was a devilish wine made to bestow a drunken state onto the Demon Race, despite their high status abnormality resistance.\nIt was as if the liquid let off a fiery heat as it leisurely slipped down my throat.\nThat heat became power, as it expanded towards every nook and cranny of my body, my six arms and all.\n“Still, Deije-san. I’m bein’ dead serious here. You heard ‘bout how the Dark Prison’s earth was sealed in ice, right? In all actuality, that Superbia Demon Lord who climbed to rank one was supposedly rising in power to restrain it, or something…”\n“That so… Ki ki ki my commanding officer’s sure gotten high and mighty, has he…”\nOf course, it’s not like a deserter like me actually witnessed anything.\nBut from the current situation, I have a good hypothesis. I can calculate it out.\nMy Avaritia aches.\nAnd as if to hold it back, I started downing the goblet that had been presented to me again.\nA high rank Demon, for argument’s sake, like me isn’t going to get dead drunk from drinking something like this, and as long as I willed it, I could blow away the drunken stupor in an instant.\nMy eyes reflected in the well-polished wine were shining with desire.\nKi ki ki, this is why Greed’s no good.\nSomething reeks. It reeks the hell of it. I’ve got a bad premonition stirring up even the depths of my soul.\nIt’s the same atmosphere I felt before the war of black and white that broke out ten thousand years ago. It’s flowing. The field’s going to change before my eyes.\nThis must be that which can’t be expressed in words, the intuition of a Demon who’s lived out his years.\nIt was the smell of treasure, and the smell of war.\nThe smell of death, and yet the smell of glory.\nI offered a warning to my junior, a Demon who also governed Greed sitting beside me.\n“Ki ki ki, well keep your shirt on, Zeta Adler. Don’t mistake your enemy.”\n“Mistake… my enemy?”\n“Yeah.”\nGenerally, those of the Demon race are all self-serving.\nTherefore, we’re always surrounded by enemies. You can’t even be negligent around allied troops. That’s exactly why the ability to distinguish friend and foe is an indispensable skill. No matter how talented a Demon may be, they would be killed in an instant had they failed at that aspect.\nYesterday’s enemy is today’s friend. Yesterday’s friend, today’s enemy. It’s important to see the sides switch as well. Those that can’t do that, yet still persist to live long lives are either ridiculously talented, or perhaps blessed with good luck.\n“Ki ki ki, exactly. Zeta, just how is that Lazy King related to us? Is he… our enemy?”\n“… No, but…”\nAn instinct for strife sleeps within a Demon’s base nature. It’s a strong instinct. It’s perhaps the second strangest force within us, next to our sin.\nAnd that often dulls out decision making capability.\n“Then there’s no need to cower at him, is all. The Lazy King is… not our enemy. I would never be able to fulfill my Greed working at a place with hostility towards me. Am I wrong?”\n“You’re not… wrong.”\nZeta nodded with an unsatisfied expression.\nIt’s fine if he doesn’t understand it yet. If he lives long enough, he’ll figure it out eventually.\nIt’s just that until he realizes that, it would be nice if my words remain in him if only by the slightest.\nEven so…\n“Lazy King… huh. Just what are you thinking, Boss Leigie… Ki ki ki, this is no good.”\nLeigie the Depraved.\nLet alone General Class, he is a long lived Lord who existed back when I hadn’t even become a Knight Class Demon.\nThe reason for his existence would be summarized into a single word. Nothing.\nA steadfast Demon Lord who wouldn’t take any action regardless of the times. An unchanging existence. Therefore, regardless of his high rank among the Demon Lords, there are few who know him, and those that have seen his figure are severely limited.\nThat’s why I fear.\nOn top of his experience, he has to have something hidden on him.\nOf all else, he’s a Demon Lord. It would be stranger for him to have nothing.\nWithout having been told it by Zeta, I knew well enough of how Boss Leigie’s land had frozen over.\nIt had spread around the expanse of the Demon World as a sort of urban legend.\nMore than a year’s passed, but even if we still hear of it from those straining their voices in the corners of the bars, to us Demons who know of the insurmountable existences known as Demon Lords, it’s absolute absurdity.\nThat’s why even after just a year, everyone acted oblivious to it.\nThere’s also the fact that a more precise threat showed itself, but that’s not all.\nIt’s terrifying. An unknown power. Of those that know, and those that don’t, there are few to put the story to words.\nIgnorants aren’t to speak.\nThose crafty enough to anticipate the outcome keep their mouths shut. Of course, I don’t speak up about it either.\nApart from Sloth, a majority of Demons’ Skills are undergoing extensive research. If a land of ice and snow were to reveal itself, then the probability of it being in the unresearched Acedia would be high, and seeing from the land on which it transpired, it isn’t hard to imagine it was Boss Leigie that did it.\nA large-scale Skill invoked by the idle lord… what sort of change has come about in his feelings, or what sort of circumstances erupted into it, I don’t even want to know.\nPerhaps Supreme Commander Heard stepped on the tiger’s tail, or… oh, right, Heard was the Rank One Demon Lord now, was he?\nWell, the thing I should be putting my mind to isn’t some absurd urban legend or anything. There was a much more precise enemy before our eyes.\nContrasting his age, Zeta showed quite a bit of promise. Unlike me, he had desires that caused him to take up humanoid form. A young male Demon with ashen hair, and eyes of the same color.\nEven without having reached General Class, in the few years since he’d been born, he was already in the upper ranking of Knight Class. His wit showed decent prospects.\nAn Avaritia’s companion’s got to be either another Avaritia, or an Invidia.\nEven if we hold the same sin, our targets are different. There’s some merit in association. Perhaps our affinity is even better than with Invidia.\n“Well, rather than that, there’s something we should be focusing on, right?”\n“Yes… that’s right. Deije-san.”\nZeta sent a glance around, as if he was mindful of the surroundings.\nA run-down bar. Without even any music, there were barely any other Demons present. In the first place, there are few Demons out there that actually drink.\nAll that was there was a strange bartender Demon offering us drink, and a pitiful lower class Demon sleeping flat on top of a table. Both of then are too low in power to even consider comparing them to me.\nPerhaps through fear, a sublime smile surfaced on Zeta’s face.\n“The 『Angel』 came out again.”\n“… How many times does that make it?”\n“It’s already the third time within the month. They’re five of them in numbers. I’ve heard information they made an appearance at the Crimson Prison.”\n『Angel』\nA Demon’s natural enemy, and their predefined nemesis.\nThe vanguard of that white god’s attempts to invade the Demon World.\nTheir power specialized to kill Demons was so great, that it’s been said they were born for that very purpose.\nDemons receive great power from the land of this Demon World, but they can put up an even fight even within this miasma. It’s not like I’ve fallen too low to take down a low grade Angel, but that doesn’t change how troublesome they are.\nIt’s because my subordinates aren’t as strong as me. They’ll be purified by the most average of Angels.\nThe Crimson Prison was one of the lands managed by a Lord Subservient to the Great Demon King. That is something that should be common knowledge to those heavenly messengers.\n“Casualty count?”\n“Close to a hundred Knight Class and lower…”\n“A hundred… is it…”\nDoesn’t look like the top brass took the time to come out.\nBut with only five coming out, I wasn’t expecting them to. The top’ll only show up when it’s time for a complete war of annihilation.\nThat time ten thousand years ago was the same. At the start, it was low class Angels, then gradually intermediate level, and finally when high class ones were sent in, the King led a force of several thousands to combat them.\nThis generation’s Demon Lord doesn’t even know of that. No, she probably knows, but she didn’t experience it.\nEven I don’t know about the Angels’ situation, but perhaps it’s something similar. A timespan of ten thousand years isn’t something to make too light of.\nTo Greed, War is but a single turning point. Ki ki ki, it’s something that brings up many a treasure chest.\nWith the low, and the intermediate, and the high, and even the Demon Lord Class Demons dying left and right, it all just starts flowing down.\nTreasure of that level gets scattered all over the place. So our enemy isn’t just the Angels. Precisely because of their desires, similar Greed Demons may become even greater opposition.\nWhat I seek… the resources I desire are finite. If it enters my hand, it won’t be goin’ to anyone else. If others lay hands on it, it’s not ending up in mine.\nIt’s a game of looting. Of Angels, of Demons, or Treasure.\nAnd the necessary power is something I possess.\nLibell isn’t here anymore, but in exchange, I have Zeta. Experience-wise, Libell came from the same time as me, but it’s unavoidable.\nThe first thing we need is to discern the enemy.\nThe number of angels. Their power. Their goal. Their actions are always focused onto some greater goal or another by the will of God. Knowing that or not will change our chances of victory.\n“What became of those five Angels…?”\n“They fled, it seems. The moment they caught sight of the Demon Lord’s main forces, they ran.”\n“How rare of an army of God to pull back… those guys are supposed to stick to their doctrine, even if it may result in death…”\nAngels are perpetual lives created from souls. Their sense of life isn’t all too different from ours, but there’s a single law. As they could only move in accordance with their grand design, their powers were severely limited when compared to Demons.\nAnd it’s all so each and every one of those things can kill as many Demons as possible.\nBut this time’s pattern clearly differed from the norm. How troublesome. They should’ve just lived facing forward.\nWhat could they be thinking…?\nHas a goal more important than Demon slaying come down to them…?\n… Well so be it. Whatever the case, the result is predetermined.\nI’m a Demon of Greed. Then there’s but a single thing I have to do.\nI don’t think I even have to say it.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 1: Avaritia’s Usurping, Part 2: The Meaning of Greed\nA majority of the Demon World’s open plains.\nBesides one part of it, there are few ups and downs. Nothing but ruined soil expands in every direction.\nWith a Demon’s eyesight, we can clearly see the emptiness leading to the horizon straight ahead, but among us, there are few who actually pay that fact any mind.\nIf you’ve got the free time to be pondering such things, go fulfill your cravings already. That is a Demon’s reason for existence, and the measure of their worth.\nBut at the same time, I know of those that have reigned over these lands for too long, gazing out over the endlessly desolate landscape. Perhaps that’s the standing that an eternal life would lead one to.\nThe Demon World’s lands are divided by the power they’re basked in.\nMeaning it was a result of the influence of a reigning lord over many years, and the Crimson Prison’s land was once under the reigns of a powerful Demon Lord of Wrath. That Lord has long since been annihilated, and it was unified by one of the Pride Demon Lords allied with Kanon.\nRank Four.\nVanity the Egoist.\nThe land ruled by the great skin-headed Demon, Vanity Seidthroan.\nHe was a taciturn man, and despite his base Pride, he never bragged. He was also a pure-born soldier who brought others to their knees with his pure might.\nWhile they were Pride all the same, compared to the two Lords Zebul devoured, he surpassed them greatly in strength, and service.\nWhile we’re all part of the same Great Demon King’s army, rarely do I get a chance to see other Demon Lords.\nI’ve only ever seen him from afar, but his large build that surpassed even mine, and his black muscles as if they were forged from steel… as Demons are beings of soul, outer appearance and power aren’t proportionate, but unfortunately, from a glance, I could tell he clearly had the makings of a great ruler.\nWith but a glance, some part of me from within my soul fell into a sense of admiration, and he was a type I’d rarely had an opportunity to see in my years that surpass ten thousand. I don’t know his real strength, but based on the air he carried, among the many Lords in service to the Great Demon King, he’s likely at the forefront.\nAnd in the first place, he was originally Demon Lord Rank Two.\nIf there are those that rise in rank, there are those that fall as well.\nThe fact that he dropped a place when Boss Leigie rose in rank was inevitable, due to Boss’s achievements, but at the same time, there are some Demons questioning whether he simply lost out to the Boss.\nRank and strength aren’t always coherent, but his strength was definitely within the top five of the Great Demon King’s army.\nWith pride as his attribute, it’s possible that if it just came down to strength, he surpassed some of those ranked higher than him.\nIf there was some merit in him putting a stop to his active service, he could rack up achievements whenever he wanted.\nIf he was to personally lead his army, he would lose freedom of movement. In exchange, he might pull up some unexpected treasure. Now is the time to observe. In that sense, me receding from Boss’s army may have been an inevitable choice, but there’ nothing I can say but that my luck was good.\nThe Great Demon King’s army is the strongest force in this Demon World. Even if the entire world’s yet to be fully unified, if Heaven were to choose a target to focus their attention on, then in would be none else but the Great Demon King Kanon Iralaude’s head. That’s something our side is also well aware.\nThe earth of the Crimson Prison was hot.\nAs if the Ira Demon Lord that ruled over it long past’s anger was being manifested into it, the air temperature in that land was close to fifty times higher than in the other territories, and even if it wasn’t enough to affect a Demon’s livelihood, simply standing there would make one soaked in their own sweat.\nWhile gazing up at the blazing blood-red sun, I simply waited.\nIn one of the towns of the Crimson Prison.\nThe burning town, 『Grey Rock』.\nIt was a small town nicely situated on the border of Vanity’s Crimson Prison, and Heard Lauder’s Dark Prison.\nThe number of civilians wasn’t all too high, and at the same time, past aside, when both Prisons were taken under the Great Demon King’s control, it lost all strategic value. A pitiful scrap of a town.\nBack when the Dark Prison was under the reign of some opposing Demon Lord, there was a platoon stationed here, but the place’s liveliness was not just something of a time long passed.\nThe reason I dropped by this forgotten town was to gather information pertaining to the Angel attack.\nEven if I say that, when it comes to collecting intel, I’m pretty much a novice.\nBut that’s not a problem. There ain’t a single problem here.\nI’m only capable of stealing, but among humans, and demons, and angels, there’s that thing called ‘the right person in the right place.’\nThe terrace of the dirty town’s only café was horribly quiet. Me aside, there was only one other customer present. That lone customer, perhaps due to the heat, was prostrated over their table with a khaki hood over their head. That state only further revealed the desolate atmosphere of the land.\nAs I sat back into my chair, Zeta Adler came at me, jogging.\nFor a male Demon, Zeta boasted quite a diminutive build. Looking from afar, it would be hard to believe someone of his delicate features would be capable of battle, but if you underestimate him, you’re in for a world of pain.\nA Demon’s shape represents their true nature, the reality of their cravings. Zeta’s childish form was a shape made up in order for him to satisfy his desires. It was the form that best allowed Zeta Adler to sate his Greed.\nBut as a General Class, my heat resistance was quite higher than his.\nThis temperature must be putting him at his wit’s end, as he panted heavily, and wiped his forehead with his forearm while he gave his report.\n“Haa, haa, Deije-san. They gathered just as you said. Just as the rumors went, the platoon of Vanity’s army that were annihilated did take a temporary stay in this town.”\n“… That so…”\nIt was the most recent report of an angel assault breaking out.\nTheir numbers were five. The casualties a hundred.\nThe target of their assault was Vanity’s army. The attacked platoon was annihilated. Their numbers a hundred. It wasn’t that high a statistic, nor was it low.\nPrecisely because of the high heat of the Crimson Prison’s soil, there were very few settlements. Even if they numbered few, letting an army stay on standby required a considerable space to be prepared.\nIt wasn’t as large as the Dark Prison, but the Crimson Prison was a vast wasteland. Even if a flying dragon was used, it wasn’t so easy to cross it.\n“For what reason did they gather here?”\n“There wasn’t really a reason made public, but… well, wasn’t it just a restraint? Even if you say the army assembled here, Vanity the Egoist’s army’s supposed to number in the thousands… they didn’t even send any General Classes here.”\n“Restraint… Ki ki ki, to keep Heard Lauder in check, is it?”\n“He did cause quite a ruckus… the other Demon Lords are getting tense, I’ve heard…”\nThe Prideful Kaiser Heard Lauder crushed the armies of the higher ranked Demon Lords, and him becoming Rank One is still a fresh memory in my mind.\nIn the first place, Heard was an old Demon, and at the same as a General Class, his name was an influential one known to all.\nSince he’d become a Demon Lord, his Pride made an alteration of rankings to be inevitable.\nHe crushed whoever opposed him head-on, and was one even feared by his allies.\nThe ones he had the worst affinity with were likely other Demons of Superbia.\nThe pecking order of pride is quite strict. That’s even more the case among their brethren.\nIt’s likely that Vanity never crossed blades with Heard directly.\nThere’s his pride and all. It’s natural for him to be vigilant… I guess.\nWithout any General class Demons, I don’t think such small numbers would serve to restrain that Kaiser or anything, but…\nAmong the Demon Lords, Vanity was of the moderate faction.\nHe didn’t frivolously advertise his Pride. That wasn’t his personality.\nThat’s why he had few chances to perform distinguished service, and Boss Leigie’s rank surpassed his.\nKi ki ki, the important thing’s to have skilled pieces to play.\n“The battleground was also around this town. The army rose to oppose the angels that made a sudden entrance, and while both sides put up a good fight, the difference in power resulted in the Demons’ annihilation. It seems there were some casualties among the civilians as well.”\n“… I see. Well, it’s not that there’s no precedent to Angels attacking Demon towns, but… the enemy numbered five, right? Five against one hundred… the gap must have been considerable.”\nFights between Demons aren’t battles of numbers.\nIt may have been clear when Zebul devoured my army, but quality was revered well over quantity.\nThe same can be said about battles between Angels. In that sense, a story of five Angels taking down a hundred Demons- while their luck may have been bad- was quite possible.\nThey failed to contain the forces attacking the town, and perished… I think the death count would actually have been lower if the let the Angels do as they pleased.\nFrom what I can see, the population here isn’t high. While the Demon population was never as high as humans, even among our settlements, Grey Rock was a tiny one.\n“Vanity noticed, and immediately sent out a larger force, but the opposition narrowly escaped.”\n“… Ki ki ki, so they were made a fool of. The Demon Lord must be quite pissed now.”\n“There’s talk that he’s prepared to send his entire army out at a moment’s notice… well, since they don’t know where the Angels ran off to, they can’t dispatch outside the territory yet, but… there’re intel his entire army’s been gathered at his 『Palace of Noble Truth』.”\nThe Palace of Noble Truth was the castle of Vanity Seidthroan.\nJust as Boss Leigie’s base is his Castle of Shadows, each Demon Lord has their own stronghold.\nThe fact that he assembled his army at his own palace means the possibility of him personally leading it next they go into battle Is high.\nThat’s how serious he is. This is what it means to step on the beast’s tail.\nHowever, there’s some part of Zeta’s story that leaves a strange taste in my mouth.\n“… Hit and run… when did the Angels become able to use such tactics…?”\nGenerally, God’s personal holier-than-thou troops would never hold doubt in their own victory.\nTherefore, they see no need in strategy. Those Angels were something like time bombs made of pillars of faith. Once they appeared, they would fight until all the Demons around them had perished, and until death, they wouldn’t cease their struggles. No, that’s how it should be.\n“Ki ki ki, this really is a pain… has a competent leader decided to step forward?”\nI don’t think something on the level of a leader would be able to change an angel’s movements, but…\nPerhaps misunderstanding something, Zeta timidly asked.\n“… Deije-san, could you be referring to the rumored Valkyrie who can kill Demon Lords?”\n“No way. Even if she may be strong, I can’t think that an Angel would abide the orders of a Valkyrie, who they think of as an inferior race.”\nOf course, I know of the noble revived heroic soul that killed a Demon Lord.\nAbout three months ago, the topic of a single maiden swinging around her might became something like the talk of the town, and she was still an existence that made the Great Demon King’s army tremble.\nIf you’re looking at damages, she’s a much fiercer one than this force that only killed a measly one hundred Demons.\nBut I’m thinking of this case as a separate matter. Killing a Lord… if there was one capable of doing something like that, there’s no way the town would still be standing here like this.\nWhile they both may be assassins from the heavens… that’s all there is to it.\n“Deije-san, is something the problem?”\n“Ki ki ki, of course, we’re going to be chasing the Angels. Zeta Adler, this is the critical moment.”\nThere’s no need to even think about it.\nRight. This is the divide.\nOnly five of them have been spotted so far. So why not make them my stepping stones to glory?\nMilitary service ain’t bad, but just following a commander the whole time makes Jack a dull boy.\nIn the first place, the heavens’ve been too quiet as of late. While Angels have been spotted here and there, they’ve all been lone riders. A few Demons would die off now and again, but it’s been a terribly long time since a whole platoon’s been wiped off the face of the earth.\nThis is the signal flare, and there won’t be a better opportunity than this instant.\nHistory will speak.\nIt’s because no one has yet to lay hands on it that 『Usurping』 ever holds meaning.\n“Still… taking on a group able to kill a hundred Demons, even for you…”\n“Ki ki ki, what’s it to ya’? We have a trumpcard of our own. It’ll work out one way or another, and if it looks like we’ll lose, we’ve just got to run.”\nThis is the Demon World. To the end, it’s a world beneficial to us.\nIf we continue to pull back, we’ll never be able to do anything. If I won’t be able to get my hands on anything, then death’s a better option.\nBalance. Right, what’s important is balance.\nI looked over the town.\nAs its name suggested, the townscape that appeared to be constructed of gray stone was simple, but it maintained a form that made it unthinkable that Angels had launched an attack here.\n“Zeta, we’ll be staying in this town for a while.”\n“… Eh? There isn’t anything here, you know?”\nI’m well aware.\nI began explaining to the lad, who let of streams of sweat as he directed his eyes at me.\nIt’s definitely hot here. IT isn’t a place I’d like to overstay my welcome, but there are times when a Demon’s got to do what a Demon’s got to do.\n“Ki ki ki, we’re going to discern the Angels’ power. Perhaps there’s something to learn from the traces left by their battle. It’s not like there’s no chance of them attacking this land again, either. Their end goal is the Great Demon King’s neck without a doubt, but we still don’t know the reason for this time’s assault here.”\n“… I see. But is there really a need for an Angel to have a reason to kill Demons?”\n“No clue. But whatever the case, there’s barely a trail to follow. Rather than setting off on a fool’s errand, it’d be lucky if we found some clue.”\nAs a General Class Demon, let me say it. If you don’t use your legs, you won’t get any treasure.\nUsurping is a hunt. Pursue, and take. That is the meaning of greed. It’s proof, it’s validation.\nKi ki ki, why don’t I teach it to you?",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 1: Avaritia’s Usurping, Part 3: … Should I Steal it?\nThis town is hot.\nThere’s a shocking lack of any clues.\nThose two truths are slowly burning up my thought process.\nIt’s been a week since I started investigating Grey Rock, and with nothing being found, only the time had passed by.\nThe feeling of impatience. But still, there hasn’t been anny information of those five angels being sighted in any other land.\nDid they return to heaven?\nThe possibility exists. There’s definitely the chance they were conducting brief recon.\nIn that case, that means we’ve been working for nothing.\nI mean, the Rank Four Demon Lord is waiting on his throne with all preparations to take them down. No one normal would attack the same spot twice.\nBut Angels are nothing normal. The Iustitia they carry is just as sinful as the cravings carried by a Demon.\nToday as well, there was only one other besides us in the café.\nIn my usual seat on the usual terrace, I wiped the sweat off my forehead, as I downed the lime-colored water in the tumbled glass in a single swig.\nBefore my eyes was Zeta, who was weaker than me, and thus more haggard.\n“Ki ki ki, how interesting. For there to be absolutely nothing after all that…”\n“It’s as if there’s not a single trace… it seems. Not even a speck of destruction…”\nAs expected of a former garrison.\nIt’s not like it was put to much use, and the structure here are overly durable, with barrier magic stretching over everything without a single crack.\nI did check out the plaza where the battle supposedly took place, but there were barely any traces of a fight having taken place.\nWith this, I can’t even begin to imagine the Angels’ attributes.\nBut it’s not like our harvest was nil. I did figure something out.\n“They can only use attacks to an extent not strong enough to break the barrier. As I thought, their abilities aren’t all that high. If you include affinity into the calculations, they’re Knight Class at best.”\n“And you’re saying that just five Knights were able to take on a hundred Demons?”\nZeta’s tone indicated he couldn’t believe it as he looked to me with doubt.\n“It’s not an impossible talk. An Angel’s power weakens a Demon’s… well, fighting in the Demon World gives some enhancements, so in the end, it comes down to personal ability, but…”\nVanity himself aside, his army’s nothing famous. So his troops simply being weak is also a possibility.\nI mean, even if he may stand out himself, it’s not like an army’s competence is directly proportional to their Lord’s strength.\nWell, still, whatever the case, the truth is uncertain.\nI asked around. I personally checked out the battle site.\n… There’s no helping it. There’s no use in wasting any more time.\n… Should I just steal it?\nA feverish dizziness shook my emotions as if my brain were being fried.\nI’m a bit reluctant to do anything too rough in the Egoist’s territory, but… this world’s survival of the fittest, after all.\n“… Ki ki ki, Zeta. There’s no helping it… do ya’ remember the faces of the witnesses?”\n“… Are you serious? We’re within the territory of allied troops, you know…”\n“Hey, if you put it like that, we won’t be getting’ anywhere. It’s adaptation. Change to fit the situation. Also… right, Zeta?”\nSpending a week investigating on this land is taking this young Demon’s stress to its breaking point.\nBut in his current expression, I can barely see any fatigue.\nI bent my lips into a smile, and pointed it out to my oblivious junior.\n“… You’re smiling at the idea, you know?”\n“… Kufu… well, if you put it like that, I guess there really is no helping it. ”\nPutting it in a way that made it seem he didn’t care either way, my faithful junior laughed.\nWhile I say faithful, his faith lied not to me, but to his own desire, the cravings he harbored.\nA trait that indicated a Demon of the highest caliber. It sure is fun, looking after guys with talent at the job…\nZeta leisurely stood, and his expression had lost all traces of tiredness.\nHis ashen eyes letting off a strong light were the only things shining under the crimson blazing sun.\nDespite the fact that all he did was stand up, it seemed as if his slim figure had suddenly expanded for an instant.\nA display of power. He let out a deep breath, gave off a repulsive feral expression, and in contrast to all of that, he began shispering in a calm voice.\n“『Greed Hand』.”\nAvaritia Skills are based on a desire to take.\nLooking back over others, and mocking, and shaming, and taking all of creation to your heart’s desire. Its true nature lay in causing loss to others.\nKi ki ki.\nTake it all.\nThe fact that there’s something to be gained. The fact that someone has something to lose.\nMore oppressing than Invidia, more crafty than Gula.\nEven though I have yet to become a Demon Lord, there’s a reason I’ve been able to live over ten thousand years of life.\nThe strong do not foresee their losses.\nThey’ll only notice after they’ve lost it.\nThe dreadfulness of Greed.\nZeta Adler, the Greed Demon arms let off a faint black luminescence.\nAn Avaritia Skill, 『Greed Hand』.\nIts power wasn’t on the level of the 『Wave of Starvation』 possessed by gluttony, but it was much more atrocious.\nKi ki ki, but it’s all fine. It doesn’t take lives of anything. It at least leaves those behind.\n“Zeta, finish up quickly. Ki ki ki, Before we even meet the Angels, I’d hate it to have to go up against fellow Demons. That would be a bit much.”\nThe sword Celeste I received from Boss Leigie was definitely a fiendish and unrivalled Demon Blade, but I’d still be at a disadvantage when the enemy’s at Demon Lord Class. I don’t think the Lord’ll pop up after we just steal a bit, but I don’t know Vanity’s nature. It would be best to remain cautious.\n“I… I know that.”\nUnderstanding that, Zeta nodded lightly, as he began searching for his target.\nThis town was narrow, and its population wasn’t high, but as it was the middle of the day, the streets were being put to good use.\nDespite the Angels coming out, they were quite calm.\nDemons were the dominant race of the Demon World. We barely had any enemies.\nThat’s why the lower one’s class is as a Demon, the more they begin to take needless pride in the powers they were born with.\nZeta approached a single passer-by, who seemed to simply be taking a leisurely stroll. Age-wise, he didn’t seem much different from the boy. A Young Demon.\nBut He was much too lacking in vigilance. Form my long life spent mostly in military service, I could see it clearly. From his attire, his gestures and all else, he was too taken in by his peaceful surroundings I was even surprised he managed to survive this far in the constantly-warring Demon World.\nEven when Zeta approached, he merely made a bit of a doubtful face, and he didn’t seem to be putting up his guard at all. Perhaps it has something to do with Zeta’s height being lower than his own. I mean, he looked delicate enough, that it didn’t seem his hands could bring harm to other.\nAfter the two of them were finally within arm’s reach of one another, the young male Demon finally raised his voice.\n“W-what are…!?”\n“Kufu.”\nThe young man’s movements ceased. While his eyes were fixed on a point directly in front of him, it didn’t look like anything was entering them.\nZeta’s bone-thin fingertips were rested on his forehead. His casually extended arm put an ent to it all to quick.\nThe man’s head wasn’t pierced or anything. It was merely touched. It was done delicately, so not the slightest of wounds was left.\nZeta let his mouth curve into a complacent crescent smile as he withdrew his hands. It was a matter of several seconds.\nBesides the ones directly involved, there weren’t any witnesses. Or perhaps though people witnessed it, they pretend not to. It’s survival of the fittest. The meaning of that should be clear.\nZeta’s longing was memory.\nJust as I desired, of all time and place, of all nature and creation, materials treasure, he was an Avaritia Demon who longed for others’ experiences, and memories.\nInevitably, the nature of his Skills developed towards an ability to steal them.\nI don’t get what’s so fun about any of that, but I doubt I’ll ever be able to understand another’s longings. Just do what you will.\nIf it affords me some merit, then all the more.\n“… It’s finished… kufu…”\nHis peculiar laugh seemed to be filled with good humor somewhere.\nPerhaps it’s because he stole something directly related to his objective.\nThe Skill 『Greed Hand』.\nIt’s merely a Skill that snatches up the target of one’s desire.\nIn my case, it’s loot, in his, experiences. It instils one’s hands with malicious power to take from others, and among Avaritia Skills, it’s known to be the one with the most frequent of use. And at the same time, based on one’s wishes, it can become the strongest Skill of all.\nLike how a General Class like me can only steal items, this Knight Class in front of me can do things much more malicious.\nWith his field of vision taken by ecstasy, he whispered to me with a drunken expression.\nhis eyes seemed directed ahead, yet he wasn’t looking at anything.\n“I see, so this is… an angel… my natural enemy.”\n“Ki ki ki, so you struck the jackpot on the first try? I doubt you even checked to see if he was a witness, did you.”\n“You’re not wrong… but it worked out, so there isn’t a problem.”\nWell yeah. For you, that is.\nI’ll allow it. I’ll give you that much.\nBut in order for one to be able to continue pursuing their desires to eternity, there’s a line that shouldn’t be crossed.\nI met his eyes, which appeared to gaze at some distant country, with a strong look of my own.\n“You made sure to keep it to a minimum, right?”\n“… Of course. Just as you taught me, Deije-san… he’ll be able to move again soon enough.”\nAnd as if he had been waiting for those very words, the frozen youth began to stir.\nWith a bewitched expression, he looked over his surroundings for a while, but after a while, he started walking as before. His footsteps were firm, and I couldn’t think of him as a recent victim of theft.\nThere wasn’t a scrap of evidence left behind.\nA question or two may pop up from an aberration in his memories of his daily life, but that’s all. That’s all the memory is. The longer you live, the less your life actually leaves a mark on your memories.\nPerhaps even my memory’s been stanched out before. Ki ki ki, it’s a repulsing thought.\nFrom his half-asleep state, Zeta slowly returned to reality. Like that, he lowered himself into his seat again, and began his report.\n“I was able to take them up quite easily, but… it doesn’t appear there’s any new information to be found.”\n“… I see.”\nI didn’t think he would be able to get anything new on the first try anyways.\nIn the first place, we spent an entire week here with no results. Otherwise, we wouldn’t think it such a fortune to actually find something out.\nLife is average. If there are rises, there are also falls, but it levels out.\n“It appears what we’ve collected so far is true, at lease. Five angels, yes, there were definitely five angels donning heavenly wings here. Their means of entrance was the sky. They attacked the town, were intercepted by Vanity’s troops stationed here, and the rest is history. That’s the extent of what the master of these memories saw.”\n“… I see. So, where did these all-important Angels head off to next?”\n“Who can say… It’s clear they made an escape through the sky, but he didn’t see the direction…”\nIt just isn’t going to go our way.\nWell, I guess just confirming our information had some merit in itself.\nKi ki ki, I mean, that was just the first try.\nAlso, seeing is believing, and at the information gathering stage, the worth of obtaining the memories of those that actually witnessed it is unfathomable.\n“What were the Angels’ means of attack?”\nOn my query, Zeta started to blink.\nHe tilted his head for a while, before slowly letting the words flow out. Usurping memories and making them his own meant that he was pursuing the experience itself.\nHis tone was filled with fear, as if he was talking about a disaster that transpired before his own eyes.\n“Light… right, pillars of light. A few meters in diameter, giant pillars of light from the sky… the town burned, and the Demons were mowed down.”\n“An Angel’s Iustitia Skill… I guess. Yes, I’m sure there was something like that.”\nJust as Demons possessed Seven attributes, Angels also had a few classifications.\nIustitia was of those.\nAnyways, I’m sure it was an attribute that specialized in offense.\nI caught a glimpse of it ten thousand years ago, as a wave of their light cleared away the darkness of the Demon World, said to be unsurmountable.\nA large-scale Angel attack… Having only Knight Class and below, Vanity’s army was at a great disadvantage there.\nRather than the platoon being weak, perhaps they were simply unlucky…?\n“… How many wings on them?”\n“… Eh?”\n“The wings, you know. Wings. They’re the symbol of an Angel. You can determine an Angel’s power by their number of wings.”\nTo those that have ever tried to oppose the heavens, it’s something like common sense.\nAnd their wings were those guys’ pride, so they never try to hide them.\n“… I see. Then it’s one. No, perhaps I should say one pair.”\nSo only a single pair of wings.\nThey’re that great a force. Perhaps from low to intermediate level. If I were to equate them to a Demon’s ranking system, there’s a high probability they’re at Zeta’s level, or below. Well, Demons have a naturally bad affinity with Angels, so Zeta alone would have it rough…\nWith Celeste, they’d be easy prey. No, even without it, I think I’d make it through.\nEven if they burned the place with pillars of light, there wasn’t a single sign of it in town.\nIn the end, their output isn’t enough to breach the barrier…\nNext, there’s the possibility they have a larger force in wait…\nBut nothing’s going to come of thinking about it that far.\nThere’s no such thing as a safe battle. I’ll at least drink down the basic risks.\nOf all else, even if they sent down an Angel or two, there’s still that monster Valkyrie roaming around.\nThis must be the turning point of the era. Thinking of the future, it’s not a bad thing to build up some anti-Angel fighting experience here.\nPerhaps still looking over his gained memories, Zeta still had an absentminded expression as his eyes traced thin air. I issued some orders.\n“Oy, Zeta. It’s time for some usurping. For now, we need a stronger trail. Since we’re already at it, why not just take all the memories you can?”",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 1: Avaritia’s Usurping, Part 4: A Disadvantageous Gamble\n“It’s no good… It’s not coming out at all.”\nZeta had a fatigued expression as he retracted his fingers.\nBefore him, a female Demon around Media’s age stood in silence with an expressionless expression plastered on her face.\nThe sight of Demons with these frozen doll-like expressions is something I’ve already gotten used to.\nIn Grey Rock with few pedestrians as it is, a back alley a left turn of of the main road. Even in the middle of the day, it was dark, and let alone Demons, there wasn’t a single mouse here.\nEven if we’re in the Rank Four Vanity’s territory, were at the outskirts of the outskirts. I mean, it’s quiet here, so it isn’t hard to aim for the gaps.\nZeta had already taken the memories of nine Demons.\nA Demon’s Skills were their craving themselves.\nBut it’s not like they could be used endlessly. With this high heat and humidity, the area was incredibly discomforting, and the task at hand, that was akin to grasping at fog put a deep strain on his psyche.\nSlowly, a scarlet light circled around his grey hair.\n“… How ‘bout it?”\n“Taking the memories was exceedingly easy, but… once again, she’s no good. She didn’t see it… no, she witnessed the event, but didn’t see anything past that.”\nIt’s a line I’ve heard eight times before.\nI thought we were in luck when the first Demon we stopped had seen the Angels, but that was far off.\nThe Angels gave an overly flashy show of power. Each and every one of the nine we stole from so far had clearly seen their form.\nBut their objective, and the direction they set off in remained foreign.\nAll of the Angels were clad in a uniform gaudy glow. It’s a light with that dreaded power of god at its core.\nAnd that’s good and all in the sense that it draws peoples’ eyes, but at the same time, it was a hated light, and no one willingly wanted to see them off.\nNo helping it. The enemies were envoys that personally crushed the army of the ruling Lord. It’s not strange for the civilians to want to run away.\nIt isn’t strange… but…\nIt’s ominous. It’s much too ominous.\nMy experience was going off like a fire alarm. It was much too quiet. There was much too much nothingness.\nIt was much too perfect.\nOriginally, the appearance of the Angels, in itself would be suspected as a ruse, but we could use Zeta’s power.\nMemories tell no lies.\n“… Oy, Zeta. Do you know whose report it was that said the Angels had come forth?”\n“… Yes, it was the Order of Black member accompanying Vanity… the inspector’s regular report. I mean, the appearance of Angels is a serious matter… I heard they participated in the force Vanity sent out to pursue, or something.”\nThe Order of Black.\nThe Great Demon King’s personal vanguard, and her direct servants.\nIf it were for Kanon Iralaude’s sake, they would even turn against a Demon Lord. They were the King’s arms and legs, as well as her eyes and ears.\nThat girl Lize was the same, but the loyalty that order shows to the Great Demon King was the real deal. Since this member was charged with a Lord governing Pride, their loyalty must be first-class. I doubt that order’d ever make a serious mistake in dispatching personnel.\nIf possible, I’d like to take that inspector’s memory to confirm it, but I doubt that’s happening.\nAs an inspector, there’s no doubt they’re a General Class surpassing Zeta already. Unlike with material wealth, usurping memories depended on the individuals’ will, and mental resistance could drop its success rate. The low class Demons we stole from today aside, a General Class it too heavy a burden for the lad.\nThe one most anxious about the current situation must be Zeta.\nWhen he’s personally taking in the sights, there’s not a single hint to be found. It’s as if he’s forced to open up an empty treasure chest over and over again.\nAs a young Demon, he’s lacking in experience. The situation where his instincts made him feel nothing but an indescript anxiety was probably the same as the feelings I harbored ten thousand years ago.\nKi ki ki, that’s right.\nThen I’ll take up the place of the one who looked over me back them.\n“… Zeta, calm yourself. This result is definitely beyond our expectations, but it’s in no ways an impossible occurrence. It’s not like we haven’t gained anything. At the very least… it all reeks, is what we’ve learned.”\n“… I see…”\nFirst, you’ve got to calm down. Regain a level thought process.\nDemons are doomed to overestimate their own abilities. That’s why when an accident occurs, they often try to resolve it with brute force.\nFirst, take some deep breaths. Breath, and focus. That is the strong point of Demons that possess not only strength, but also intelligence.\nThink with your own head. That will often change your fate.\n/there are times when you’ve got to take risks, and risk your life as well, but at the very least, now isn’t that time.\n“Those Angels, they must have a smart one amongst them… no, even so, their numbers are much too small, and we still haven’t a clue on why they attacked this town. Why did they aim for such a remote region… what is their goal?”\nSimply slaying Demons?\nA hundred Demons. With their military service, their power was higher than standard Demons. I guess it’s enough or a reason for Angels to attack.\nBut that’s exactly why I don’t get it. Why did only five come?\nEven if we may be enemies the Angels specialize in killing, this is a land that greatly raises our abilities.\nLuckily for them, there wasn’t a General Class among the forces, so they could easily take on a hundred, but if one was there, then five would definitely be at a disadvantage…\nIf it was the same heaven as before, if it was the usual angels that would resolve themselves to kill the moment they met a Demon, then it would make a slight bit of sense, but this time’s folks… they retreated.\nIt’s mismatched. It’s all over the place.\nThe recklessness they carried to take on twenty times their numbers, and the wisdom they held when they retreated the moment the army came into sight. That gap births a sense of discomfort.\nIt doesn’t match the angels I’ve seen up to now.\nSensing my hesitation, Zeta offered a proposal.\n“… As I thought, should we steal a little more?”\n“… Can you?”\n“Yeah… Kufu, my Greed is… not satisfied yet, you know…”\nWith a face that looked quite forced, Zeta smiled.\nAbuse of usurping. The fatigue he’s been building up, and his physical enervation. I can see them all.\nBut this time alone, I can’t go about babying him.\nWe need to find our trail before someone catches onto the inconsistency in their memories, and leave the town.\nTime isn’t on our side. We don’t know when or where an Angel’ll pop up again. We should finish up quickly as best we can.\nBut at the same time, I had a hunch.\nThat we wouldn’t find a single thing more from this town’s residents.\nI returned once more to the soul-less café terrace. When someone of large stature like me is around, the targets tend to be wary.\nMy role was that of a thinker.\nThere’s no doubt there’s some cause and effect going on in this land. That Valkyrie aside, this is the only place that’s incurred large damage from the Angels as of late.\nAfter retiring from Boss Leigie’s army, I’ve been around, but that’s the only real change I’ve heard about.\n“… As I thought, it’s really no good… Hah. It feels like I’m opening empty chest after empty chest.”\nAfter executing another usurpation, Zeta let out a deep sigh of lament.\nOddly enough, his words were exactly the example thought of previously.\nAs if it had become a mere routine, I confirmed it with him.\n“That was the tenth, right?”\nAnd just like me, he gave a form answer.\n“Yes… Those that saw it have slight differences, but those past nine were pretty much the… same…?”\nIn an instant, Zeta’s face trembled.\nHe turned pale, and his mouth opened and closed silently as he sought out the words. It definitely wasn’t a normal expression.\nI instinctively rose, and met his eyes.\nThey were pointed at the air, and tracing the low sky that hung over the Demon World.\nMy thoughts changed. From a looped circuit, to a straight path.\n“Deije… sa… tha…”\n“… Oy, oy, is this for real… What trickery is this?”\nThere was a figure.\nThe form of a person emitting brilliant white radiance in the crimson sky. The large single pair of wings sprouting from his back were pure white.\nLoved by God, and produced by him. The opposite side of the spectrum of Spirits from Demons.\n『Angel』\nIn an instant, he expanded his power.\nThe complete opposite of the miasma Demons clad themselves in, an aura that could even be called holy was deployed across the ground.\nMy body trembled. My genetic memory, the emotions of fear carved into a Demon’s soul upon looking up at their executioners.\nNo matter how I looked at it, the Angel wasn’t even a hundred meters away.\nThis is strange. Why haven’t I noticed him when he’s come this close?\nAngels are Demons’ arch nemesis. Their specific positioning is one thing, but if they approach, I should be able to realize it at once…\nI restarted my frozen mind with willpower. Fine. What I have to think of right now isn’t something like that.\nI slapped Zeta on the back to unfreeze him.\nI laughed out loud.\nI sneer. A maliciousness great enough to blow away this holy feeling.\n“Ki ki ki, just when I thought there wasn’t a trail to be found, the man shows up personally… I’m in luck.”\nLuckily, besides me and Zeta, there wasn’t anyone else around. The town was frighteningly silent. There’s plenty of space. I can fight with all my might.\nI swiftly counted the figures decorating the sky.\n“Ten… is it? They’re friggin’ multiplying.”\nEach one’s individual power was, as expected, nothing too serious. Even including their affinity, they were much weaker than I. If I kept down this instinctual feeling of dread in my soul, they’re opponents I could wipe the floor with in ten minutes.\nI firmly plant my feet on the ground, and build up power. So I can react no matter when or how they try to come, I optimize my soul.\nThe flock of Angels was ominously quiet, as they looked down on us. What floated in their eyes was pure and utter scorn. The eyes of those looking upon an inferior species.\nKi ki ki, I’m being made light of.\nIs this their main force?\nNo, that’s probably not the case. This is them testing the waters.\nThe fact that ten came out after five is proof of that. Are they measuring the power of Demons?\nWell, come out in as many dozens as you will. Greed has its own way of doing these things.\nZeta’s made himself more than useful enough.\nMental and physical labor.\nInvestigations and battle.\nFrom here on, it’s my role.\n“Deije… san.”\n“Ki ki ki, fall back.”\n『Big Pocket』\nI open up the subspace warehouse of Greed.\nBecause of that unpleasant Lord of Gluttony I fought a year ago, it’s mostly empty. But a splendid article’s been left hanging.\nIt was a blade of fire said to have burned a fire dragon whose power rivalled Demon Lords to death.\nI easily pull out the sword I had become accustomed to. As always, its crimson steel let off an explosive amount of magic, matching the sun blazing above it.\nDemon Blade Celeste.\nOnce upon a time, it was a supreme treasure bestowed upon a certain Lazy King.\nWhile me being the polar opposite of God, sensing me give off similar waves, the doll-like Angels’ expressions warped cruelly.\n“Ki ki ki, don’t worry too much about it. I’m Avaritia. I won’t go as far as to take your lives.”\nIf you obtain one, you’ll wish for ten. Once you know ten, you’ll lust for a hundred.\nI can’t be satisfied with just ten measly angels. Bring on a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand.\nYou guys ain’t the target of my desire, but I’ll sip you up all the same.\nI lightly waved Celeste. The magic that overflowed from the edge took on the the shape of a flaming dragon, that shot out to pierce the wing of one of them.\nAnd as that happened, the Angell’s body was covered in fire. He did a tail spin as he fell to the ground.\nA thunderous roar.\nThe Angel’s large build collided, and the café’s roof let off quite a racket before caving in.\nWrapped in flames of legend, and Angel didn’t move at all, and I didn’t feel any more power from him.\nI licked my lips. Just as I thought.\n… Just one hit, it seems. They really aren’t anything special.\nBelow Knight Class even. Even if I didn’t pull Celeste, they’re at a level I could handle.\nI directed the blade at the remaining flock. As if pierced by the thrust I gave in the air, the Angels swayed in the hollow air.\nShould I hold back?\nAt the very least, I’ve got to leave one alive, or we won’t be able to take their memories.\nBut do I have enough leisure to accomplish something like that?\nCan I render them powerless without killing them? The positional advantage lies with the Angels ruling over the sky.\nCeleste’s output is too high. I’ll end up killing them.\nShould I leap, and hit them to the ground? Can I do it? Avoid attacks in midair?\nThe moment those thoughts swirled around my head, the Angels’ powers swelled up explosively.\nFrom their bodies, like steam, power, magic, divinity gushed out. The growing golden holy aura, even from the eyes of a Demon like me, seemed divine.\nMy body felt the sudden elevation of my enemy’s power, and I could grasp it in an instant.\nTheir powers were now in the higher tiers of Knight Class. Were they holding back up to now? To quantify it, they individually increased two fold for all five of them. That difference was exceedingly large.\nBut still, my superiority hasn’t been shaken.\nThe nine Angels held out their hands, as if to seek answers from the heavens.\nThey were quite clearly preparing an attack. To match that, I took a large swing with Celeste.\nThe Demon Flames grilled my arms. It’s the compensation for raising the blade’s power output.\nRaising the output several times for a single strike, a pillar of flames rose from me.\nI endured the pain akin to my body being torn apart and got the power under my control when a pillar of light from the Heavens came down on me.\nThe intensity of the light darkened my vision. Celeste’s crimson, and the Angels’ white clashed, and the resultant waves caused the café, and the houses around it to sway.\nThe three tables lined up alfresco were shot away all at once, and they shattered upon hitting the wall. Hiding behind me, Zeta lowered his body, as he looked up at the clash of light and fire.\nAn Angel gave a vulgar chuckle.\nThat bearing makes it so I can’t see them actually governing any Justice.\nAnd the laugh was the faster of the two.\nI understood when I first saw their Skill. These guys… without a doubt, they’re nothing to that Devouring Lord.\nKi ki ki, no I guess I picked the wrong target to compare.\nBack when my attack clashed with that of a certain Zebul Glaucus’, it was pure opposition. I didn’t hold back, and I didn’t have the leisure to do so.\nNo matter how much power I poured into it, I wouldn’t push forward at all, as if I was dealing with an absolute wall. It was as if the entire world was my opponent, and I wasn’t able to stop the fear in my heart, but these guys are different.\n“… Well, I guess that all there is to it.”\nI swung Celeste again. With just that, the dragon of fire’s force increased, and it swallowed up the light all too easily to scorch the heavens.\nIt shot through the very center of their formation, and a number of Angels were instantly burnt black before falling to the earth.\nThe laughter from the sky ceased.\nAn Angel’s form didn’t differ too much from a Demon’s. With shapes that took after the human race, their ivory-white vestments fluttered in the wind. Their glass ball-like colorless eyes followed their falling comrades. But in them, there wasn’t an expression of fear or impatience.\n… Even when half of them had fallen.\n… Just what is this feeling?\nEven Angels are supposed to have emotions. For them to be this inorganic…\nFeeling an unfamiliar sense of dread, I held Celeste aloft.\nAt the same time, the Angels spread out.\nThey flew out in every direction. I wouldn’t say their speed was higher than that of a Demon’s, but there’re no set roads in the sky. No obstacles either.\nThe air is their playground. Their mobility is exceedingly high.\nThe crimson blade cried out.\nThe directionless swirl of Mana flashes out once more to cover the sky.\nCeleste is demanding fuel. Even if it’s a sword, it’s an article manufactured by Demons. A single blade birthed for the purpose of opposing God. Its personality is the worst.\nThe flames raging on left and right flew out at a speed that the heavenly wings were unable to surpass.\nThe Angels that split into five directions were burned, and one fell to the ground.\nThe difference in power was all too clear.\nThe difference in equipment, as long as I had Celeste was my overwhelming victory, and the situation transpired with that advantage on my side.\nThe moment I was able to bat down their Iustitia Skills so easily, my victory was certain.\nI ignored the painful heat feedback from the sword, and licked my lips.\n“… Something’s wrong with this picture.”\nIt’s not as if there was no resistance. And the presence of the Angel that fell to the ground had definitely faded out.\nBut, still… right, if I had to say, then I’m simply unsatisfied with it. I can’t see what their intentions were.\nPerhaps this was what Zeta felt when he was fruitlessly nabbing all those memories.\nI brushed away an arrow of light from up high with Celeste.\nThe Angel that had lay in wait to use a Skill was burnt to cinders.\n… Three of them left.\nAn even greater chill than before came over my body.\n“Deije… san… these guys are…”\n“… Seriously, what trickery is this…”\nDazzling lights blocked out the sky.\nThe air was astir. On the power opposing a Demon’s base, a wave of divine magic made the world shake, as if it were crying out beneath it.\nEnough to make that previous display of power look like mere child’s play. If I had to compare the scopes of power, it must be at least ten times of that before.\nMeaning from when I first saw that group from before, it was twenty times higher.\nIt’s like an army of ten Angels becoming two hundred.\nAgainst an opponent of this scale, even with a General here, I can’t make a definity judgement on the outcome.\nBut that’s not where the problem is. What I have to care about isn’t something useless like that.\nThe extent of how far their power had fluctuated from the starting point went against an Angel’s nature.\nThat was the strangest thing I had to put my mind to.\n“That can’t be… it can grow that much? Were they hiding their true power? No, there shouldn’t be any meaning behind suppressing it all the way up to here…”\nThe Angel remnants numbered three. But every one of them was clad in a dreadful divinity.\nRank-wise, they had far surpassed Knight, and if they were Demon, they’d be in General range without a doubt.\nI’m not sure when they appeared, but the three Angels drew white swords from their hips.\nIt’s a Skill I’ve seen some place, sometime before.\nRight, those are the holy swords the Angels of Justice used in the war back then.\nAn Iustitia Skill\n『Sin Breaker』\nIt isn’t a Knight-class Skill.\nEmitting light, the heavenly wings flapped. Rise, glide, and descend.\nThe speed they came down was fitting of the term Godspeed. It’s been said that high ranking Angels move at the speed of light, but these ones are reasonably fast themselves.\nPerhaps they thought they were at a disadvantage in a long-range battle. The demon-slaying sword of light entered my field of vision.\nIt was as if it were a coordinated attack. Only the prideful smiles plastered on their faces indicated that this action was nothing of the sort.\nTheir fighting style was crude. No techniques or anything. But only in power alone did they excel.\nI don’t even have the time to let out a sigh.\n“… Well, well, this is getting to be a pain.”\nWhat fools.\nAgainst an Avaritia Demon, what’s more, against me, they contest with swordplay?\nThe sword of justice coming at my eyes went out in an instant.\nIn my lower-left hand, I could feel the sensation of gripping a new weapon. Upon seeing his weapon suddenly vanish from within his hand, the Angel froze up for a moment, and I slashed upwards at him with the stolen sword.\nEven when turned against its wielder, the Sin Breaker showed its power without a moment’s regret.\nI put strength into my lower body to stop his bullet-like kinetic energy. The arm that swung the sword felt a heavy burden.\nAs he already flapped his wings to retreat, while his body received a deep slash wound, he still returned high into the air.\nAs he shot up, I delivered a follow-up swing, and even with the light to his back, I could clearly see the face of terror dawn on him. Unlike when the others were burned up by Celeste, a look of despair swept over his face several times before he ceased.\nWith a thud, the power-less angel’s body rolled along the ground.\nHe was definitely strong. If I took that divinity head on, there’s no way I’d get away unhurt.\nBut that’s all. I just don’t have to take it head on. Generally, both Angels and Demons place an emphasis on offense rather than defense.\nMeaning those rare exceptions that specialized in defense- such as Boss Leigie- aside, the rest of us had to dodge in order to survive.\nBut these guys don’t even have a sense for that.\nIt’s a complete mismatch. Their power isn’t matching their battle experience.\nThey’re not even measuring their opponent’s attribute, and their attacks are nothing but sheer stupidity.\nThat’s why even without weapons, I should be able to drop them easily. Using melee weapons against Greed is pretty much asking for them to be stolen. It’s because there are plenty of those sorts of Skills on the Avaritia Skill Tree.\nIt’s by no means a bad thing for me that the enemy’s weak.\nWhile I may have the instincts for battle, I’m not a battle junkie like that Heard Lauder. If I can easily attain results, then there’s nothing better.\n“… Two left.”\n“Deije-san… you sure are strong…”\n“The enemy’s just weak.”\nI lightly returned Zeta’s words. They’re my honest feelings. This can’t be all there was to those wars with Heaven.\nThe remaining two were suspended in the air.\nMale Angels. As if they had been mechanically mass produced, two similar face, four eyes in total, glared at me.\nWhat was there was either hatred or sorrow.\nTwo high class Angels.\nBut I don’t get the feeling I’ll lose against them.\nI’ll take down the first one, apprehend the second one, and have Zeta take his memories.\nGeneral Class or not, we’ll just take everything.\nWhat’s the problem? ‘Tis but a simple matter. Compared to over ten thousand years of hell.\nI gripped Celeste strongly again.\nMy arm had already become quite burnt by its aura. It’s compensation. The feedback to its wielder.\nThose that use the blade to its limits are fated to be reduced to ash. It’s a legend with no proof to back it, but the blade was clad in a force devilish enough to give it some credibility.\nI haven’t fallen enough to have to rely on it to that extent.\nWith a sneer an Angel raised a disciplinary voice.\nIt was an irritating high cry that howled in the back of my ears. Unable to bear it, Zeta covered his ears, and squatted on the spot.\nThe world was shaking. Rumbling. Oscillating.\nBut it’s not as if anything was truly moving. It was a wave of divinity great enough to give off that illusion.\nThe Demon World’s air was dyed. From jet black to pure white. Darkness to light.\nZeta’s eyelids convulsed at the abnormal situation, as he watched the figure of one of the Angels.\nJust what the hell is this… I never heard anything about it.\nNo, could it be…\n“It can rise… even further? Dammit…”\nMaking me see an illusion of the Angel’s body expanding, the passively released holy aura from them neither exceeded nor fell short of the pillar of light they released none too long ago.\nTheir rising power carved up the sky, and split the clouds.\nThe trembling of my body I had contained with the thoughts of battle started up once more, and I used everything in my power to put a halt to it once more.\nThe power I felt from the Angel completely surpassed mine at this point.\nVanity’s 『Abyss Zone』 eroded away, and shattered.\nWhat expanded in its place was a pure and divine feeling. It was as if god’s blessings themselves were pouring down on the land in orbs of light, and a silver wind overwrote the lingering miasma.\nFrom the increase in power, the Angel’s disposition went through a complete change.\nFrom their meaningless holy aura, and expressions that gave off a somewhat manufactured feeling, to eyes in which dwelled strong fighting spirit.\n“This… is…”\n“… Oy, oy, give me a break already…”\nThe Demon Lord Class doesn’t exist among Angels. But to identify those among them with Demon Lord level powers, the Angels of that rank were referred to as follows.\n『Saint Lord』\nDemons and Angels were opposing souls.\nBlack and white. Darkness and light. Evil and good.\nTherefore, through our very natures, we were always predestined to oppose one another.\nTheir existence was, among our natural enemies, the worst and greatest foe.\n“Tsk, what the hell… a Lord descended to the Demon World!!?”\n“…”\nLords have obligations. They have land. They have subjects. That didn’t change among Angels and Demons.\nWhile Angels would occasionally drop by the Demon World, there’s barely a memory within me of a Lord coming down here.\nI’m not sure if they were even listening to my words, as the Angel didn’t respond.\nHe merely silently pointed his extended finger, and gathered Mana into a single point of light.\n“!?”\nMy instincts as a soldier. My experience up to now made my body instinctively leap to the side.\nIn the next instant, the light was released. Its speed was close to pure light itself, and a high ranking Demon like me with enhanced perception couldn’t even follow its afterimage. It was overwhelmingly separated from that arrow of light aimed at me before, a power suited to a true Lord.\nThe light that missed me by chance bored into the café terrace, and after a brief moment, my body was assailed the lights and the sounds.\nA thunderous roar rocked my eardrums, and my failing five senses were forcefully recovered with my anti-status-abnormality Skill.\nI used my instincts to guide my falling body.\nMy field of vision spun.\nI confirmed the form of Zeta’s injured body on the ground. It’s fine. Something of that extent won’t kill a Knight Class Demon.\nI confirmed my own situation. It’s not like I took a direct hit from the attack, the shockwave from it merely hit me from behind, and this level of damage isn’t one that’ll hinder my movement.\nWhy, for what reason did a Lord of Angels descend to such a desolate place, I haven’t the slightest idea. I don’t even want to know.\nMy luck was in that I hadn’t let go of Celeste in that instant.\nGreed Skills don’t have a high damage output. Losing the Demon Blade would definitely be a fatal loss.\nAnd if I have this in my hands, then I stand a chance against a Saint Lord of Heaven.\nMy thoughts are become severely twisted from my chance meeting with my arch foe. The instincts shaking my very soul clear up my field of vision.\nThe light he shot from his finger. Its output and speed were definitely adequate for a Lord’s Skill.\nI bent my legs to kill the impact, and corrected my stance.\nMy left hand held the 『Sin Breaker』.\nMy right, 『Celeste』.\nAs that fingertip pointed at me once more, I swung the Demon Blade.\nThe dragon of fire shot out to devour the Angel.\nThe light came down to annihilate me.\nCeleste’s flames definitely had a wider scope, but the Angel’s blasts were all concentrated on a single point.\nThe light leisurely moved forward while ripping through the dragon’s innards. It was unable to stop its advance.\nAnd as if to defend the gap in the Angel’s defense, the other Angel stepped forward.\nIn my fright, the power slackened for a moment. Using that, the light increased in speed.\nI couldn’t even feel another presence that large until now, but the other one definitely gave off the same feeling as the first.\nThis can’t be… what’s the meaning of this? What the hell is going on!?\n“Lord of Angels… two of them!?”\nI could barely surmount the gap in power with one, yet I have to face both. The Lords that hadn’t shown their faces in ten thousand years were lining up as if I were having a nightmare.\nI couldn’t discern a single thought from their expressions, and all I could really pick up was that they were determined to kill me.\nIt’ll only get worse at this rate. I leapt to the side, and the light finished its way through the dragon I lost control of to pierce the ground I was at before.\nEven when I haven’t taken a single attack head on, my entire body was giving an aching pain.\nShould I retreat?\nCan I even retreat? Against these monsters?\nOddly enough, I began to recall when I withdrew from Boss Leigie’s army a year ago.\nFate. Is my fate going to cast me away here?\nAfter having escaped that Demon Lord of Pride, Heard Lauder, I’m going to die here?\nA sensation ran up from my toes to my head.\nA dark heat pouring out of my soul gave strength to my body.\n“K ki ki, interesting, ain’t it? If you think you can, then come at me.”\nI held the Demon Blade above my head. The Lords of Angels cautiously took a step back.\nCeleste’s flames were peerless. But in the end, a Demon Blade was still a sword at its base.\nIt was made in order to rend.\nMy soul continues to let off a dull pain.\nI kicked the ground strongly, and thrust.\nI twisted my body. I concentrated the entire kinetic energy of my frame into the blade, and threw.\nThe Demon blade became a crimson comet as it came at the Saint Lords. The magic it usually used to create large scale flames was all being concentrated on the tip, and this blow was definitely the highest I could release at the moment.\nBut without witing for the result, I ran over, and took up Zeta in my arms.\n“Hah, hah… gu… are we running?”\n“Ki ki ki, life’s only to be lived if you survive.”\nTreasure and riches, you can pile up as much as you want as long as you live on. There isn’t even a point in equating them.\nA high-pitched voice of song I took to be the Angels’ screams struck my ears. But without even learning of what effect it as supposed to carry, my status abnormality resistance activated, and erased it.\nAll that was left was to run. Angels possess frightening mobility, but if I take cover in a town, it will be a pain to search from the skies. There are plenty of places to hide.\nAnd there was some merit to my flight.\nThere’s no way Vanity didn’t notice the fact that an Angel appeared here. In this case, his zone was even broken.\n『Abyss Zone』 wasn’t just a Skill to offer enhancements to friendly troops.\nIt was an enlargement of a Demon Lord’s sense of perception. It let them sense if enemy troops even set foot on their lands.\nIf I can keep myself on my feet until the army arrives, it’s my win. If I’m found, I lose.\nKi ki ki, what a disadvantageous gamble.\nWhile it may not be that wide, I’ll be completely out in the open on the main street. If they were to shoot that light at me from behind, it’s the end.\nIn the past week, I’ve gotten a map of the town into my head. Those guys shouldn’t be familiar with the place, and ironically enough, from our memory theft, we know all the points with few pedestrians, and bad visibility. Never thought it would aid in our own escape, though.\nThe moment I turned into a side alley, I noticed a figure collapsed at my feet.\nWith a khaki overcoat wrapped around their body, a Demon boasting a small build. At the same time, that form was one I’d gotten familiar with in this one week.\nIt was the Demon that was always hunched over the table at the café terrace. I was also there for quite a bit of time, so while there wasn’t a day I didn’t catch sight of him, I had started percieveing him as part of the background.\n… Could it be this one was at the terrace?\nSeeing the Demon still face down, and unmoving, I hesitated for a moment. But I didn’t have the time for that.\nI resolved myself, and lifted the Demon up by the scruff of the neck.\nI don’t really care, but leaving this one behind would go against my style.\nI won’t call it good will, but if I had to say, it’s just a whim. In the first place, with my strength, carrying one or two doesn’t really make a difference, and because I cast away Celeste, I have an arm or two to spare.\nI gripped his neck as if hoisting up a kitten, and when I lifted, the hood flew off.\nInstinctively, I threw the Demon behind me with all my might.\nUpon having the mass of Khaki chucked at them, the approaching Angels were brought to a momentary halt.\nAtop my shoulder, Zeta cried out.\n“W-what was that all about!? All of a sudden…”\n“Like… hell… why…”\nJust how should I express these thoughts racing through my head?\nTerror. Surprise. Confusion. Amazement. All of them intermingled, but if I were to summarize it into a word, it would have to be ‘dumbfound’.\nThe two Angels whose presences I couldn’t sense.\nThe two Angel Lords.\nThe culmination of all the consecutive events beyond my wildest dreams.\nGreater than angels, a miraculous nightmare.\nI tried to open my mouth to convey it in words, but my thoughts wouldn’t come together. I didn’t know what to say.\nI frantically moved my mouth, and what my seesawing emotions finally fell on was weariness.\n“So even Boss Leigie’s… played his hand this time…”\nI’m not sure what my mind was coming to, but the only image that floated in it was the form of a sluggish Lord of Sloth.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 2: Gula’s Starvation, Part 1: I’m full\nWhy did I go to such extents to consume such things?\nI’ve received such a foolish query time after time after time…\nIt was a dialogue pointless enough to make me hold my stomach in laughter.\nI’ll bet there’s nothing in this world more meaningless than a Demon’s desire.\nIt’s not that these longings exist because of us Demons.\nIt’s because these longings exist that Demons live on. That’s why you can’t call a sin-less Demon a Demon.\n… And… and just as I’ve become one who can’t provide an immediate response to that senseless quandary, I guess I’m no longer something you could call a Demon either.\nMy awakening was a coincidence, yet also an inevitability.\nMy soul did definitely go out once, but as if it still had lingering regret, it displayed its gluttonous will-power, and returned.\nHazily, as if surfacing from a deep well of water, my consciousness came up, and naturally, the first thought that came to my mind was, ‘why?’\nEven if I may have been a Demon Lord who built up much power over a perpetual existence, a soul that’s been extinguished can never return. There’s no such thing as a second life. There shouldn’t be.\nBut I found my answer soon enough.\nReflected in my sluggishly adjusting field of vision was a field of pebbles that went on to eternity.\nUnable to understand what had happened, unable to fathom what to do, I simply leisurely surveyed my surroundings.\nI should have been smack dab in the middle of a battlefield, but on the black soil was neither the Lord of Sloth nor his subordinates, and from the fact there wasn’t even the traces of the flames from that Demon Blade around, I determined that a considerable amount of time had passed.\nIn my daze, I turned to the palm of my hand. My body was practically the same as the one I boasted before. The limbs I had become accustom to, even after taking so much damage from that lazy Lord, were left without a scratch, and I could make smooth movements without any support. It was as I the complex fracturing of my bones I felt in battle had been but a dream.\nSimply, on a land that was nothing but vast, the Demon World’s stars that hadn’t changed in several tens of thousands of years shone down on me.\nThe words that came to my mouth without meaning were blotted with tears.\n“Haa… haa… he didn’t break my core… Leigie, are you not… an idiot?”\nThe reasons I was able to successfully revive likely numbered three.\nFirst. Leigie’ Skill did destroy my body quite thoroughly, but it was unsuccessful in crushing a Demon’s heart, my soul core.\nSecond. His subordinates didn’t even doubt my death, and they didn’t confirm said core.\nThird. The Dark Prison’s land was vast, and in the time my soul core spent regenerating, no opposing force happened to pass by.\nIf even one of those had gone astray, my consciousness would have drifted into an eternal hell, the depths of a true Dark Prison, and never surfaced again.\n… Well, I’ll put aside whether that was a good thing or not.\nAnyways, I confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my body. If there were, it would have to be with my heart.\nThrowing myself down on the Dark Prison’s soil, the dark color of gunpowder, I looked up at the sky.\nStill in a trance. Even when I hadn’t even started to think about it, the words poured out.\n“Fufu… so I’m to… live in shame.”\nI doubt this was done by the Lord of Sloth’s will. That man wasn’t one who would do anything so troublesome.\nBut, still, it’s quite certain that I lost. While bearing the name of the Devouring Lord, I met the first inedible matter in the course of my life.\nAnd the satisfaction I felt at the very end of the end was enough to fill me up.\n“I’m already full…”\nI was satisfied. Not an iota of my hunger remained.\nThe moment when I resolved myself for death is one things, but now that it’s been extended to my life, it’s quite an ominous sensation.\nMy hunger was my enemy, and yet my friend. It’s only because it was there that I was a Demon Lord, and I was able to eat up all of creation.\nWith that gone, the current me isn’t even a Demon, and while this goes without saying, I’m definitely no Angel. I must be quite a fragment of an existence.\n“Leigie, the truth is… you made me think it for the first time.”\nThank you for the meal.\nMy last supper had long drawn itself to a close. Then what is with the current situation?\nThere’s no god in hell. If there was, then what logic did he work by to put me on this land once more?\nMy comrades and vassals are gone. I’ve eaten everything. Even my family.\nAnd this time, this time, my closest friend from over a hundred thousand years ago, my hunger, is gone.\nComplete loss. In spite of my satisfaction, an abyss incomparable to starvation had opened up in my stomach.\nAfter dying once, and reviving here, perhaps that was my compensation.\n“Fufu… well, fine. If that’ how it is, I’ll play along a bit longer.”\nWith no goal or will, I’ll spend a life simply continuing down this endless path. How cruel must it be.\nEven if I lack an objective, since I’ve already gotten on the rails, since I’ve already faced defeat, I’ve a need to tag along.\nAlso, if I do that, perhaps I’ll be able to touch the purpose of that Lord of Sloth’s power.\nIf I do that, then perhaps I’ll learn the reason my hunger lost.\n“Well, maybe wandering the Demon World without purpose for a while won’t be too bad…”\nI was always fighting. I was always devouring.\nAll just to sate my hunger.\nThose were definitely absurd, and sweet, and fun days, but if I look back now, I was just being pushed around by my desire. After being cut off from my sense of starvation, I’ve realized that for the first time.\nThen if it’s now, with my hunger lost, with me not even as a Demon…\nThe view of this Demon World should become a little different from back when I was a Demon Lord.\nLet’s leave behind the world I called my dining table, and find a new one.\nMoving my limbs for the first time in a while, I propped up my body, and stood.\nA lukewarm wind brushed against my body. Noticing I wasn’t wearing anything, I let out a sigh.\nNaked is embarrassing… that’s a sentiment I lost in a time long passed, but being left in this uncouth state isn’t good. It would be inexcusable to the ones that disappeared into my stomach, the Demons of Gluttony who served me up until the end.\nWell, perhaps this second take at life would be more insulting to them than anything, though…\nWithout uttering a word, I used a Skill.\nI was just a little anxious, but even without my hunger, I was able to operate Gula Skills without a problem.\nThe manifestation of starvation. An unfathomably deep darkness gathered, and wrapped around my body. To me, these were my clothes for battle clothes, and at the same time, my ceremonial garments.\nGluttony Skills specialized in attack, so it’s not like they’ll really be of use as armor, but it’s much more decent than being naked.\nFor arguments sake, I searched for my favored sword, but it didn’t seem to be littered anywhere around.\nThat one was my favorite, and it’s likely in the hands of one of Leigie’s subordinates at this point. There was a Greed Demon there, so perhaps it’s with him.\nWell, that all doesn’t really matter. Even that Greed-kun who whetted my appetite to that extent, now that I’d lost my appetite, held no more meaning to me then the countless foodstuffs scattered around the dirt.\n“… I guess I should get going…”\nI whispered.\nI already knew what I was going to do.\nI’ll meet Leigie again. For that sake, I’ll start walking forward. That was the only premise. When the girl he was supposed to have killed appeared before his eyes, just what sort of face would that man make? I was looking forward to it just a bit.\nI gave an order to my body, which felt heavier than it ever had before, and put one foot out.\nJust how desolate is this reality without hunger?\nIt’s not like I’m damaged at all. Neither have my muscles declined in the slightest.\nSimply through the fact I wasn’t properly embracing a desire, through the fact I no longer held any strong will, it seems my body will become this hard to move.\nThe Demon World’s map had names stuck onto it by the color of the soil, and the atmosphere surrounding it. Even if I didn’t know my exact location, I had a general idea.\nThe surrounding region, all the way to the horizons, was filled with pebbles of black, with some ash colors mixed in here and there, taking in the sun’s light without end.\nAnd fitting of the name of the Lord of these lands, meaningless air filled with gloomy mana as if to lower one’s spirits.\nIt’s the proof of how, over long years, revieving power from the Lord of Sloth, the environment underwent a change.\nEven thinking back to my oldest memories, it’s not hard to remember how this was always the Dark Prison ruled by Leigie of Acedia.\nMeaning if I proceed like this, then Leigie’s stronghold… I’ll arrive at the Castle of Shadows.\nBut is that really alright?\nIsn’t that like skipping the story, and directly going out to challenge the last boss?\nBy my estimate, my own power hasn’t declined, but that’s merely another peculiarity.\nA Demon’s power is their cravings. There’s no way the current me that doesn’t embrace hunger is of the same strength as the one full of nice and healthy appetite.\nI hesitated for a few seconds, and decided to alter my objective.\nAt the moment, I don’t hold the will to confront the Lazy King. I don’t have any will to begin with.\nIt’s no good to head straight for him. At the very least, getting a grasp on my own situation, and the current situation of the Demon World comes first. I’ve never experienced being regenerated from my soul core before, but I can guess that it hasn’t been a short amount of time.\nI mean, I have all the time I need. With my need to eat gone, looking back, it’s been a frighteningly long time I’ve spent.\nA map floated up in my head.\nI thought of the closest fiefs to Leigie’s unified lands.\nThe Egoist, Vanity Seidthroan. The Crimson Prison ruled by a Lord of Superbia.\nTyler Gredmore. The Golden Prison ruled by a Lord of Avaritia.\nThe one with the greater power would be Vanity, but the current me didn’t have the heart to take on a Greed Demon. To line up a feast before me when I’m not even hungry, the thought alone sends shivers up my spine.\nVanity’s pride was, strangely enough, not violent. With that in mind, it’d probably be best to set out for the Crimson Prison for now. His army’s quality isn’t that high, so even if my sustained existence is to be found out, I doubt they’ll chase me too far.\nAfter thinking that far, I noticed. Even without some grandiose goal, even when my hunger was non-existent, I was trying to live on.\nThat was just too strange, and I ended up giving a bitter smile.\n“… Fufu… fu for my instinct for survival to still functions without desire…”\nIt looks like I’ll have to change up my opinion on life a little.\nI let out a sigh of grief, and began walking across the black earth, that seemed to extend on forever.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 2: Gula’s Starvation, Part 2: Maybe if my Appetite Returns\nA change in the situation always comes abruptly.\nEven for a Demon Lord with absurdly wide perception, we cannot see the future.\nLast year’s me never even imagined that I would ever lose my hunger, and I never thought it would become this hard to move either.\nTo demons embracing their longings, those longings were their will to live. Perhaps I never truly understood what that meant until after I revived.\nA world without hunger, as if I was seeing a dream, lacked a sense of reality.\nWhile I had found myself in a new world, to me, it didn’t fall short of the depths of hell.\nI was in a small town of the Crimson Prison I had reached by chance. And there, I ran out of power. I lost my will to do anything, and spent who knows how long collapsed at some café or another, forgetting an innumerable amount of things.\nI’m sure I had a plan. But the black hole drilled into the center of my heart wouldn’t allow it.\nAny and everything is but a trifle. To me, my appetite was a desire I could barely stand, but also the highest form of pleasure.\nOn the table of a dirty casual café, I fell flat. It was an action so pointless in nature I couldn’t even laugh at the Lord of Sloth anymore.\nAt the start, someone or another tried to talk to me, but perhaps getting tired of me not offering a single action in return, that came to an end all too soon. I also get the feeling I took a few Skills directed at my body as well, but contrary to my state, the Gluttony Skills I had honed over my life nullified all of them.\nI’m not hungry at all. Yet still, my power shows no signs of dying out. It won’t decrease. No, more so, even when I’m not eating anything at all, I get the feeling it’s on the rise.\nThat was one of the few truths I came to learn upon returning from the abyss of death, and it was also something I should have been shocked at.\nIt’s not like I was simply eating in order to gain power, but when I’m growing stronger without doing anything at all, I somehow feel that all I’ve done up to now has been pointless.\nI simply sat, and within the quiet darkness, I thought about its meaning. Without the desire that had always shaken up my existence, I had enough thinking time for my brain to rot.\nI even get the feeling that I’ll be able to grasp something given just a little bit more.\nBut for some reason, today’s been quite noisy.\nThe sounds. The lights. A somewhat nostalgic wave of magic was coloring my world. Whether I liked it or not, I perceived it all around me.\nI wonder if some sort of accident’s transpired. Even for Demons, in times of peace, the towns should have some peace and quiet. Especially with the place I was at not being any sort of major city. It was simply a remote settlement. If I was in the land of a hostile Demon Lord, that would be one thing, but this isn’t the front lines of anything. I can’t imagine who’d attack who here.\nBut if you turn that around, if it’s a rare occurrence, that means it can happen now and again. Those reckless enough to attack the cities of the Demon Lords allied to the Great Demon King come out regularly.\nThe information coming through my five senses told me that the town had been dragged into some form of war.\nBut the power ringing out around me, the forms, and the sounds, with the burden I felt on my body, they were fruitless stimulus.\nThey’re not at a level where they’ll harm a Demon Lord like me, and it’s not like…\n… It’s not like I’ll be able to eat them anyways.\nPerhaps someone died. Several sources of power went out, and several of them swelled up.\nIt was probably the after effect of the blasts. The table supporting my body was blown away, and my body was thrown onto the ground. Again, I’m uninterested.\nHaving been tossed onto the earth, I stretched out my flawless tongue, and took a taste of the ground.\n… It’s not half bad. It’s definitely not bad, but my appetite isn’t whetted at all.\nSince my revival, I’ve tried putting various sorts of food before myself. But still, there’s no signs of anything coming back.\nIt’s not like it’s inedible, but I don’t want to eat it. That feeling was one of a variety that, since my birth, I’d rarely ever tasted.\nIt’s also not something I felt when I confronted the Lord of Sloth. Those back there were negative feelings, but what I’m feeling right now is surely zero.\nApparently, even non-Gluttony Demons will feel hunger with the passage of time. That information did give me some optimism about my present condition, but I can now say that my current state is of a problem beyond that level.\n“… Hah, I wonder what happened… for me to not feel anything to this extent…”\nAt this point, the hunch that I might not be a Demon anymore started turning into my certainty.\nIs this that sort of, ‘truth from a lie’ sort of thing…\nBut still, what’s with this…\nWhile I was thinking something like that, I was grabbed by the scruff of the neck, and hoisted up. My build isn’t too tall, so I don’t think any large Demon would have too much of a problem doing that, but it’s quite amazing that they were able to do that without saying a single word to me.\nThe hood that was intercepting the sunlight flew off, and I saw the face of the one who lifted me.\nCurling horns that grew at the top of his head, and six eyes were the Demon’s characteristics. And to me, who lost all of my comrades, it was the first familiar face I’d seen in a long time.\nLeigie’s subordinate Greed-kun. One of the few existences in this world that I tried, and failed to eat.\nBut even with one I thought of as tasty before my eyes, I don’t really feel anything.\nGreed-kun’s eyes went over my face expressionlessly for a moment. The stare from his six pupils met with mine.\nAnd in the next instant, without saying anything, still without an emotion on his face, Greed-kun chucked me with all of his might.\nI was thrown. As if throwing a ball, easily, without hesitation.\nHow cruel… to throw me away after going through all the trouble of picking me up…\nPerhaps he added some spin onto the toss, as my field of vision spun all over the place. On an incredible wind, and an impact great enough to rock my semicircular canals, without any real feelings, I put power into my body for once in a while, waited for the right timing, and made a landing on the ground.\nEven if I’ve lost my desire, that’s something irrelevant to Greed-kun.\nHey, at least let my keep my pride. I try not to show my unsightly face, and try to strain my voice, but when it came out, I couldn’t help but think it was tinted with a tired tone.\n“… Well, well, well, you sure do some cruel things there… to acquaintances no less…”\n“W-w-why the hell are you at a place like this!!?”\n“Fufu… I wonder.”\nHis confusion was enough to make me crack a smile.\nNice reaction. That’s a nice face you’re making there. As always, his appearance is fitting for one called a Demon. Greed-kun’s figure, of course, but also his gestures haven’t changed in the slightest from when I saw him last.\nIt would be nice if Leigie would give a reaction like that too, but…\n“Of all else, I’m the one who’s wondering why you’re at a place like this, Greed-kun… what a coincidence.”\n“This sort of coincidence… I don’t need it. Boss, please give me a break already…”\nLooks like I’m quite hated. Fufu, even when I just went and devoured his collection a little… What a narrow-minded child.\nWell, I doubt I’d even be able to do something like that at this point.\nSaved by his reaction, my tension that had been brought down to the lowest possible level rose ever-so-slightly.\nI could finally confirm the situation.\nI smelled a scent that made my nose twitch.\nGreed-kun, and the lone young boy Demon he was shouldering… that’s also a Greed-kun. Fufu, he smells like the type that steals emotions. There aren’t any other Demons around. Like a bubble of air, this entire area’s become completely empty.\nBut more than that, the problem’s likely the enemy.\nEnemy… prey. Nice ring to that.\nI turned my eyes to the side.\nTwo sculpture-like males. Wearing pure white vestments, their large builds boasted a pair of white wings of light on their backs. Heavenly messengers. Showing off their dark intent to kill us all in their silver eyes, these natural enemies of Demon-kind were lined up right in the middle of the Demon World without a moment’s hesitation.\nAs if one of the two had been replicated, they looked like two peas in a pod. The large presences they wore around themselves were a single widely pronounced symbol of fear to our race.\nIf you do something bad, the Angels will come for you, the parents say… Fufu.\n“Two Angels… Fufu, it sure has been a while since I’ve seen the form of an Angel… it sure is regrettable that I can’t eat them.”\nTheir light presences, that had so little impurity in them they began to feel unnatural.\nEven for someone with a perpetual existence like me, a force I rarely had a chance to meet: high ranking Angels. What’s more, the higher rank of those high ranks.\n『Saint Lord』 Class.\nThis white light eating away at all the surroundings was the polar opposite of the 『Abyss Zone』of Demon Lords.\nIt must be none other than the 『Paradise Field』 Skill that only Angel Lords possess.\nTheir Divinity had a nasty nature of wiping away the Mana held by Demons.\nIn territories under the reign of Angels, we’re unable to wield our powers to our satisfaction.\nBoth of the Angel’ eyes were directed at me, the unexpected trespasser.\nEven if you look at me like that… this isn’t my will, you know. Fufu, I was just kinda thrown, you know.\nYeah, I’ve just been thrown around. If you want someone here to resent, then go after that Greed-kun, okay?\nThe Angels’ Killing intent, enough to shake one’s soul, gave a jolt to my instincts. It’s not appetite. This must be those battle instincts that other Demons speak about.\nGreed-kun called out.\n“Zebul, I’ll give you a warning for old time’s sake. It’d be best if you ran! Ki ki ki, taking on two would be tough, even for you.”\nEven when you just used me as a projectile, that’s quite mean.\nBut that may just be my misguided resentment there.\n“Fu fu… who do you think you’re speaking to here?”\nI’m an undefeated Lord. No, wait, I lost to Leigie, so I’m a once defeated Lord.\nIn a hundred thousand years of life, one loss. I can’t even remember the amount of things I’ve eaten. Never fleeing, never facing loss.\nIf you want to call that good luck, then go ahead, but more than that, my Gula disposition let me specialize in offense.\nThe use of my Skills were accompanied by a sort of uplifting feeling. Without saying anything, I started using them for once in quite a while.\n… Fufufu, my bad, Vanity. I’ll be taking these ones.\nThe black aura of darkness that gathered with me at the center tainted that divinity.\nA bottomless black that seemed to devour every color around it, that dark power that seemed to represent hunger itself was, even when its user had lost her desire, in good health.\nI washed away that annoying holy air those Angels were spewing all at once, and dyed their white with my black.\nThe force that wouldn’t permit any resistance was, while I had lost my starvation, the proof I was still a Lord.\nTo eat up and defile all creation, a Gula Demon’s right.\n“I can’t believe it… you ate their Paradise Field!?”\n“Fu… I haven’t eaten anything. It’s just that my power was the stronger of the two. That’s all.”\nHaving their Field destroyed, the Angels’ silver eyes let off a dangerous light.\nIt wasn’t fear. Simply, their newfound will to fight me let out a slimy light. It wasn’t anything different than what Angel usually embraced whenever they were slaying Demon.\nStrong light gathered in the palms of their hands. Unlike that let off by the Demon World’s crimson sun, it was a white light. Without even an incantation, their speed was like lightning, and their flowing movements gave off the impression they were accustom to firing off such bolts.\nBut I saw through it in an instant. The memories of the war of White and Black still lingered in my mind. Even if they haven’t appeared as of late, the nature of these things wasn’t something I could forget so easily.\nAh, that’s…\nI licked my lips. Even when I didn’t have an appetite, I was drooling.\n… It sure was fun back then.\nA quivering excitement ran from the base of my feet up my spine. All of my memories could be summed up with the word, ‘Tasty.’\nThat was a wonderful time. It was even regretful that it had to come to an end.\n“Fufu… so you guys are 『Iustitia』 Angels?”\n“……!?”\nThe time from collecting to shooting off their energy was a matter of seconds. Theirs was an attribute designed for rapid fire, and it boasted a high offensive power in order to bring ruin to Demons.\nthey shot off a light so dense, I couldn’t even keep my eyes open.\nAnd without a chance to dodge, a large impact raced through my body.\nAn Angel’s power was much different from a Demons. Anyways, it was fast.\nTheir speed truly rivalled light. No matter how much speed you had, you would be unable to outrun it; it was worthy of the name Heavenly Retribution.\nYep, it was probably worthy of that.\nDefinitely.\n“Fufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu\nfufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu”\n“…!?”\nThe light went out.\nI can’t stop my laughter.\nAlong with that killing intent, the angels’ faces had surprise mixed in for a moment. For some reason, without running away, Greed-kun was making himself scarce at the end of the alley, staring at me with his eyes wide open.\nThere wasn’t a single wound on my body.\n“You guys… could it be that you’re idiots? Releasing out an energy attack at a Gula… fufu, there’s something here we like to call sheer stupidity.”\nI cast aside the overcoat, which now had a large hold burned into it.\nThe pitch-black clothing I wore underneath were『Gobbling Garments』 produced through a Gluttony Skill.\nEverything’s got to do with affinity. Gluttony was relatively weak against physical attacks, but against magic attacks, it was extremely strong. Even against something made of our natural killer, 『Light』, that fact held true.\nThe black clothing absorbed all light, as if it were a black hole. Even under the light of the sun, it was nothing but uniform black.\nStill… it wasn’t tasty at all. I’m sure it tasted quite fine when I last partook ten thousand years ago, but…\nHow unfortunate, but there’s nothing to be done.\nEven if I’m not to eat, Angels and Demons are opposing forces.\nFufu, how about I hitch a ride on that theory for a while?\nI turned the palm of my own hand to the two Angels.\n“I’ll show you a darkness that devours all light.”\nAs if taking those words as a trigger, the Angels’ wings began emitting light once more.\nBut at that point, I had already fired off my Wave of Starvation. The wave that gradually encroached on them was the hunger my soul thrived of in itself. For the longest time, it was the curse that obeyed my will.\nAs the light passed through the depths of the darkness, it was eaten up, and faded away.\nThe bland turned to pure energy, and filled my body. I’m not soft enough to be done in by elementary Skills.\nI birthed countless 『Tentacles』 from my body. Because my own two arms had proven insufficient, I became able to create them. They were my hands.\nThey numbered a hundred. Of course, that number vastly exceeded the Angels’ limbs, and also Greed-kun’s hands.\nThe Angels’ expressions warped in disgust. Nice expression. That’s a nice face you’re making there.\n“Then, I’ll start.”\nTen for movement. The other ninety for attack.\nI manipulate my tentacles like whips to swipe at the angels from the side.\nPerhaps not in the mood to be touched by them, the two Angels acted in unison. Their wings let off light, and they flew up vertically to avoid.\nIt was one of their selling points. Something that even lower class Angels possessed without exception- their heavenly wings… their mobility.\nAnd as a Gula Demon with numerous means of attack, regardless of distance, I had a good affinity here.\nAs I swung one tentacle horizontally, I extended another up high, and brought it down at them.\nAnd I extend another. Once you get to my level, the tentacles’ numbers and lengths can be freely manipulated and changed.\nFor the one coming at them from above, the Angels barely dodged to the said.\nAs they dodged, from the palms of their hands, they shot of large Novas, several times the power of their previous attack.\nThe balls of light numbered in the dozens. Masses of destructive energy cause the townscape to change. They shot them off without properly deciding a target, so they hit building after building, causing their collapse.\nThe ground shook greatly. Power great enough to alter the terrain. But with an increase in destructive power, the speed dropped off. As the came at me with speeds much lower than their light, there wasn’t the space for me to dodge.\nI packed power into the tentacles at my feet, and had them bore into the ground.\nAnd I avoided them all. Within my Zone, I could perceive everything. I understood the area, and for the balls of light without that great a speed to begin with, I could dodge them even with my eyes closed.\nAnd like that, receiving power from the masses of muscle that were my tentacles, In just a step, I had reached the space right below the two Angels floating in the sky. Of course, in that space of time, I didn’t stop the tentacles coming at them up there either.\nThe skies don’t belong to you guys alone. If I felt like it, then like a spider’s web, I could string up my hands.\nNothing can escape from my dinner plate.\n“Uge… you sure do some reckless things…”\nI barely heard Greed-kun whisper to himself with a stiff expression.\nReckless?\nFufufu… that’s just how a Lord’s battles go.\nI think your Lord’s the one who’s all over the place! Even if I try forgetting, I’ll never be able to get that taste out of my mind!\nThe moment the Angels had their full attention focused on the hands coming at them from up high, I gave the ground a nice kick.\nI put the tentacles I used for movement to offensive use. As a large number of Tentacles came at them from below, one of them tried diverting them, the other directed the palm of his hand at me.\nFufu, for them to still be relying on magic Skills at this point…\nOf course, this isn’t my place to complain. The ones who hold responsibility for this one are you guys alone\nAs if to match him, I also held out both my hands.\n“Judgement Rain.”\n“The Skyeater’s Darkness.”\nAnd light and dark were to clash once more.\nThe light tried to pierce through the darkness, and the dark to suck up the light. In a sense, it was a mini representation of our eternal struggle.\nThe energy I felt from that light was, without a doubt, Lord Class.\nTherefore, the power I got from dissolving it was also large.\nBy drinking down the light, the darkness only gained in strength.\nWhile Avaritia may be the best under the heavens at stealing, there’s no one out there to contest a Gula’s skill at eating.\nEven so, I doubt I’ll be able to stomach all this energy. No matter what, the power of darkness was always a step behind that of light.\nWhen Lords of the same level were to duke it out, it was inevitable that the Demons would be the ones torn apart. I knew that all too well.\nThat’s why I tempted them. With tentacles.\n“Fufu… it’s not good to look away like that.”\nI pierced the Angel’s hand with a tentacle I circled around from the side. At the same time the light emitted at me changed course, and flew into the distance.\nFor a moment, I could see surprise on the Angel’s face, and before that faded, the Angel was swallowed into my darkness.\nAn indescribable scream escaped his lips.\nAn exclamation enough to make me shiver. The power of the Angel passing through the darkness flowed into me. It’s likely that at the moment, he’s going through the pain of having his entire body dissolved.\nThe Angel passed through, and gripped my face with the palm of his hand.\nI couldn’t see his expression. But it was easy to imagine. It must be the expression I’ve always found directed at me.\nAnd that’s why, as always, I offered some words of gratitude.\n“Thank you for the meal.”\nIn a short moment, the Angel’s body fully settled into my stomach. Only the remnants of his magic overflowed onto my lips.\nAs I thought, it’s quite tasteless. It seems that he did properly raise his power level, but this is way too bland, you know…\nFollowing the law of gravity, I landed on the ground. As long as I have these Gobbling Garments on, I don’t even raise a cloud of dust, but out of habit, I patted down my trousers.\nThe other Angel wasn’t there anymore. I knew.\nThe moment the first one tried to shoot of that ‘Judgement Rain’ attack, the second took flight. Perhaps, if the other one had stayed behind, I wouldn’t have been able to pierce that Angel’s hand. And even after having his comrade desert him, the emotions of the Angel firing down his judgement at me didn’t shift in the slightest.\nThat goes to say that was their plan from the start.\n“Fu… they’re way too understanding. How boring…”\nIf they were floating around, that’d be one thing, but I’ve no means to catch up to an Angel flying a straight line path away\nIn the first place, that lack of taste doesn’t let me work up a desire to give chase. The instincts for battle, the instincts for strife burned into my body were restrained upon eating that first one.\nIn the past, it was unthinkable for me to let an ingredient flee from before my eyes, but… well, I wonder if this isn’t too bad either.\nI looked around the town that had become a mountain of rubble, and found Greed-kun looking at me from a corner.\nAs always, that’s quite some courage there. With a former enemy, a former Demon Lord before his eyes, for him not to be harboring any fear, even for a General Class Demon, that isn’t an easy thing to pull off.\nWell, even so, in the end, that’s all he is to me…\n“Ki ki ki, as always, that’s some absurd power you’ve got…”\n“Fufu… even if you call them Lords, they weren’t anything to speak of.”\nJust as Demon Lords differed from start to finish, Saint Lords had a wide gap between the top and the bottom.\nEven among them, the Lords I just met were… small fries.\nWell, even then, there’s no doubt they’re a rare food stock to find in this vast Demon World.\nI let out a large sigh, and patted my stomach.\nAh… maybe if my appetite returns…",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 2: Gula’s Starvation, Part 3: It’s no good… I guess\nI smelled it.\nThe table before my eyes was crammed full of various types of food.\nBesides a single territory, the Demon World was covered in poverty. That’s why it’s a rare sight to see so many dishes spread out, but I was of a sort that didn’t really mind appearances, so that didn’t really matter.\n… As long as it sates my hunger.\nOn top of a white polished plate was a meat dripping fresh blood.\nAs a Demon of Gluttony, I could understand. That was Dragon meat.\nThe raw meat of one of the few races of this Demon World able to fight on par with Demon. Of course, it was a rare delicacy, and its taste was supposed to be splendid enough to put it on the same level as Demons.\nAs I silently looked upon the masses of meat distributed across the plates, the large-built Demon that had brought it timidly asked a question\nHe was likely a Pride or Greed. I didn’t know his name, or his power. His lust for the limelight alone was first-rate, and he was a pitiful man who tried attacking me when I was furrowing my brow, and slowly walking alone.\nTo a Demon Lord, most Demons below General Class were generally just part of the rabble. At the very least, to one that had spent long years in the position like me, even when I’d lost my cravings, I could only speak of him as ‘one of those other Demons.’\n“… I-is it to your tastes? It’s the meat of the Crimson Dragon subjugated just the other day. Meat that won’t fall short of any Demon… For someone like you that governs Gula, it must be more than a suitable offering, right?”\n“… Hah…”\nThe Demon frantically tried to shrink his body, and his throaty voice shook. There really isn’t anything more unsightly than this.\nI played around with the silver fork I took in hand, and gazed at the Dragon mean.\nHow troublesome. As I thought, it’s not whetting my appetite. I’ve no mood to eat it.\nIt’s smell wasn’t bad at all, and the power exerted by the meat was quite clear. Speaking of Class, it may even surpass a General Class Demon’s. It won’t transcend a Demon Lord, of all things, but even so, there’s no mistaking that it was a first-rate edible.\nFor the pitiful man kneeling before me, it must have been quite a trouble to obtain.\nNormally, I would have devoured it without a second thought, but now it was futile. My feelings aren’t moved.\nEven the concept of hunger itself is starting to disappear across the horizon of my memory.\nIn the first place, once a Demon becomes a Demon Lord, they can go several years without food or drink. That’s why there’s probably no need to worry about death, and for someone like me, who went through such an intense sense of irritation just through a single day without food, this was definitely the strangest state I had ever found myself in.\nIn the end, I couldn’t work up the intention to eat it no matter what, and without staining the end of the fork at all, I left it on the table.\n“… No, I’m good.”\n“… Eh? You haven’t even touched it, haven’t…”\n“… You can eat it if you want.”\nAh……………………\nThis isn’t me. This definitely isn’t my character. Just how am I supposed to face my subordinates waiting for me in the world beyond!?\nNormally, the food, and the plate, and the silverware, and the Demon that made it all would have been in my stomach by now. I’m the freaking Devourer, dammit!\nI dismounted the chair, and passed by the Demon staring at me in a daze.\nAnd without eating a single thing in the end, I left the store.\nAt the entrance, a needlessly wary Greed-kun was waiting for me.\nOh, he wasn’t Greed-kun, was he… right, Deije.\nDeije Breindac. Former general of Leigie Slaughterdoll’s army.\nWell, at the point, he’s just a lone Demon searching for treasure in foreign lands, it seems.\nFufu, that’s what you call unemployed, you know. Unemployed.\n“… Oy, oy, so you’ve seriously lost your cravings…”\n“Yeah. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.”\nCleanly gone. Nothing left. All that remained in me was a deep feeling of loss.\nI had no clue of the means I needed to fill that. There’s nothing I’m capable of besides eating.\nDeije-kun knitted his brow into a difficult expression, and folded his arms.\n“… I’ve never heard of something like that…”\n“Yeah, that’s because I’m the first.”\nEven if he’s long lived, at the very least, he’s probably younger than me.\nWell, for the individual that lost their longings, it definitely wouldn’t be a fun thing to speak of, and even if such a case came up in the past, there’s a possibility it never spread too far.\nIf I took away the point of looking at Deije-kun as an ingredient, he was a rare find among Demons, an ‘accomplished individual.’\nUsually, the deeper a Demon’s desire runs, the harder it is to hold a conversation with them. In that sense, with his shallow desire, he may still be a novice of a Demon, but as a travelling companion, he wasn’t half bad.\nIn contrast to his monster-like appearance, he was quite straight-forward. That man.\nWell, that’s something I was even able to notice when I fought him a year prior.\n“Well, that’s how it is, so the current me doesn’t have the willpower to eat you.”\n“Ki ki ki, that so?I get the feeling it’s nice and peaceful that way…”\nSeeing him let out quite a deep sigh gave me the impression he was quite the pessimist.\nIt’s not good to overthink things, you know. If you’re going to think so hard about something make it thoughts towards how you plan to satisfy your own desire.\nThinking of something, I tried asking him.\n“… You, could it be that you usurped my appetite?”\n“Wha… like hell I did. Even if you begged me, I wouldn’t want to take it.”\nWell, that’s about right.\nThe target of his theft I likely treasure. You can call that the most popular type of Greed.\nIn the first place, I doubt someone who wanted something like my appetite would ever become an Avaritia. If there was a Demon like that, they would definitely come to govern Gula instead.\nDeije-kun’s disgusted face was the real deal. Fufu, you don’t have to hate it that much…\nDeije-kun, and that Zeta-kun fellow seemed to be suffering quite a bit, but once you become a Demon Lord, this level of heat isn’t enough to influence you in the slightest.\nRegardless of having eaten that Angel, after confirming that not a particle of my hunger had retrned, I lowered myself into a seat at the café.\nOf course, it wasn’t the one I had collapsed at before. That shop was destroyed from the shockwaves of the Angels’ attacks.\nThe shop chosen to grace our reunion was somewhat newer than that other one, but there wasn’t much a difference between them. It was that sort of small diner.\nPerhaps because it was a ways away from the battlefield, the air was calm as if that scene from before had been but a dream.\nIt was enough to make one sleepy.\nWith Deije-kun sitting across, and Zeta-kun positioned to watch my every move, I conversed. They didn’t seem to intend to hide anything, and they smoothly explained the current state of affairs.\nIt looks like the Demon World’s state had changed greatly in the time I’d been gone.\nIt was right of me to set out for the Crimson Prison. My name was likely spread across the lands. As the foolish Demon Lord who tried to pull a bow at Kanon-sama.\nThat’s why meeting someone who knew my face like Deije-kun was a form of luck. Yep, I must be in luck. It’s not like we’ve become comrades in arms or anything, but there are plenty of Demon out there who won’t listen to what you have to say.\nAlso, when I’m left alone, that feeling of loss wins over, and brings a hinderance to my daily function, so in that sense, this moderate level of tension isn’t bad.\nAngels and Valkyries.\nLeigie’s demotion in rank, and of how Heard Lauder became a Demon Lord.\nThese old tales were all fresh news to me.\nOf all else, Leigie’s fall didn’t settle right. I wonder what happened.\nAt the very least, the achievement of bringing ruin to me should count towards his promotion, and not the opposite.\nThe fact that the Ancient Demon who moved the army under his name, Heard Lauder, became a Demon Lord makes the possibility that Heard Overruled Leigie to be the most likely option, but…\nWhatever the case, it looks like my death was the starting point of something.\nA Pride Demon, and me of Gluttony don’t have too good of an affinity. They’re not an enemy I’d like to fight, but… if my annihilation started up something, then if my survival was found out, I got the feeling he would come for me. It was quite a pain.\nBut putting me aside, the two Greed-kuns were focusing on the former.\nFuture over past. Well, it’s not like I don’t see where they’re coming from. The problem with Leigie was mine alone, and Deije-kun was irrelevant.\nWhile Deije-kun had become quite affable, Zeta-kun continued to send suspicious eyes in my direction, so I decided to just play along.\n“Hmm… Angels, is it? I guess blue moons really do rise.”\n“What’s more, Saint Lord Class. Ki ki ki, there’s definitely something up.”\nAs he said that, Deije-kun’s eyes sparkled with desire as if he were staring at his prey.\nIt was common knowledge that Angels occasionally descended, but that was in low frequency, and those with over a set level of competence wouldn’t think of coming down.\nFor Saint Lord class, if you exclude the War of Black and White ten thousand years ago, it was a story I hadn’t heard at all as of late.\nDeije-kun’s words were quite on the mark.\n… But that’s all they were.\nIt feels bad to dampen the flame on Deije-kun’s earnest desire, but this isn’t that sort of story. This won’t be the path to his glory.\nFrom my point of view, it was all too clear, but a General has a General’s point of view, and a Lord, a Lord’s.\n“Fufu… Deije-kun, you’re reading too much into it. Fufu… if you want Glory, then stop chasing around something like Angels, and start aiming to become a Demon Lord already.”\nThat was the first crossroad.\nFor a Demon who can’t even do that, there’s no glory to be found.\nAnd chasing Angels is a waste of time. Honing the mind and body on the path to become a Demon Lord isn’t something done in order to destroy angels and Demons.\nIt’s all about seeing the depths of your desire. That’s all there is to it.\nIt’s another matter when battle is directly related to said desire, but your Sin isn’t something like that, right?\nFufu, this is what they call escapism, isn’t it?\nDeije frowned, and regretfully shook his head.\n“Ki ki ki, reaching that level isn’t something I can imagine for myself. I’ll just take it as it comes.”\nFufu… do what you will.\nOf course, even if it be to friendly troops, any Avaritia willing to lend out the target of their longings (treasures) will never become a Demon Lord, you know…\nRight, his sin is… too shallow. I know of a greed that burns much more brightly.\nFor Deije-kun who chose to toss away his treasure, of all things, it may be a matter of pure nature, but this is quite severe.\nZeta-kun asked Deije-kun a question. It looked like they were partners, and had a sort of teacher-student relationship.\nThe young boy Demon’s expression did indeed hold the color of trust towards him.\n“So, Deije-san. What should we do? We ended up letting one of them get away…”\n“… Now that a Lord’s in the mix, we can’t go on at this rate. I did plan to give chase, but at that level, to be honest, it’s beyond my hands.”\nOur natural enemy, the Angels.\nAnd the difference of Rank.\nDeije-kun’s words were correct. Depending on the situation, Avaritia could exhibit unrivalled strength, but in pure fighting power, it fell a step behind Ira and Gula.\nIf he had that Demon Blade from before, I’ll bet he’d be able to put up a decent fight with a Saint Lord of that level, though.\nThat thing was all bark, and no bite.\n“Ki ki ki, for now, let’s at least write in a report to the Great Demon King… even something of that level should give off a considerable reward.”\nFufuf… how sweet. How very sweet. Having Lust Demons for sweetness is more than enough.\nSweeetness and firmness. He’s pushing too hard on the brakes. There are times when wiles fall short of bravery. That was a phenomenon that we age old demons rarely come to witness.\nKanon-sama was a Lord that governed Wrath, yet also a kind-hearted King.\nThat’s why, even even with a simple report, there would likely be a bit of a reward. But Deije-kun, if you keep at it like that, then what you seek will never fall into your hands.\n“So, Zebul. What do you plan on doing?”\n“… Well then, that’s a good question.”\nThe Angel wasn’t tasty at all, but still, there was something to be gained.\nMy physical condition isn’t bad… No, the truth’s that I understand I’m at peak condition. The current me could probably even put up a more decent fight with that Leigie. Once more, I’ll get some experience fighting that Lord of Sloth. I won’t be crushed so easily this time around.\nOf all else, the current me doesn’t taste anything no matter what I try to eat. That’s why perhaps I’ll be able to eat him this time around. Fight poison with poison… I wonder if that’s what you’d call it.\nIt’s the life I’ve gotten together again, so challenging him again doesn’t sound bad. I’m a challenger… fufufu, when I think of it that way, my heart dances just a bit.\nPerhaps sensing something from my expression, Deije opened just one of his six eyes, and asked.\n“Zebul, won’t you come with me? In the past, we were mutual enemies, but that’s exactly why I can understand your strength. Ki ki ki, taking on Angels instead of Demons isn’t a bad change of pace, once in a while, right?”\n“Fu… I’ll have to decline.”\nHis proposal was a respectable one, even shocking to hear from a Demon. Inviting along one who once terrorized me in the past isn’t something I could imagine.\nBut even if I’d lost my cravings, I had my dignity as a former Demon. Also, the merits of answering to his invite were too low.\nAn Angel’s taste held too little value to me.\n“Why?”\n“Fufufu… I have a need to go and meet… eat up that Leigie.”\nThat was my obligation as a challenger to one who’d bested me once before.\nDeije-kun distorted his face a little, and directed a gaze as if he were looking at a monster in my direction.\n“… Just where do you find such energy after you were thoroughly destroyed like that…”\n“That’s obvious… if I go on without eating, I can’t call myself a Gula anymore.”\nEven if I’m not hungry at all. I doubt you’d understand it.\nThis is a matter of pride.\n“… Well, well, well, I guess all of those Demon Lords out there are a bit off their rockers.”\n“And that’s exactly why they’re all tasty.”\n“Deije-san… is this person alright in the head?”\nZeta-kun’s face was quite clearly stiffened as he pointed at me.\nWhat a rude child.\nWell, I didn’t expect him to understand my train of thought anyways. This is mine, and mine alone.\nFufu… even if you may be Greed, I won’t let you take it from me so easily.\n“… So you’ll be off to the Dark Prison, then… Ki ki ki, the ownership of that land has already shifted. Heard Lauder’s a tough one, you know? I mean, that there’s a Superbia who’s followed Boss Leigie from time immemorial. He’s even the Rank One Demon Lord at the moment. While you may be the Devourer, it’s too heavy a burden.”\n“Fufu.”\nYou really don’t get it.\nYes, your words are all correct.\nAs it is, Pride grows stronger the more years pass by. If that gets to around the same level of time as Leigie’s existence, then no normal Demon Lord would be able to lay a finger on them. Ranks aren’t just some decoration, and as Gluttony, my affinity against him is bad.\n… But that’s not enough of a reason for me not to eat.\nFufu… Rank One’s Pride.\nHeard Lauder. It’s unfortunate that I won’t be able to partake in your matured taste.\nBut there’s no helping it. You may be a bit heavy for an appetizer, but I’ll eat you up all the same.\n“… Keh, looks like you’ve no mind to change your intentions.”\n“Could it be you’re making light of me, Deije-kun? Fufu… even like this, I’m a former Demon Lord, you know.”\n“No, of course, I know that, but…”\nDeije let out a dissatisfied sigh.\nIt was likely his own shallow desire that prevented him from empathizing with me.\nThe two of us were different lifeforms. The souls that formed our base, and our ranks were different. My power was higher class even among the other Demon Lords, and no matter how strong Deije-kun became, no matter how many Demon Blades he held, that gap was close to absolute.\nI wonder if he’s noticed it.\nThat in the eyes he used to look at me, there was a slight color of awe mixed in.\n“Yep… each and every one of you Lords is just too hard to deal with. There’s no helping it. I’ll just do as I wish, them.”\n“And I don’t plan on stopping you. Carry out your cravings as you please. Fufufu… make sure you don’t regret it when they’re all gone.”\n“I can’t even imagine these feelings in me going out. Ki ki ki, from my eyes, Zebul the Devourer… I can’t see that yours has gone out either.”\nAs me muttered that with exaggeration, he raised a peculiar laugh.\nHis eyes, and his voice didn’t give me the impression he was joking around.\nWell, desire is something you keep within yourself. Only their possessors can truly grasp their natures.\nAs it to answer to that, I licked my lips.\nAfter trembling a little, Deije-kun got up. He had a goal of his own. I had neither the right, nor the motivation to stop him.\n“So will you be departing any time soon? From here on plan on heading for the Palace of Rending Flames as soon as I can.”\n“Fufu… perhaps I’ll go meet an old friend first. Stopping to talk once in a while isn’t a bad thing.”\nIn the first place, it was a coincidence I chose to set foot in the Crimson Prison.\nI came here without any detours, so I hadn’t even heard the slightest rumor an Angel had come down, and I never even imagined I would see someone I knew.\nBut when It came down to it, I met the Angels, and I met Deije-kun. It may be off from my goal, but while I’m at it, another meeting or two doesn’t sound bad.\nHumans sure are interesting creatures… no, I’m pretty sure I mean Demons.\n“An old… friend?”\n“Yeah… I’ve been alive for a while… even if I look like this, I’ve been around quite a bit.”\nOf course, a majority of those acquaintances have taken up residence in my stomach…\nIf you look at it from the other side, you can think of the one I was off to meet as one of the rare acquaintances I had that didn’t settle down there.\nThere’s also the fact I couldn’t eat him because we were part of the same army under the Great Demon King, but the greater reason lay with that Demon’s power.\nFufufu…\nWell, it’s not like we got along anyways. We’re comrades in longevity, so there’s that sympathy thing or another.\nSuspecting something, Deije-kun opened his six exes, and stared hard enough to bore a hole in my face.\n“Oy, oy, you couldn’t mean…”\n“Fufufu… well, we’re friends… after all.”\n“… That’s news to me.”\nIt was a somber voice as heavy as lead.\nAs if smacked by that voice, Deije-kun and Zeta-kun took large leaps back. I had noticed it all along, so I wasn’t surprised, but that presence surely was fearsome.\nStrong enough that even with General Class power, you wouldn’t have been able to perceive it.\nIf I didn’t have my Abyss Zone, it was so thin that even I might have lost sight of it, and that inherently tremendous existence, was one of a rare Demon who didn’t show off a single piece of the power he had stored up from times beyond memory.\nThat was the base of the Pride this Demon governed.\nZeta-kun looked up at his large frame with a stiff expression.\n“W-what… you.. from when…”\n“… Tsk.”\nHe was about two heads over Deije-kun, making one think he was one of the 『Greip Giants』 that once inhabited this Demon world.\nHis protruding muscles were built like stone, and they covered his entire body like armor. The gap between his dignity and his light presence left one with and absurdly ominous sensation.\nVanity Seidthroan.\nA Demon Lord who gave up on the throne.\nHe was quite a rude one whose first sounds directed at me were the click of his tongue. The great Lord of Demons boasting the moniker of The Egoist, used his thunderous voice that reverberated through the skies to throw out some lamentations.\n“Why are you alive… that Slothful Lord… didn’t destroy you… perfectly enough.”\n“Fufu… how rude a fellow. For those to be the words of our long-awaited reunion.”\nAlong with an overflowing smile, deep despair started sputtering around me like sparks.\nAs I thought… isn’t no good.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 2: Gula’s Starvation, Part 4: Seconds Please\nBefore I knew it, the store was surrounded by countless soldiers. Just like Vanity, their presences were faint, and the sense of reality of the situation was compromised.\nDeije-kun’s face tensed, as he surveyed the area without a hint of negligence. His bearing was high strung, but there wasn’t any fear.\nMen and women of all ages. Their bodies, and powers, and sizes varied greatly, but in just one regard, did that Legion have a trait that put it apart from the armies of other Demon Lords.\nWithout any divide among their movements, they all fixed their eyes on me.\nLet along an expression, their entire faces were enveloped in full masks of the darkest black.\nThey somewhat resembled the subordinates of Vanity when I first met him, but they were also somewhat different.\nVanity the Egoist’s subordinates were a peculiar unit known as the Ravus Persona.\nTheir origin, or reason, nothing about them was known.\nIt wasn’t for their strength, but for their ominous appearance that their names were spread. An incomprehensible army.\nIf we were looking at strength here, then Leigie’s army that Deije-kun once commanded would far outclass them. As long as Vanity wasn’t with them, that is.\nBut still, even without their Lord, this army had something I couldn’t put my finger on.\n“Fufu… that’s quite a greeting…”\n“Caution is… natural… no?”\nVanity came to his own conclusion, as he look down at me from a level far above my stature.\nThat goes without saying. I’m Gula. I’m used to putting people on their guard.\nWith their faces covered, the silent Demons weren’t letting out any intent to harm me, and they merely looked on, as if awaiting orders from their master.\nLoyalty. That quality that was exceedingly rare to find in a Demon was even rarer to come across in these numbers.\nFufu… well, I got used to it from past experience.\nAs if looking upon a detestable object, Vanity’s deep and dark eyes full of longings lorded over me.\n“Zebul… damn devourer.”\n“You’re scaring me… fufufu, I’d prefer if you didn’t glare at me that much.”\nThose aren’t… the eyes you direct at an old friend, you know. I mean, I just tried taking a bit of a taste, didn’t I?\nNo matter how many tens of thousands of years pass, he’s a narrow-minded man…\nAnd as always, the number of words he let out were few in numbers. It was apparently a habit he picked up in his childhood, and he couldn’t grow out of it.\nWhat was the saying for this again…\nThe child is the father of the man. Right, that’s the one.\nWithout even trying to hide his disgust, Vanity raised a boorish voice.\n“Why, here?”\n“That one’s… a coincidence, I assure you. Fufu, though I did make a stop here in order to meet with you.”\n“…So I took… the bait.”\nThe Crimson Prison was Vanity’s kingdom.\nEntering it was one thing, but with a Lord like me coming in, there’s no way Vanity didn’t notice it.\nAs if trying to fill in the space between Vanity’s eyes and mine, Deije-kun opened his mouth.\nYour guts alone are to be commended… Deije-kun.\n“Ki ki ki, and so, why in the world have you decided to show up at this point in time, Boss Vanity?”\n“… That, there.”\nVanity used his chin to point me out. As I thought, no matter how many years go by, he’s a rude one.\nFinding satisfaction in that answer, Deije-kun nodded. I’d like to complain a little to that one.\n“… You plan… on eating… more Angels?”\n“… You sure bring up some nostalgic stuff.”\nYes, in the past, I was the Gula who devoured angels, and left nothing behind.\nWhile they may be the natural enemy of Demons, no fault lay with them as ingredients. I have no discrimination among food. Apart from Leigie.\nThat’s why the Gula who ate the most Angels ten thousand years ago was likely me.\nBut of course, my goal this time wasn’t anything like that.\nAs the look of suspicion towards me rose, I spoke up to the man looking over me with an apologetic tone.\n“But this time’s goal is irrelevant to that. Fufu… Vanity. I have some business with Leigie.”\n“… Revenge… huh.”\nA prideful thought. That sort must always have thoughts of violence.\n“I’ve no interest in revenge. It’s because I can’t even eat him. Fufu… this time, I just what to have a little talk. With the Lazy King, that is.”\nYes. Those are my true intentions.\nIf it’s that man, who took inactivity to its extremes, then perhaps he would be able to offer an explanation to my current state.\nNo, even if he can’t… there’s no doubt that man killed the Demon Lord in me. In order to restore my desires once mre, it’s a score I have to settle.\nEven if I’m only to face defeat again.\nVanity easily, and calmly nodded to my words.\n“That… so? Do what… you want.”\n“… Oy, oy, Boss Vanity, you sure about that? The Devourer, Zebul Glaucus, is the Demon Lord who pulled her sword on the Great Demon King, right? Ki ki ki, you sure you don’t have to clean up the matter?”\nYou sure say some unnecessary things. Unnecessary as it may be.\nVanity was definitely a subordinate of the Great Demon King, but he definitely wasn’t her loyal servant.\nIn the first place, Demons are self-serving. Direct orders from the King aside, there’s no rule saying that two Demon Lords who meet by chance have to break into a fight.\nAs I’ve had an unnervingly long relation with him, I can say it for sure.\nEven if he’d given up on the throne, if you were to split the Demon Lords allied to Kanon-sama into factions, he would definitely be on the anti-Kanon faction.\n“… Don’t… die… too quickly.”\n“Fufufu… is this where I’m supposed to give my thanks? Then thank you?”\n“… fu.”\nVanity snorted, before readily showing his back, and walking off.\nAnd as if they were a receding wave on the shore, his subordinates filtered out of the store.\nIt was like I had been seeing a dream, and after that, the situation was exactly the same as it had been before.\nVanity was only here for a brief instant. His presence wasn’t anywhere close at this point. Using my zone, I was just barely able to make him out before, but now it had faded into the mist.\nDeije-kun’s stiff face let out a sigh.\n“Just what… was that? He sure is an ominous one. My instincts were sending shocks of fear all over my body… Ki ki ki, the world sure is wide. I didn’t think it was like this last I saw it… ”\n“… That’s because Vanity was preparing for war. Fufu… it just means he wasn’t as calm as his expression would indicate.”\nFrom times past, that man’s been a coward. To his sin of Superbia, he held a crippling trauma.\nThat’s why he’s so timid, and that’s why he’s so strong.\nI hadn’t seen him in a while, but it looks like Vanity hadn’t changed in the slightest. No, just a little, just by a small margin, he had become more resolved.\nFufufu… Heard Lauder must have stepped on a nerve.\nZeta-kun tilted his head, and posed a question to Deije-kun, who had regained his composition.\n“… But why did he even come all the way here…? Even taking his army with him.”\n“He likely came to hammer me down… fufufu, it’s because I know him quite well.”\nProbably, Kanon-sama included, he was the Demon Lord I’ve known for the longest amount of time.\nFor Demons who I’ve known of that long, there’s probably only that Leigie to contest. Also, perhaps I knew of Heard Lauder, or not.\n“… Hammer?”\n“Right. Hammer. I won’t get in your way, so you don’t go getting up in my business. That sort of thing.”\nThe killing intent flowing out from Vanity was definitely directed at me. To try threatening someone who, for argument’s sake, reigns over Gluttony like me, I can only show some admiration.\nFufu… just as meeting Leigie was my current supreme goal, Vanity must have something as well.\nWell, I do have a general idea, but of course, I’m not going to do anything about it, and it’ll probably come to a result convenient to me anyways.\nRight now, eating was nothing but a pain. It would be best if there were fewer hindrances.\nMisunderstanding something, Deije-kun tensed his face, and let his gaze float out in space.\n“Even so, that imposing air wasn’t normal… does that Vanity have some sort of karma with Angels? It did seem he had taken quite a bit of caution regarding them, but…”\nKarma. Karma, is it?\nDeije-kun was half on the mark, and half off.\nIf you ask whether he has some or not, then that’s probably a yes right there. Among long-lived Demons, I doubt you’d find too many without any karma against those heavenly guys.\n“Fufu, Deije-kun. That Demon is…”\nShould I say it, or not?\nHmm… I hesitated for a moment, but it’s not like any problems would arise just by saying it.\nI wanted to put on airs for a bit, so I decided to teach little old Deije-kun.\n“… a former 『Angel』, you know?”\nAngels and Demons are two sides of the same coin. We’re all made of soul all the same, and the differences between us lied only in if we’re trash, or righteous souls.\nThat’s why, if an Angel falls, their spirits can turn over, and they’ll become Demons.\n“… So he’s Fallen…”\nRight. An Angel falls to a Demon. A 『Fallen Angel』.\nA reversed Angel. An angry soul, betrayed by the love of god. Fufufu, in the first place, he’s much more sinful than I, back when I was still a Demon.\nEven upon hearing my words, Deije-kun was more collected than I expected. Fufu, despite everything, it seems he really has been through a considerable amount of life.\nHe whispered to himself, to confirm the meaning of his words. Half of it may have been to let Zeta-kun follow the conversation, as the lad was looking up a Deije-kun with an uncomprehensive face.\n“Ki ki ki, a former Angel… is it? That sure ain’t anything nice.”\n“Well… that’s right. Fufu, he’s still quite bitter about it.”\nNothing nice. It’s because he wasn’t nice that he fell in the first place. Well, that’s right, I guess.\nBut why is it that Vanity currently holds the seat of a Demon Lord? An absolute existence among the ranks of Demons?\nThis is why humans are so interesting… no, Demons, I mean.\n“… So can Vanity win against those Angels?”\nDeije-kun muttered, but as if he wasn’t looking for an answer, he let his words dangle.\n“Well, if it’s just Angels, he’ll probably win. But Vanity’s enemy this time is no Angel.”\n“… Yeah. No ordinary Angel, a Saint Lord. What’s more, those guys… they went and powered up in the middle of battle. If that wasn’t something they had been concealing, and it really did rise right in the middle of battle, it’s going to get troublesome.”\nFufu… Deije-kun’s quite the worrier.\nBut those worries are needless. At the very least, if it’s an Angel on the level of the one I fought, it won’t be an enemy for Vanity, and that wasn’t even really a battle for me.\nBut I won’t say that one.\nFufufu, what you should be worrying about is yourself, and I need to start worrying about myself as well.\nI turned my thoughts back to me.\nMe alone.\nNow then, how should I go about getting to Leigie…\nHow should I set out…\nIt will be difficult to get past Heard Lauder. That’s just how Demons of Pride are.\nThey have absolute strength, but if I had to say, that power declined the most when faced upfront.\nBut when it was a battle of pursuit, they displayed peerless strength. That was the Original Sin of Superbia.\nIn the first place, will he even fight me?\nLeigie’s Castle of Shadows was deep in the land known as the Dark Prison.\nNo matter what direction I go at it from, I’ll have to tread on the territory of Heard Lauder. Will he think of me as a harmless Demon?\nNo, I doubt it. My power’s too strong for that, and even if I try to get through with words, he’s kinda a battle maniac.\nIn that case, I’ll have to make an opening.\nIf we face off, I don’t think I’ll lose, but it won’t be an easy win.\nPride was generally an attribute that excelled in speed. At Demon Lord Level, they could see the world moving as if it were stagnant.\nSince there’s no way to break through by running, my best bet would be to wait for a good opportunity.\nI don’t really like leaving myself to fate, but luckily for me, it shouldn’t be long before a large gap appears in Heard Lauder’s defenses.\n“Fufufu, an opportunity, is it? How many years has it been… since I did something like waiting for a chance…”\nIt usually works out one way or another if I muscle my way through it… for me.\nThis exhilarating feeling of waiting for something to come wasn’t anything I’ve felt for a long, long time.\nSo what should I say at a time like this… fufu…\n“Seconds… perhaps?”\n“Hm? Did you say something?”\n“Fufu… it’s nothing.”\nI dodged Deije-kun’s suspicious look, and stared out in the direction Vanity had departed.\nNice. That desire, that emotion, it’s quite nice. Vanity the Egoist. From the eyes of someone who’s known you so long, I can’t even believe you were once an Angel.\nTime and luck were on my side.\nFufufu, Leigie. I’ll probably be meeting you in a foreseeable future. Have fun waiting for it.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 3: Acedia’s Neglect, Part 1: Today was Peaceful\nIt was the reaches of space.\nSpace. According to some God out there or another, it was an endless abyss of darkness. Even if one possessed heavenly wings, it wasn’t so easy to span the emptiness that was vaster than the high Heavens, and rumored to exist in a place somewhere far beyond them. And there, it was said that absolutely nothing existed.\nGravity and matter and light and even desire ceased to exist.\nAll that was there was… right.\n“Nothing…”\n“… It’s not… nothing!”\nAn unthinkable amount of power came from those slender arms to pull at me, and from that dark, and warm, and soft space of nothingness, I was dragged out.\nLust generally wasn’t suited to battle, but when love was concerned they did have a nature that raised their abilities quite a bit. Not that it really matters.\nBeautiful golden hair, and deep blue eyes. Her innocent yet delicate features held an air that would knock any Demon that governed another original sin silent.\nBut at the same time, there wasn’t anyone brazen enough to assault her on this land.\nLorna. No last.\nA Luxuria Demon, as well as the Lord of Sloth’s personal maid.\nBut that form I once yearned for, that way of life, none of them were enough to stimulate my desire in the slightest.\nIt’s not like I Overruled her, or that I didn’t even envy her anymore, or anything like that.\nIt all just became a pain. All of it. Perhaps this is a single form of enlightenment.\nBetween me and her, I was just a little shorter, but that was a difference in the range of experimental error. That’s why when she grabbed me, and dragged me around, my feet still slid across the ground.\nWith strong will concealed in those blue eyes that seemed to suck me in, I offered a single word as always.\n“… What?”\n“… Why are you… in Leigie-sama’s bed…”\n‘Twas my daily schedule. That’s why I’m always so sleepy.\nWith my arms locked down by her, I let out a yawn. The corners of Lorna’s lips twitched for a moment, but even that expression of hers was lovable.\nThis may be her natural gift thing… no, is it something that simply comes naturally to Luxuria Demons? I mean, those guys are always tempting others’ carnal desires.\nThe darkness gradually seeping out of the deepest depths of my body.\nLike Envy, it was hard to go against, but overwhelmingly more gentle, and nothing but kind. That force that was sinking my existence into depravity was something called drowsiness.\nI wonder how much time has passed since the path of Sloth opened to me. Recently, I’ve become able to understand Leigie-sama’s sentiment just ever-so-slightly.\nI’m really sleepy. And sluggish.\nJust as Envy continues to scorch, and Gluttony continues to hunger, the desire of Sloth forbade me from making any drastic movement.\n“… Each and every day, just give it up already…”\n“That’s because you haven’t given up on crawling in there each and every day!!”\nAs if her usual calm demeanor was but a lie, Lorna began prodding me with her broom.\nAnd just as I’ve begun to understand Leigie-sama’s feelings as of late, I’ve begun to understand Lorna as well.\nIt’s not that she’s kind. She’s kind to Leigie-sama. She’s spoiling him.\nThere was probably a small difference between the two.\nShe incessantly shakes up my shoulders.\nBut up to here’s just our usual routine. Perhaps because of Sloth’s power, even if she’s shaking me like that, it barely gets through to me.\n“Medea Luxeliaheart! Do your work properly!”\n“… I’m a pillow.”\nIt’s not like working is a pain.\nMy duty is for me to sleep in Leigie-sama’s bed. By sleep, I don’t mean it in any strange way. I’m just trying to indicate pure and simple sleep.\nIn that sense, I’m fulfilling my professional duties more than all else.\nAs evidence, my Sloth Tree is proceeding forward at a reasonable rate.\n“Then… what the hell is that under Leigie-sama’s head!?”\n“… My senpai.”\nWhether he was listening to our exchange or not, Leigie-sama had the back of his head rested against the pillow without moving a single bit.\nThe way he looked as if he were dead hadn’t changed at all. But the power I could feel from him simply existing there was definitely that of a Lord.\nSenpai. My senpai.\nHanded down from the Great Demon King, Kanon Iralaude, he was a pillow crafted from the plumage of infant Fire Dragons. Of course, he didn’t have a name. But having been made of Fire Dragon materials, the pillow was exceedingly durable, possessed ridiculously high fire resistance, and on top of being constantly warmed to a comfortable temperature, he boasted exquisite softness.\nHe was undoubtedly my greatest foe.\nHe was, but recently, I’ve found myself losing interest in mulling over something like that. In the first place, I never accepted it from the start.\nIsn’t it idiotic to envy a pillow? I’ve never heard of an Invidia like that.\nThe reason I still aim for that coveted position is simply because my instincts will me to.\n… And it’s not like I have anything better to do.\nWhat’s more, the greatest bedroom in the Castle of Shadows was undoubtedly the Demon Lord’s bedroom. Just by being here, my power rises.\nLorna silently held a hand mirror up to me. And in it, I saw an expressionless Medea Luxeliaheart, without a trace of the abundant emotions I had before.\nTruly expressionless…\n“… And?”\n“… Hah… Medea. Are you really fine with this?”\n“Yes.”\n“… Hah…”\nAs I gave an immediate response, Lorna let out a deep sigh.\nHer eyes weren’t colored with wrath. They held only the colors of sorrow.\nLorna would never let an angry expression grace her face. Perhaps that was the nature of Lust, or perhaps she had gotten used to Leigie-sama’s behavior, or perhaps it was because she was the one who saved me. I didn’t know the reason.\nShe seemed to want to say something, but once more, she let out a deep, deep sigh, before speaking.\n“At the very least, please wear some clothes… clothes…”\n“… That’s a pain.”\nIn the first place, I’m barely ever going to leave the bed, so there’s no point in wearing clothing, and when I did want to leave, there was only ever Lorna here, so there was no point in hiding anything.\nLeigie-sama’s here too, but I’ll bet he doesn’t even see me when I’m before his eyes, so the emotion of embarrassment before him had vanished at some point. Thinking about it was just a waste of time.\nWithout saying anything to my response, with a smile to indicate, ‘Medea’s drunk again,’ she took a single Glance in Leigie-sama’s direction.\n“Leigie-sama… once I put Medea away, I will bring out your meal, so please wait a moment…”\n“…”\nLeigie’s sleeping time has recently gotten even longer. He doesn’t even make the slightest movements at Lorna’s voice.\nNodding in satisfaction, Lorna quietly extended her arms towards me.\nShe inserted her hands into my armpits, and lifted me up. I didn’t resist. This is also but our daily routine.\nBeing lifted like this was quite a bizarre sensation. It literally felt like I was moving without my feet reaching the ground.\nAs she carried me away like I was a piece of luggage, I offered her a word.\n“Lorna…”\n“Yes?”\n“I think it’s best if you quit it with these pointless things.”\nNo matter how many times you put me away, I’ll return.\nAnd as of late, it’s a scene that’s happened over and over again. As if through homing instinct, no matter how far away she would stow me, I would find myself here.\nEven if it went against my Sloth, perhaps that was the remnants of the Envy left within me.\nI can’t calm down. I have to be here.\n“Medea… you are a bad influence on Leigie-sama.”\n“… Bad… influence?”\nLorna likely offered blind devotion. She saw only what she wanted to see.\nThis is the Lord of Sloth who’s lived an overwhelmingly long time, and you’re saying I’m a bad influence… just what sort of dreams are you seeing of Leigie-sama?\nThere wasn’t a window, but due to the countless candlesticks decorating the walls, the inside of the room was bright.\nOh, even if it was dark, with my night vision, I would be able to make out Lorna’s expression regardless.\nI thought for a moment, and tried asking.\n“So should I wear clothes?”\n“… That isn’t the problem here.”\nThen what exactly is the problem?\nEven if I didn’t ask that, I could guess. If a Demon’s cravings are the validation for their existence, then Lorna’s being is the form of Luxuria.\nBut in this current situation, without envying me, without developing 『Invidia』, she continued to embrace that, and in that sense, she was perhaps superior to me as a Demon.\nShe didn’t answer anything more, as she draped a gray blanket around me, before lifting me up by the armpits again.\nWithout sound, she opened the door of Leigie’sama’s room. The deepest chamber to which no Hero, or Angel had ever reached was, to the maid, and to the worthless Demon known as me, simply a portion of our everyday lives.\nThe army of Leigie of Sloth, that used to exist in such numbers, could now be counted on a single hand. The inside of the Castle of Shadows, constructed of black stone, was dreadfully quiet.\nThe powerful and famous army had largely been absorbed into the forces of a certain Heard Lauder. No, that was probably Heard’s army to begin with. That’s why that was the natural result.\nThis castle was always much too vast.\nEven compared to the Great Demon King’s Palace of Rending Flames I had visited once before, its scale was off the charts. It could fit two or three of those cities around inside it with ease.\nNo, in truth, while this castle was a castle, it was just as much a town itself.\nNot just subordinates, all of the subjects under the protection of the Lord of Sloth gathered at this stronghold. Of course, they lived apart, but that was also one characteristic of the Castle of Shadows.\nAdditions, and annexes added onto one another, and onto this bizarrely bloated Demon Lord estate. Inside, a countless number of Demons had their own properties, and it had already developed into a sort of labyrinth.\nBut all of that is already a story of the past.\n“Now, Medea. We’re here.”\nWhile I was nodding off, it seems we arrived. The place I found when I lifted my eyelids was my own room I had become accustom to. Without any decent garnishings, it was a very practical room.\nLorna’s room was the one beside it. That wasn’t always the case, but since I began carrying around Sloth, she altered her station. So she could deal with me easier.\nMy body was left on the bed, and Lorna hit her hands against each other as if she had just finished cleaning up.\nHow rude…\nShe tilted her head in thought, and murmured.\n“Wouldn’t just tying her to her bed be for the best…?”\n“No use.”\nIt was a pain, so I just gave two words.\nRight, that won’t work.\nIt’s a given that Lorna’s schemings will end in failure.\nEven like this, I’m a General Class Demon. In just basic specs, I far surpassed the maid.\nIn this dog-eat-dog world, that simple truth was an absolute value.\nWith a wordless expression, Lorna looked at me.\n“Then just… work a little. Every day, you just keep sleeping in that bed…”\n“…”\nThen why not tell that to Leigie-sama?\nIn the first place, I am working. In my own sense of values, I’m continuing to pursue my desire. I mean, yeah, I haven’t been fighting as of late, but it’s not like fighting’s all there is to life.\nJust what is Lorna wishing of me?\nThat was the biggest mystery. Leigie-sama no longer has any territory besides this castle, and this structure was completely surrounded by Heard’s domain.\nPossessing a territory surrounded on all sides by allied forces was a trait that no one else but the Great Demon King boasted.\nMeaning there isn’t a single one to invade here.\nEven if you think long and hard about it, I doubt there are many out there who could get past that Heard Lauder.\n“Leigie-sama is fine. Because that’s his job…”\n“…”\nThen what’s different with me? No, Leigie-sama’s sleeping time is rapidly growing in length. I spend about half a day asleep, but while I’m awake, the only time I ever see Leigie-sama awake is during his meal time. That meal is also fed to him by Lorna, so I can’t even say with certainty that he’s awake at those times.\nI’m quite gone case, but Leigie-sama’s on another level.\nThat great divide was something I could only look to in respect. Just what can I do to sleep for such a long time…\nWhen looked at from afar, Leigie-sama was quite bad, but when observed up closely, he was even worse, and even greater than that, was Lorna’s habit of taking everything in a favorable light. I don’t know what’s going on anymore.\nAnd all was at peace at the Castle of Shadows.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 3: Acedia’s Neglect, Part 2: Honestly, it’s Troubling\nI’m bored.\nDemons of Sloth are bored. Their cravings don’t require any stimulus from the outside world.\nNo stimulus means their bodies, and their hearts give no reactions. They can’t.\nTo summarize, one with Sloth at his base aside, for a half-assed one with other longings within me, it was quite an unbearable sensation.\nThis must be why there aren’t any out there that reach the extremes of their power through simple sleep.\nBoredom was the slayer of Sloth.\nI remembered back when there was a Sloth Demon among my subordinates. He was an exceedingly weak Demon, but that stands to reason. The more they move, the more Sloth’s power declines. Being enlisted in the army pretty much means there was no helping his powers dropping to such a low level.\nHe didn’t lose the use of his Skills, but the greater problem was that his base abilities were much too low. As a soldier, it was a fatal error.\nOn top of that, Sloth Skills weren’t even used for offense.\nEvery kind of resistance imaginable, VIT elevation, and other defensive Skills, as well, as some passives to let one live life without having to eat, and some passives to prevent one’s body from getting dirty, and some passives to make excretion unnecessary, and… anyways, there was an absurd amount of passives. Passive perfectly describes a Demon of Sloth, but no matter how you look at it, that’s an invitation to death’s door.\nThat’s why there’s no reason to embrace it, or a reason to forge it. For what purpose did Leigie-sama continue to push on with it, I didn’t understand even a fragment of his thought process.\nBut at the very least, I’m quite certain that the other Demon Lords proceed down their paths at a rate that leaves Sloth back in the dust.\nAnd… I’m bored.\nBy doing nothing but wriggling around in the mattress like this, I end up recalling unnecessary things. I’m starting to feel a sense of inferiority.\nLike, am I really alright with it like this?\nWithout finding victory, some hazy, cloud-like thing was wandering around the depths of my heart.\nWhat’s useful at times like these are my Invidia Skills.\nEnvy.\nIt was the most common Original Sin embraced by the Demons of the Demon world.\nThe heart to find jealousy in others was to Demon, and Humans, something anyone had felt at least once in their lives.\nFortune, and tragedy, and talent, and power, and treasure, and fame.\nEven in this desolate world, there was an abundance of targets to envy.\nIt was the complete opposite sin to Pride, and its versatility of use was something not found within the other Skill Trees.\nWell, I put a lot out there, but to say it simply… it’s optimum for killing time.\nWhile lying face up on the bed in my room, I activated a Skill.\n“Envy Vision”\nMy field of vision frothed over in an instant, and changed.\nIt’s a Skill to observe those you’ve Envied. Based on time and place, this was an evasive Skill that could display considerable power. It could only target the targets of your Envy, and that restriction was quite a fault, but for the current me, it didn’t really matter who I saw, so there wasn’t really a problem.\nFirst, the General who once served under the same banner of Leigie’s Legion, an Avaritia Demon, The Usurper, Deije Breindac. Let’s peep at him.\nIt’s been a bit since Deije left, but I get the feeling it hasn’t been too long either. While it may be one sided, I can frequently view his form.\nWithout taking up a position in another army, after he resigned, Deije had been wandering here and there across the lands.\nThere are few of General Class. That’s why regardless of what army he takes up service in, he should receive a favorable reception. Despite that, without taking up any official duty, he sought the fulfillment of his longings, walking through foreign lands. Of his way of life, I was a little jealous.\nIt seems he even got himself a tag-along. A Demon about as young as me. One with ashen hair and eyes.\nComparing his slender body to Deije’s was like equating a woodchip to a tree, but the power I sensed from his body was definitely nothing so small.\n“… How nice.”\nCompared to that, how about me?\nHow many months has it been since I last tasted the outside air? I can barely even remember it.\nSince attaining Sloth, I’ve just done nothing but lie atop the bet, and spent my time lazing around.\nIf you ask about my growth, I am growing, so I can’t really say anything about it, but that growth was limited to my power as a Demon, and other than that, nothing had changed at all.\nThinking too deep about it would lower my spirits, so I changed my train of thoughts.\nI craned my ears to Deije’s and that tag-along who seemed to be called Zeta’s conversation.\n“… Angel.”\nI’d never really met one before, but I’ve heard the rumors. That name belonged to the natural enemy of Demons, who lived atop the heavens, and the polar opposite existence to Demons.\nThe war that broke out around ten thousand years ago birthed considerable casualties on both sides, apparently, and the older Demons rarely ever talk about it.\nRecently, the fact that more heavenly assassins had been descending had become the topic of gossip, and I’d listened in to that.\nIt appears that Deije is pursuing them. I don’t know the reason, and even if I heard it, I doubt I’d understand. Deije’s desire was stronger than mine, it’s probably something like that.\nIf he’s telling the truth, then will that something that’s going on in the Demon World make it’s way all the way here?\n… Yeah, probably not.\nAfter thinking a little, I ended up answering my own question.\nLeigie-sama is strong. He doesn’t move in the slightest, yet he’s overwhelmingly strong\nEven if that something were to aim for his neck, they’ll give up soon enough. They’ll understand the complete lack of meaning in such a deed, and how their power would never amount to enough.\nI changed my posture, and pushed my face into my pillow.\nDespite what she says, Lorna cleans my room as well, so there’s no obstacles to my slacking.\nWithout shifting my body, I changed over to the next target.\nWhat entered my eyes was the form of a single girl with teary eyes, and grit teeth, looking over in my direction.\nShe was trying to form a smile at her mouth, but even a moment’s glance could tell you how cramped her face was.\nHer form could be described as a little younger version of Lorna, with her breasts quite a bit withered. She definitely had an attractive face and figure to an extent.\nThe name of the girl who, if you wiped away the smile full of ill intent constantly covering her face, would look identical to Lorna, was Hiero.\nLorna’s younger sister, and the Demon who’s set to look after Leigie once Lorna is gone.\nBut she wasn’t the target of my Envy.\nMy target was the one calmly standing at Hiero’s side.\nLike Leigie, the Demon boasted black eyes and hair, as if they were fashioned of darkness.\nBut the air about him was the opposite of the lazy Lord.\nThe Demon whose mere existence constantly exerted an aura that forced all creation to their knees was a Demon Lord who governed Superbia.\nAt the same time, he was once my superior, and upon becoming a Lord, he easily crumbled the ranking system, and took over the Rank One position among Demon Lords.\nThe Prideful Kaiser, Heard Lauder.\nAt this point, he was a Lord of Pride that no one didn’t know of, and with his condescending eyes pinned on Hiero, he raised his arm to the horizontal.\nTowards an area of empty space, he lightly lowered that arm.\n… And with just that, the ground split.\nWithout using a Skill, the pressure from that single attack had torn the ground asunder. The earth quivered as if choked with tears, as black pebbles rolled across the ground.\nBut with a single word from Heard, all of them fell flat on the earth.\nHeard used his chin to indicate the natural disaster he had personally brought about. Even during that motion, his glare continued to pierce through Hiero.\nWith a dejected expression, the girl pointed to herself, as she tilted her head in a planned-out cute gesture.\nHeard completely ignored that flirtation, and gave a single order.\n『Do it.』\n“Pu… Nonono, that’s impossible.”\nI unintentionally let out a laugh.\nJust what does Heard Lauder think Hiero is?\nShe’s an ordinary person without even any military service behind her. For a civilian, she may be considered strong, but that’s all she was as a Demon of Pride.\nI won’t say she doesn’t have any talent. Her garbage-like nature was exceedingly aligned with that of a Demon, and given the time, she would probably become strong.\nBut now is definitely not the time.\nMore so, to split the land barehanded without using a Skill, just who are you…?\nI don’t even think most Demon Lords would be able to manage that one.\nThat was the farthest front only a Pride Demon who had continued to hone his body could reach.\nI had heard of how Heard had dragged Hiero off from Lorna.\nPerhaps he felt something from a fellow Pride Demon, but it seems she was persevering in being beaten into shape.\nNo, she was persevering, but… yep. My condolences.\nThat’s impossible, ain’t it?\nIn the first place, the thickness of Heard’s and her arms are completely different. While it’s true a Demon’s strength and appearance are disproportional, there’s something out there called limits. Hiero was just as delicate a Lorna. Her power was likely not something she polished to use in battle.\n『N-no… impossible. That’s impossible for me…』\n『Do it.』\n『No, I mean, my power is…』\n『Do it.』\n『……』\nOn the other side of things, it doesn’t look like Heard has any intentions of listening to Hiero’s words. Well, that’s to be expected from a Pride Demon, but…\nHiero lowered her eyes from Heard’s, and with tears of defeat forming at their corners, she slowly lifted her hand.\nI couldn’t handle the scene any longer, and returned my vision to my own.\nOn top of the bed. The complete opposite of the wasteland Hiero had stood on, lying idly in my world of repose. I stretched my body.\nI recalled the scenes I just witnessed, did some calculations, and as no one was around me, I shook my head.\n“No, no… that’s impossible…”\nI really wonder what Heard is thinking… that was… too much. Even for me, it’s absolutely imposible.\nI remember of how, with a gentle smile on her face, Lorna had told me of how Heard had taken Hiero away for training. I wonder if she hates her sister… no, that’s definitely wrong. Despite this and that, when Leigie-sama isn’t concerned, she’s a woman of common sense.\nBut that being the case, that scene back there was… just harassment. She’ll fold over before anything actually gets trained.\nAnd wait, what about her household skills… I was kinda under the impression she was going to take up duty after Lorna…\nIt looks like the intent has completely shifted,…\nThis is kinda tiring…\nI sighed, but I still went on to use the Skill for my next target.\nMy field of vision shifted for a third time. This time, it was for the kind older sister.\nThe form of a maid walking down a familiar corridor came to my eyes.\nEven when no one was watching, she held a posture brimming with courtesy, and even when she was doing nothing but walking, that figure made for a pretty picture. She wore a clean white apron over a navy blue one piece. On top of focusing on practicality, the attire made her seem all the more lovable.\nHer form was prim and proper, and while I can’t say for certain, she didn’t look suited to one carrying the sin of Luxuria.\nBut I know. Right, under that naively oblivious expression, I know just how muddy of an appetite lies. Her well-calculated passions let her raise her status as a Demon without letting a single thing taint her body.\nHonestly, she was the one I was most afraid of.\nIn the past, I once chanced upon a meeting with the Demon Lord of Lust, Lilith Luxeliaheart, and by Envying a part of her, I could understand.\nThe Original sin of Luxuria didn’t possess any direct offensive Skills like Pride or Gluttony, but it definitely wasn’t weak. Its way of life was, in a sense, close to Sloth.\nBut if Acedia was like a plant, then Luxuria was a carnivorous plant. For them, the battlefield wasn’t some bloodstained wasteland, but a… stained bedroom. Their battles were not the swinging of fists, but to burst in full bloom.\nIn that, there was a melting fear that had built up in me without my notice. And Luxeliaheart, the Demon Lord one, was a powerful Lord who brought a number of other Demon Lords to their deaths.\nIt was, in a sense, the most dreaded power for a soldier.\nI returned my eyes, and under the covers, I let my body shake in a fear that came from the depths of my heart as I whispered.\n“… Lorna… what a frightening woman…”\n“… And what do you mean by that…?”\n“…!?”\nI pulled off the blanket covering me. There, was the maid I had been peeping at, and fantasizing of.\nThe fact that I got lost in thought, and stopped watching, had backfired on me.\nThe perplexed face that she made— under that mask, I felt as if I were being tasted by the extended tongue of a snake, and on that illusion, I raised a short scream.\n“How rude…”\n“Kku… h-ha… hah…”\nIt became hard to breath for a moment, but I somehow got myself in order. It would be no joke if I choked to death atop the mattress.\nAnd despite all that… Lorna still takes care of my meals, and cleaning. That’s why it was unavoidable for her to be here.\nA Demon of Sloth has no right to refuse. I mean, we aren’t even doing anything to earn it.\n“Now, Medea. It’s time for your meal…”\n“Y… yes…”\nHunger hasn’t struck me yet. It’s because it has been abated with my Skills. If I continued advancing down this tree, then perhaps food will become unnecessary in itself. For the reason of it being a pain, most likely.\nBut there’s no way I’m getting there any time soon, and even once I’ve reached that point, I’d still probably eat meals. It would be difficult crushing such a necessary habit.\nI press against my heart that was still exploding in my chest, and somehow raise my sluggish body before proceeding to the dining table that had been prepared.\nBefore coming here, I had never eaten a decent meal, so to me, Lorna’s cooking was the taste of home.\nEven without hunger, there’s no way I would ever think it wasn’t tasty.\nSilently, Lorna stood by my side.\nWithout saying anything, she watched me bring the food to my mouth. If she stares at me so intently, I won’t be able to make anything of the taste.\nI finished eating, and as if she were gauging for the moment I put down my silverware, Lorna finally opened her mouth.\n“… Hey, Medea.”\n“Yes?”\nFor a moment, I caught a glimpse of her hesitation. But that quickly vanished, and resolving herself, she threw a strong look in my direction.\n“Don’t you think it’s about time you start working…”\n“… Y-yes.”\nThose eyes were filled with such sorrow that my heart began to give off a throbbing pain.\nWhat’s with this mental assault… my Skills won’t defend me from it…\nHer voice was still untainted. There wasn’t an emotion of Wrath or Pride behind them.\nAnd that’s why it was able to pierce through my heart like a blade.\n“Medea, no matter how much you sleep, you’ll never become Leigie-sama… you should have your own way to live out your life.”\n“… Y-yes…”\nI… I feel like running away. Her earnesty was giving me this unbearable urge to flee. It was only amplified by the fact she was my life’s benefactor.\nAnd those words weren’t getting at the root of things. It’s not like I want to become Leigie-sama or anything… more so, I’m sure I don’t want to do that.\nWhat I want to be isn’t the man, but the man’s…\nAfter thinking that far, I started going over the sins I carried once more.\n… There’s no way. I wonder if a screw went lose somewhere in my desire of Envy.\nTo add to it all, I’ve even begun to carry Sloth due to that, and it feels like I’m being closed in on from all sides.\nIf you carry multiple Sins, then each individual Skill becomes harder to raise. This is just a rumor, but its rate becomes even less than half. Because of that, it’s hard for Demons of multiple Sins to get strong.\nAlso, how should I handle the pairing of Sloth and Envy…\nAnd wait, in the first place…\n“… This place doesn’t even need an army anymore…”\nRight. Leigie-sama’s camp no longer has a need for bloodshed. There’s no enemies, and no army. If you had to say, I was the sole member of the army.\nIf you tell me to work at a place like this, it’s honestly troubling.\nRight. It’s not that I don’t want to work. I don’t have a place to work.\n“It’s fine.”\nAnd to me, Lorna directed a smile like the Virgin Mary, and said something befitting a Demon.\n“I’ll try getting Heard’s Army to let you assist their work, so…”\n“I’m sleeping. Good night.”\n“Wai…”\nI ignored Lorna’s cries, and dug myself into the bed.\nPerhaps the one most messed up in the head is Lorna. She doesn’t think of a single thing but Leigie-sama.\nWhat floated up in my head was the form of the one I had peeped at a while ago, Hiero, who was forced to attempt so many impossible feats.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 3: Acedia’s Neglect, Part 3: But that’s Definitely Strange\nThe Pillow is way too competent, that I’ve no chances of victory.\nResults are something gained by victory in battle.\nEven if the battlefield changes, that fact remains constant. I glared at the pillow Leigie-sama was putting to use, as I considered my means.\nThe Lord of Sloth doesn’t give much thought to anything. That’s why whenever Leigie-sama looks at me, all that comes to him is, ‘Ah, so she’s still here, is she?’\nHe probably doesn’t care about anything. That is his form of nihility.\nHis strength of heart to protect himself was unrivalled. Leigie the Depraved’s soul was always subdued, and it would never be moved by emotion. That’s why he reached the position no one else had ever attained, the lone Lord of Acedia.\nSince I’ve been secretly trying to burn up his pillows while he’s asleep, I can say for sure. He doesn’t even care about those. If he’s thrown off of the bed, then he’ll just start sleeping on the floor.\nBut I don’t really care about that.\nWhat’s important to me, is that the current generation pillow is a pillow that can’t be burned. Meaning besides the merit that I had the capability of motion, that pillow triumphed over me in every way.\nHanded down by the Great Demon King, apparently.\nA pillow forged of the down of infant Fire Dragons.\nAs a pillow, he didn’t have a name. But he was an article so fine, it wouldn’t be strange if he was granted one by his craftsman.\nHe was probably a compensation for all those times Lize burned through his pillow. That’s why he won’t burn.\nAt present, Dragons were the only race living in the Demon World that possessed power rivalling Demons. Their characteristics were their high attribute resistances, and durability, and even from a General Class Demon’s powers, they weren’t so easily knocked down. However, they were small in numbers, and with that, the down of an infant dragon was more valuable than any average magical artifact.\nOnce the dragon grew up, its plumage would change to scales. In its feather state, it definitely didn’t boast the durability of scales, but still, it was much too great of an opponent for me to face.\nBy the way, this goes without saying, but among the Dragon Race, the greatest threat is their fangs and claws, as well as the attacks fired off from their tails. But now that it’s become a pillow it can’t attack or anything, so I’ve no need to worry over such matters.\n“Damn you, Great Demon King… for you to get in my way…”\nEven when I acted up in his bed alone, this lord showed absolutely no signs of giving a reaction. I’m not sure if he’s completely uninterested, or he’s truly sleeping.\nEven when I lightly shake his body, touch his hands, or cling to him, he wouldn’t move in the slightest, and I believed him to be truly worthy of such a pillow.\nHow rude. Even when I’ve thrown away my pride to present myself as a pillow to him, Leigie-sama probably hasn’t even noticed something like that..\nIt was a major problem that shook up my dignity. And at the same time, it was quite futile.\nWhile I was likely carrying out the most gruesome battle in this cruel world, I heard footsteps approaching the room.\nThere were two sets. The ones who come here are severely limited. It seems that assassins used to come here as well, but since Heard took over the surrounding area, that hasn’t happened as of late.\nIn that case, I knew who would drop by.\nLorna or Lize Bloodcross.\nI don’t know much about the woman known as Lize.\nWhat I know is that she’s part of Kanon-sama’s personal knight brigade, and that she was sent with the intentions of observing the Demon Lord as a member of the Order of Black.\nI also knew she was relatively strong, but when you put it against Heard and Leigie, the stage was so different, that I couldn’t really feel that much strength from her. What’s more, the only chances she’s had to demonstrate such strength was when she burned up this man’s pillows. In a different sense than me, she was a pitiful woman.\nAs expected, the two sets of feet stopped in front of the door. I felt they would become a pain, so I dove my body deep under the covers, and clung onto Leigie-sama’s body.\nI’m a pillow. A pillow that can move of her own will.\nWith a small sound, the door opened. In order to let the matter pass, I held my breath.\n“Huh? Medea isn’t here?”\nAs I thought, it wasn’t a matter for Leigie-sama, but one for me.\nRight, I’m not here. So please go away already.\nThere are Skills to conceal your body on the Sloth Tree as well. Right now, I’ve become one and the same with Leigie-sama, and they shouldn’t be able to sense my presence.\nLorna and Lize seemed to be having a quiet conversation about something. I can’t really hear them. I want to use a Skill to listen in, but if I did that, then in all likelihood, Lize would sense it. Sloth Skills were made on the premise that their user wouldn’t be doing anything.\nIf I move just a little further down the tree, then I should obtain one that lets me go about life without doing anything at all.\nBut unfortunately, my opponents are professionals at dealing with Sloth.\nThey are the brave heroes who have continued to serve one of the rare Sloth Demon Lords for many years on end. I doubt there’s anyone in this vast Demon World more adept at dealing with Sloth than these women.\nThe cover was town away, and I was bathed in light and cold air as I continued to cling to Leigie-sama.\n“… There should be a limit to running away from reality…”\nLize sounded utterly fed up.\nFine. I’m fine with running away from reality, so please just leave me be.\nA hand was placed on the arms I was using to tighten my embrace.\n“Now, Medea. Separate. Yourself. From. Leigie-sama!”\nIt was a fearsome display of superhuman strength. For an estimated Knight Class like Lorna, it should have been unthinkable for her to be able to pull a General like me’s arms away.\nBut by some divine providence, my arms were just barely being moved away.\n“Look, Lize. You lend a hand as well!”\n“… Hah… why do I have to…”\nDespite her complaints, Lize’s hands were put around my torso.\nHer power was probably over mine. If it came down to pure power, I’d never win.\nThis is no joke. If I get dragged off now, I’ll get wrapped up in something troubling. There was no helping it, so I used a Sloth Skill.\n“Unwork.”\nMy body instantly became heavier, and the bed gave off a creaking sound.\nMy rising arms, as if gravity had suddenly increased, came down on Leigie-sama once more.\nThe Unwork Skill increased one’s own weight, and among Sloth Skills, it was a rare Active. That weight increase wasn’t something on the measly level of two or three times over.\nBut still, with the bed receiving enough force for it to begin to creak, Leigie-sama showed absolutely no signs of waking up.\nLize’s frowned.\n“Medea… for you to even use a Skill… how cruel…”\nShut it.\nEven I can tell what’s cruel or not. I’m well aware of it. You don’t have to put it into words.\nAnd at that moment, as I hid my face, Lorna’s voice entered my ears.\n“Medea… if you don’t separate yourself, then I’ll also use a Skill, you know?”\n“… !?”\nChills ran up my spine, and alarm bells went off in my head.\nLorna’s voice had been the same as normal. That’s why it was bad. Could it be I tread on the tiger’s tail?\nNo, wait.\nThink about it calmly. Rank-wise, I’m above her. With the resistances I gained as Sloth, there’s no way Lorna, who hasn’t even had any combat training, would be able to separate me.\nMy heartbeat was heavy enough that my chest hurt. As if to contain it, I increased my grip on Leigie-sama.\nLorna’s hand touched the nape of my neck. That’s all she did, but a sensation as if a sword had been pressed to my carotid artery came down on me.\nNo, this is an illusion. As a Demon of Envy, I can say for sure. Luxuria barely has any physical prowess. She won’t be able to do anything to me.\nThen just what is this fear encroaching on me bit by bit?\n“Medea… make sure you say uncle when you give up, okay?”\n“…”\n“But perhaps you won’t even be able to speak at that point…”\n“… W-what are you…”\nThe moment I opened my mouth, it happened.\nThere wasn’t a single wound on me. There wasn’t any pain. But my instincts raised a scream.\nMy Mental Corruption Resistance Skill continued activating itself without end.\nIt was a painfully popular passive Skill among Demons. Even held by children, that Skill could identify any and every Skill meant to corrupt the mind, and render them null and void.\nIt was the Skill that made Luxuria the weakest, and once you reach General Class, it could invalidate almost one hundred percent of all things.\nThat’s why no matter how many Skills Lorna uses, I can’t think it will bring any effect onto me.\nThe reason for my shocks was the contents.\nThe Luxuria Skill Tree was simple. Mental Corruption included, it allowed one to grant any and every status abnormality, and specialized in glamor.\nOn something quite repulsing, I unintentionally moved my head, and confirmed Lorna’s expression.\nBecause I intentionally made a movement, the Unwork Skill was undone, and my weight vanished.\nWith a calm expression, Lorna directed her deep blue eyes at me.\n“Wai… w-what are you trying to do to me!?”\n“…”\nI could tell she had done something by instinct.\nAgain and again, without any signs of giving up, with numbers enough for me to feel fear, the status abnormality she continuously tried to cast was the one that Lust was most suited in handling.\nIts name was 『Heat』.\nThis is no joke.\nEven if I know it won’t affect me, I can’t take this as a joke.\n“Take off your hand!”\n“So you give in?”\nBut I don’t want that. I don’t want to feel like a loser.\nIn the first place, this is pointless. It won’t even work on a standard Demon, so there’s no way it would take effect on a Sloth like me. Her Mana will be the force running out first.\nAt that moment, I felt a bad premonition cross my mind.\nHow many times can she use it? How many tens? Hundreds? Thousands?\n『Heat』 was the most basic ability of Lust. Even Demons who had just awoken to the Sin could use it. That means it barely had even the slightest Mana expenditure.\nFor a Knight Class like Lorna, then it wouldn’t be strange for that to number in the thousands, or tens of thousands.\nAs if she had seen through my thoughts, she let out a gentle laugh. Her laugh was quite reminiscent of Hiero’s, and their figures overlapped for a moment in my mind.\nI was sure of it now. That a little sister like that gave way to a girl like this. No, that’s the other way around.\n“… Medea. Just how much resistance will you put up? A thousand? Ten thousand? Kusu… my 『Rat Sleep』 may take a bit of time, but… it will take effect on you eventually.”\nIn the end, Status Abnormality Resistance was but a resistance… nullification based on identification. It wasn’t complete nullification.\nThe probability of it getting through wasn’t zero. It was ridiculously low, but, there are times when it would actually work. And at that time, I have no means of freeing myself from it.\nOf course, the probability of it working wasn’t something high enough for me to train for it on the battlefield. That’s why I didn’t pay it any mind before.\nBut if you look at it the other way…\nLorna gave out a declaration like that of a death sentence.\n“I’ll keep at it as long as it takes. If it’s something on the level of 『Rat Sleep』… My mana recovery is higher than its usage.”\n“!?”\nMeaning she can keep this up forever.\nNo matter how low the chances, if she was going to keep at it uptil it worked, then that was no different from one hundred.\nLize looked at Lorna with a cramped expression. It was probably the same as the look on my face at the moment.\n“A-are you joking…?”\n“…”\nEven when she heard my chiding words, her smile didn’t chip in the slightest.\nIt was frighteningly ominous, and the information flooding into my head of how each and every attempt to resist the Skill had succeeded was uncanny enough to jolt my heart.\nThis girl… is serious.\n“Just getting me in heat isn’t going to…”\n… Isn’t going to be of any merit to her… I think.\nAs I was about to say, that, Lorna held her fingertip to my lips to stop me.\nWhat was before me was a single Luxuria Demon. Her pupils stained with lewdness seemed to lick all over my body as they evaluated me. That was the first sexual glance I had ever received since I started hiding in Leigie-sama’s bed naked.\n“… Kusu kusu… an unworking Medea… should just show off her unsightly form to Leigie-sama.”\n“N-no, isn’t your intent changing…”\nThinking it bad, Lize offered some council to Lorna.\nBut in regards to that, Lorna threw out a carefree response.\n“Lize, this girl’s Sloth is… just inactivity. It’s different to what Leigie-sama has.”\n“Eh…?”\nWhat’s different about it? That’s what Lize’s eyes were saying.\nI was in complete agreement.\nJust what’s different? Why not try giving an answer.\nNo, I’m still moving around a bit, so aren’t I more decent than…\nAt that point, from my ankle to my spine, a small impact raced.\nIt was simply too light, but the vividness of the sensation was enough to make my body leap without intent.\n“Kusu kusu… look, it got you.”\n“…”\nThe temperature of my body rose a little. A ticklish fever created a thin haze over my brain.\nMy thoughts begin to come apart. My body is hot. My heartbeat was resounding to annoying levels.\nIt got me. In itself, it wasn’t a fatal status abnormality. In the end, it’s just a basic Skill.\nEven without a recovery Skill, something of this level should go away given enough time.\nSloth Skills cut off my senses. Because of that, the vision through my fevered eyes made it feel like I was watching the isolated events of another world play out.\nI let out a hot breath, and directed up some words that were half me putting up a strong front.\n“… Hah… something of this level is…”\n“… You don’t know when to give up… Kusu kusu, you know what this is, right? Luxeliaheart. At this point… it’s your loss.”\nA small light burned at the tip of Lorna’s right index finger. It was a characteristically pink light. I could instantly determine it was something from a Skill. Even what Skill it was.\nLuxuria Skills were short range, and most of them wouldn’t activate without direct contact. In the first place, even if they did go off, they would be put down by status resistances.\nBut these unsurmountable demerits came with unsurmountable merit.\nLuxuria was a Skill Tree to affect the mind. You have to fulfill the conditions first, but once that’s done, it can exhibit unrivalled power.\nWith me clinging onto Leigie-sama like this, I’ve no means to avoid it.\n『Rat Sleep』 had not activated itself yet. After my resistances had been ringing off alarms for so long, they had fallen silent. Lust had its stages. First, to light the flame, then to spread the fire.\nAnd this presents the main problem, my status abnormality resistance wasn’t going off anymore. Meaning I would be out in a single hit.\nAs if to enchant me, Lorna slowly brought her finger to my body.\nHer slender fingers lightly brushed against the back of my neck. With just that, my mind, which was supposed to have been cut off from sexual passions, was thrown into disarray.\n“I’ll make you bloom.”\nI’m being driven mad.\nThat voice was filled with an ample amount of darkness. It wasn’t by much, but it was something I wasn’t able to stand.\nAt this rate, I’m going to have a mental trauma for the rest of my life. Or perhaps I’ll awaken to yet another sin.\n“U-uncle! I give, I give up!”\nLorna looked at my face, before nodding once. That was enough to make my beat to jump up.\nI don’t even know what’s going on anymore. I might cry.\n“… Where’s your apology?”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“… Leigie-sama’s mattress has been stained… I’ll have to wash it again…”\nShe took a fleeting glance at the place I had been before looking down at me again.\nThe scary part was that I couldn’t see an emotion of anger in her. She was likely the type that could kill with a smile. If she had entered the army, then perhaps she would have become a soldier much more prodigious than I.\n“Medea. Put on clothing at once, and take a seat. I have something to discuss with you.”\nHer tone that didn’t ask for a yes or no, made me straighten up my back as I sat up on the bed.\nHer eyes were shining. If I didn’t bring out as much speed as physically possible, Lorna was going to break me. That was the most repulsing, and unbecoming manner of a soldier.\n“Y-yes.”\nI lifted my still-itching body, and put on the clothes Lorna had prepared.\nI pulled the undergarments over my flesh, and draped the battle clothing I had often worn before over them.\nThey were made of a mass of dark materials, and they didn’t boast enough defensive power to block a direct blow, but they had a special magic carved into them to mitigate attribute damage to a certain extent.\nNaturally, they were stiff, and they didn’t feel too good to wear. That’s the reason why, once I had a slight change in occupation to be a pillow, I’ve never once put my arms through those sleeves.\nThis is… a bothersome scent tickled my nose.\nI did take a quick look at the bed, but losing to Lorna’s smile, I reluctantly stood.\nHonestly, I’m terrified. In the first place, I couldn’t even raise my head to look at her. She was an existence like a mother. I always feel like apologizing about this and that to her.\nAs I sat in a chair with good manner, Lize and Lorna stood before me.\nTheir eyes were serious. Of course they were. Never once has Lize ever had any business with me since I’ve become a pillow. I’ll say this time and again, but no matter how noisy it gets out there, the Castle of Shadows will always be at peace.\nCould it be… I’m sacked? Just by spending a few months as a pillow? No, no, I mean, that’s my job to begin with… and firing isn’t something decided but Lorna or Lize. That’s Leigie-sama’s job…\nThere were bags forming under Lize’s eyes. I’ve heard she’s been busy lately. Even a moment’s thought could make me feel how heavy a responsibility it would be to work as Heard Lauder’s observing officer. My deepest condolences.\nLize hesitated, but soon started talking in the cold tone of a superior giving order to their subordinate.\n“Medea Luxeliaheart, there is a single job for you.”\n… Don’t want to.\nI wanted to answer that, but the glint in Lorna’s eyes kept me silent.\nThe answer I gave a few seconds later wasn’t something by my own will.\n“… What?”\nBattle? That’s the one with the highest probability. I’m a former General. If you look at it from another perspective, that’s pretty much the only thing I’m capable of.\nIf it was battle against, I guess I’d manage one way or another. Even if it be against another General, it would probably work out. As long as they weren’t a monster like that Heard Lauder.\nI mean, I have that thing I got from envying Leigie-sama, 『Miracle Wonder Lighthand』.\nI can’t use the left hand portion of it, but for an average demon, the right hand was more than enough. Just as Zebul didn’t know of it, that Skill was an unknown entity that barely anyone had ever seen before.\nIt’s a pain, but if it will let me evade those eyes of Lorna, then it’s unavoidable.\nI don’t want it… being thrown into heat outside of my will is the worst. This is why Luxuria’s so wicked.\nIt’s also the reason that, when I envied that Lilith Luxeliaheart, I copied not her status abnormality Skills, but just her Skills to create illusions.\nTaking away one’s free will is really the work of a Demon. No, that’s what I am, but…\nBut the words that came out when Lize opened her mouth next were a bolt out of the blue.\nAnd at the same time, they were the worst.\n“In Leigie-sama’s stead, you are to answer Kanon-sama’s summons.”\n“Eh? Why?”\nI unintentionally blinked my eyes, and looked at the face of the Great Demon King’s apostle.\nThe fact that she looked apologetic for a second didn’t escape me.\nOn the other side, without a hint of apologetics on her face, Lorna gave me my answer.\n“That’s obvious. It’s because Leigie-sama is busy…”\n“Eh? What part of him is?”\nI looked over at the bed.\nAs usual, Leigie-sama was sleeping, as if he were dead. Even when his surroundings are this loud, I have nothing to say about his ability to concentrate.\nI wonder how Leigie-sama has lived a life this long… Recently, I’ve begin thinking about that reason once more, and I’ve no answer to it.\nIn the past, I thought that, since I wasn’t a Sloth Demon, I wouldn’t be able to fathom the answer anyways, but even after gaining Sloth, I couldn’t understand it.\nSeeing me like that, Lorna gave a brazen declaration.\n“Do you have knotholes for eyes? Can you not see that Leigie-sama is busy taking his rest in peace?”\n“No, that is…”\nYes, I can tell that.\nI understand that, but that is completely irrelevant to being busy, is it not?\nI’m not that free either, you know? Like thinking about how to better become a pillow, or peeping in on other Demons, I’ve got quite a bit on my plate.\nOf course, I won’t say that. It’s scary.\nLorna is a little off in the head department, so I helplessly looked to Lize. She was considerably the more decent of the two. And that’s exactly why she’s going through such troubles.\n“… It’s a customary practice for Demon Lords, or representative General Class Demons to stop by Kanon-sama when she calls a meeting. At this point, you’re the lone member of Leigie-sama’s army, so…”\n“That is…”\nExactly right. Leigie’s army of thousands has been reduced to a single pillow. But I don’t want to go.\nThis is where Leigie-sama should go. That is his duty as a Demon Lord.\nNo, really, its not just that I don’t want to go, if you think about it logically, isn’t that how it’s supposed to go?\nAs I tried to speak, Lorna interposed herself, and made an imposing argument at Lize with just her eyes.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, Lize averted her eyes, and spoke.\n“Not moving Leigie-sama is part of the Great Demon King’s will.”\n“Eh? Isn’t that strange?”\nWhat is the meaning of this? Leaving that man asleep is part of the Great Demon King’s will?\nShe permits him to shirk off his regular obligations?\nIf the Great Demon King was to convene a meeting, it could only be one thing.\n『Demons Round』\nA round table opened only when the Demon World was to face a time of crisis. It’s getting noisy in the world outside, so it probably has something to do with that.\nDemon Lords are generally self-serving, but there are few fools out there who would defy the Great Demon King. Those faces dispersed across the lands should all be gathered there.\nAnd with it being a gathering of Demons who’ve raised their sins to their limits, it was an inevitable instance of putting the cart before the horse, where casualties were often reported.\nSo let me declare it. If a General Class went out, they’d be crushed in an instant.\n“… That is the Great Demon Lord’s will. Medea, do you plan on opposing that?”\n“… Eh? No… but still, that’s definitely strange…”\n“By the way, up to now, Heard Lauder has always been the one going in his stead.”\n…\nJust how soft is everyone being on our Leigie-sama?\nBut I don’t want to go. I really don’t want to go.\nLeigie-sama’s already the lowest ranking Demon Lord. You can’t just permit him to skip out. I get that if he was Rank Three, it may be permitted, but for the lowest ranked of them all to not even show up, I doubt there won’t be complaints. Right, there definitely will be. There’s no doubt there will be some political turmoil if the individual in question doesn’t step out himself.\nRight. That’s right.\nWithin my head, my Mini-Medea was crying out such things.\nBut reality wasn’t so kind. Lize strained her voice to a lethal level.\n“Kanon-sama even ordered for you, Medea, to be dispatched in his place.”\n“… Eh? I was called by name?”\nWith unbelievable emotions, I looked up at Lize’s face.\nI don’t get what she means. Why must I…\n“Yes, you were called by name. If Leigie-sama’s asleep when you get there, then be a dear and go drag Medea out here, won’t you?”\n“…”\nI heard the sound of Lize’s arm being clad in flames. Her power was undoubtedly over mine.\nKanon’s figure came up in my mind.\nBack when I had just gotten here, the figure of the observer charged with Leigie-sama.\nThat woman… she’s favoring the man.\nA hopeless reality was coloring the world beyond my eyes in black.\nShe occasionally called him ‘niisama,’ and she was always soft on him, so I knew it would definitely bring about something one of these days, but with this terrible timing…\nI was sure she was impartial…\nAnd on the other side, the maid who did with me what she pleased landed in the finishing blow.\n“Medea, if you meet up with Heard, make sure you ask him to let you join in his army, okay?”\n“… Heard Lauder…”\nI recalled the form of the man who detested Envy Demons like the plague.\nThis is bad. I’m so dead.\nI hath been forsaken by all. And it all happened while I was asleep.\nDid I even do anything bad? This is just too much.\n“… Nn…”\nIn this situation where there was nothing for me to do, I fell flat over the table before me, and started crying to myself.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 3: Acedia’s Neglect, Part 4: Now That’s Just Terrible\nThe 『Palace of Rending Flames』.\nThe castle the Great Demon Lord, Kanon Iralaude set as her stronghold was also the most important site in the entire Demon World.\nIts scale didn’t reach up to Leigie’s Castle of Shadows, but its construction boasted of countless spires that reached up through the skies, and it carried about it an sinister air, as if the entirety of its designs had been but an insult to the heavens.\nJust as the flames of purgatory, Kanon of Ruin’s rage could be felt by all who set foot into her land, and the power that could be felt at its center made one think that a single touch from her would burn even their soul to a crisp. All would hang their heads in awe before the Great Demon King.\nBut she was a Brocon.\nIt wasn’t in her character, but she was a brocon. Mentioning that was the single taboo that existed within this vast Demon World.\nIf I were to leak that information, then my own soul would be doomed to burn away to cinders. I’m always cautious as to not let the fact out in my sleep talk.\nIf a single word were to escape my lips, then the entire area around where I stood would be reduced to nothing but scorched earth. Without understanding anything of what was going on, the countless Demons within a large radius of me would have their lives drawn to a close.\nDespite this and that, Kanon Iralaude was a Demon Lord who governed Wrath. Her anger wasn’t something anyone could control, herself included. And its output was needlessly high, even enough to burn through Leigie-sama’s resistance.\nIra Skills generally have ridiculous output, but there were many cases where it couldn’t be controlled. That was the burden that those who continued to pursue Ira to its depths had to bear.\nShe herself did seem to be mindful of it, but whenever she was by Leigie-sama’s side, she would frequently let out those incessant ‘niisama’s, to a point where one would even begin to wonder if she had any intention of concealing it, so even if I covered my ears, it would reach me.\nIf you’re the Great Demon King, then go get some dignity already. The hell’s with niisama? It’s not like he’s your real brother or anything.\nI was posed holding on to the neck of a flying dragon, as a launched complaints at Kanon-sama in my head. I sulked as I looked over the outside world.\nWhile it may be the Palace of Rending Flames, the land here wasn’t as hot as the Prison of Flames, or the Crimson Prison. The Great Demon King’s Wrath was, when compared to the Demon Lords of history, under frighteningly delicate control. That’s why, when aboard a flying dragon, a nicely cool wind lapped against my face, and gave me quite a comfortable feeling. If my goal wasn’t to attend the meeting at the entrance to the River Stix, then I might have actually enjoyed it.\nBy the way, Lize’s the one piloting the dragon, so I’m free. I’d like some praise for working so hard.\nIt’s been around a year since I last rode a dragon this far.\nPerhaps some apologetic sentiment had arisen in her, as Lize directed some mindful words at me. And that was quite a pain.\n“Medea… you really are becoming identical to Leigie…”\nIs that supposed to be praise, or is she making fun of me? I hesitated for a moment.\nNormally, being equated to a Demon Lord is supposed to be praise. But this time, it’s that Leigie-sama we’re talking about.\n…\n“… Thank you.”\nStill, in the end, I’m but an imitation.\nEverything started to not matter anymore, and I gained sloth for half a decent reason. The girl who gained such a sin is third rate, by no doubt. It isn’t by much, but I’m in no way a Demon to be compared to Leigie-sama.\nIf possible, I’d have liked to gain it after becoming a Demon Lord. But if I had just continued to pursue Envy like that, then in the end, I wouldn’t have become a Demon Lord anyways.\nNo matter the case, it was too abnormal. Envying a pillow… it was even more decent back when I was envying Lorna. Even when the result of that didn’t elicit the slightest reaction from Leigie-sama.\nIn that sense, my future is already pitch black. Pairing up the emotions of Envy with Sloth doesn’t make anything of use. There’s no helping it.\nIn that case, I should just live on as a pillow. Yep, let’s do that. I’ll become the ultimate pillow.\nThen one day, they’ll call out to me. The Pillow Lord.\n“… Kuh…”\n“Medea!? W-why are you crying!?”\nI’m not… crying.\nThis is just sweat. Tears are something born of blood. Like what I shed long ago.\nWhile I was carrying out that pointless conversation, the Flying Dragon descended onto one of the spires of the palace. It was the dragon post.\nApart from ours, there was over ten other dragons restlessly pacing back and forth.\nThe Demons dismounting from then were men and women of all ages. Monsters, animals, tentacles, each and every sort of form, but there was a single point that kept them all aligned.\nThe fact that each and every one of them possessed powers beyond General Level.\nNo, there’s a single Knight Class. I quietly hid in the shadow of the dragon.\nLightly patting the mouth area of the dragon to offer her gratitude, Lize tilted her head as she looked at me.\n“Did something happen?”\n“… Why is Hiero…”\nI stuck out only my face to confirm it. She was definitely reflected on my eyes.\nMixed in with the Demon World’s elite, a single Demon of small power.\nBeautiful golden hair and blue eyes like a doll’s. The hair that grew up to her shoulders was done up in twin tails. After being tossed around so recklessly by Heard, she showed not a trace of fatigue, and at that, I could only let out a sigh of admiration.\nAs expected of Superbia… Even when surrounded by a flock of Demons much greater than her, her movements didn’t show the slightest of lapse. It may have just been the girl’s personality, but the hospitality of her face was something I could only feel jealousy towards.\nLuckily for me, it didn’t seem that Heard Lauder was here.\n“… Why are you hiding…?”\nLize’s tired words stung my ears.\nIf that’s Hiero’s nature, then this is mine. I have much too much trauma. And in a place like this, it will only hinder my function.\n“No, I mean, you…”\n“I know.”\nI knew what Lize wanted to say. I knew it enough, that it hurt. When there was a Demon of lower power than me carrying herself so boldly, I can’t keep myself hiding in a corner like this.\nRegardless of how it came to pass, I am currently Leigie-sama’s representative. My behavior will drop Leigie-sama’s status.\nEven if Leigie-sama himself cared for it less than the nail on his pinky, it was something my own pride wouldn’t allow.\n… Because despite what I say, it’s not like I hate Leigie-sama.\nI resolved myself, and held out my chest, as I wandered over to Hiero.\n“Hiero… it’s been a while.”\n“… Medea… san?”\nHer face distorted for a moment, before returning to a smile. That part of her really resembled Lorna.\nAfter looking over my body once, with a fed up bearing, her tone turned sour.\n“… I’m surprised you can just show yourself before my eyes like that. Because I ended up saving you, I was sure I was going to be killed, you know?”\n“… That was you reaping what you sowed.”\nShe did go against Heard’s will, and save my life, and that might have put her own life in jeopardy.\nBut that was something brought about by her own discretion. I may not be in a position to say this, having been saved and all, but that definitely wasn’t my fault. Anyone would have run away there.\nSeeing my expression, Hiero sighed with a mature expression unbefitting her years.\n“Well, I did end up surviving, so I guess it doesn’t really matter… so what business have you?”\n“… Business?”\nNo, I don’t really have anything like that.\nSeeing one of my few acquaintances, I just wanted to call out. Unlike Deije, or Heard, I haven’t been around all too much.\nTaking my attitude in some strange direction, Hiero raised a bright voice.\n“Ah, could it be that you wanted to offer some thanks for being saved? Kusu kusu kusu, despite your scarce body, you’ve got quite a nice sense of duty there.”\n“…”\nShe really phrases everything in a way that touches a nerve, this Demon.\nWell, I didn’t have such intentions, but come to think of it, Hiero was kidnapped by Heard before I knew it, so I didn’t have such an opportunity.\nSince it was by her own whim, I don’t have the obligation to thank her, but the truth of the matter is that I was spared.\nI furrowed my brow, and tried asking, for arguments sake.\n“… What do you want of me?”\n“Ah! So that was true? Um… I saved your life, so I can ask for whatever I want, right?”\nShe crossed her fingers, and looked up at me in a flirtatious manner.\nIt was mortifying, but that doesn’t change how lovable that gesture was. Even with this personality, she was Lorna’s sister, and unlike her, she sure knew how to show that off.\nI kept myself wary, as I answered.\n“Ask away.”\n“… Then please trade places with m–”\n“Rejected.”\n“Eh~!? W-what was that!?”\nOutrageous. She was more decent when she was still at Leigie-sama’s side knowing she wouldn’t get anything of it.\nI ignored her screams, and reunited with Lize, who was looking over at us with fed up eyes. That was a waste of time. Let’s go over to the conference room already.\nStill… I see. Trade places, is it?\nEven if she didn’t show it on her face, the training from Heard did seem to be having an effect on her.\n… Her personality hadn’t changed, but I wonder just what it was Heard was attempting to drill into her. Power as a Demon?\nI gave Hiero, who tried to pursue with teary eyes, a cold reception, as I continued forward.\nThe Demon Lords of other lands rarely chanced by the Castle of Shadows, so they probably didn’t know, but the inside of the Palace of Rending Flames largely resembled Leigie-sama’s place.\nThe floor, and walls, and ceilings were all done in ink black stone, and the strange patterns carved along the passageways bore similar likeness. What differed was that, as the castle’s Lord over here governed wrath, the air here was full of a quietly burning aura.\nThis is the second time I’ve come here, but it was something I thought the time before as well.\nI don’t know if Kanon’s put a stop to that brocon tendency of hers. If she likes her niisama so much, then she should just call him over. It’s because she’s like that, that someone like me ends up being forced to come here.\nWhile holding in such complains, I didn’t forget to be vigilant.\nI’d like to think I won’t face an assault before the meeting, but Demons were a race where you couldn’t know what could happen next. The law of the jungle. Self-serving. It was a world where you could call something wrong merely because it was weak.\nLize was acting as a guide, but regardless of who she may be, I doubt she was a match for Demon Lord Class.\nThose guys are monsters. Much greater than the gap between General and Knight was the disparity between General and Demon Lord. It was likely greater than anything we could imagine.\nThat was something I could understand from when a legendary Demon Blade couldn’t even raise the slightest resistance against Zebul.\nPerhaps it was rare for someone like me to be present, as I felt magic probe through my body. Out of curiosity, some eyes followed me as I went by.\nAfter walking a while, the site of this time’s meeting came into sight. Even without being told, it was a clear swirl of Mana. Gathered over time, that dark Mana told me, even without thinking too hard about it, that this was the point of death.\nGreed, Lust, Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony.\nSloth aside, Demon Lords governing those six attributes clamored around, and that place was probably the most dangerous site in the entirety of the Demon World.\nAnd me, filling in for Leigie Slaughterdolls, of the Slaughterdolls. By adding on my power, that wasn’t even enough to patch up the holes, a total of seven sins had been gathered there.\n(TL: Yes, both Leigie’s title, and last name, are ‘Slaughterdolls’)\nThere was nothing good to come of it. Because of our longings, we were a race that conflicted with one another.\nThe fighting I couldn’t think of as coming from an allied force raged up as if to prove just how war-driven the Demon Lords were, and it brought pain to my stomach. Even before entering the room, it felt as if the forces on the other side were considering how exactly to squash a bug. It was detestable, in many ways.\nBeside me, Hiero had tagged along for fun, as if she were a cat. She didn’t think a single thing upon having reached this point.\n“Ah, have we arrived? Then~ I’ll be going ahead!”\nWith a sunflower-esque smile, she put her hand on the door without hesitation, and pushed it open.\nJust where does she hide such confidence in that small stature?\n“Heard Lauder-sama? I’ve finished taking care of the Flying Dragon!”\nRank One. The greatest bearer of Pride among the Demon Lords, was the first thing she spoke upon treading into the haunt of evil.\nThe moment I saw that, I could understand it.\nAh, she’s a fox borrowing the dignity of a tiger. What should I do? It feels quite pleasant thinking of it like that.\nThe moment her mildly-short skirt fluttered as she stepped through those doors, I could see it. That the delicate legs concealed beneath it were quivering a little.\nPerhaps Lize saw it as well, as she whispered in an expression mixed with wonderment and respect.\n“… She’s quite something.”\n“Right. I can’t lose to her either.”\n“No, you’re…”\nTo interrupt the words Lize wanted to voice, I stepped through the doorway.\nI felt the gazes converge on me. The gazes blacker than the depths of the Demon World’s darkness. The grounds of Demon Lord and Demon Lord. There wasn’t any killing intent, but what was there was malice, and eyes filled with strong desire, which were probably merely a breath of fresh air to those of Demon Lord Class.\n… Passions great enough to violate the souls around them.\nThe Demon Lords here understand it.\nThat those that reach this place were Demons of the same level as themselves, and threats to their own existences. That fact served to hone their minds, making the place somewhere much more calamitous than the greatest of battlefields.\nAn elder stanced like a withered tree. A young boy a head shorter than me.\nA balloon-like bloated body with pitiful limbs making up the body of a man.\nA black haired girl perhaps even younger than Hiero, and a large baldheaded man with armor-like muscles enveloping him.\nA metallic inorganic humanoid mass of indistinguishable gender, and a half-transparent woman whose body floated through the air. And so on, and so forth.\nAs one who worked at the Castle of Shadows, and served as Leigie-sama’s guard, they were faces I knew. There was but a handful of names to remember.\nBut I can only express my admiration at the sheer variety these peculiar Lords have managed to achieve for themselves.\nWhen they’re this overflowing with personality, then a simple slim male Demon like Leigie-sama starts to lack a sense of individuality. No, perhaps it’s the opposite… I mean, Leigie-sama would probably be fast asleep, even at a place like this…\n“…”\nAmong them, the greatest of stares made my heart contract. I turned my eyes to the figure sitting closest to Kanon-sama.\nHeard Lauder. He was probably the newest Demon Lord here, the most Decent of the lot, and the strongest Demon Lord of Pride.\nSeeing his form here, his gaze told me that his impression of me was still the absolute worst.\nThe reason he didn’t issue a complaint was because this was a meeting space, or perhaps because I was the representative of Leigie-sama. I think it was probably the latter.\nAnd that woman of tall stature sitting at the head of the table was the perpetrator of it all.\nThe one who ruled over a large portion of this extensive Demon World, leader of the strongest force, the 『Great Demon King’s Army』.\nThe master of that, as well, as well as the incarnations of Wrath, said to bring ruin to all creation with her flames of purgatory.\nThe Lord of Ruin.\nKanon Iralaude.\nUnthinkable of the violent emotions that formed the base of her Sin, the lights of wisdom and intellect dwelled in her eyes.\nBut she was a brocon.\n“Ah, Medea Luxeliaheart. Leigie-niisa… Leigie of Sloth’s representative. Take a seat.”\n“… Yes.”\nI’m not even going to retort anymore. It’s not like any of this is relevant to me. Just do whatever you want.\nTo shake off the awkward air, I took my place at the foot of the table.\nEven if it may be round table, the seating was based on rank. Leigie of Sloth was the Lowest possible rank, so his seat was the furthest one from Heard Lauder. That was my sole spot of luck. Let’s get this over with already so I can run away.\nMy not-too-short life experience was calling out to me. I’m… screwed.\nIn the place I could only think of as a bed of spikes, I lowered myself into a luxurious black chair, and without uttering a word, I looked over the others present.\nMore than half the seats were filled, but including the empty seats, there was a smaller amount of places at the table than I had expected.\nThat means that’s just how many Demon Lords had fallen. While I myself don’t want to take them on alone, regardless of what Lord they be, Demons die when they are killed.\nCompared to my suspicious behavior, Lize was carrying herself as grandly as always. She straightened up her spine, and displayed not a hint of unrest.\nIn a small voice, I offered a complaint.\n“Lize.”\n“… What?”\n“… From what I can see, I’m the only representative here…”\nEveryone’s a Demon Lord.\nEach and every one of the figures surrounding the round table were of the class that ruled over this world. The ones by their sides are likely their inspectors. Even if they may be of the Great Demon King’s personal order, comparing their powers to the Lords put them in quite an unfavorable standing. And there was one lower than all of them… Me.\nThe one with the lowest power over all was Hiero, but that wasn’t even any consolation. Together, we’d still be taken out in a single punch. One punch.\n“… Of course. The Demon Lords will generally take up attendance, you know. They have to show off their might and all…”\n“…”\nI’ve been fooled.\nNo, I’d known I’d been fooled for quite some time. I’m not in heat anymore, yet, the beating of my heart has become overly violent.\nI grimaced, and forced myself to play calm.\nAnd finally, at that time, I noticed it.\nThere was something at the center of the table.\nA shadow like a black sphere. Its size was around that of a soccer ball, and even when there wasn’t any wind, it was rolling around. Towards me.\nMy application of 『Sky Right Hand』 and the mass growing limbs happened at around the same time.\nI instinctively swung my arm at it. The mass greatly contracted its legs, and like a spring, it came flying at me with lightning speed.\nIts wide-open mouth, with blade-like fangs lined up closed in to a few centimeters in front of my face, before I succeeded in deflecting it.\nI somehow stifled the scream that surfaced. No, I didn’t even have time to scream.\nWhat was that!?\nBefore I could seek held from Lize, she raised a scream in my place.\n“Who was it!? Who summoned a『Preta』!?”\nThe Preta I deflected changed targets. It bounced off at the metal-bodied Demon Lord of unknown origin sitting in front of me.\nRegardless of its small body, the speed it unleashed wasn’t something a General Class like me could follow with my eyes. But the changing scene went far from my realm of understanding.\nI barely saw the movement of iron-like arms. With a short sound, the thing called Preta burst open like a tomato. Pale blue blood scattered, and fell onto the girl to my side.\nThe next instant, the girl with an outward appearance similar to mine’s arm changed shape to a steel pole.\nThe room shook greatly. By the time I noticed it, the metal Demon Lord’s body had been buried into the wall. The girl’s face remained expressionless.\nAt the stream of circumstance leaving me behind, I could do not but let off a cold sweat amd blink my eyes.\nHe was hit. She hit him. At a speed I couldn’t see. Expressionlessly.\n“… Hey, stop it.”\nAs if obstructed by Kanon-sama’s words, countless orbs began to fall from the ceiling.\nWai… these are all that thing from before…\nAfter bouncing once, they all split to show off their giant mouths.\nI saw countless of those knife-like fangs lined up one after the other.\nEach of them grew their own limbs. Looking closely, their arms were much more robust than mine. Based on their previous conduct, their explosive power was far from perfect, though.\nI don’t have enough lives for this one.\nI tried to brush them all away with Sky Hand, and Kanon-sama shout blew it all away.\n“I told you to stop!!”\nAlong with the cry, a raging fire passed in front of my body. After the flame had left, not a single one of the numerous Pretas remained.\nThat destruction that happened before I could even be given the chance to feel feverish was truly worthy of her name, Kanon of Ruin.\nThe metal body of the Lord in the wall leisurely rose.\nHe barely had any wounds. But only his right arm had vanished as if it had been shaved away.\nNo. It wasn’t shaved off.\nI saw through it.\n… This is 『Usurping』.\n“Schitol, return it already.”\n“… Fu.”\nThe young girl Demon Lord known as Schitol snorted at the Great Demon King’s words.\nAnd at around the same time, her body was sent flying.\nThe metallic Demon Lord hit her. Though all I could see was the result of her being hit into the air.\nDespite his slow-looking build, that was quite some acceleration.\nSchitol’s head pierced into the ceiling, and dangled for a while. Fresh blood dripped down to stain the black table.\nI want to go home.\nJust by being here, I can gradually feel my power of Sloth whittling away.\nAnd of course there would be casualties if it’s like this…\nThe young girl’s body lost to gravity, and fell from the ceiling.\nI could see her expression.\nThere was nothing but despair in the pitch black exes visible beyond the red trickling of blood.\nThe expression alone was a symbol of the hell of desire, great enough to fold any normal Demon’s heart. That which made clear the gap between me and a Demon Lord was, if put into words, perhaps a ‘difference in character.’\nRight as she landed, she lowered her raised arms at the metal Demon Lord’s body. From her footing, I couldn’t imagine that she had taken any considerable damage.\nThat attack without and hesitation, as if her malice had been creeping up on him with the passage of time was much too vivid.\nAnd yet, the metal bodied Demon Lord blocked it.\nThe fleeting sound of a barrier shattering due to pure physical might rang out, and the ground made of highly-durable stone caved in.\n“Oy, Schitol. I told you to return it.”\n“The one to return it to will be gone soon enough.”\nSchitol returned a level voice.\nThat wasn’t even an answer.\nBut of course, I didn’t put that to words. If it won’t directly bring any trouble to me, then you guys can do whatever it is you want.\nWell, this display of power is a trouble to my mind, but…\nHis left arm disappeared, and as that happened, Schitol’s left arm changed to one of metal.\nWith both of her arms made of iron bars taller than her own height, the girl’s form was nothing but bizarre.\nAs that new existence shook her body, Heard, who had been quite up to now, let out a gloomy voice.\n“Can’t we finish this up faster? I’m busy.”\nThere was the sound of something bursting. Having lost its head, Schitol’s body slowly collapsed onto the ground.\n“… No mercy…”\nWith unappealing sentiment, I whispered. No matter how you look at it, that was too abrupt.\nHeard Lauder lowered his fist. The Prideful Kaised hadn’t even moved from where he was. He just pressed his elbow into the table, and looked at Schitol with an uninterested look on his face.\nAs if that seat was his own throne.\nIt was as if the distance between himself and the girl had been meaningless from the start.\nThe extent of speed he displayed was enough to silence the room. Within that, I who was probably second from the bottom in power let out a sigh.\nStill, it’s finally going to start, is it… it hasn’t even commenced, and yet there’s already been way too much bloodshed…\nI whispered in my heart, as I listlessly looked over at Schitol, and at that moment, her eyes met with mine.\n“… Fu.”\nThe head that was supposed to be gone had regrown itself. That wasn’t the speed of regeneration. I was sure I was looking at her most of the time, but I had never even seen the moment she started to heal.\nStill collapsed over, as if nothing had happened, Schitol bent her lips into a smile.\nWhat’s with this Demon Lord!? This is way too absurd, is it not?\nFirst, let’s see what Rank she…\nWhen those thoughts were going through my head, my eyes were completely taken by darkness.\n＊＊＊＊＊\n“What happened?”\n“… I died before the conference even started…”\nWith weary emotions, I rubbed my head into Leigie-sama’s back.\nThank god. That I sent an illusion.\nThank god. That I can still use 『Phantom Aliquot Dance』.\nThank god. That I didn’t take Lize’s words too seriously, and actually go out myself.\nEven if they may be Demon Lords, that was just too cruel. No mystery why there’d be casualties there. Those are tried and true monsters, ain’t they?\nGreat Demon King Kanon, Heard Lauder, and Lilith Luxeliaheart are all starting to look sane to me. Leigie-sama’s harmlessness was enough to make him seem lovable. That must have been the haunt of the greatest of beasts.\nI wonder what they were planning to speak of in such a space, and wait, I wonder if Lize is alright. I had quite a few things to consider, but surprisingly, the greatest thing on my mind was the stoic front of a single young lass.\nIs Hiero okay…\nIf she died, would Lorna be sad?\nFurrowing my brow, I looked to the maid trying to pull me away, thought of such pointless things, and once more, I embraced Leigie-sama with all my might.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 4: Superbia’s Arrogance, Part 1: Abnormal, and Foolish\nThis was back when I had just developed awareness.\nThere was something I tried asking oneechan.\n“Why is it that we only have first names?”\nAll of those Demons out there were made of both a first, and last name.\nThe first that proved their individuality, and the last that defined their way of life.\nIf they hadn’t decided on how they were going to live on, then in most cases, they took on the last name of their ancestors.\nThat’s why, as Demons, it was unthinkable that those of a house that’s served a Demon Lord for generations couldn’t have a last name.\nAnd to me, the sister that boasted an identical appearance offered a short answer. Kindly, as if to caution me.\n“The way we live our lives is decided by our Lord. That’s why our predecessors have no last names.”\nI simply couldn’t believe it.\nOnce in a distant past…\nMe, and my parents, and the parents before that and in the generation even before that lot was born, our continuous line was something you could call a form of legend.\nIt’s not like we performed service on the battlefield, and it’s not like we successfully followed our desires.\nIf I were forced to say, then our family’s last name was 『Shadow』.\nThe Lord of Depravity who, as a Demon, boasted a providence much too undemonlike. For us, who continued to nestle ourselves close to him, we could be nothing but pure shadows.\nWe weren’t weak, but you wouldn’t be able to call us strong either.\nStrength was unnecessary to a shadow. All that we wished for was to serve, and it wasn’t the sort of service we were rewarded for.\nThe existences that continued to serve the Lord who spent his time meaninglessly, were likely just as meaningless.\nI remembered back to my ancestors.\nI didn’t know what had happened several tens of thousands of years ago. I couldn’t even hazard a guess.\nBut killing off the cravings that dwelled in their bodies, they spent an eternity accompanying their Lord, and living while concealing their breaths. They were likely more abnormal than any of those third rate Demons lying around out there, and much more foolish.\nThat’s why, oneechan included, I sneered at my predecessors.\nOn that day, rained poured to the ground, as if the heavens were weeping. The violent sound of the rain drumming against the glass window, and the reverberating rumble of thunder.\nIn the darkness, the figure of my body reflected back at me was identical to oneechan, but only my eyes were a little different.\nMy ancestors, my patents, my siblings, and even the Lord I was to serve. I sneered at them all.\nAnd as if even to sneer at the girl who did all of that, the blue eyes I saw were earnestly probing my expression.\nLightning lit the scene.\nOn rainy nights, the miasma would grow thick. Among the Demons of the Demon World, the holders of strong negative souls, that was passed as a simple superstition.\nBut on the other side of the glass which interrupted the darkness, I saw my figure putting on a smile so dazzling even I couldn’t believe it.\nThere wasn’t a hint of miasma in those lips.\nAll those pitch black emotions were enclosed within me, and not a fragment of them was to leak out.\nRight.\nThat must be my 『Superbia』.\nNot to raise myself to a higher platform, merely a heinous vice to scorn all others.\nEffort was unnecessary.\nStrength was unnecessary.\nFriendship was unnecessary.\nAll of it, everything was… just stupid.\nEven if the result were to isolate me, if I’m just to quietly find my spot in the grave without even a name, then I choose the path that would shine some light onto myself, as temporary as it may be.\nWithin the polished, mirror-like class, the gold-haired woman giggled to herself.\nThat should have been me, and yet, she lacked a sense of reality.\n“Kusu kusu… no matter how you look at it… holding yourself back too much…”\nA somewhat sweet, and slovenly tone poured out of my mouth.\nRight. This is the shape of Hiero’s soul.\nIf you desire it, then seek it.\nIf your Lord is idle, then take action.\nOverrule everything in this vast Demon World.\nIn order for me to stay as me.\nIf desire is what’s to decide the power of Demons, then…\nThere’s no doubt that my Superbia is the mark of the world’s strongest Demon.\nWithin the darkness, my lips bent into the shape of a smile.\n… I mean look at just how brightly I’m shining.\nMy image swirled around the frame of the window. The light caught onto my golden hair, and glistened.\nIt was as if it were the portrait of a fairy, yet for some reason, it appeared tasteless.\n“… Lord of Sloth, please look at me. Please remember me. My name, my form, my voice, my soul…”\nSpending a pointless lifetime not feeling anything, without thinking anything, not recording anything to memory, for you, who never cared in the slightest for us, my existence will be…\nKusu kusu kusu.\nRight. Then first comes introducing myself.\n“My name is Hiero. Hiero of Superbia.”\nNo last name, no way of life, just a normal Demon\nBut I’ll accumulate my desire, and show you as I wash out the heavens.\nI am Hiero of Superbia.\nBut you don’t have to prostrate yourself before me. You won’t have to kneel. I don’t need your worship.\nI’ve no need to make you fools out there understand me.\nI’m on top, and you’re at the bottom. That’s all.\nIt’s fine as long as you understand that.\nBut things went beyond my expectations in the blink of an eye.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 4: Superbia’s Arrogance, Part 2: They are the Worst\nOverrule.\nIt was the most famous power possessed by Pride Demons.\nI think it’s pointless Skill. Something like that shouldn’t be necessary in the first place..\n… If you’re truly Pride.\nBecause even if it didn’t appear to me as a Skill, I had already 『Overruled』 everything.\n… Besides oneechan.\nBefore my eyes, Medea-san slowly toppled over. Within the swirls of the Demon Lords’ mana, the smallest present by far disappeared like the fleeting light of a lone candle.\nEven for me, that sudden departure was outside my expectations, and I unintentionally opened my eyes wide to stare at Medea-san’s falling small stature.\nA large hole had been opened right in the center of her body. It clearly showed that she had been pierced by something.\nThe hole itself was wide enough that if I looked through, I thought I might see the world beyond.\nAfter meeting her for once in quite a while, Medea had become quite slackened. I wonder just what sake she was living for anymore. It was too much of a way of life for me to take up. In a way, it was worthy of admiration.\nIn that sense, I didn’t actually hate Medea-san all that much.\nEven if, through her narrow escape it looked like Heard-san was going to kill me… well… Medea-san is… a pitiful Demon. Enough that just thinking about her existence was enough to elevate my power a little. Her being was able to contest for the first and second place of the most trifling Demons I had ever met, and even when her height exceeded mine ever-so-slightly, her chest was even more barren than me. There wasn’t even any comparison between her and oneechan.\nThat alone was enough for me to forgive everything.\nAnd by forgiving it all, it also signified that I didn’t really give a damn, and that, to me, Medea-san was a genuine, tried and true, worthless existence.\nBut, even so, there’s always something that comes to mind the moment a Demon I was acquainted with was annihilated.\nI let out a small voice so no one would here, as I muttered in a daze.\n“Medea-san… how unsightly.”\nNot even a dry laugh could escape my mouth. But at the same time, I felt that being dealt with before the conference started was quite suiting of Medea-san’s way of life. To fulfill her role to the death, we have quite a pro here.\n… Though that would only be if she did it on purpose.\nThis is the land of death. Places where Demons gather draw death close to them. When that gets t Demon Lord Level, then that’s not even related to enemy or ally anymore.\nHarming others came as simple to them as breathing. That’s why even I’m hiding myself behind Heard-san…\nShe didn’t get it at all. Even if she was a General class, her behavior full of openings made others want to test their powers on her. As a class even lower than her, I can only saugh scornfully at how ill prepared she was.\nAs I was simply staring at the scene from Heard-sans back, the sound of the clicking of a tongue entered my ear.\n“Tsk…”\nThe Prideful Kaiser, Heard Lauder.\nThe Rank One Lord who had served the lone Demon Lord of Sloth lorded over the Demon Lord who remained collapsed over the table.\nBefore the Lord whose dislodged head had recovered itself at a moment’s notice, his Pride showed not the slightest of waver. His eyes, as if they looking upon garbage, were far different from mine, but they gave more than enough verification that he was Pride all the same.\nI’ll bet there’s a bit of his complex towards the great and powerful Leigie-sama mixed into that.\nAnd every time I see that, I think.\nThat way of life… isn’t it tiring?\nA strong killing intent, as if those eyes alone were enough to bring all to ruin, lapped at the air of the conference room.\n“Schitol, I believe I told you to stop.”\n“? Stop what?”\nFace up on the table, the female Demon answered.\nThe army Heard-san lead in Leigie-sama’s stead was said to boast the greatest fangs among all the Demon Lords.\nWith that sort of numerical power, the information did tend to gather around there, so I did have some recollection of the name Schitol.\nSchitol Tzuchaser.\nAs a Demon of Avaritia, she held the moniker of the『Collector』. Her Rank was just one above Leigie-sama’s current position, and Leigie-sama aside, she held the least land among those of the Great Demon King’s army.\nBut that being the case, in what was supposed to be her first round table conference, she picked a fight with her senior Lord of Pride. I guess that’s what makes a Demon Lord.\nOf course, it was our first meeting, but seeing her nerve to stand before Heard-san, whose honed magic might even surpass the Great Demon King Kanon-san’s, even if it may be pure recklessness out of ignorance, it was an act worthy of praise.\nBut that’s all there was to it. She must be all bark, and no bite.\nI mean Schitol-san… her appearance is decent, I guess, but her breasts are puny.\nSchitol-san leisurely rose.\nHer expression seemed to show true confusion, and her black eyes, with the gloss of obsidian, were directed at Heard-san.\nWith no anger for the one who personally crushed her head, her face was like that of a lost child. The purity of her expression made it all the more repulsing.\nI doubt that was really the case, but her face seemed to seriously be wondering why it was that she had received an attack.\nBut that’s all there was to it. She must be all talk.\nI mean Schitol-san… her appearance isn’t bad, but her breasts are much too pitiful.\nAs her size was just around the level of Medea-san, her worth as a person must be that of a single Medea Luxeliaheart at most. No doubt about it. A useless existence to me.\nNo need to think about it. The moment we met, with the form her desires made her take on, I was Overruling Schitol-san.\nHeard-san furrowed his brow. A proof of his displeasure.\nDespite this and that, while the Demon Lord known as Heard Lauder was powerful in body, his mind wasn’t as resolute. He was a warrior. It’s likely that while Leigie-sama was asleep, he had spent his entire life on the battlefield. That devotion to his study that surpassed tens of thousands of years of experience definitely had an impact on his personality.\nBut his power was truly absurd. As Demon Lords, each and every one of them had a ridiculous amount of strength, but even among that, Heard-san was a cut above the rest.\nHe was a typical muscle head.\nSince he abducted me without telling me anything under the pretense of training, I had always been watching that.\nThe word patience didn’t exist in his dictionary. For whatever the reason, he had been overly sullen as of late, and his boiling point was getting exceedingly low. His pure physical strength that was, for argument’s sake able to knock down a Lord of Sloth once, was, to Demon Lords that were no match in defense, definitely fatal.\nBut regardless of being crushed by Leigie-sama afterwards, his Pride didn’t seem to have taken the slightest tumble.\nTo Heard Lauder, even if she was a former subordinate, the Envy Demon Medea-san was likely nothing but trash.\nBut to the Lord of Superbia, that wasn’t enough of a reason for him not to eliminate the Demon Lord who didn’t listen to his orders.\nHis words were the words of Pride. The words of god.\nUnable to find satisfaction unless me made any Demon he met prostrate themselves before him, from my point of view, he simply looked like a narrow-minded man worried over all the finer details, but while I couldn’t sympathize, I could understand.\nAs if to support the thoughts in my mind, without any warning, Heard-san’s figure blurred for a moment.\nAt about the same time, Medea-san’s body that had been left in the corner of my vision faded away as if it had been an illusion.\nIn the span of the blink of an eye, Schitol-san’s head and limbs ruptured, and a bright red mist erupted out of her body. All that was left, an obsidian Soul Core the same shade as her eyes let out a dry sound as it rolled desolately across the round table.\nHis means of attack lay only in his fists. But his incomprehensible attach strength and speed gave off a power much too barbaric to be called Pride. I couldn’t even follow the slightest of it with my eyes.\nAnd those apart from me probably couldn’t follow it either. I saw the Demon Lord who picked up Schitol-san’s disembodied arms swallowing his spit.\nHe should have been a Demon Lord of Pride as well… now that he’s seen those fists in action, the probability of him ever surpassing Heard-san has become close to zero.\nHow unsightly. If your heart loses, then there can never be pride. There’s nothing but a slow destruction in store for him.\nThe old withered tree-like Lord sitting right across from Medea didn’t seem to pay any mind to the ghastly spectacle, nor did he mind the wreckage of Schitol-san showering down on him. With a fed-up tone, he muttered.\n“… Phantom Aliquot Dance… That girl… so she was a Luxuria Demon. A living illusion… no wonder it ended so soon.”\n“… Dammit Medea… when you’re the substitute for a Demon Lord, for you to send in a phantasm…”\nHeard-san’s eyebrows were quite clearly stiff. It was as if his anger was clearly visible. How scary…\nDemons Round was also a place for Demon Lords to demonstrate their power. As it is, Superbia already detested those who would taint their pride.\nEspecially when Medea-san was just a replacement.\nOriginally, that was Heard-san’s role… no, more than that, while she was attending in place of her own Lord Leigie-sama, for her to submit an illusion of all things, there should be a limit to tomfoolery.\nI can do nothing but secretly praise her needlessly high amount of guts.\nShe really is just a precession of failures. She was ignored by Leigie-sama, beaten left and right by Heard-san, and even after surviving all of that, I could tell from a glance her new slovenly take on life. That girl must be a genius at tragedy.\n“Kusu kusu kusu…”\nAnd being thrown around like this by the Lords, how pitiful.\nA laugh flows out of me. Just as its name might suggest, those of the Demon Lord Class were strong. If it was just in battle ability, then no matter how many of those of my level you grouped up, there’s no way we’d be able to oppose.\nBut in exchange for that, they were completely hopeless degenerates.\nOne of the seated Demon Lords sent his eyes over here.\nThe pressure I could feel just from that, enough to rock my soul, made my shrink back behind Heard-san.\nMy instincts informed me of the power gap that surpassed whatever enhancements I could gain with my Overrule Skill, however, it was likely something that, if I were given the time, I could close all too easily.\nThe only thing I was lacking in was time. Time for me to grow with the desires of my soul as fuel.\nHeard-san made a slight gesture of peering over here, but he corrected his field of vision immediately.\nKusu kusu. Right, right. I’m just a weak little girl. If you hit me, I’m sure to die…\nIt appears that the situation was out of Kanon-sama’s expectations. She scowled a little as she stared at the position Medea-san had disappeared from, but she soon took a deep sigh.\n“… Well, so be it. Lize, as his inspector, you will be informing the Lord of Sloth of this matter at a later date.”\n“… Understood.”\nReceiving the will of the Great Demon King, Leigie-sama’s observer Lize-san offered her affirmation. She wasn’t surrounded by a tense air, and she held an aura you could call grand as she stood upright behind the seat that had become vacant.\nThey had found common ground. Whatever the case, with Leigie-sama holed up in the Castle of Shadows, perhaps the safest place in the entire Demon World, a large majority of things were unrelated to him.\nContinuing on, Kanon-sama’s blood-red pair of eyes glared into the table, as if to pierce a hole into it.\nAt the one who should have received enough damage to return her body to just its Soul core, the Collecting Demon Lord.\nI was swallowing my spit behind Heard, but neither Heard-san nor Kanon-san showed and disarray in their attitudes.\nAs if it was all a complete natural occurrence, they looked at the Demon Lord who had been reconstructed whole at some point in time.\n“Schitol Tzuchaser… Then next time you lay your hands on an allied soldier, I will dispose of you in the name of my Ruin. Know your place.”\n“…? What place?”\nHer conduct was as if nothing had happened at all.\nSchitol-san’s sharp gaze didn’t seem to hold any care for the force that seemed to try to wither her away, as she returned to her seat.\nThe Pride Demon Lord who still had both his arms stolen tried to stand, but when Heard-san shot a look at him, he silently sat.\nTo regain control of the area, Kanon-san sent a silent glance around the table.\nThat burning pressure spread about to suppress the fighting spirit, the instincts, longings these Demon Lords had probed to their depths.\nThe Great Demon King position didn’t have the qualifications of wisdom or status, or charisma, or talent. It was a spot that came to be by pure power alone, and that display was plenty to demonstrate that fact.\nOf the Demon Lords allied to the Great Demon King, there is said to be nineteen in all. But less than half of that number had gathered here.\nAs if that shameful sight hadn’t ever happened, Kanon-san offered her thanks to the Lords present.\nThat was the signal of the conference’s start. A weak Demon Lord had no worth. In that sense, even if she may have been an illusion, for her to have been killed before the start, Medea-san had done an insufficient job of filling the role of Leigie-sama’s representative.\n“So we’ve all gathered… I thank you for making the journey here. Lords.”\n“… Hm, so this is all that’s left. The numbers sure have dwindled.”\nHeard-san’s head shook in lament.\nThe number of Demon Lords wasn’t something that fluctuated so easily.\nThe race known as Demons was one without a set lifespan, and they get stronger the longer they’ve lived. At Demon Lord Level, their survivability was overwhelmingly higher than other Demons.\n“The two that the Devourer, Zebul, ate, and Zebul herself make up a loss of three. The other casualties were Angels. Hm… for them to be annihilated by something on the level of Angels… how deplorable.”\nHeard-san sent around an intimidating glare to those present.\nIt was like he was offering to end them all before they faced defeat from such things.\nHeard-san’s way of life was much too severe. I would never be able to imitate it, and I think it’s nothing but stupid.\nSo please don’t try dragging me into it. No, seriously.\n“But we really have faced a considerable decline. It no one beyond Rank Ten is in attendance…”\nThe old man spoke.\nHis height wasn’t even half of Heard-san’s, and he was a Demon with a slim stature like a dead tree’s. His frailty made it look as if he would be sent flying with a breath of air.\nBut his glare held a viscous and sticky darkness.\nThe ranking system of the Great Demon King’s army wasn’t something based solely on strength.\nWhile it was usually taken as an equivalent, the primary factor that influenced it was that Lord’s service to the army. That’s why compared to those below Rank Ten, the other Demon Lords simply lacked achievements.\nThey were young.\nThat doesn’t mean they had lived short lives, but that not too much time had passed since they became Demon Lords.\nFresh Meat.\nEven so, it’s quite likely they had lived longer than me, and with that life, they were anniohilated by Angels. What a pointless life.\n“Yes, this is Rank Eighteen here.”\n“Yep~ Rank Eleven over here.”\n“Ho ho ho, my apologies. It looks like not all of them have perished…”\nSchitol-san raised her hand, and raised a high pitched, tension-less voice towards the empty seats.\nHer lack of nervousness made me feel a little power seeping from my body.\n“Hm… facing defeat at but a single Valkyrie, they’ve not the qualifications to be Demon Lords. They were fated to die a dog’s death eventually. There’s no need to pay it any mind.”\n“Don’t be like that, Heard Lauder. This time’s enemy is… quite capable. The reason I’ve convened you all is also about that matter.”\nOn Heard-san’s words, Kanon-san let out a tired sigh.\nThe Great Demon King had an enemy too great to simply be called treacherous within her midst. Her anger scorched the heavens, and reduced the ground to ash. Always under such an extreme amount of stress, it was said to be only natural that she became the Great Demon King. As I thought, the Ranking system is nothing but garbage.\n“Oh?”\nOh Kanon-san’s words, Heard-san’s eyes widened a little.\nI noticed a faint fire burning in them.\nThe light of fighting spirit.\nIt was because Heard-san was Pride, that the stronger the enemy, the more likely he was to take the initiative.\nIt was in order to forge his own power, or so he called it, but I do believe that’s a little extreme.\nIt was likely because he lost to Leigie-sama. I was forgiven as a result, so that’s all fine and dandy, but that doesn’t change how troublesome it is.\nOnce more, in silence, Kanon-sama looked over all the gathered faces, and spat out words backed by emotions violent enough to make existences quiver.\n“A few days ago, at the hands of the Valkyrie in question… Serge Serenade, the Seventh Rank was destroyed.”\n“Seventh… Rank…”\nIt was the first death of a Demon Lord within the top ten.\nEven when the death of a Demon Lord was a rare occurrence, it was even rarer for one of the higher ranks to perish.\nOn that note, the air in the conference room suddenly got heavier.\nThe old man opened his eyes wide, and scowled at Kanon-sama.\n“Oh… Rank Seven… Ciel Afreide, was it? So the Haughty Youngun died…”\n“… Hm, I see… it truly seems that she is sufficiently capable. Kanon, I shall approve of your anxiety.”\nI’d never met her before, but apparently Heard-san knew her.\nEven so, why does his arrogance act up so much whenever Kanon-san is concerned? I’ve not the slightest.\nI don’t think there’s a single merit to come of picking a fight with her, you know…\nStanding behind me, Heard-san’s one of Heard-san’s inspectors let out a long sigh, as if he had become accustomed to the man’s behavior.\nThe King in question has probably become accustom to dealing with his Pride as well. She ignored his dauntless wording, and moved on.\n“Ciel Afreide was not a weak Lord. At the very least, no matter how many average Angels came at him at a time, he would never be at the risk of defeat.”\nA Demon’s power was greatly chipped away in the Heavens where Angels lived.\nBut in exchange, our Demon Lords were transcendentally strong.\n“And, what of it? Kanon-sama, all you’re saying is that a single Demon Lord has died, correct?”\nWith a bored expression, the balloon-like man sitting beside Kanon-san tried asking.\nHis swelled ball-like large torso was enough to surpass Heard-san’s height, and at a conspicuously high level, his sorry excuse for a head sent down a look with its white eyes, and colorless pupils.\n“Just as you may have heard from your inspectors, on this occasion, where one within the top ten ranks has been killed off, we cannot simply let her violence reign free any longer. It will be a hindrance to my world domination.”\nKanon-san looked around again.\nWhile she looked calm, the inside of the room was filled with a grilling heat, and even when she didn’t look directly at me, I could feel it.\n… World domination, is it?\nI think that’s just plain idiotic. For those out there, those fools out there, what point is there in gaining command of them?\nIf you’re going to do something like that, then… right, just skimming the top of the broth sounds best. Get everything under your control, find a way to scoop out nothing but the beautiful substance, and leave the rest of the meal to the wolves.\nKusu kusu…\n“Ah~… with the Seventh Rank being killed… does that mean I’m next~?”\nRather than… sitting in a chair, a young lady floating right above it raised a hysteric voice.\nI secretly frowned, as I committed her form to memory.\nAppearance-wise, she was a slim girl that didn’t seem like much a Demon Lord at all. More than uncertain, her bearing was one where she swayed back and forth in the air.\nHers was an uncomposed voice I couldn’t think of as coming from a Demon.\nBut she was one I had to be wary of.\nI mean, even with that slim figure, how does her chest grow to that size…\nHer pale-blue robe-like dress, and deep blue sash were, if memory serves, the traditional clothing of a peculiar province… it did fit the lines of her body quite well, but only her breasts swelled unnaturally from it.\nAs expected of a Demon Lord…\n“There won’t be a next. That’s why we’ve been gathered. Right?”\n“Yes, that’s exactly right. Up to now, we let her run free, believing whoever died by her hand was fated to die off either way, but… now that Ciel has been slaughtered, we can no longer postpone the matter. We can’t leave the Angels looking down on us like this…”\nA gathering of Demon Lords wasn’t anything that happened all too often.\nWhile her calm composure wasn’t thinkable of one governing Wrath, in truth, in her body, the Great Demon King was seething in rage.\nKanon-san was severe. What’s more, she knew how to use that fact.\n“We’ll strike first. Other than that Valkyrie… I’ve also read the report of the skies showing strange movements. Right, Vanity?”\n“… Yep.”\nA steel-like body apart from Heard’s, wrapped around a mountainous build of a man roared out.\nVanity Seidthroan.\nNext to Heard-san, the second strongest Demon of Pride.\nWhy are all these Prides these shameless masses of muscle…. It’s quite wondrous. It isn’t beautiful in the slightest.\nOf course, that metal body over there is also out of the question.\nOut. Of. The Question!\n“Attacks… came twice. The enemy was five Angels, and ten the next. Our casualties… roughly one hundred.”\nWith uninterested expressions, the surrounding Lords listened in.\nThe number of one hundred wasn’t anything great, but it definitely wasn’t small.\nBut it’s not that we assembled a force, but that one of our forces was assaulted, and faced annihilation. An exception.\nAmong these Lords who gave their all to pursugin their desires, I doubt there’s really anyone who understands the meaning of those words. All these Lords are idiots.\nAnd Heard-san was the same as always. While he might have known, his lack of interest made his disposition even more ill-natured.\nWith his arms crossed, he lorded over Vanity-san with a grim expression.\n“Hm, have you grown soft? Even if it may have been just a hundred, while you were there, for you to have failed to destroy a measly five Angels…”\n“… No… my army’s… the strongest.”\nVanity-shot down the glare with a look that didn’t fall short at all in terms of malice. There was no hesitation in him.\nThe class of wills between two Demons of Pride caused the air to shake.\nAs if to blow that away, Kanon-san let out a deep sigh.\n“Please don’t make this any more of a pain than it already is. Heard, Vanity… Vanity, I heard that the enemies were of Saint Lord Class, but is that true?”\n“Saint Lord…”\nThat was heaven’s finest. If Demon Lord was a Demon’s highest rank, then that was what took its place in the Angel race.\nAnd at the same time, they were a rare sight to find in the Demon World.\nI’ve only ever heard of them, and never seen one for real. No, I doubt even a majority of Demon Lords have ever seen one.\nBut on the other hand, with the appearance of a Saint Lord, having only a mere one hundred casualties became strange.\nThey’re supposed to be much higher up there than that Serge something something Valkyrie … and with but a hundred casualties, the Lord was able to repel them? Is Vanity’s Legion strong?\nI’ve always been going through bridal training in order to serve Leigie, so I’m none to knowledgeable in that field.\nVanity-san gave his solemn consent.\nWith just that, the other Demon Lords began to stir. It sems they had finally begun to understand the abnormality of the situation.\nThe ones that didn’t change were Vanity-san, Heard-san, and Kanon-san. Those three. Those were the only ones who had understood what was going on from the start.\nThe balloon man sitting beside Kanon-san flailed his arms about as he gave his opinion.\nHow unsightly. It’s unsightly, but… that man’s Rank Two. That means he was the former Rank One Demon Lord. This world must be at its end.\n“So that means… there’s a need for us to divide into two groups. What are your thoughts on the matter, Kanon-sama?”\n“Right…”\nKanon-san had likely already reached her conclusion.\nNo, she likely had done so far before we had gathered.\nThis was just a dispatch order under the guise of a conference.\n“I have no intent to mobilize us all. We still have the duty of crushing the Demon Lords of other territories. Right… two. Two is more than enough.”\n“The Angels… I’ll destroy them.”\nWith fiery sparkling silver eyes, Vanity-san’s gaze pierced through Kanon-san.\nThat wasn’t… Anger. But his voice like the rumbling of falling thunder definitely had some power behind it.\nOn that voice, Kanon-san grinned.\n“Hu… so be it, Vanity. Swing about your powers as you please.”\n“Then on Serge’s matter… I’ll step forth.”\nBefore another Demon Lord could open their mouth, Heard-san made a declaration.\nHe had a somewhat unpleasant expression on his face.\nIt seems both of them had wanted to take on the previous matter. I’m not sure if they were afraid of Heard-san, but Demon Lords had stopped coming to attack our lands altogether, as of late.\nEven so, he decided to take the initiative, and go forth to crush his enemies one by one, but they were all too weak for him to feel any resistance, apparently.\nThe frustration from that is making my training more and more absurd, and I was just at my wit’s end.\nIt’s impossible, I tell you… to split a mountain with my bare hands…\nBut could it be that… I’m finally free? I want to return to Leigie-sama’s side already…\nI’m actually quite busy. I’ve no time to follow along with Heard-san’s games.\nWhether she understood his state or not, Kanon merely nodded once.\n“Yes, Heard Lauder. If it’s you, you’d definitely be able to handle it. Her station has already come to light.”\n“… You already know Serge’s location?”\n“Yeah, a Demon of Envy witnessed a scene of her battle. She’s now but a caged bird to us.”\n“Hm… let it be so. At best, she’ll make for a quick snack.”\nIt didn’t seem the other Lords had any opinions to share.\nOf course. Those guys had no incentive. Orders were one thing, but they wouldn’t choose to do something like opposing Kanon-san or Heard-san of their own volition.\nOr so I thought, but the ghost girl went right into her fifty cents.\n“Hey~ Heard-san. I don’t really have a problem with you going for the Valkyrie or anything, but… if she attacks me, I can kill her, right?”\n“Hm… I mind it not, Rank Six. If she had the power to bring ruin to Rank Seven, I can understand your sentiment of wanting to fight her.”\nWell I don’t get it at all.\n“… No, no, no, no, I just hate it when people like that get in my way, you know~?”\nAnd the ghost girl didn’t seem to get it either.\nAs if to say the conversation was unexpected, she crossed her arms. She needlessly emphasized her needlessly bulging chest.\nHow sly… as I thought, this woman is formidable.\n“Are those Angels made of nice parts?”\n“No clue.”\nOn the other side, Schitol-san was, of all things, conversing with the Demon Lord whose arms she had stolen about some pointless topic, only to receive a flat out refusal.\nHow shameless… she really is the worst.\nAnd what’s with this lack of tension discussing out arch nemesis?\nWell… just do whatever you want. The ones who’ll pay for your unsightly display here is you guys after all…\nIn my eyes, I could clearly see the form of these Lords facing destruction at their oen negligence. You reap what you sow.\nKusu kusu…\nHow unsightly. They’re taking everything in jest. Even if they may call themselves the rulers of Demon-kind, those gathered here are nothing but an extension of those third rate Demons scattered all over the place.\nI can’t… even take them into consideration. The one I want to prove myself to is one man alone. Only Leigie-sama. That is the starting point. If I don’t get anywhere with that, my life won’t find its beginning.\nFor a while, the surroundings were astir, and when a moment of silence finally came about, Vanity spoke up, as if he had just remembered something.\n“… Ah, come to think of it… that Devourer… survived, you know?”\nThe thunderous voice clearly reached my ears.\nThe hustle and bustle that had been resounding through the room, as if taken by the tide, died down in an instant.\nHis voice was one thing, but his tone was one where he seemed to be giving a trifling report over something that didn’t matter all too much.\nBut I did see it by chance.\nStanding to the back right of Heard-san, I was in a place where I could pick it up.\nThat’s why, I may have been the only one to notice it.\nFor a moment, just a slight moment, Vanity’s eyes were colored in an eerie light.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 4: Superbia’s Arrogance, Part 3: I Cannot Run Away\nHiero, you are… beyond help.\nWhile those words lacked any clear killing intent, they were filled with a force that surpassed that.\nThey were definitely the words of a Lord of Demons, but they were on another level from that of the Lord of Sloth I had been watching up to that point.\nNo, rather than level… perhaps I should say type.\nThe difference between, without any stimulus, the large power that could always be sensed… the force of Sloth, and the heavy oppressing power of Pride to suppress everything.\nKusu kusu kusu, even when he was frozen as well, and had to be saved by Kanon-sama, he’s acting way too high and mighty…\nBut I could never voice such a thing, and if I did, regardless of how high I thought myself over Heard-san, without even a moment to feel it, I would surely die.\nIt’s no joke. My life doesn’t exist for something like that.\nBut the reason I’m still alive is likely because Heard-san lost to Leigie-sama.\nThat’s why Heard-san went against his own Pride, and refrained from killing me.\nWithout requesting a single armament, the Lord of Pride who took down the world with but his fists.\nThere are numerous cases where the source of one’s Superbia comes from the ‘self’ a Demon had trained up, but in Heard-san’s case, that wasn’t nearly enough to explain it.\nHis was an abnormal, and overwhelming conceit.\nBut his gaze that looked down on this Underground was something that I, who went in the complete opposite side of Pride’s spectrum, couldn’t understand.\n(TL: After so many chapters… they’ve finally… given a reading for Demon World… as Underground.)\nThat’s why… I’d appreciate it if he stopped taking this out on me.\n“Tsk… damn Egoist. What is he plotting…”\nHeard-san’s blade like glare was locked onto a wall.\nIt’s probably that he wasn’t doing that intentionally, but the pressure alone was enough to weight down my body. It wasn’t that sort of weight of air type pressure, but rather a definite force of gravity.\nBreathing became difficult. The inspectors keeping their distance from behind were looking at Heard-san with tired expression, and as if all of this was natural, they didn’t say a word.\nTheir job was to keep tabs on this Demon Lord. At times, they assisted, and at times, they gave advice, but they were generally neutral entities. As long as it wasn’t going to cause any real harm, they wouldn’t say anything about this level of pressure. This level of self-control makes me commend their professionalism.\nWell… even if a gathering of ten General Classes were to challenge him, Heard-san wouldn’t even take the wave of a finger.\nPerhaps the other Demon Lords finally collected themselves, as I was finally able to secretly take a breath of air in another’s Zone.\nIt wasn’t enough to prevent movement… but I was still in a bit of pain.\nSo the Devouring Lord, the former Fifth Rank Zebul Glaucus of Gula survived.\nThat fact stirred up the meeting quite a bit.\nThere wasn’t a single Lord who knew not the Devourer’s name.\nAnd that wasn’t a complement there.\nIf it was in the number of Demon Lords she’d killed, that woman likely numbered within the top three of the Great Demon King’s army, and she was an incarnation of sin great enough to even swallow up this bleak and desolate Demon World. Of all else, the repulsive Demon even ate those of her same race.\nShe was likely more troublesome that a Valkyrie who wasn’t doing anything but challenging Demon Lords, and much more abnormal.\nIf her continued existence was true, that is.\n… I mean, she should have been destroyed by the Lord of Sloth.\n“Kusu kusu kusu, but… seriously, after all this time, why is the Devouring Lord…”\nWrong. That wasn’t the main problem. I knew that. And I also knew it wasn’t something I should put to words.\nThe problem was that Leigie-sama had defied Kanon-san’s words, and allowed the Devouring Lord to run free.\nNo, that likely wasn’t the reality of the matter. Leigie-sama would never do something so troublesome. But from an outsider’s perspective, how would it look…\nNormally, it would be a failure more than deserving of punishment.\nThat was the important point here.\nEven when I didn’t voice it, I’ll bet Heard-san guessed what I wanted to say.\nHe glared at me with strong eyes, and gave an answer as if it were nothing special.\n“Hm… to Leigie of Sloth, Zebul merely wasn’t even worthy of a finishing blow. That’s all there is to it.”\n“I see…”\nAnd I doubt there’s any Lord here who would be satisfied with such an answer.\nBut, still, in this world, Rank and power was everything.\nAs long as the highest ranked Heard-san, and the one who stood above all, Kanon-san, didn’t say anything, any more words would put the speaker’s life at risk.\nJust what was Vanity-san thinking when he suddenly proclaimed the Devourer’s survival in an atmosphere like that?\nI don’t know his intent. Rank Four. His status likely wasn’t a mere decoration.\nBut there was one thing my instincts told me when I saw his eyes.\nVanity-san… gave off a scent somewhat like mine.\nEven if they were both Demons of Pride, he and Heard-san were water and oil.\nWhether there was ill intent or not, the two of them were incompatible.\nAt that point, Lize-san started jogging in our direction.\nSince the girl she had guided here had disappeared, she was probably free.\nLize-san was generally a straight-laced person, and while she was occasionally out of it, she was a woman of valor. Ah, also, her breasts were quite considerable.\nShe directed a single look at the several inspectors behind us, before turning to the one much greater than her, and in the worst of moods, Heard-san.\n“Heard Lauder, what do you plan on doing?”\n“Hm… a foolish question.”\nUsing those words as a trigger, the vague mana emitted from his well trained body suddenly converged onto himself.\nWith just that action, I saw an illusion of the air around him warping.\nExplosive magic.\nImmense physical ability.\nAn unshakable will.\nHaving obtained all of those, his bearing was undoubtedly a Lord’s.\nHeard-san had no losses, and no retreats.\nWithout ever fading, his assurance in his ‘self,’ high as the skies, was always there.\nAnd as I thought, as if it were a trifling matter, he offered a short sentence of answer.\n“… I’ll just destroy the Devourer.”\nThe meaning behind those words was likely something Lize-san couldn’t comprehend.\nBut as another Pride, I could feel them.\nEven if it went against his nature…\n“Why, at this point…”\n“Hm…”\n… It was merely his Pride.\nThat was the only basis for Heard-san’s actions.\nThat was the reason for his strength. The meaning of his strength.\nHis longings wouldn’t allow it. Even if it no longer held any relevance to him, Heard-san would wash away the stains on Leigie-sama’s record.\nIt was a pain-in-the-ass way of life. But also a way all the same.\nLize-san hesitated for a moment, before posing a question.\n“… Then what about the Valkyrie?”\n“… The Devourer comes first. The Crimson Prison is close… and I doubt it will take much time at all.”\n“No time…? The enemy is the former Rank Five, Zebul Glaucus, correct?”\n“Yes, what of it?”\nThere was never a waver in his way of life.\nIt was likely that Heard would never hold doubt in his own victory up to the moment before his death.\nKusu kusu kusu, he really has no flexibility….\n“I’ll head to the Crimson Prison.”\n“Eh? Wai… that land is under Vanity’s domain. Are you sane?”\nHeard-san didn’t even nod at Lize-san’s voice.\nIt was his resolution. Without listening to anyone else’s words, he would push through his path on nothing but his own willpower.\nHow useless. When he’s like this, he can’t be stopped by anyone. In that sense, he was still quieter back when he was Leigie-sama’s supreme commander.\nWell, it doesn’t really matter to me.\nI don’t need strength. I don’t need training.\nThe ‘supreme’ that Heard-san wishes for holds absolutely no meaning to Leigie-sama.\nTo me as well.\nIf Heard-san is to die, then all that will happen is that I’ll go back to serve under Leigie-sama. I still have something I have to accomplish there.\nAnd wait, you don’t have to die, just hurry up and release me already…\nI seriously don’t need this training. The land isn’t splitting anytime soon. It’s impossible. It’s not splitting, and there’s absolutely no one out there that wants it to split.\n“Lize, you can just go scout out the Valkyrie’s station. After destroying the Devouring Lord, I’ll head there.”\n“Wai… it couldn’t be that you’re going alone, right? At the very least, your army…”\n“Unnecessary… Hm, damn Vanity. I’ll definitely make you pay for this one.”\nOy, that one’s a false claim. All Vanity did here was report the truth.\nBut he couldn’t come out and say that due to his nature.\nAt the very least, I couldn’t see that Vanity had that sort of disposition.\nWhen I recall his boorish silver eyes looking our way, even I had shivers run down my spine.\nHis moniker… the Egoist means he himself acknowledged his own fault.\nVanity Seidthroan was apparently a Demon Lord who gave up on the King’s throne. His disposition was far removed from prim and proper Superbia.\nIt’s not my problem who dies where, and while Heard-san is messed up in the head, he’s no idiot. He likely has several tens of times more experience than me, and he should have noticed it.\n“It’s quite definitely a trap, right…”\n“Hm… trap… is it? Then I’ll merely crush it head on.”\nAs I thought, this is impossible.\nI was sure he would say that…\nThis is why muscle heads are…\nHeard-san has a large quantity of power, so perhaps it’ll work out one way or another, but I’m considerably lower in that department. The Overrule Skill is powerful, but it doesn’t have the ability to overturn a power gap too great.\nBut I’ve already given up on stopping this man long ago.\nI stood a while staring at the inept inspectors standing about like scarecrows, before I made a smile and turned to Heard-san.\nSmiles didn’t work on him in a different way than Leigie-sama. However, it’s more decent to make one than not… I think.\n“Will you be heading straight for the Crimson Prison after this? In that case, I’ll go return the flying dragon…”\nThe Crimson Prison was far. From the Palace of Rending Flames, it was a few hours, even with a dragon.\nAnd in Heard-san’s case, unbelievably, his own running pace was far faster than such a beast.\nThen the dragon would just be in the way. Even so, the flying dragon was also his property, so we couldn’t just leave it here, so it was inevitable that someone was needed to return it to Heard-san’s base of operations, the『Castle of Shimmering Souls』.\nBut on my polite proposal, Heard-san directed enough anger at me to make my body shrink back.\n“Hm… Hiero. This is why I said you were beyond help.\n“Hii… n-no… I was…”\nIt was merely a locking of eyes, but the weight I felt was physical enough, and I unintentionally retreated.\nWrong. That’s wrong.\nI-it’s not like I didn’t want to accompany you or anything…\nNo, you see, well, if you drag me along, there’s the possibility I might kinda die, you know…\nThose observers, who were really just there for show, looked at me with eyes of pity.\nI don’t need your sympathy.\nMedea’s unsightly exit floated vividly in the forefront of my mind.\nBut only her face had been altered.\nWhat was there wasn’t Medea-san’s but…\nA dull heat started welling up from the depths of my brain, joining up with my bloodstream.\nAnd once more, Heard-san let out the words he had spoken just a year before when he abducted me.\n“You are unworthy…of your Superbia.”\nHis words were concise, but their meaning vanished as they were absorbed into me.\nLize-san let out some lines that were quite sensible in all regards.\nShe was a surprisingly hopeless person as she was, but she may have been the only sliver of conscience that existed around me.\n“Heard, Hiero is a non-combatant, is she not…”\n“Combatant or not isn’t the problem. Hiero is much too lacking in Pride. This one is different from… Lorna.”\nI don’t get just what exactly he’s looking for.\nBut when a Demon Lord of Pride says such things, they hold quite a bit of weight.\nPerhaps the reason I am unable to Overrule oneechan lies somewhere there. No, there’s no doubt that it does.\nIt was merely a coincidence that Heard-san took to me.\nBut earning his sympathy must be my failure.\nWhat he felt towards me was likely an illusion, but anyways, Heard-san’s Pride was much too severe for me.\nI have… no, we don’t even have a way of life.\nIn the first place power… isn’t even something I’m searching for.\nBut such excuses are rendered moot before this man.\nNo, just by stating my reason and will, I was unable to get him to recognize me. His annoyingly stern criterion had yet to be fulfilled.\n“Lize, you are to take care of the flying dragon. Hiero… come with me. We’re going to destroy the Devourer.”\n“… Kusu kusu kusu, there’s no helping it… I’ll follow you… yes, I’ll follow.”\nI used all my effort to smooth the matter over, but the fatigue in my voice was so clear I could feel it the moment it escaped my mouth.\nI don’t know if there’s anything for me, who can’t split the ground with my bare hands, to do, but from Heard-san… I cannot escape.\nWhile feeling that I was gradually heading in a completely different direction from my will, the image of Medea-san’s departure grew stronger, and I prayed to the God of the Demon World, who all could say did not exist.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 4: Superbia’s Arrogance, Part 4: Dear…\nHeard-san’s speed was extraordinary.\nAs it was, Deon Lords of Pride were said to be able to make the world around them their own, and contract it to their will, but even for that, this was just too much.\nWhile I was using a flying dragon as my means of movement, his speed on the ground could only be expressed with the sentiment, ‘ah, he disappeared.’\nWhat’s more, according to the individual himself, he could put that out even before becoming a Demon Lord. He’s a monster, that one.\nOf course, my Pride isn’t weak, but if you were to compare our running speeds, then it would be as if I were in stasis. My Pride wasn’t something that depended on strength, so there was no helping it.\nEven when he told me to come with him, it seems he had no intent of waiting for me, so I frantically urged the dragon on. At a speed slower than Heard-san, but much greater than the norm, we headed towards the Crimson Prison, and by the time we reached, the sun had already set.\nThe temperature of the land ruled by Vanity was high. It’s rumored to be the lingering influence of a Lord of Wrath who governed the area in times past, but the truth of the matter is yet to be determined.\nEven if it was now night, the heat was incomparably higher than that on the Dark Prison Leigie-sama once controlled, and the unbearable heat made me let out a single fevered sigh.\nI gratefully patted the neck of the flying dragon, who had put out a speed beyond his potential, and lay myself onto the ground for a while.\nStill, this place is… really hot…\nI lifted my arms to take in my own scent. I checked for dirt on my garments.\nKeeping my appearance in order was part of the standard curriculum for the house in service to Leigie-sama. No matter how pained, or fatigued I may be; even on the brink of death, I could not let myself be dirtied.\nI feel the anti-heat resistance on the standard Demon Tree gradually starting up.\nJust what came to their minds to have them build a town at a place like this? I can only wonder.\nIf they were going to raise one, it would be best off in a place easier to live in… Like in the Dark Prison that never had any temperature fluctuations year round, day and night.\nThis town, which seemed to be called Grey Rock was only a few kilos from the Dark Prison… it was right across the horizon.\nThe information that it was a town that defined the border looked accurate. It was relatively close to both Heard-san’s Castle of Shimmering Souls, and even Leigie-sama’s Castle of Shadows.\nAnd wait, I even passed it overhead. I felt a strong urge to stop by, so please praise me for not taking a detour here…\nWell, I can’t tell what Heard-san would say to me, you know?\nI let out another deep sigh, and started walking through the town.\nBut even if it was night, it was still too quiet.\nI was able to discern it from the skies, but the number of residents wasn’t anything great. Is the Devouring Lord really at a place like this… no, there’s also the possibility this is what’s left from that Lord’s dinner. I mean, the Devourer apparently eats other Demons for pleasure…\nThe moment I thought of the possibility, a chill ran through me, and I clutched my shoulders.\nThis is no joke.\nAccording to Vanity-san, she was being quite well behaved, but he’s not a trustworthy source of information. Our opponent has a bottomless stomach. There’s no enemy I would like to take on less than a Demon of Gluttony.\nEven if I was able to Overrule and nullify most of their Skills, I still doubt I’d have a chance of victory.\nWell, from what I can tell by looking around, there are no traces of battle.\n… Of course, there’s the possibility that all the town’s residents were devoured without being given the time to put up a fight, but if I thought that hard into it, I wouldn’t be able to take any action at all.\nWhatever the case, Heard-san should have arrived here long ago. No matter how ill-famed an enemy Zebul Glaucus was, she shouldn’t be able to stand before him. Even if she were here, she was probably gone by now.\nWhile I started forming my perfect theories on the matter, I strained my senses to feel for presences, and started walking down the path lit by the large red moon.\nIt was an ominous town. But I can’t figure out the reason for the chills I’m experiencing.\nLikely the town’s namesake, the countless houses of grey stone gave off not a single sign of life, but still, some of their windows let off dim orange colored lights.\nThe only one walking about outside was me.\nAnd there, I understood my discomfort.\nIt was too quiet. There was too little of anything.\nAs if white paint had been smeared all around me to paint out all the surroundings, it was an unnatural feeling of emptiness.\nI wasn’t particularly skilled at picking up presences or anything, but I should at least be able to feel Heard-san’s. I mean, he never held any intentions of concealing that massive power of his.\nI hurriedly looked around. The only one standing in the wide plaza of the town was… me.\nBut I couldn’t tell that. Even if I strained my ears, or concentrated my eyes, there was nothing.\nThat truth caused my Soul Core to quietly shake.\nI put my hand to my chest. The beating pulse I felt on my palm was all I could feel, and all that made my being.\nI need to calm myself. Making a ruckus at a time like this is… the work of a small fry.\nDammit! This is why I didn’t want to leave the Castle of Shadows!\nI focused myself on the beating of my core, and encouraged myself, as I took a slow glance around.\n“… Kusu kusu kusu, what could it be. This is… quite strange.”\nIt wasn’t that my life was in peril, or anything like that.\nI’m not sure the reason, but I was feeling an immense sense of impatience. If reports are to be believed, then a Lord of Angels attacked this land before. Perhaps that’s the cause of my unease.\nThe possibility that the unperceivable marks left by my natural enemy were ringing alarm bells in my head.\nAnyways, my best course of action would be to meet up with Heard-san. If it’s him, then whether it be a Saint Lord, or Devouring Lord, it will work out one way or another. And the reason I’m even here is also his fault, so it should be fine to have him take responsibility for this.\nAfter I took a deep breath, I closed my eyes, and heightened my senses to a level I’d never felt before.\nThe negative soul beating within me stabilized. I have no Skill to take in everything around, like a Demon Lord’s Abyss Zone.\nBut my perception should be wider than any of those dime-a-dozen Demons out there. Despite this and that, Heard-san’s kidnapping/training did serve to strengthen me.\nMy five senses spread out into the surrounding air, and informed me of the world. My cold sweat fell to the ground in beads.\nAs if using that as a signal, I instantly started to grasp in the depths of my heart that I was indeed on hostile territory.\nIt was likely something like synesthesia. Not from my expanded five, but from a completely different sixth sense.\nSympathy.\nLike I was gazing into a mirror, and uncanny world reflected my own form back at me.\nThis town had already served its purpose. The reason for its scarcity of inhabitants was likely that as well.\nAnd it was likely… not by Heard-san’s hand.\nThis is… right. A long time past. My sense of discomfort started to change.\n“Hm… how useless…”\n“Hyah!!?”\nOn the voice that suddenly resounded behind me, I unintentionally let out a shameful cry.\nWhat entered my eyes was a man two heads higher than me.\nBlack hair, and black eyes. His overly arrogant expression was knit in obvious displeasure, enough to make my slight sentiment of wanting to meet up with him not too long ago flip over in an instant.\nWhat was there was definitely the one whose reunion I had been hoping for, a certain Heard Lauder.\nBut even right before me, his presence was surprisingly faint, and if I took my eyes off him again, I bet I’d lose him again.\nFor how long has he been behind me?\nThe reason my perception doesn’t catch anything likely isn’t Heard-san’s power.\nIt’s this air. This magic, that seems to hang over like a mist to cloak any and everything.\nOn that air, as if an unknown fear had been eating at the base of my feet, caused me to raise my voice.\n“W-what do you mean by useless? Heard-san?”\n“… Tsk, damn Egoist… as always, he’s a crafty one.”\nHeard-san didn’t turn his eyes the slightest bit in my direction, and merely lorded over the completely empty space. He wore the same grimace as always, but there was a slight color of conviction on it.\n… I wonder what this is about.\nWhen I was about to call out again, the blank space Heard-san had been staring at for a while suddenly began to warp.\nAnd as if attempting to muffle the scream I almost let out, a gloomy and broken voice shook the air.\n“Don’t… be like… that.”\nVanity the Egoist. Even taller than Heard-san, the mountainous man raised a roar.\nHis disposition was like he had been watching us from that exact spot the entire time, as he calmly looked down at the both of us. Behind him were numerous Demons with their faces covered in black masks. Their heights and bearings were various, but the platoon of Demons had a strange sense of uniformity.\nIt wasn’t… at some arbitrary point.\nThere was surely nothing there until a moment before. My eyesight isn’t bad. There’s no way I’d let pass an army of that size.\nThe abnormal situation made me begin to shiver.\nIt’s… not an illusion. There may be a high-level Luxuria Skill to reproduce this phenomenon, but this wasn’t something of that sort. Of all else, the power I felt from Vanity-san was definitely Superbia.\nIn that case, there’s a high chance it’s an ability of his subordinates, but for these numbers to be hiden away, it would be difficult for even a General.\nOf course, Medea-san Class was out of the question. And she wasn’t even Lust in the first place.\nHeard-san was calm enough to make one think he had expected all of this.\nHe calmly spat out his words.\n“So even after living a life long enough to erode at one’s memory, you’ll still favor underhanded tactic, Egoist?”\n“… Call it… what you will, Prideful Kaiser.”\nHe grinned.\nThe edges of Vanity-san’s lips did indeed rise, but is that really a smile?\nI raised my evaluation of Vanity-san a level. His appearance and contents didn’t connect. A mismatch. He was much too mysterious. Despite his robust body, he went for roundabout methods.\nFor a Demon carrying the same sin as me, he remained unidentified. The unknown was the greatest enemy of Pride.\nVanity-san’s and Heard-san’s powers clashed.\nNeither of them had moved a step. But I’m sure I felt their mana collide, and mingle.\nJust by standing here, I can feel a wind enough to make my body cower.\n“Where is the Devourer?”\n“That girl… went to… the Lord of Sloth.”\nThe Lord that governs Sloth.\nThose words could only indicate a single place in this vast world.\nLeigie Slaughterdolls. The world’s strongest slacker, and the existence I was born in order to serve.\nAnd at the same time, Heard-san’s birth parent.\nI haven’t heard the specifics, but at the very least, the Lazy King held a great importance to Heard-san.\nDid Vanity-san not know?\nNo, that’s not it. There’s no way that’s it.\nOtherwise… there’s no way he could stand so calmly before Heard-san’s blatant ill humor.\n“… You… bastard… so you knew from the start!?”\n“Of. Course.”\nA short sound rung through the air, and dust whirled into the air to accompany it.\nI immediately closed my eyes to handle it.\n“Wha… t…”\nVanity’s large build had slid back several meters. His large hand that was perhaps the size of my face saw spread open in front of him.\nThe scraped off portions of the road revealed bright red soil.\nFrom his upheld hand, smoke quietly started rising up the heavens.\nHeard-san was glaring at him with eyes as if to shoot him dead.\nI understood.\nHeard-san had released his fist, and Vanity-san had blocked. That’s all there was to it.\nBut that simple truth was enough to beat me down.\nThat can’t be… there’s someone out there that can stop the Prideful Kaiser, Heard Lauder’s fist…\n“You’re also… the same… incredible power.”\n“What’s your goal?”\nI can’t keep up with this.\nPlease don’t start conversing with your fists. I don’t understand that language.\nHis expression covered up with his audacity was simply quiet, and I couldn’t comprehend the feelings he held behind it.\n… Well, of course, I’m going to pretend to understand them…\nI thought for a moment, before raising a cheerful voice.\n“Heard-sann, Leigie-sama is undefeated.”\nThe greatest monster I had ever met in my lifetime was not Heard-san, but Leigie-sama.\nHeard-san was a monster in strength, but completely irrelevant to that, Leigie-sama’s existence was incomprehensible. If I had to say, he was like a deity. Just his existence made me feel awe.\nEven when I’ve only ever see him sleeping…\nSince he’d already taken down Heard-san once, for argument’s sake, I cannot think of a single one to win against Leigie-sama, and of course, the one who already faced an unsightly defeat at his hands, Zebul-san, is out of the question…\n“Hm… I know.”\n“Of. Course.”\nUnexpectedly, both Heard-san and Vanity-san nodded as if that fact were natural.\nI don’t really get why everyone has such a high evaluation of that man when all he does is sleep, but it’s likely that’s just the way this world works.\nStill, that makes the reason Vanity-san kept quiet about even harder to comprehend. There’s not a single merit for him in luring Heard-san here.\nAt that moment, as if the Egotistic Lord had read my thoughts, he warped his mouth into what was, this time, undoubtedly a smile.\nA hoarse voice. He included in some sarcastic mimicry towards a sincere tone, and what was there was clearly malice, and at the same time, his will.\nHis arm that likely had a width three times mine pointed up towards the sky.\nHis thunderous voice resounded through the unnaturally quiet town scape.\n“Like I care about the Devourer… My enemy is… heaven. Alone.”\nAs if it were waiting for those very words, a heavy wind blew.\nThe heavy deep-blue clouds covering up the sky split.\nWhat remained was… a pure white light.\nCountless strings of light poured through to sever the Demon World’s red moon, and I witnessed a scene I could not believe.\nHeard-san made a rare display of gritting his teeth into a sour expression… with eyes full of malice, he looked towards the sky.\n“Vanity… bastard…”\n“Fu….”\nThe light danced.\nI could only watch it in a daze.\nAngel.\nThe natural enemies of us Demons, and the souls that dwelled in the heavenly realm.\nClad in shining garments of pure white, with large wings sprouting from their backs… their Heavenly Wings caught the wind, and let them race through the open air.\nOf course, even I’ve at least seen an Angel before.\nBut… the number was different.\nEven as I watched, the sky continued to clear, and the whole story was made true.\nA single cloud still hung, but it was clear enough. Their numbers weren’t just a hundred or two.\nI bit down on my quivering lip. As if a silk thread had been strung around my neck, my instincts began to suffocate me.\nI had a clear understanding of it.\nI was… scared of ‘them.’\n“Kusu kusu… why, at a place like this, so many Angels…”\nThe opposite entity from Demons.\nI naturally put an arm over the other to hide my own trembling.\nThe spectacle I observed for the first time was truly deserving to be called a miracle of god.\nThe Angels were his vanguard. Unlike Demons, that would never remain bound to any single entity, they held on to the will of the heavens.\nThe will to bring ruin to all of us.\nStanding at the front of such an army was an Angel with conspicuously more luxurious attire. While the others had a single pair of wings on their back, that lone Angel had two sets.\nIt was only for a moment, but those cold eyes without a fragment of self-consciousness, definitely captured us.\n“…”\nI could clearly see the difference in power. Regardless of how far apart we were in distance, it was more than clear enough to me.\nWithout a doubt, if she were a Demon, she would be Demon Lord Class.\nThere, I recalled the name Kanon-san had presented as the meeting’s agenda.\nThe Valkyrie of the Silver Blue who acted to take down the Demon Lords all together.\n“Could it be, that’s… Serge Serenade…!?”\n“Kuku…”\nVanity-san stifled his own laugh.\nIt was only the span of a blink that their eyes met. But to me, it felt like several minutes. My cold sweat shows no signs of stopping.\nBut as if to say that he didn’t have interest in Serge anymore, he changed his field of vision.\nTo the horizon extending over the Dark Prison.\nHis mouth bent a little, and he formed up a slight grin.\n“Heard-san, t-that is…”\nI informed Heard-san, who continued to look up at the Angels with a grim expression.\nAt around the same time, Serge’s heavenly wings flapped grandly.\nIt was a white light.\nDisplaying a sudden extreme acceleration, the Angel’s body left a white afterimage in the sky as it disappeared. To accompany that, the other countless angels began to race through the sky without the slightest sound.\nIt wasn’t towards us.\nNot to Grey Rock, where two Demon Lords of Pride had gathered.\nTo the land that was once ruled by the Demon Lord of Sloth… to the Castle of Shadows.\n“So this is… the reason you lured me out.”\n“My enemy… is… heaven. Alone.”\nLetting out something that sounded a little like an answer, Vanity-san raised his right hand.\nFrom all over the town, from the shadows scattered here and there, numbers upon numbers of masked soldiers started to appear. It was as if they had just come to being at this moment, Vanity-san’s presence-less Legion.\nAdding on the ones who were there from the start, it was a considerable force. Even after seeing that number of Angels, their gestures showed not the least bit of unrest.\nVanity-san looked down at Heard-san. As if he were evaluating him.\n“Kuku… Prideful Kaiser… go forth, if you must.”\n“… Tsk…”\nIf you were to compare Demons and Angel, the greatest differing trait would be mobility.\nHeavenly Wings granted Angels air speed rivalling that of flying dragons. It was something an average Demon wouldn’t be able to follow so easily.\nVanity’s Legion was likely the same. Especially for high ranking Angels with experience on the battlefield like Serge, no normal Demon would be able to catch up.\nBut here, we had an extraordinary Demon.\nThe Lord of Pride, left behind by the passage of time.\nThe decision was instantaneous.\nHeard-san’s body blurred for a moment, before a kick jutted out at Vanity-san’s bald head.\nThe ground shook greatly, and fragments scattered all over.\nBlood danced around the air, and with a single wet sound, brown cuts of meat fell to the ground.\nI grimaced at the terrible spectacle. I picked off a piece of meat stuck to my apron, and let it fall to the ground.\nWhat was once Vanity-san was now left in ruin. With the attack against Schitol-san, her soul core still remained, but even that wasn’t left within the wreckage. It was likely thoroughly smashed.\nPerhaps they were at a loss for words, as Vanity-san’s subordinates remained silent as they watched the blood.\nI averted my face, waiting for the end of it.\nI’m not sure what he was thinking, but… kusu kusu.\n… It’s because you tried to look down on our Heard-san…\nHe can’t stand being made fun of. And I’m the same as Heard-san in that regard.\nThat’s why it was natural for Vanity-san to die.\nWith a bored expression, the perpetrator of all of this trampled over the bloody mess, and said but two words.\n“… We’re going…”\n“Yes. Will you be using the flying dragon?”\n“No need.”\nOf course. His feet are faster after all.\nStepping on the ground, Heard-san’s form vanished in an instant. Ah, he’s gone…\nThere really is such a thing as way too fast.\nWell, if he’s not going to use it, I guess I will.\nIt’ll probably be impossible to catch up with those Angels on this dragon, But as long as Heard-san’s there, there will be no role for me even if I do end up catching up.\nThen it would be more useful for me to simulate what to do, and how to appear on my reunion with Leigie-sama.\n“Yes, yes, please move aside…”\nI passed through the pitiful army that continued to stand frozen in silence, and headed for the flying dragon, as I thought to myself.\nOneechan, I wonder what you’re doing right around now… well, you’re probably the same as always, taking care of Leigie-sama… you’re probably carrying out the exact same routine you’ve been doing for the past few thousand years.\nDear Oneechan,\nYeah… it’s all gone to hell here, but know that I’m doing fine.\nPlease put in as much needless effort as you so desire.\nI will, in you guys’ place, Overrule everything.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 5: Ira’s Resentment, Part 1: How Sad it Must be\n“Oh… what beautiful crimson hair… this child will surely become a fine wielder of Ira.”\nA large face with numerous wrinkles carved into it peered at me.\nHis height was twice my own, and it was likely that even if I squeezed out every ounce of mana in my body, my power wouldn’t even reach his feet.\nAmong the ruling Demons, he was a being with supreme power. With awe in their voices, those around him referred to him as such…\n『Demon Lord』\nAnd even among them, this man’s might made him a Demon Lord amongst Demon Lords.\nHe was a rare Great Demon King within this warring era, who even survived through the battles with heaven.\nFels Crowne.\nHis name was Fels Crowne, of 『Deceit』.\nHe was a wire-like man.\nHis thin stature was likely not graced by anything like muscles, and he had a characteristically kind expression one would think to be unthinkable of Superbia.\nBut even so, Fels was a long-lived Demon Lord.\n… Even if that glory was a thing of the past.\n“Ira… if you have that power, than perhaps you’ll even be able to unify the Demon World someday.”\nWhile making light of all the other Demon Lords, but that being a case, the King who sat at the summit for much too long was already tired.\nDesire wasn’t infinite. That’s why, while we didn’t originally possess lifespans, there are times when a longer life is the very reason for a decline in power.\nHe was severe, and vile, and merciless enough to earn the word 『Deceit』 in his name, and yet the one who had continued to pursue his desire all alone, the Lord Fels Crowne, was already dead.\nOnly because of his strong power, did he continue to sit on the Great Demon King’s throne.\nMeaning in the end, that was the extent of his caliber.\nHis lukewarm bearing was enough to make me bear resentment just by looking at him, and yet, he was always nothing but kind to me.\nEnough to make my Wrath grow hazy.\nIt was a tale of a time in the distant past, but even now, it remains vivid in my memory.\nI would intently gaze up at his stagnant eyes, and wait for the next words to escape his mouth. And to me, the Great Demon King dropped to a severely dark tone.\nThe young me understood.\nThat was likely the reason an ordinary man like Fels was able to climb to the seat of Great Demon King.\n“But this rate isn’t going to work out… we require the power of Leigie of Sloth, I guess…”\n“Leigie… of Sloth?”\nUnable to comprehend Fels Crowne… father’s words, I tilted my head, and he gave a grand nod, as if he had suddenly nodded off.\nOnly his silver pair of eyes continued to let off a dull light.\nI’m not sure how much time had passed. Perhaps it was an instant, or perhaps there had been a space of several minutes of silence.\nThe Great Demon King slowly opened his mouth.\n“Kanon. Henceforth… take up the name Ira Lord…”\n“Ira… lawd?”\nIt was a name much too full of pride. I was a freshly born Demon, and I hadn’t even gotten to Knight Class.\nBut Father seemed quite certain of it. That I was to become a Lord of Ira.\nDeceit was an accumulation of fiction.\nThe nature of Fels Crowne was to remove what existed, and build existence out of nothing.\nThat’s why me understanding the meaning of those words required the span of the next few thousand years.\nEven if there are many who know my name, there are few who know its meaning.\nThe Castle of Shadows.\nIt was a palace, where even the shadows slept silently.\nThe ramparts that extended beyond the horizon was merely boorish, and its size rose great enough to befit the term, ‘towering above.’ The fortress of a Demon Lord.\nThe Lord of Sloth was to refer to a Demon Lord who forged himself in depravity.\nThis peerlessly vast Castle of Shadows was nothing more than that Lord’s bedroom.\nHis subordinates, whose numbers surpassed the thousands, existed for nothing more than to protect his sleep.\nHeard Lauder. Boasting a rare kind of power, he was a Pride Demon who would never prostrate himself before anyone.\n“Hm… Kanon… Iralaude, is it? Useless… do what you will.”\nThe strange Demons who held no higher directive than to attend to the ambitionless Lord.\n“Kanon Iralaude… well, as long as you don’t try to disturb his sleep, then…”\nActing on an incomprehensible principle, the way of life of these Demons I had no way of grasping was something I had never witnessed before, and they delivered a bit of an impact to my mentality, but that was blown away when I saw the Lord himself. Blown all away.\nEven now, I can recall it clearly.\nThe quiet air covering the entire fortress, and the black door, an incarnation of darkness.\nOn the other side of the door I had opened to introduce myself, the Lord simply whispered to himself alone.\n… I’m kinda tired…\nHe didn’t seem to pay any mind to me, as I was taken up in silence, as the jet-black haired man directed his dead eyes towards vacant space.\nThe Lord of Sloth.\nLeigie the Depraved. The sole Demon accepted to have pursued the foundation of Acedia to its limits, an ancient Demon.\nAs if he were the air, he lacked a distinct feel to him, but just by existing before my eyes, the vast amount of Magic you could even call absurd was clearly something extraordinary, even from the eyes of a fledgling like me, and he had much too less of a will.\nIt was such that even when I compared it to the preposterously high power of my father, I could quite distinctly tell that it was much, much higher.\nAt a single glance, I could tell by intuition.\nAh, so this is… the man who crushed a Great Demon King by merely being there.\nNo offense, or defense, but mere existence.\nNo charisma, or fighting spirit, or even intent, but power alone he possessed. If you call one who’s thoroughly learned their Sin a Lord, then… yes, I see, he is surely worthy of being a Lord of Sloth.\nThere was status, and honor, and then, there was a gathering of Demons that showed no interest in either of the two.\nEven I, having seen all the Demon Lords that came to kneel before father, found that lifestyle to be exceedingly rare, and it invited on my anger.\nThese Demons… just what are they searching for in life?\nEven when, as Demons, they possess power great enough to warrant the envy of others.\nThe haves, and the have nots. Talent can be cruel. The gap between my father, whose wrinkles grew deeper with age, and the one who came on as youthful after living an even greater amount of rime was more than clear, and for some reason, it irritated me.\nAnd my father that brought me here, with nothing but a worn-out expression, pleaded to that Lord with a single sentence.\nTo the Lord who, while he wasn’t even doing anything, had an expression much more worn-out than father.\nThose words were, quite likely, not what a Great Demon King was to address to his subordinates.\n“Leigie… I’ll leave my daughter to you.”\nI didn’t known the resolve or weight behind his words.\nBut the Lord of Sloth gave a response anyways.\nHe let only his face out from beneath the blankets, and the slovenly tone he answered in held no ambition. I couldn’t see a fragment of the makings of a Lord in him.\n“… Just do whatever you want. It’s not like I’m the one who’ll be attending to her anyways.”\nThe compensation he paid for his power was… depravity.\nA man adorned with the polar opposite of the anger that fueled Ira.\nChange and stagnation. Perhaps precisely because they were opposites, that a principle exist in them to heighten one’s Wrath.\nFather likely saw through that.\nWhile staring at Leigie’s lifeless eyes, I frantically tried to think of the meaning behind father’s will, and unable to think of anything, what entered my eyes as they turned up to father expectantly, were dark eyes of nihilism.\nIf another were to see his spiritless expression, they likely would have evaluated it as not falling short of the Lord of Sloth.\nAs young as I was, his speech delivered a considerable shock to me.\n“Kanon… introduce yourself. He is the lone one to have spent his eternity in solitude. In this endlessly vast Demon world, the sole… Lazy King.”\nHe pushed my back, and I took a step forward.\nBut I was still frantically thinking.\nHis recklessness. The intent of the aged Great Demon King.\nEven before the Great Demon King, the eyes of the Lord who didn’t pay any mind to it in the slightest, were horridly muddled.\nAnd oddly enough, that was the vey answer to the question of, ‘for what sake is he living?’ I had thought the first moment I met him.\nThere was no meaning in this man’s life. No goal. No reason.\nHis life that couldn’t be worn by any other Demon Lord was the cruel meaning behind the solitude my father spoke of.\nJust how sad a thing must it be?\nThat was the first time I felt an emotion opposite to resentment.\nJust as father said, I lightly raised the edges of my skirt in the gesture that had been thoroughly beaten into me, and gave a polite bow.\nI didn’t feel anyone’s eyes on me. Even while his pupils were directed ahead, this man wasn’t looking at me.\nHe must be staring at whatever he does every day.\n“Kanon Iralaude. The Sin I govern is Wrath. I’ll be in your care, um…”\nI hesitated for a moment.\nLeigie-sama? No, as the daughter of the Great Demon King, it’s unthinkable for me to use such an honorary title for another.\nLeigie…san? That sounds too reserved. It doesn’t settle right.\nShould I just drop the honorific? No, he’s someone father spoke up to this extent. He must be deserving of some respect.\nBeing left with him meant that we would be becoming family.\nI already have a father. But let that be the case, there’s no way this one’s little brother material.\nThe hesitation was only an instant. With as much affection as I could muster, and, with Wrath backing my tone, I called that name… the pitiful name of the Lord o Depravity.\n“… Leigie-niisama.”\nThat was likely the starting point.\nAnd I, in the long life that followed… in spending a timeframe much longer than that which tormented my father before me, I came to know the significance of the Lazy King’s name.\nBut no matter how much time passed by, niisama was to stay as niisama.\nAnd as if he were in hibernation, the way he would never leave the Castle of Shadows, was never to change.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 5: Ira’s Resentment, Part 2: There Wasn’t a Single Decent Person in my Army\n“—–sama, ——sama?”\nMy auditory sense received a jolt, and my consciousness was pulled together once more.\nThe voice I heard at regular intervals sounded quite nostalgic for some reason.\nLight entered my field of vision.\nI held my head, and let my eyes scan the area. It was the same place as always.\nThe throne room of the Palace of Rending Flames. While it held the same mold as that of the one in the Castle of Shadows, the Great Demon King’s throne was soaked in a completely different atmosphere.\nAt that place where many Kings of History had entrusted themselves, I awakened.\n“Kanon-sama? What seems to be the matter!?”\n“… Yeah… don’t worry about it. Just… I was just reminiscing a little bit.”\n‘Twas a failure. It seems I had sunk too deep into thought.\n“Y-yes… if that’s all it is, then…”\nThe one looking at me with some doubt was my right hand Demon.\nLize Bloodcross. A Demon of Wrath like me, and a woman that somewhat reminded my of my past self.\nPerhaps’t that’s why.\nOf all things, I sent an inexperienced Lize to Leigie-niisama’s side.\nPerhaps when father left me to him long ago, he experienced a feeling like what I feel as well. There’s no way to find out at this point.\nThe Lord of Sloth has no enemies. There’s no way niisama, who doesn’t even take any action, could bear animosity towards anyone.\nHaving power surpassing her age, the mildly unstable Lize was able to gain fine control over her emotions due to niisama’s influence. Rather than stating it as a report on her progress, perhaps it is simply an inevitability.\nBecause niisama has quite a lot of experience…\n“Good grief, those Demon Lords are the same as always.”\n“Yeah… but that can’t be helped. It’s precisely because they’re like that.”\nI brought together the Demon Lords strong in Sin. It’s natural for there to be a level of friction between them.\nIt’s proof that the Great Demon Kings of old bent a large variety of powers to their whim.\nAnd I’m the same.\nI gathered together the wielders of all sorts of desire. I was more than prepared to be surrounded by potential traitors the moment I became Great Demon King.\nTemperament. Wisdom. Brute force. Charisma.\nThe only thing those guys didn’t heed was… authority.\nAnd at the same time, with them following me to that extent… I can’t have them lose their powers, and fall to some Angel, or the like.\n“But… as I thought, Schitol went too far… to snatch from an allied soldier before my very eyes…”\n“… Ah, Medea…”\nIt was only natural that a Greed Demon’s power depended on material possessions. Therefore, their basic battle power wasn’t all too high.\nHowever, that Demon Lord had, of all things, chosen ‘Bodies’ as her target of desire. I haven’t the slightest idea what caused her to develop such a craving, but the power she possessed could likely easily pierce a Demon Lord’s body.\nShe was truly a troublesome Demon.\nAnd there’s that personality of hers…\nAll the Lords had quite picky personalities, but even among them, she was top class in being hard to handle.\nMedea Luxeliaheart was a considerable Demon.\nI never thought she would be thrown into the army when niisama randomly picked her up, and I hadn’t the slightest notion that she would even reach General Class.\nBut even so, before Demon Lords, there was much too great a gap in quality.\n“Looking at it from another perspective, could it be our luck that it ended with Medea alone…?”\n“… Well, there’s some truth to that… but it sure has been a while since a casualty came up at a conference.”\nOf course, if you mix together so many strong poisons, the damage to the surroundings is nothing small.\nBut at the same time, in this land swirling with various strong desires, they did hold the strength to show off their mettle, so it’s not like they’re to be killed off so easily.\nIf you want to look to the current trend, then most casualties don’t arrive during the meeting, but from the aftermath, and it wasn’t the Demon Lords themselves, but everyone around them.\n“W-well, Medea was just a double, so…”\nLize let out a mournful sigh.\nIt must be painful to witness the Demon she dragged out be killed like that.\nTruly, it may have been thoughtless to drag the girl over here.\nI never should have compared her to Heard Lauder, who had always attended these conferences in niisama’s place.\nMedea and Heard’s careers were different. Even if I was the one who ordered it, for her to have an insurance plan known as illusions… well, perhaps she was killed so easily due to the resultant negligence, but anyways, I should commend her for coming out in the first place.\nI extinguished a cinder that as set alight in some corner of my head with a sigh.\nTo cover that up, I directed my eyes to Lize.\n“As I’ve told you before, Lize, I’ll leave the role of reporting to Leigie to you.”\n“Yes, understood.”\nLize’s figure as she gave her affirmation overlapped with my own form of the past, and for some reason, it gave me an excessively lonely feeling.\nI shook my head to deny that. Such sentiment is unnecessary to my Wrath. Nothing will change from harboring such a feeling.\n“But, Kanon-sama… whatever the case, I doubt there is anyone out there to target Leigei of Sloth.”\n“Oh… why is that?”\n“I mean, for the Lord of Sloth… there’s absolutely no reason to aim for his head, is there? Back when his territory was vast was one thing, but right now, Leigie Slaughterdolls has nothing but the Castle of Shadows… he doesn’t even have an army. Attacking Leigie will not earn anyone any status or fame.”\n“… That’s… right. Truly, by assaulting niisama, there’s nothing to be gained.”\nBut, still…\nAs long as he doesn’t take any active action, as long as keeps his hand from the world, as long as he stays holed up in his room, can he truly isolate himself from all else?\nCan he merely sleep peacefully without receiving any evaluation from anyone?\nNo.\nPower is justice. Without doing anything, he spent his long lifetime, and like the sweet smell of a nepenthes, the vast power he cultivated would draw Demons to him.\nNaturally, his obligations increase. That’s something that can’t be helped.\nThe ice he lowered on the world must have been a manifestation of the sentiment he was always been building up. How repulsing, and sorrowful.\nBecause of his very being, the Lord of Depravity is not permitted to gain a single thing in life.\nBack in my own element, I gave more orders to Lize.\n“Vanity’s report is… also uncertain. A Lord of Angels, and Zebul the Devourer, even if this land is constantly astir with turmoil, the timing is much too convenient. What’s more, that man isn’t one to trust.”\nVanity the Egoist’s words were soaked in deceit.\nSuperbia was largely divided into two categories.\nThose like Heard Lauder, who gained Pride in their own ability.\nAnd those like Vanity Seidthroan, who boasted not of their power, and used wit to accomplish their pride.\nThat was Pride of the same type as father’s.\n“He’s scheming something here.”\nAs that man’s daughter, I understood.\nThat sort of Demon Lord was the most dangerous factor to the King’s seat.\nI see, compared to all the others prostrated before me, that Lord is quite an irregular. I mean, I cannot see a clear form of desire in him.\nBut still, I didn’t think that the man was telling a lie. High ranking Lords could generally see through most lies on the spot.\nIf he were to report a falsehood, what merit would be in it for Vanity? Even if he may be Rank four, he’s not able to contest my Ira, and also, even if his report were to be a lie, that would just put Heard against him.\n“… The truth of the matter aside, if the Devourer truly was defeated, yet managed to survive… then her destination will be niisama’s side.”\n“…”\nLong lived Demon Lords cared not for victory, but were stubborn in defeat.\nZebul Glaucus was known for her exceedingly high offensive power, and brutal nature. I’m not sure how long she’s lived for, but I doubt she has much experience in failure.\nI folded a leg atop the other above the cold throne.\nI felt a burning power from my prided long staff clasped in my right hand. As if to manifest the submerged anger in the depths of my heart.\nAs if it were eagerly awaiting for me to release power through it once more.\n“Hm… I don’t think that niisama will lose, and… I can’t think that Heard will let her escape either.”\nI mean, Zebul has already lost to niisama once.\nNo matter how heinous she may be, it would be difficult for her to oppose both niisama and Heard, with their exceedingly high powers.\n“… Y-yes. Heard Lauder has already departed from this land. If it’s that Lord, then perhaps there’s no need to worry.”\n“What an impatient man… but so be it.”\nEven if there’s no defeat to be found, I can’t let such a trifling matter disturb niisama’s sleep.\nIn that case, there would have been no reason for me to take his rank and land and army. Heard should know that fact as well.\nHeard Lauder’s power was undoubtedly top class within my army. I hated dealing with that man as a child, but when he’s my subordinate, he makes himself quite useful. Especially how he could roam as he pleased in this wide world that was hard to span even on a dragon. His agility like that of a clap of thunder was that man’s nature. It’s almost impossible to run away from him.\nThe more and more I thought, the more sighs came from my mouth. If he’d only actually listen to my orders for once, I wonder just how much my Demon World unification plans would have hastened.\n“Good grief, the world just turns about as it pleases.”\nAnd that will likely never end.\nEven from the past… he was that sort of man.\nHaving spent many years alongside those niisamas of mine, they were my… bane.\nIf I became negligent, then even my desire would weather away.\nA scene of a few thousand years past came up again, and I shook my head to rid myself of it.\n“Well, fine. The main issue is that Valkyrie. Lize, I’ll assign you the duty of informing Heard of what we have on her.”\n“… Yeah, he did leave before anything was said…”\nLike that, just how does he plan on chasing after Serge…\nDemon World unification is being held up by the existence of a single lone Valkyrie. How troublesome.\nAnd sending representative to them rarely has any effect on those Demon Lords.\n“But, even so, it’s already the end.”\nIn the end, there’s but one opponent. Because of her mobility, we were having a problem getting our hands on her, but as long as we know her location, taking her out is all too easy.\nThis is the Demon world. A land of dark miasma governed by fiends.\nThe miracle of God, those heavenly wings cannot fly too far through this abyss.\nWe’ll have to pound that fact into those foolish Angels.\n“Right?”\n“Yes, it is as you will it.”\nWith intoxicated eyes, the man who was standing behind me immediately kneeled.\nHe was the inspector Demon dispatched to the late Rank Seven, Ciel Afreide.\nWhile the Lord was killed, my eyes on him remained alive. No, that alone is part of the role of an observer.\nIt was the end of her luck when she chose a Demon Lord of Envy to assault.\nThe observer’s intoxicated eyes, which would never stop envying all of existence, Angels included, had surely captured the Valkyrie’s form.\nAn Envy Demon’s nature was highly geared towards information. After being caught in the eyes of Envy, that girl was nothing more than a butterfly in a spider’s web.\nLize furrowed her brow in a sort of wonder, and began timidly probing through my eyes.\n“… So where is Serge of the Silver Blue…?”\n“Ah, what a girl… silvery white hair, and cyan eyes, wings of pure light, and… her strength, everything about her was simply beautiful. How does that lass manage to live such a vivid life!? Kuku, it’s a pity she’s to be destroyed… and at the same time, what a wondrous day it is. That I can witness the death of such a beautiful Angel with these very eyes!”\nHis figure took on a form of joy, as if to express the ecstasy running through his entire body, and Lize’s expression cramped up a little.\nFor her to make a disgusted expression at something of this level, is she not thrown about by her emotions a little too much?\nWell, when you’re by niisama’s side, these sort of stimulus seem quite distant. Should I go dispatch her off to some repulsive Demon Lord for a time…\nIf this is enough to disturb her, she’ll never be a Lord.\nI prodded the man with my staff to return him to his senses.\nFinally noticing the phrase, ‘these very eyes,’ and understanding their intent, Lize blinked a few times.\n“… Report.”\n“Yes, that Valkyrie is, at present… racing about the skies over red soil. From the Crimson Prison to the Dark Prison… at the speed of the wind.”\nIn this area, there’s no land soaked in such black magic besides the Dark Prison.\nWith an Invidia Demon’s 『Envy Eye』 Skill, it wasn’t possible to find exact location, but if we had the general idea, then the rest was simple.\nIf they enter a zone, then the Lord could likely tell their location. That white aura of theirs was like a splotch of white on a canvas painted black, and it really stood out.\n“But it’s the Crimson Prison… again.”\nThe Crimson Prison.\nRuled by Vanity Seidthroan, a scorching wasteland.\nThat land wasn’t an important strategic point in any way, and the population of Demons in it wasn’t high. The army size was also standard.\nIt’s not worthy of being the first land attacked by Angels in such a long time. I mean, their goal is to eliminate as many Demons as possible.\nBut as of late, problems have surfaced there one after another.\nThe appearance of a Saint Lord.\nThe appearance of Zebul.\nAnd, now a report of Serge.\n“Hmm…”\nI thought back to the General Class Demon who stopped by the Palace of Rending Flames to give a report on the Angels just the other day.\nWhile he was General Class, he was a seasoned veteran who had crossed many a battlefield.\n『Abnormal』\nThat’s what the man had said.\nA Greed Demon given a reward was one of the few trustworthy entities in all of these lands.\nIs this a coincidence?\nFather… Fels Crowne was, rather than military arts, skilled in his insight. That was likely something that couldn’t be avoided to carry out his Deceit.\nThat’s why there must be some meaning behind this trend.\nFather treated everything in his surroundings as part of his work, but to me alone, he was kind.\nEven if that was just him considering profit and loss…\nShould the Egoist be trusted or not?\nVanity does heed to my orders, but it’s not like he’s loyal or anything. From the start, his nature was opposed to devotion.\nBut the vanguard of God… those entities called Angels weren’t ones who would let themselves be manipulated by any form of Demon so easily. Zebul was a monster who could have eaten the man the moment they met.\nEven if someone was plotting something, it would be too much a risk for the Egoist to play his hand.\nHeard Lauder is strong.\nBut against two opponents, the Devourer and the Valkyrie, can he possibly come out victorious?\nIt’s unlikely that he’ll encounter them simultaneously, but his power should fall the more he uses it up. That doesn’t change regardless of how much of it he’s stored up.\nHeard was niisama’s formed right hand man. It’s an impossible notion, but in the million to one chance he’s destroyed, niisama might actually be saddened. At that time, I’ll have to be prepared for the entire Demon World to be frozen over again.\nSo perhaps I should send in some reinforcements.\n『Always foresee the worst outcome. Reality will always exceed that.』\nFather’s teachings floated up in my head.\nBut even if I were to send backup, the Rank Two and Rank Three Demon Lords bear resentment against Heard Lauder, and the chances are higher that he’ll actually suffer an attack from behind.\nSince Zebul was removed, Rank Five has yet to be filled, and with his nature, Rank Six is unlikely to even hear out my orders.\nAs the Great Demon King, I can’t have myself go out personally.\nThere wasn’t a single decent person in my army.\n“? What seems to be the matter?”\n“Hmm… no, I was just considering whether to play another card or not.”\n“To send reinforcements? Is Heard Lauder insufficient for the task?”\nLize’s question was on the mark.\nEven back when he was a General, Heard boasted exceptional power, but that was brought even further to the limit when he became a Lord. If it’s that man, then perhaps he could even rend the earth with his bare hands.\nI’m sure he’s the greatest master in my army. If you think about it logically reinforcements would be unnecessary.\nMy dispatches to the Demon Lords haven’t been recalled, and if I sent out those numerous ones below General Class to a fight between Lord Class entities, they’d be there for no purpose but to make noise.\nI scrutinize over the incessant notions passing through my head, and reached a conclusion.\n… I’m being a little… too cautious.\nI’ve not the leisure to leave my own subordinates on standby.\nAt that point, Lize furrowed her brow, and muttered.\n“But… truly, even if Heard is not to face defeat… there’s the possibility he might let them slip past. Once they’ve entered the Dark Prison’s territory, the Castle of Shadows isn’t too far away…”\nCastle of Shadows… niisama?\n… Right, if they’ve already entered that land, then with Heavenly Wings, the Castle was but a stone’s throw away.\nBut just because she entered the Dark Prison, that doesn’t mean that Serge is set to head for the Castle of Shadows.\nI decided.\n“Lize, prepare a Dragon. We’re off to the Dark Prison.”\n“… Huh? Wai… Kanon-sama, you’re going out personally?”\nThere’s no time.\nThe Palace of Rending Flames, the Castle of Shadows, and the land of the Crimson Prison were lined up in a straight path. If I set out immediately, there’s a chance I’ll arrive in time.\nI glared at Lize, who remained in a daze.\n“Exactly. Now on with it!”\n“Y-yes! Understood!”\nI gripped my staff strongly, and stood up.\nIn times beyond memory, when there was nothing but darkness in this desolate world, the Dark God was said to have passed this instrument to the Great Demon King. With my desire as its fuel, it gave out a steady pulse like a heart.\nThe feelings that came with my impatience circulated around my veins. Like the starting of an engine, heat began to spread through my body.\nValkyrie… Valkyrie, is it?\nTo stand before me, before niisama, how reckless must she be?\nTo try to slay Leigie of Sloth after killing off a measly Demon Lord or two is simply outrageous.\nWell, well, well, I guess there’s no helping him.\nI, Kanon will protect your peaceful rest, dear niisama.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 5: Ira’s Resentment, Part 3: I am a Coward\nRage up, my flame.\nMy resentment shall birth dark flames greater than the cauldrons of hell, to do the Devil’s work of reducing the universe to ash.\nYou unsightly insects fluttering about the skies, before my ambition, you hindrances are all no greater than flies.\nThe heavens that looked down on the red blazing sun were simply high, and a realm beyond the reach from us beings forced to crawl along the ground.\nBut that’s how it should be. That’s why it’s perfect.\nTo us, wings are… unnecessary.\nWe don’t need those white bonds that tied us down to some inept God.\nThis lightless soil is the land we shall rule.\n“You all will learn the meaning of that soon enough.”\nI’ll have them regret setting foot here in jest. I’ll carve it into those bodies, those wings.\nOtherwise… I won’t be able to feel satisfied.\nA flying dragon’s wings ranked equal to those of an Angel’s in speed.\nBoasting the greatest influence across these lands, my steed was faster than any ordinary dragon you’d find out there.\nBecause of the wind, there was quite a bit of turbulence atop the dragon. From up here, sitting on the gliding beast, that was letting off rough breaths from its nose in excitement, the boundary that marked the territory of Heaven felt horribly close.\nWhat my ancestors… no, what me and my ancestos yearned for, a world of light.\nIt’s not that I don’t understand that sentiment.\nThis faint malaise I feel in my soul core, simply by looking up at the sky. That was probably… aspiration.\nEven when it’s been less than ten thousand years since I first came to be, I could feel it. For those Demon Lords of old, forced to look up at it for hundreds of thousands of years, their yearning must be much greater than I.\nBut at present, I held no interest in such a thing.\nThere’s no guarantee that dazzling light is capable of bringing about any change to us. Just as it’s not certain our darkness will drop one to depravity.\nI knew that all too well.\nThat’s why, it’s likely that even if some Great Demon King of old had managed to subjugate that world up there, I doubt anything would have changed.\nSitting aboard a flying dragon a little smaller than the oversized one I took as a steed, Lize sat with a grim expression as she flew to my lower left.\nIt’s been several of tens of minutes since we first entered the Dark Prison.\nIn this land constantly bathed by silence, while there still wasn’t a touch of sound, there was an unrest the likes of which the land had yet to see before.\nIt wasn’t by much, but niisama’s perception from his 『Abyss Zone』 was vaster than mine.\nMy zone was currently encompassing approximately three fourths of the Dark Prison’s vast land. I probed through the contents of that without leaving a stone unturned.\nThrough concentrating on all the faint traces of information I picked up, my head began to hurt.\nBut I can tell. I can see it clearly.\nThe presences of all shapes and sizes gathered around this land.\nApart from the countless irritating forces adorning the sky, there were three large powers. By size, there was no doubt they were Demon Lord Class, and for three powers of that extent to be in such close proximity was usually something that never came to be.\nOne of them was definitely clad in light. With the presence tracing the sky, and the flock following its lead, an overwhelming amount of divinity was being released.\nEven if this isn’t heaven, that would be quite a debilitating factor.\nThe other two were ones I knew.\nTwo simple ones faithful to their sinful desire. At the summit of the Demons that governed the Demon World, two Lords of Demons.\n『The Prideful Kaiser』, Heard Lauder.\n『The Devourer』, Zebul Glaucus.\nThey were the presences of two Lords top class in this Demon world.\nWith those two presences at the center, the air sunk. Just by being there, their massive souls caused the world to creak and grate.\nStrangely enough, both of them were specialized in attack, and their power transcended that of the other Demon Lords. In this den of beasts and monsters, their power that didn’t permit pursuit was much greater than any of the divinity coming down from above.\nThe level of power of Angels and Demons were decided by the souls embedded in their bodies.\nWith Heard and Zebul, the gap between them and the Angel was close to double.\nWhile it’s not like the quantity of power directly correlates with battle ability, that gap wasn’t something to be overturned so easily.\nHeard might be able to settle this with one hand.\nThen was my anxiety unfounded?\nDefinitely… not.\nThe fact I can sense them means that they can sense my location as well.\nHeard was a given. Also Zebul, and likely, the enemy Angel.\nOn all those forces swarming towards the Castle of Shadows like moths to a flame, I remembered a scalding crimson emotion, which I frantically clenched my teeth to contain.\n“They’ve stepped a little too far out of line… of all things, to set foot in the Dark Prison…”\nLize’s prediction was correct.\nThe Angel’s destination was undoubtedly the Castle of Shadows.\nI felt that my own decision wasn’t wrong.\nThere would be nothing I could do if I sent a representative, and they were to fail.\nThe Castle of Shadows was the Lord of Sloths bedroom, and his coffin.\nI won’t allow a single one to set foot in there.\nI remembered niisama’s eyes when I last saw him a year ago. All he wished for was a quiet rest.\n“We sure are… foolish…”\nAs ones with power, we cannot help but attract stronger ones to us.\nWhen I think of such a trifle disturbing niisama’s rest, along with a helpless feeling, I felt the sensation of my gut being burned through weighing me down. It was an emotion I’m sure I‘d learned to control before.\nThe flying dragon raised a low voice, and tis body swayed greatly. On the smell of something burning, I finally noticed that my own Ira was inflicting damage onto my steed.\nWith that small voice I hear below me compared to the beast’s large build, I can’t help but find it quite lovable.\n… This is no good. At this rate, I’ll break into a smile again.\nI took a deep breath. Little by little, I sink my Wrath back down to the depths of my existence.\nLevel-headed anger. Sharm rage, honed like a blade.\nI already knew all the ways to swallow my anger.\nI licked my lips. The beat has already quieted down. But it’s not like my resentment had disappeared.\nIt was merely left without eyes. It was constantly burning up my soul. All the parts of it I didn’t show on the surface were merely sharpening themselves. In order to bring ruin to my enemies.\nWe got closer to the battlefield, and the information I picked up grew more vivid.\nThere, was a scene that raised my concern.\n“Tsk… Heard… just what’s holding him up.”\nAs if to show himself off, I witnessed a pulsating black flash… The wave of darkness that resulted from a clashing of mana spread across the sky like an aurora.\nThe mass of power came into contact with the other mass, and gave off an intense flicker like stardust. But there was no sign of either light going out.\nThe spectacle I could even see from a distant sky felt something like a premonition of the end of the world.\nThe devourer, Zebul Glaucus.\nBlessed with an endless hunger, a witch of Gluttony.\nShe was conspicuously atrocious, and conspicuously sinful, even among the Demon Lords. All to devour all creation.\nEven that Heard Leader won’t be able to knock down that perpetually lived gifted child of starvation.\nOr maybe he’s just playing with her…\nTo blow away the gloomy feelings sticking to my head, I scoffed.\nBut that didn’t clear away any of my inner resentment in the slightest.\n“Hmm… just do whatever you want. I’ve no intent to rid myself of either of you two. Go at it as you will.”\nAnnoying. It’s annoying, but… otherwise, there would be no point in me coming here.\nIf you were to look at Heard Lauder in terms of simple power, then he would be within the top three of all Lords.\nIt’s not like I conceded Rank One to him simply because he was an old friend.\nDirect physical strength.\nAbsolute confidence in himself to lord over all.\nThose were the qualities of Pride. He more than accomplished his own Sin.\nI’ve no doubt in his victory. Even if it were to take a bit of time.\nEven if I didn’t really like him all that much, I had at least that level of trust in him.\nBut still, the current situation is a little too rowdy.\nFar behind Heard, there was an army of around five hundred racing over the land.\nTo chase the sky-bound Angels, a Legion atop flightless dragons was rushing over.\nWhile kicking the ground at a speed that didn’t fall behind those of the Angels’ wings, the ominous army that seemed uniform enough to gain a constant measurement with a meter stick was one belonging to Vanity.\nI’m not sure if they were even focused on the Angel flock, as without even a sign of them using a Skill, they quietly continued their dash. Their presences were exceedingly light, and for some reason, they brought about a psychologically unpleasant feeling with them.\nLize let her shoulders tremble.\n“As always, that’s a repulsing army he keeps.”\nThe army with such a fleeting feel to it was a rare one among the Demon Lords’ forces, which had been given a specific name.\nVanity himself had tacked it onto them, the 『Ravus Persona』.\nEven from this distance, the lost individuality and colorless grey souls I felt may be the origin of the name.\nIt’s not like there was a gap of power between that army’s Demons and others, but their somewhat ominous atmosphere made it so even I couldn’t tell for what purpose they had come into being.\nOriginally, I should have been analyzing the Angels. But rather than them, I found myself naturally concentrating on the army trampling the ground.\nQuite different from than those holy messengers, who were irritating from their nature opposing ours, it was that army’s lack of nature in its entirety that made them all so irritating.\nIn that Legion advancing over the wasteland, the presence of their Lord Vanity was… absent.\nI can’t feel him anywhere in the extent of my perception. Within my Zone, there are but three existences of Demon Lord Class apart from myself.\nWas he annihilated? No, even like that, he’s Rank Four… he’s not of the caliber to go down so easy. Even if he were up against a Lord of Angels, he should have held out no matter the case…\nThere are too few characters on this stage. It’s a strangely ominous sensation.\nI can’t think that Vanity’s army would act without its master.\nAt the conference, he clearly declared that he would bring death to the Angels.\nAt this point, I’m even beginning to doubt those words of his. The warning I heard from my father long ago threw my analysis of the situation out of line.\nIn the first place, no matter what sort of army it may be, there’s no way that Demons could pull off such coordinated movements with no one leading them.\nMy thoughts, stuck in a ditch, were snapped back with a thunderous sound.\nNow’s not the time to think of such things, I see.\nBy taking a deep breath, I calmed myself down.\nAn army of Angels. And army of Demons.\nZebul Glaucus. Heard Lauder. Serge Serenade…\nAnd Kanon Iralaude.\nIt’s quite an extravagant lineup we have there, but to Leigie-niisama, we’re at quite a disadvantage.\nNo matter how strong he may be, Heard Lauder’s but a single Demon. What’s more, of all things, that lone Demon was up against another Demon Lord who should be part of my own army.\nWithout their master, Vanity Seidthroan, that army was… a meaningless gathering.\nWhile five hundred was nothing to scoff at, that level would find taking anyone of Demon Lord Class on to be difficult.\nA low ranking Demon Lord may be one thing, but to one who took down the Rank Seven, they won’t even be a hindrance to Serge.\nA Lord for a Lord. Those were the bare bones of anti-Demon, and anti-Angel tactics.\nGod dammit, if only Vanity was here, I’m sure it would work itself out one way or another.\nRacing like shooting stars above the ether, the Angel forces weren’t all too high in power, but they were numerous, and anyways, they were fast.\nThe number of them Vanity reported was ten, but this time, their forces pretty much equal the man’s army. I’m surprised they managed to get such a large army to infiltrate this place without triggering a single Lord’s zone. A strange smile started to come across my face.\nThe heat I should have kept confined started singing my thoughts.\nAre we unlucky, or incapable? The enemy’s numbers are beyond expectations. We’ve too little hands here.\nFor all the enemies I imagined to be gathered here…\nJust like Demons, Angels were few in number. A few of them was one thing, but it’s been a few thousand years since several hundred of them appeared at once. However, my urge for battle wasn’t worked up at all.\nI had no physical enhancements born from the urge to do battle. All that was in me was simple impatience.\nNo matter how many Saint Lord Class Angels unify themselves, this scale isn’t going to make the Demon World fall. Rather than that, if we had an honest clash of power, it’d all be settled in an hour. It’s just a way to pile up corpses. These guys are merely needless casualties.\nIt’s a perfect form of harassment, mind you.\nThis is all just an inconvenience.\nPerhaps I should have taken along another Lord.\nFirst of all, defeat ain’t happening here, but there’s a chance of letting them escape. Once they’ve gotten away, it would be difficult to give chase.\nThe main point Angels overlooked Demons in was their speed.\nHard to catch even aboard a mount, the flight of an Angel’s wings was of the highest speed, and with their stamina, Demons were no match.\nIf there’s something out there called fate, then I can’t just spend my life placing curses on it.\nPower naturally flowed to my hand, and my nails sunk into my upper arm.\nWhy.\nWhy do they head for the Castle of Shadows?\nTo the side of the Lord who without accomplishing a single thing, spent his peaceful time in a deep slumber.\nAn abyss of sorrow. Always clad in a deep and dark sea of gloom, the most sorrowful existence of this world.\nEven if you look upon him as one with power, I could only see it as saw.\nAnd at the same time, I was certain.\nIf that’s the burden my niisama is to carry, then it must be my role to assist him.\nI smiled at my own cowardice.\nFine… it’s something I knew from times long passed.\nThis world will make a fool of me.\nInconvenient? Too numerous? Absurd.\nFine. I’ll swear it here.\n“With my name Iralaude on the line, I’ll leave not a single one of you all alive.”\nFrom far away, along with the sound of the collapse of a mountain, a large fissure emerged in the earth.\nRight over the horizon, I finally got a view of the battlefield.\nThe numerous holes dotting the ground and as if lines had been drawn in, the countless cracks.\nIn the center of that stood the arrogant Heard Lauder, and a Demon of small build, with black miasma circulating all over her body… Zebul Glaucus’s miniscule form.\nThe ground rumbled, as if trembling before them. Lize’s face was colored with fright and surprise as she strongly gripped her reigns.\nFor a brief moment, Heard Lauder’s mana swelled up. But with just that, it felt like a normal Demon would be rendered unconscious.\nSo she’s an opponent he has to let out that much power to defeat. I didn’t think I would arrive in time to actually witness Zebul’s destruction.\nWith that much force going around, there’s no way he isn’t serious.\nThe wind that blew across this land was violated with a thick magic, to suck in each and every desire.\nThis was the wind of a battlefield.\nBirthed by the clash of desire, a wind of chaos.\nAs if it were actually suffering wounds, the mana that soaked into the Dark Prison… niisama’s zone was torn asunder.\nWhile it was cut through a couple of times, it’s not as if the Zone itself was effected as a whole.\nBut that truth was irrelevant to me.\nThose that get in my way… be they Demons or Angels, or Valkyries, they’re my enemy.\nFinally capturing the battle scene in her pupils, Lize opened her eyes wide.\n“Absurd… what… power… They’re equal? No, Heard has the advantage, I see.”\nThere was affinity between Demons.\nWith high offensive power, it’s quite rare that a clash of Pride and Gluttony would turn into a drawn out battle.\nAffinity-wise, Pride was the stronger of the two, but the gap was not a great one.\nLize’s discernment was correct. Given the time, it would likely be Heard’s victory.\nBut there’s no longer the time to wait for such a thing.\nI cannot match the speed of those heavenly wings. No matter how proficient a dragon I ride, I cannot overturn that biological deficiency.\nWhile I looked one, I could do nothing but measure the velocity of the encroaching Angels. That was the pure physiological difference between the Angel and Demon race.\nIf there was a single Demon out there to oppose it, then it would be the Superbia Demon who saw time as stagnant.\nAnd that truth was likely what dulled Heard’s fists.\nThe malice the man released wasn’t only directed at the enemy before him.\nHeard was a battle maniac, but he was also once niisama’s follower.\nWhile he once waved a banner of rebellion, I don’t see his devotion weakening at present.\nBattles between Demon Lords were where desires ate into one another. Each and every blow exchanged was potentially fatal, and the Lords put their very existences behind each and every one of those blows.\nZebul’s life was too powerful to be taken down so simply, even with Heard’s unfollowable speed.\nShe wasn’t an opponent that could be defeated merely by finding a gap in her defense.\nOn the other side, the holy flock was, to their natural archnemeses… to the Legion marching along the land, and to the large-scale destruction raised by the warring Demon Lords, they showed no signs of even paying the slightest attention. With what one could call pure honesty, they headed at full speed towards the Castle.\nTheir powers weren’t as high as I had heard. While there surely was a Saint Lord Class there, if you were to ask whether she would be capable of destroying Rank Seven, I would be left in doubt.\nBut that doesn’t change that it’ll become a pain if I let her off here. At the very least, it wasn’t a level of power those middle class Demons at the castle like Lorna or Medea would be able to deal with.\nMe revoking his army in order to protect his silence backfired on me.\nLeigie of Sloth lacked high offensive power, or dexterity, but his defense and vitality alone were extraordinary. That’s why even if he were hit around left and right, he wouldn’t die too easily, but that Angel’s actions weigh heavy on my mind.\nShe bore an undaunted will, as if she had some sort of scheme to surpass Leigie-niisama’s needlessly high defensive ability.\nWith the million to one, billion to one chance that he’ll be killed in mind, I cannot let her pass.\nEven if that wasn’t the case…\n“… I shall not let her disturb his sleep.”\n“…”\nThe distance between us was but a few kilometers. But as if to avoid us, the flock had altered its path.\nMy luck lay in my Palace’s location in relation to the castle of Shadows, making it so they were forced to head in my direction. If that had not been the case, then I wouldn’t even be able to confront them.\nMy misfortune was in that my Wrath was mainly of Skills for single targeting use. With five hundred on their side… that’s a little high to capture them all.\nBurn up their souls. Converge my entire being on my desire to further hone my blade.\nOne of my unconsciously clenched teeth snapped, and fresh blood scalded the back of my dragon. From its mouth, a small groan was audible.\nI wiped it off with my sleeve.\nPerhaps too much blood had rushed to my head. My footing was unstable.\nEven so, while swaying, I stood upright on the dragon’s back, and silently held my staff in front.\nIt was the greatest treasure of the Demon Race, a gift handed down from the Evil God to the very first Great Demon King. Its height was about a meter and a half. The lumber that formed its main body was tougher than any material found in this Demon World, and its tip was garnished with an ornament made in the like of a beast’s jaw.\n(TL: Its height is given as 5 Shaku, which converts to 1.515 (repeating) meters)\nThe inscription on it read, The Emperor of Destruction’s Staff, Weydhe. Among the countless treasure littered around the world, it was an item with the opposite nature of a holy relic, a treasure of the Evil God.\nWithin the reptilian jaw was inlaid a golden crystalline eye to direct at mine enemies.\nThe reflective surface of the finely cut jewel caught the sunlight to give an ominous shine.\nIra was the manifestation of violent emotion.\nA heartless sin to burn away all other sentiment.\nI took a deep breath. I let out the resentment I had been building up all these years.\nRight now, I’m likely making an expression I would never display to another.\nMy vision is died a bright red, and viscous fury swept over my mind.\nBut still, I could remain calm. That was what Leigie-niisama taught me.\nIt’s what he sacrificed his body to teach me.\nAnger isn’t something to release so recklessly. It’s something to control, and hone.\nI give a short incantation. What dyed all I saw in red was channeled through my prized possession into the sky.\n“『Wrath Drive』”\nCountless crimson lights raced across the air.\nAt the speed of light, those crimson comets burned up the sky, and in the next instant, they had reached their targets. They pierced through the Angel flock from the side, and continued to go through one body after the other.\nLike scraps of paper, the divine robes were bore through. No sort of defensive wall holds any meaning before me.\nSeveral dozens of Angels were instantly reduced to nothing, leaving not but faint afterimages in the air.\nI heard the ominous sound of something breaking resound through my skull.\nAn impact to my taste buds, the flavor of iron. I completely ignored the pain I felt, and clicked my tongue.\nHaving been pierced through, the Angels were halted for but a moment, before restarting their flight once more. That gesture made it feel as if they were following a set program, and there was barely any lag. An army prepared for death.\nI subconsciously spat out my crushed tooth.\nWhile I had not experienced the wars of old, I knew enough about those beings called Angels. At least, I thought I had known.\nThey are our sworn foe, and brutes whose tenacity lied only towards hunting us down. Their bodies themselves didn’t differ from ours at all.\nThat’s how it should be.\nThen in that case, what is this supposed to be?\nIf the attack was ineffective, that would be another matter, but after so many of them had fallen, for their flock to continue to go on like that should be heresy to an Angel.\nWrath Skills weren’t suited to rapid fire.\nThe Angels spread out. It was likely a plan for them to not all be taken out at once. That wide formation showed off their clear knowledge of how to deal with Ira Skills, and their narrow area of effect.\nAnd as I thought, those heavenly wings still didn’t have me set as their destination.\nThey didn’t fight back, and they didn’t use any Skills.\nBefore my wrath, these Angels’ flight… their march was surely backed by some form of strong will. Something that exceeded their innate instinct to oppose Demons.\n“Even with me before their eyes… they’ll still head for niisama…”\nThen there’s even less reason to let them through.\nI spread that dark heat across my mind again. My instincts and emotions raged up to burn through my entire body.\nIn proportion to my anger, the incessant violent waves of Mana weighed down on my psych, And I only gathered them at the head of my staff.\nPut all my fury into a single attack.\nFormation? Plan?\nUseless. It’s just a pain.\nThen I’ll just have to burn up everything in the world.\nI just have to turn heaven to ash in one strike.\nNiisama is the King of Despair, and the most sorrowful Lord on these lands.\nWith just a few hundred Angels, to stand before dear niisama… it makes me sick.\nFoolish Angels. Decay away on these dark lands.\nJust like all that have come to oppose niisama before you.\nI poured nothing but directionless Mana into the staff, dying it a strong red, and point it at those foolish heathens. The moment I was about to use a Skill, Lize, who was moving right below me, let off a shrill shout.\nMy subordinate’s face seemed to be at its wits end as I looked down upon her.\n“Kanon-sama, is this… not the time to use Heard Lauder!?”\n“… What?”\nThose words released from an unexpected position made me instinctively suppress the powers I was to bring out.\nHaving become the Great Demon Lord, there were few out there to contest my opinion. For those that hadn’t even become Demon Lords yet, I could count them on the fingers of one hand.\nLize’s opinion often found itself to be leaning on one side, but her devotion was quite high, even among my direct subordinates.\nIn this land of warring powers, she was one of the few who had sworn loyalty to me. Her words held some worth in considering.\nPerhaps sensing a shift in my will, the flying dragon dropped its speed a little.\n“That army is moving at a considerable pace. There’s some distance between us, and when they’re spread out that vast… to burn all those Angels in the sky… Even for you, Kanon-sama, it is in my humble opinion it would be too great an expenditure of power.”\nAs one governing the same desire, she understood.\nThe sin of Ira that scaled in proportion to anger was the one boasting the highest offensive potential among the seven attributes, and… the one with the greatest consumption of power.\nBut I was also well aware.\nRegardless of the mere dozens of minutes that have passed since we entered this Dark Prison, the heat that was currently scorching my body, and frothing at my skin was… anger.\nToo great a power expenditure?\nWhat of it? Regardless of what I use up, even if I’m to run dry, and be mocked by my subordinate Lords, I haven’t fallen low enough for me to hesitate over such a matter.\nMy desire… the path of my Wrath is something I’ll decide for myself.\nThe clear display of emotions on Lize’s face barely changed upon looking at me.\nHer complexion was turning a little pale. We’ve known one another for years, and she should know me well enough, but there was no hesitation in the words she spewed.\n“For Heard Lauder, and the Pride he governs, it would be a simple matter for him to overtake them.”\nIf you were to ask whether she was sound, well sure, she was.\nBut Heard is returning fire with Zebul. He’s no leisure to shoot down angels while taking her on.\nOn top of that, I cannot count on Vanity’s forces. Five hundred Demons would just be a nice snack to that Devourer.\nThat’s where Gula’s troublesome point came in. To those of them that boasted Sin deep enough to eat up their own race, going at them with numbers was nothing but a waste of resources.\nA proposal to maintain the status quo.\nI read what Lize had wanted to say.\nI looked down upon the impertinent lass I had known from her childhood.\nAt some point, she had climbed up to General Class, this gifted subordinate of mine.\n“So to summarize, it’s something like this. You’re proposing an exchange.”\n“Yes, the right man in the right place. That Heard Lauder can keep up with any Angel.”\n“You do have a point. But there’s a single problem in that.”\nIf you’re looking at power usage, that plan does have a greater efficiency… if you look at it like that.\nBut Lize has forgotten a single point.\nHer opinion is grounded solely on the assumption that I would be able to destroy Zebul oh so easily.\nHer Gula and my Ira have a bad affinity.\nNaturally, I don’t have any intentions on losing. But fighting her will be a large power expenditure all the same. Perhaps much greater than what would be required to burn up these Angels.\nThat’s just how strong Zebul is.\nShe’s the ultimate predator, and a natural-born warrior.\nWith her at an affinity disadvantage against Rank One’s Heard Lauder, she has the might to persist at almost an equal level, a world apart from any standard Demon out there.\nHaving eaten on through ancient times beyond memory, her abilities as a Demon, her battle experience, and her ability to devour others were all realized in her extraordinary power.\nI mean, the sin she holds dear, the Gluttony to even eat other Demons was… linked to the pure and honest desire to bring malice to others.\nI somehow suppress the shout that was about to escape me, and try talking in a soothing voice to persuade her. This girl is smart, and na?ve.\n“Heard is Leigie’s former subordinate. Before him is a stain on Leigie’s record. He’s sure to shake his head.”\n“But if you consider efficiency, that’s the best option.”\nYeah, yeah.\nIf Heard were to take them on, then Angels of that level would be close to woodchips. He’s be able to destroy them all without using much power at all.\nBut if I take Zebul on, an energy waste is unavoidable.\nEven if you call me the Great Demon King, at the end of the day… I’m just a single Demon girl, you know.\nI hesitate to let out words.\nEven as we speak, the Angels are putting up more and more distance.\nBut I had to say something. To my cute, cute subordinate.\nPerhaps those were the words my father once imparted on me, or perhaps their contents were the same.\nEven if their exteriors were to change, at the very least, the sentiment in my heart should be similar.\n“Lize, we are by no means… monolithic, you know.”\n“!? T-that is…”\nLet me be honest here.\nI am… not able to fully trust the man known as Heard Lauder.\nHe was Leigie-niisama’s right-hand man. But he’s also a Demon who once Overruled niisama. I don’t know when he’ll lash out again.\nLeigie-niisama’s power is… strong. But at the same time, he isn’t suited to battle. His nature was the complete opposite of Heard’s. Even that power of ice I caught a glimpse of… there’s a possibility it won’t work the next time.\nAnd the only one who can suppress that is me. I cannot trust another.\nAs it is, my power was around a level to compete with his.\nIf I were to have a loss in strength here, then it’s likely I would eventually face defeat to that man.\nRather than Zebul, who eats her kind, or Vanity, who father directly warned me about, the one I feared the most was niisama’s greatest follower, Heard Lauder.\nDesire was something that ate up the soul over time. The emotions held by a Demon Lord were in no way something that could be held back by one’s rationality.\n“So will you laugh upon my foolishness, Lize Bloodcross?”\nI’ve always been a coward.\nPeople say I have intellect unbecoming of the Wrath I govern, but caution is the other face of cowardice.\nI can’t kill off niisama’s right hand man, nor can I let niisama get killed. I can only pray to the Demon World’s God, and wait… just as father long before me, I can only pursue a hopeless dream, and learn of an unreachable summit while I protect the seat on the empty throne.\nBut still, I cannot stand still.\nUntil some day, I’m swallowed up by the name of Ruin I carry.\nEven having received my words, Lize’s gaze had yet to change, and she merely looked up at me in silence.\n“… Have I become a little too sentimental?”\n“… No.”\nHer look told me that word held no lies or scorn.\nJust as I found her long ago, her eyes, her heart, showed no distortion.\nThen so be it.\nI’ll offer up my Ruin to you, niisama.\nAngels and Demons, and even God will turn to ash.\nThat is… the authority of my Wrath.\nTo hold hatred and resentment for all of creation.\nOn top of the dragon racing through the sky, I fell to one knee.\nThe land of the Demon World mainly consisted of spread out deserts of pebbles, and the Dark Prison was no exception.\nWhen I looked down from the sky, I could take in the infinite expanse of land in a single glance.\nThat land enveloped by darkness that simply seemed to go on, and on. This jet black earth that had never changed from ancient times.\nTo that ground basked in the Mana of Acedia, I only ever held a single thought.\nThe distance to the Angels was already beyond my field of vision. But that’s no problem. I could get the particulars of their location from my Sone Skill.\nAt regular intervals, the ground shook to remind me of the clash of Heard and Zebul.\nI drove that all out of my mind.\nI put power into my staff once more. My fury acted in kind to make the entire body of it emit light like a miniature sun.\nThe moment I was to let it burst out, Lize’s dragon suddenly cut up in front of mine.\n“… What is the meaning of this?”\nWhat I was about to reach was far above all the power in her body.\nEven if she may be one who bears the same desire, that was hellfire that wouldn’t even leave her ashes behind.\n“… Hanon-sama, as I thought, I am… opposed to this.”\n“… What?”\nHer downcast face rose a little.\nThe blazing fire in her eyes blazed with a strong emotion much removed from resentment.\n“This is a role you should leave to Heard Lauder.”\nThat idiotically repeated line was just barely able to push down my emotions.\nThe remnants of my anger drifted out of the staff, and the coat I wore let off a light luminescence.\nIt’s fine. From the Wrath I once held against niisama, something of this level is… something I can bear.\nI wanted to tell her to shut up and follow. But Lize’s frantic eyes were painful for some reason.\n“Truly, that man may betray you one day. I can understand your anxiety. But you should consider the present situation. Out enemy is… the Angels, and Zebul.”\nHer quivering voice pierced my ears.\nMy enemy was present in the entire Demon World. While Heard did his share of work, the Demon World wasn’t small enough for that to let me gain control of it.\nIf I were to consider my army as a while, it would be a bad play to exhaust him here.\nBut once more, it’s a matter of future prospects.\nMerits and demerits.\nIf I don’t use up Heard’s strength here, that man will surely be able to deal with all the opposing Demon Lords. The time to Demon World consolidation will certainly be shortened.\nBut at the same time, regardless of whether Heard’s power is to weaken, or if those Demon Lords out there are to survive… niisama won’t notice any of it.\nNiisama’s Vitality was nothing normal. Even against Demon Lords, that remained unchanged.\nLet’s say that there were some who could pierce through that. That would only be the few Demon Lords like Heard or Zebul, who specialized themselves on pure offense.\nSharpening power. Killing enemies.\nThere’s no right and wrong. Even if it is just to buy a little bit of time.\nI must trim the sprouts of calamity.\nThat was something that transcended both Merit and Demerit… the initial prerequisite.\nThe basic standard I decided on the moment I became Great Demon King.\nAs long as that’s accomplished, then I won’t grieve for my power.\nI don’t… need the world.\n“Lize, step aside.”\nWhile you’re standing there in my way, those Angels are just building up more distance.\nMy flame of impatience were already escaping my body to raise the surrounding temperature. With their high heat resistance, the dragon’s scales let off an offensive smell, as they burnt down. Letting out a low cry, it thrashed out left and right as if to drop me to the ground.\nEven if you call it a dragon, in the end, it’s just a beast… no, but… Ah, this will work out.\nThe wind scattered my hair.\nBy the unrest in the dragon’s movements, Lize was far separated from me, and she raised a scream from far below my eyelevel.\nI give her a single glance.\nYou are… a good subordinate.\nWith the excitation of my Mana, and the manifestation of my spirit, the song of my mind was finally satisfied.\nFrom the depths of hell, where the light of day would never reach, the hardships in the furthest recesses of the earth, carved into my very soul, the song of a Demon Lord.\nI naturally began to hum it.\nFrom the vestiges of my widely swung staff, vivid flames continued to pour.\n“Dawn Blaze. Oh jet black rain. Let the flames of creation enter my hands…”\nI am a coward.\nThat’s why, my enemies, go to hell.\nDestruction is my reprieve. So you can just dissapear to the world beyond.\nHow many years has it been since I chanted the incantation of that Skill on the highest tiers of the Wrath Skill Tree?’\nTo carry out my Ruin, I activated it.\n“Shield Anchor.”\nI feel the color seep from my world. Demons are being of soul, and their corporeal bodies held little meaning. Their existences were largely centered around their minds.\nThat was slipping away. A large portion of my thoughts had taken form and expressed itself.\nThe power collected at the head of the staff shined as a single light, before spreading explosively.\nThis was the abyss of Ira I had reached.\nThese flames of creation to rid myself or the rabble resembled the wrath of a form of God, and it was merely beautiful. A power to reset the world to create anew.\nThe expanding light cloaked the heaven and earth, and cleared away the sky into a crimson aurora.\nThe growing heat wave condensed to a single storm, and the ground calmed. Taking on the resultant wind, the flying dragon swayed greatly.\nIt was a wave of light.\nJust as niisama once sealed the land in ice, an opposite force to bake everything in the world bathed the land.\nNo matter how much agility those wings may grant them, in the end, they cannot match up to light.\nIt was only an instant before the flames coming at them at the speed of light swallowed them up without a single one left remaining. Without the time to raise a scream. Without even the time to form a thought.\nMy resentment burned the sky.\nBe they Saint Lord Class, or Demon Lord Class, before my Ruin, they hold no meaning.\nThe flames cleared.\nThe sky was a pure red, and in it, not a single thing remained.\nOf Serge who flew ahead, and the angels that followed, there wasn’t a single particle of ash.\nTo niisama’s enemy, that disappeared before I had ever even seen her face, I held not a single deeper emotion.\nThe strong display of power was always accompanied by compensation.\nA nihility enveloped my head. The power leaving my body caused me to kneel over the dragon. But I won’t unhand my weapon.\nUntil I drop all my enemies into ruin.\n“Hah hah hah…”\nI gripped the reigns, and had the dragon descend. The hands of the battle below, which had stopped for a moment at the flames in the sky, restarted themselves once more.\nThe sound of destruction echoing across the land was on a different scale from before.\nI’ve cut off Heard Lauder’s hesitation. If it’s now, he should be able to give it his all.\nIf he’s to lose here, then… I’ll be the one to kill Zebul. That’s all there is to it.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 5: Ira’s Resentment, Part 4: …What Luck\n“Kanon-sama, are you alright!?”\n“Yeah.”\nWhen I dismounted my dragon, and landed on the ground, Lize rushed over to me.\nI’m a bit unsteady, but there’s no problems. It was a slight overuse of my powers, however, that should heal up just fine, given the time. It’s not a quantity I’ll recover over a night or two, but it’s nothing fatal.\nI could even wage a war right now.\nIt seems that when I wasn’t watching, my level had unexpectedly risen.\nThere’s barely a hindrance to my body’s movement. I used much greater an amount back when I liberated the frozen world.\n“It looks like all the Angels have been wiped out.”\n“Yep, I’ll bet.”\nThere wasn’t a single thing left in the sky. They’ve disappeared from my Abyss Zone’s perception as well.\nLize’s expression indicated that she wanted to say something, but in the end, she remained silent.\nDesire means you must have your own way with things. The more you’re in control, the easier it is to use power.\nAnd that’s exactly why, even if I were to use too much energy and ruin myself, I wouldn’t hold the slightest of regrets.\nFor some reason, I became excessively mindful of the Castle of Shadows.\nI let out some rough breaths, and put myself in order. Supported my staff… Weydhe, I began treading across the ground.\nI can only hate how narrow the extent of my own Zone is.\nMy perception couldn’t extend all the way to the Castle. From here, I cannot discern how niisama fares.\n“Will you offer assistance to Heard?”\n“As if I could assist a Pride Demon.”\nIf I did something like that… Heard’s power will drop.\nThat will only result in me making an enemy of him. There’s nothing more trifling than earning his hostility with good intentions.\nAll I can do is the aftercare.\nI watched the cloud of dust rising over the horizon… the army racing forth on grounded dragons.\n“Lize, tell Vanity’s army to abate. The enemy they chase after no longer exists.”\n“Yes, understood.”\nLize receives my will, and urged her own dragon to take to the skies again.\nI don’t know that man’s will, but there’s no doubt Vanity’s goal lay with those Angels.\nTo chase those flying bugs by giving chase on the earth was a foolish notion to begin with.\nThe running dragons that existed for ground movement could put out speeds equal to flying dragons, and they existed in much greater numbers, so they did make for an exceedingly proficient means of transportation, but they were less than worthy to chase those leaping through the sky.\nAs long as their power is insufficient to go up against Zebul, those guys will have no part to play here.\nJust in case, I closed my eyes, and searched every nook and cranny of my Zone.\nAs I thought, the only Demon Lords here are Me, Heard, and Zebul; the three of us. There’s no question about it.\nVanity… just what the hell is he doing?\nI couldn’t see him anywhere. And that made me feel somewhat suspicious.\nFather’s words of warning echoed in my mind, and ate into my heart like a wedge.\n“… It reeks. I can’t think that Venity would take any meaningless action.”\nPremonition… no, it wasn’t something to the extent of calling it a premonition.\nThis is… merely unease. I’m just a coward. It’s a topic that will draw to an end if I leave it at that.\nBut at the same time, it’s true that it’s unnatural, the off feeling that one of my chess pieces had suddenly disappeared.\nI forcefully shake off that notion.\n“… Well, whatever the case, that’s something to think over at a later date.”\nI pushed down the emotions that were still smoldering in my heart, and looked to the distant battlefield.\nEven with my eyes, Heards movements weren’t something I could follow.\nThe distance was around a thousand meters.\nWith that space between us, I could only see each step of his as instantaneous movement. His speed truly was akin to thunder.\nTo one constantly clad in a wave of starvation, that would eat into you on mere contact, going at Zebul barehanded was a poor move.\nBut he didn’t even pay any heed to that.\nHis tactics were simple and clear.\nNo tricks to play.\nSuppression through pure force. That was the very form of his combat. Without any smoke or mirrors, his hands tore the earth, and made mountains disappear.\nWhat’s more, from what I can see from afar, even against Zebul, Heard shows not the signs of using a Skill.\nHe’s an idiot.\n“Is he preserving his energy? No, it’s just his Pride again.”\nI don’t even have any intent to say something about it.\nMaybe he’s actually stronger without using anything, but… the nature of Superbia’s power was something that could only be understood by Superbia Demons. No matter how much I mulled over it, it would be a waste of my time.\nWhatever the case, it’s already over…\nI’ll confirm Zebul’s death with mine own eyes, and go home.\nIn the first place, I have more than enough things I should be doing right now.\nI’ll have to take another look over the Angels’ peculiar movements. I’ll have to ascertain the reason they aimed for the Castle of Shadows.\nWhen I think of it like that, perhaps I should have spared an Angel or two.\nWell, all of it’s already passed. And those guys aren’t once I could think of to spit anything out under interrogation or torture.\nMore importantly, Serge’s death will be a huge asset.\nThe fact that an Angel of that level was able to take down Rank Seven is already a point of concern, but there would be nothing I could do by thinking over that one.\nI carefully laid out my worries in my head. My biggest headache has gone away, but that doesn’t mean that everything’s been resolved.\nI’ll have to question Vanity as to why he vanished at the critical moment.\nBecause my greatest goal isn’t suppressing heaven, but unifying the Demon World.\nBut it’s fine if I take my mind off that from time to time, right?\nI mean, I’m on the road home anyways. How about I stop by the Castle of Shadow for the first time in a while…\n“…”\nThe next moment, when I had just grown a little lax, it occurred.\nMy zone naturally captured those presences.\nIt definitely wasn’t anything so important.\nI didn’t hold any fear of my own death, nor did I sense the presence of anything strong.\nThe only emotions I held were slight hints of resentment and resignation.\nAh, this really is… a pain.\nI took my eyes off of Heard and Zebul’s battle.\nIn the direction Lize set off in. I don’t have a clear sight of it, but of all things, there’s no way that I would mistake those presences.\nHow many of them are there… they really just keep coming forth like cockroaches.\nI can easily destroy them, but there’s no helping them ruining my mood.\nI unintentionally clicked my tongue.\n“Tsk… so they appeared again. Just how many of those guys did they send out, anyways…”\nThey were certainly the presences of Angels.\nAs if launched, and propelled, a white light came down vertically from up high. Within it, I saw a swarm of Angels.\nThe distance wasn’t far. It’s as if I could take them in my hand.\nThe number was five. Their power wasn’t great. They didn’t even reach General Class. It’s possible they were even below Knight.\nBut to be honest, it was really quite depressing.\nIt would be simple if they came at me of their own accord, but when they thoughtlessly fly about like that, it’s truly a pain. No matter how low class they may be, if I let them free, there’s no doubt it would become troublesome.\nIt was annoying, but I reluctantly raised my staff.\nIf it’s only five, then I doubt I even have to deal with it personally. They aren’t even that far away, so Vanity’s army should be able to handle it one way or another. Lize’s more than up to the task.\nBut without their Lord taking command, it’s unknown whether Vanity’s Legion would even engage in battle in the first place. There’s also the report of an ordinary Angel suddenly climinb up to Lord status.\nThen it would be more reliable if I just did it myself.\nI need not anything to high class. I select the lowest Skill on my tree, and activated it.\n“Angry Arrows.”\nIt’s a lower Wrath Skills to shoot out flaming arrows of rage. A trifling one normal non-Lord Demons could use as well.\nI made a few dozens. The red lights that came forth in the air around me shot forth.\nI’m not sure what those Angels were trying to accomplish, but I shot them all down, and left not a single one behind.\nIf I just have to target them before they gain any speed, then I barely use up any power. No matter how you look at it, they’re mocking me. That was completely pointless.\nUnsure of whether more would be coming, I remained poised with my staff, but there was no sign of another wave of Angels. Have I shot them all down with this.\nJust what were those last five supposed to be? Was there some meaning to that?\nAre Angels merely idiots? Even for that, that was much too foolish.\nIt only elicited useless questions where I didn’t even know if an answer existed. If that was supposed to be psychological warfare, I must admit it was quite effective.\nIs it best if I just assume their actions held no meaning?\nStill…\n“It’s a pain…”\nThe painful thing is how I don’t know my enemy’s forces.\nShould I just retreat already, or is it best if I remained? I want to head for the Castle of Shadows with all due haste, you know… at the very least, I have to see to the end of Zebul’s battle.\nIn the worst case, if it’s Angels of that level, I could easily repel them, even from the castle.\nWhile I thought that, there was still no signs of the ground to stop shaking.\n“… How long do they plan on going at it…”\nWhile feeling restless at the battle that showed no signs of ending, I looked towards Heard once. The Demon’s fight… the contest of desire seriously didn’t seem to be ending any time soon.\nHeard… he better not be biding his time, having finally found a worthy foe.\nZebul’s face was covered with her hunger-turned-dark-aura, so I couldn’t’ make it out, but I can see Heard’s.\nI don’t have that much spare time, you know…\nI took in one deep breath, and glared at the battlefield.\n“That’s enough! Heard Lauder!! Finish up already!!”\nAt the very least… use a Skill!\nThe more time you try to buy… the more my time at the Castle of Shadows decreases!\nOf course, I won’t voice those concerns.\nMy scream swept over the expanse of the obstruction-less wasteland.\nHeard’s movements stopped for a moment. I get the feeling our eyes met briefly.\nWithout even paying any heed to the Wave of Starvation covering Zebul, the kick he lowered from above came down, and sent her body flying.\nTowards me.\nIt held an energy I couldn’t think of coming from an ordinary kick.\nWhile carving a deep fissure along the ground, the Devourer’s body flew accompanied by a cloud of dust.\nThe brushed past me a few meters to my side.\nThe wind loaded with those black pebbles surged up like a tornado, and spread out in a wide radius.\nI instinctively covered my face from the black storm suddenly expanding before my eyes.\nI take no damage. That was just that aftermath. I’m not sure about an ordinary Demon, but a Demon Lord wouldn’t have gotten any wounds from that.\nBut it’s as iff he were making fun of my lack of preparation.\nThe wind died down in a moment.\n“…”\nI silently brushed the hair that came down on my face to one side.\nI put my unkempt locks in order with a hand comb, and remembering the scene, my vision was dyed bright red.\nI’ve had it.\n“DON’T DRAG ME INTO IIIIIIT!”\nFrom here on, I’m totally going over to niisama’s place, okaaaay!?\nThe anger that should have been used up sprung forth again like a fountain to fill my body.\nCalm down. I just have to put it in order again.\nI doused my thoughts, and pushed them back deep inside.\nThe flames of Wrath birthed from my Soul Core flare up as if to cover over my entirety.\nIt’s a sensation I’ve felt time and again from the moment I was born. A state that Wrath Demons often fell into.\nThe space around me was baked by my sinful blaze, and let off a blood-red luminescence.\nI don’t even need to hold the staff.\nMy raging Ira was merely taking shape.\nBlack lustered armor. What spread around my body was light and durable, and hot enough to burn through my soul.\nI don’t have a recollection of having used a Skill.\nNo, I’ll bet I did.\nWhat I had unconsciously put on was a phantasmal armor worn by Demon Lords of Ira.\nA manifestation of malice to bring as much destruction to the masses as possible. Its meaning for existence was merely to lead all those that made fun of me to ruin.\nI glared at the body that was lying a few meters from me.\nA mass of countless poisonous purple tentacles. The liquid dripping from the ends of every one of them, and the ink-black Mana coating her entire figure.\nBeing dragged along the ground, a number of those tentacles had been destroyed, but she seemed to be healthy enough.\nA voice came out. A tired voice.\nHer tone was like that of a young boy. But it was a female voice I remembered.\n“… Good grief, that Vanity… this is completely different from what he told me, is it not… that’s some courage he has for him to be getting in my way.”\nAs if bursting open, the tentacles disappeared.\nAll those protrusions covering up her form disappeared, and the monster of endless appetite finally showed her form.\nIt took on the shape of a giel, but I knew she was more than what she seemed.\nThere’s no way she’s just any brat. There’s no way a brat could stand so calmly before Kanon.\nThe young girl’s lips were formed into a cynical smile.\n“What’s more, fufufu… for even Kanon-sama to be in attendance. Even with Heard here, I’m already full, and sill, such a splendid menu is set out before me. Have I perhaps been a good girl?”\n“Zebul Glaucus…”\nAnd even like that, her expression held no fear, and her gestures, no waver.\nHer deep green eyes simply continued to observe me.\nJ-just whose fault do you think it is… that this pain-in-the-ass situation came to be…\nEven when I know I’m wide open, I hold onto my head. I can’t help but hold my head. If I don’t I feel as if I’ll explode.\nI let out a rough breath. I’m not fatigued. It’s to let out as much of this enormous heat in my body as possible. In order to wash over my waves of emotion as much as I can.\nMy rationality and emotions were having a bout in my narrow skull.\n“Hah hah…”\nThere’s no sign of Zebul raising a hand.\nOnly the red that painted out my thoughts continued to hone itself.\nMy instincts for battle started calculating the information around me.\nHeard’s location. Zebul’s. Lize’s. Vanity’s army’s. I understood it all.\nAh, dammit. This world can go to hell.\nI prodded my staff into the ground. It let off an explosive sound.\nThe earth below it melted.\nThe high temperature earth splashed onto my armor, and let off a peculiarly bad smell.\nI raise my face.\nAll that was left was a single point of resolve.\nIt’s fine. I’ll just deal with all of it, and return as quickly as possible.\nMy trembling lips produced a voice. I’m not thinking of anything. I’ve no time to think.\nThat’s the declaration I made must have been a cry straight from my soul.\n“… I condemn you to ruin.”\n“… So you’ve no intention to talk this out…”\nI shot down the countless tentacles she sprouted with flames.\nBurn through her? Na?ve. Ruin isn’t anything like that.\n“Delete”\n“Tsk”\nMy inexhaustible stream of emotion passed through my staff to birth physical phenomena in the world.\nI don’t need an aria. Ira is my entirety.\nThe moment those humble tentacles were to touch my countless lights of Wrath, they disintegrated.\nZebul has a lot of them at her disposal. But I could bring forth just as much fire.\nThe attacks coming at me from all three hundred and sixty degrees were met by the flames produced by the armor, and erased.\nI’m not sure what extent of control she had over them, but at some point, they even started coming out from the ground below me. Even those were easily dealt with by the fire. Those hands of hers are never to touch me.\nHaving finished burning through all her tentacles, the flames onverged to delete the girl herself.\nThe swirling wave of fire caused her face to turn a little pale, before she took a large leap back to avoid it.\nReflexes, and experience. I can’t deal with her through ordinary means. Perhaps she even has the experience of devouring a Wrath Lord of my level.\nBut I know. I knew this would never be so straightforward. Then I’ll just destroy that spirit of hers.\nWithout learning a thing, the tentacles came at me from all directions again, to be erased by the flame.\nI saw her form a slight grimace.\n“Oh my, could it be that thing runs on auto? How unfair…”\n“Die.”\nFlames spiral up my staff, and emerge as a blast to burn up the air.\nMy power is grinding away, and all that was shaved off was supplemented by the beating of my soul core.\nIf you’re going to get in my way, then you’ll have to pay for that with your body.\n“Fufufu, I won’t hold up like this… I never thought that I would end up being personally scrapped by Kanon-sama…”\nAs she said some irritating lines, Zebul directed the palm of her hand downwards.\nThe number of feelers extending from her decreased. Did she give up on offense? No.\nWith her right hand at the center, I felt a fearsome amount of power amass. It was of the same nature as what she had been wearing up to now. But it had a greater depth than anything she had displayed.\nEven within this armor of Wrath, I could feel chills enough to pour water over me. There was no doubt she was to show her fangs.\nWhat appeared was a blade.\nIts height was close to two meters, and its body was colored in a sinister black miasma. An oversized longsword.\nIt was a form of disruption that came forth from a series of Skills specialized to attack.\nThe ominous feeling from it made me forget my anger for a moment.\nZebul Glaucus easily brandished the great sword that exceeded her own height, and pointed it at me.\nIt was as if to make a proclamation of war.\n“Have you ever seen this one before? This is… my 『Fang of Origin』.”\n“Like I care.”\nIt’s strong. A feeling of death lingers over my trembling soul.\nI shuddered at her power, that exceeded my expectation.\nEspecially that blade… is dangerous. The alarm bells wrung by the experience I had stored up to now were telling me that.\nIt was of the most feared line of Demon Lord Skills.\nTo materialize an equipment with one’s cravings at the base, a Phantasm Armament Skill.\nIt was of the same sort as the 『Ruin Robe』 I wore, but that blade was clearly on a higher tier.\nI can’t see myself being able to block it.\nIt wasn’t a problem with the quantity of power amassed, but of its nature.\nI’m pretty sure that’s a Skill to ignore defense. One blow would be fatal.\nIn my mind, painted out by anger, only my thoughts turned at a level pace.\nI calculated the damage that blade would afford me. If it ate into me, it would most likely be fatal.\nAnd after a few seconds of calculation, I threw the result out the window.\nAs if I care.\nI licked my lips to wet them.\nI looked at Zebul Glaucus, and smiled.\n“… A guaranteed fatal blow… what luck.”\nAh, I’m thankful for having met you here.\nI’m thankful I can bring about your end here.\nThat power… has the worst affinity with niisama. At some point, it would likely bring calamity to him.\nAs if my fighting spirit acted as oil, my flames blazed higher. In proportion to my feelings, the armor around me scattered sparks to my surroundings.\nZebul made quite an obvious grimace.\n“Damn, I would have been happy if you pulled back there… why is it that each and every one of you have to be so quick to fight…”\nI don’t want to hear that from you!\nThere’s a distance of ten meters between us.\nThat great sword has an extensive reach, but even so, she’ll need a few steps to be able to cut at me.\nMy Ruin Robe is a Skill that autonomously carries out attack and defense to intercept enemies. There’s no set reach to the intercepting flames.\nI have the advantage.\nIs what I should be thinking. Normally, that is.\nBut there’s no way the blade in her hand is an ordinary sword. She can likely alter its reach at will. Common sense doesn’t apply to Phantasm Armaments.\nNo,, even if she can’t change its form, I should expect such a thing. Predicting beforehand, or taking it as it comes will create a large gap in reaction timing.\nI concentrate on every step and action of my opponent.\nShe has no openings. She should have just carried out an intense battle with that Heard Lauder, but let alone fatigue, I couldn’t see a single scratch on her.\nI tried to fathom the reason for the fighting spirit in her eyes. What was there was the very same as mine… impatience.\nShe had just used the word ‘scrapped’.\nAs I thought, her goal is… the Castle of Shadows. It’s an idiotic tale, but the target of her gaze passed right through me.\nWhy is she so panicked? Why is she in such a rush?\n“Kanon, that over there is my prey.”\n“Heard Lauder…”\nI looked to the other devil who came to my side at some point in time.\nPure black eyes to look down on everything.\nJust as with Zebul, there wasn’t a wound carved on his body.\nWithout a single weapon, or the use of a single Skill, yet regardless ot that, I felt an oppressing weight pressed over me.\nAnd whose fault do you think it is that I ended up fighting her!?\nZebul’s frown intensified.\nBut still, there was no sorrow in her expression.\nAll that shined was her intent to kill. Before me, and the Rank one, her unclouded will was worthy of praise.\nBut at the moment, that was detestable enough for me to want to slay her.\nThe devil of hunder directed a dumbfounded look at the two of us.\n“… Fufu, now, now, I can’t say I approve of bullying the weak, you know? 『Prideful Kaiser』.”\n“Hm… I’ll admit it. Your desire is splendid. You are… my enemy.”\nHeard raised his power even higher. So the requirements for his pride were met.\nJust how high does it go? I can’t understand that man.\nCompared to that, Zebul seemed much better behaved than what I’d heard of her.\n“… I’ve no business with you guys. Are you sure there’s no way you’ll let me pass?”\n“Hm… a foolish query.”\nShe’ll pay the compensation for bringing shame to Leigie.\nThat’s what his earnest eyes were telling me.\nSilence.\nThere was no starting signal.\nPerhaps Heard’s fighting spirit made her give up on negotiations, as Zebul’s Mana swelled.\nAt the same time, her small stature kicked at the ground with all her might, and she flew forth like a bullet. In a single step, she surpassed the speed of sound. An impact rocked my body.\nThat blade of dusk that ate up light itself, extended like a snake. Its tip was aimed at me.\nIs she looking down on me? Wrong. Even with Zebul’s speed, it would be impossible for her to land any normal attacks on Heard.\nBut…\n“That’s the same as looking down on me…”\nI pushed the staff’s body into the floor, and back stepped before jumping into the sky.\nThe sword’s body shaved away at the ground I had been at before. The land broke down without the slightest of sound, and I found certainty that my own hypothesis had been correct.\nA dragon composed of fire spiraling around the body of my staff was released towards the ground to confront it.\nHellfire.\nThe jaw of that dragon made to turn all to ash closed down on Zebul and Heard altogether.\nAnd it was all sucked into that Fang of Origin. Without a clash of power or anything of the sort, a portion of the power I released was simply shaved away. As always, there’s no doubt that Gluttony is a step ahead when it comes to eating.\nBut my fire wasn’t just a straight line.\nSensing she couldn’t block it with the sword alone, before she was devoured whole, a black wave was released from Zebul’s body.they competed for a moment.\nAfter going through the slight bit of resistance, my flames reduced the darkness to cinders.\n“Tsk, what a pain!”\nZebul retreated even further.\nThe flames follow her, but their output decreases the more waves she releases. She was eating them.\nShe just couldn’t take them all in at once. Knowing that was plenty.\nInferring my will, my flying dragon took off, and caught my back in the air.\nI directed the staff below. I’ve no time to play around. I’ll just burn it all away from up high.\n“Looks like it’s unavoidable.”\nHaving easily evaded what was akin to a surprise attack from the stream of fire, Heard appeared behind Zebul.\nHi lowered his locked fists like a hammer.\nIt wasn’t a metaphor, the desert literally split apart. The earth let out a rumble incomparable to all the quakes I had heard before.\nEven from the sky, a massive and deep fissure had been carved into the ground.\nOn the unexpected spectacle, I swallowed my breath.\n“That can’t be…”\nHeard is scary.\nThe man who could do that barehanded was scary, but more than that…\n“Oww… you’re way too merciless…”\nEven after receiving an attack tat split the ground like that, Zebul’s continued existence showed off her extraordinary endurance.\nIt’s not like she didn’t take any damage. Her head had caved in, and her blood had stained the surrounding pebbles a dark red.\nBut even that… her broken cranium started regenerating as if rewinding a tape.\nRegeneration is fine. That’s a single skill of Gluttony. They could use the power they had eaten as a means to heal themselves.\nBut I can’t see the reason why she persists on. That one blow would have easily destroyed the cores of even Demon Lords above the average.\nJust… what did she eat?\nAnd I realized it. Heard had not been playing around.\nBecause of her tenacity, he wasn’t able to take her out despite his advantage.\nLike a tempest, consecutive attacks from all sides made sport of her small frame. Even when she brought out a sword, she was losing in a pure battle of close quarter combat. The one-hit-kill blade in her hand was completely pointless if it didn’t hit.\nEach and every one of those blows seemed to be accompanied by a flash of light, and even I couldn’t determine how many hits he had put into it.\nBut it’s not like Zebul was just quietly taking them. She received them by converging the tentacles sprouting from her body on single points.\nShe blocked them. The fact that she could do that meant her endurance wasn’t endless.\nI won’t let the chance Heard created get away.\n“I’m not sure where you got your hands on it… but I’ll reduce you to ash all the same.”\nIt’s useless.\nEven if that Vitality is… something you gained upon eating a slice of niisama.\nMy Ira can even burn away that Lord of Sloth.\nI summon countless bullets of fire, and pour them onto the ground like meteors.\nEach and every one of them should be lethal. They’ll turn all to ash without even leaving a Soul Core behind.\nThey’re not at a speed she couldn’t dodge, but their numbers made her extend her tentacles to knock them down.\nIt’s useless.\nI already know you can’t eat it all at once.\n“Gu…”\nZebul raised a scream.\nHer burned tentacles already regenerated. But I was sending down my fire at a rate exceeding that.\n“Go to hell!”\nThe feeling of raining these down from the sky was truly the worst. The way she was barely dealing with all of them was all the more irritating.\nAs I thought, that blade is dangerous. After sucking in fireball after fireball, it shows no hint of breaking or melting.\nIt’s a weapon that causes them to dissipate with a single touch.\nThere’s no doubt it’s a physical manifestation of her hunger.\nZebul used that sword, and dodged with as little movement as possible. Heard exceeded her, and got out without even being grazed.\nHe easily avoided the flames that would have burned through regardless of enemies or allies, and in just a step, he closed in on Zebul.\nOnly a tremor was left to prove the result.\nHeard’s eyes pierced through me. He was clearly pissed.\nThat malice of his would usually make my fighting spirit blaze up in order to try and stop him.\nBut fine, so be it. What a wonderful day it is.\nThat I can eliminate my enemies all together.\n“… Fine. I knew it would come to this one day. There’s no problem if I take care of it here and now.”\nIt’s fine as long as niisama isn’t to find out. Given the time, even this matter will eventually be forgotten.\nThe Devouring Lord lying flat on the ground leisurely rose.\nHer arms bent in an ominous direction and her crushed skull set off strange cracking sounds, as her small form returned to normal.\nWhat a monster.\nAs I thought, my power is necessary.\nThere’s no way I can let this monster enter the Castle of Shadows. As long as she lives, niisama’s peace will never be attained.\nAfter coming this far, I could understand. Annoyingly enough there was barely any difference in power between us.\nWith the sins we embraces differing to this degree, the battle wasn’t something to be decided by size of power, though.\nI summon my flame bullets again.\nI can’t call a single one my comrade. From up high, I looked down on the two Demon Lords.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 6: Irritum’s Vanagloria, Part 1: Not a God\nKeeping rank and file, those white wings lace the sky.\nFrom the earth well up those incarnations of desire, those to become God’s enemy.\nHeaven was already a crucible of chaos, of mingling light and darkness.\nWhile they had an absolute scarcity in number, and would originally never be able to form a large force, the Demons’ Legions already numbered more than a thousand.\nThey each took up on the backs of giant flying dragons greater in size than my own body, and raced across the skies that they hadn’t been permitted to step foot in before. It could even be taken as a forecast of the world’s end.\nThe air that had received God’s blessing was violated with miasma, and none of it gave off a sense of reality.\nAnd it wasn’t just these skies that the armies were flying about.\nBased on the signals from my comrades all over the land, the Demons of the underworld had formed factions to attack all of our Heaven.\nMine numbered five hundred. Even with the army ranked fifth within these holy lands…\nEven if our wings granted us the territorial advantage here…\nThe Demons came in numbers greater than we of Heaven could ever muster.\nDemons were wicked souls, dark minds smeared with avarice.\nIf you think of how human hearts were easier to turn to bad than good, it’s likely just a natural matter of life.\nThat’s why I cannot bear it.\nThose maggots creating this nauseous stench to waft about this Eden.\nWings are town off. An ominous whirlwind raced by in the gaps of the light.\nYet another of the Demons stationed behind me fell to the earth.\nThe irregular army numbering close to one thousand, and it boasted an exceptionally high amount of power.\nA man with jet-black hair sat atop a silver wyvern.\nRacing left and right about the Demon’s war, a commander. I could barely capture him in my field of vision, and among these piles of trash, he was the one with the greatest power.\n“Hm… so this is all they have. We’ve not even the need to bring trouble to Leigie-sama’s hands.”\n“…… !?”\nFrom the Angels rushing up to my rear, countless lights were released to brush out the darkness. For us, that were like God’s household, it was an act as simple as taking a breath of air.\nJudgement lightning to purify those masses of negative energy. Released without a sound, it filled the sky, and swallowed up that irregular army.\n… And, That was brushed off with nothing but a fist.\nThe army trembled. On that absurd pride. In fear. In awe.\nIt was originally something that never should have come to be. Something that was impossible.\nOur mission was to take down evil. To fulfill our raison d’être, we were to cast aside our emotions.\nMy sworn friend who ranked second in my army opened his eyes wide, and called to me in a grim voice.\n“Gloria, that man is…”\nI received the name of Glory from my God.\nI held up my hand to stop my friend, who seemed like he’d rush to join the battle at any moment.\nThe enemy army was too numerous. And that extraordinary man…\nHaving been created by God, we surely boast a greater amount of power than them. If it were to be one on one, there would be no way for us to lose.\nIf only we were to destroy that thing rushing about and tearing our light to pieces, the rest would only be a matter of time.\nI’ve not the time to be sunken into darkness of this level.\nI stake it on my name of Gloria, I cannot let this go on any further. I shall bring Glory to my God’s side.\nAn indescribable shout wracked the heavens.\nThe enemy army took position. Those Demons that originally should have been rushing at us to their hearts content were astonishingly quiet.\nHiding behind the back of their leader, they were nothing more than a bother. If only they gave us the space, we would be able to decrease their numbers, and shoot all of them down.\nBut that meant that the army’s strength, and command all fell to that single man.\nAnd so there’s but one measure to take. It’s simple.\nI turned my head to my comrade three heads higher than me. To the Angel with radiant eyes, and six heavenly wings on his back.\n“My friend… I leave the command to you. I’ll take down that one.”\n“Gloria… but…”\n“Speak not. Your commander is… me.”\nI am God’s greatest blade.\nNo matter how close we may be, I’ll have him obey my command.\nEven if I’m at a disadvantage, that level of power, and a soul of that extent, a normal Angel’s power… would never be able to stand to it.\nAnd in that case, I, the one brought forth by God to protect the throne, governing Glory and Justice Gloria Seidthroan will be his opponent.\n… In the place of my petty army being outdone by something like a Demon.\nFrom the blessed ten wings adorning my back, I released my power.\nWithout waiting for an answer from the man, I dashed forth. There’s no obstruction in the skies to these wings. In an instant, I had come before the man’s eyes.\nThe rising sun. A feeling of catharsis close to omnipotence refined my power.\nNow receive it if you will.\nThe virtue I govern… 『Iustitia』’s authority.\nI need no weapons. I directed the palm of my hand to the pitiful male Demon who didn’t even have any wings.\nEternal darkness, and the mud of destruction. You can just fall back to that place.\n“『Judgement Rain』”\nThe spears of lightening handed down to me by God filled the sky.\nThe man’s dark expression was swallowed up whole.\nAn Iustitia Skill.\nAmong the numerous authorities granted to Angels, it was the power most specialized in bringing ruin to Demons.\n“Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!”\nThis cathartic feel of turning it all to nill. An endless laughter gushed forth from my heart.\nThere’s no one to swing their fist before the Glory of God.\nNo matter how strong in power he may be, in the end, he’s just a negative soul. A filthy wingless mongrel fated to crawl about the earth.\nMy entire body was covered in a light even greater than before. That itself was the proof of my growth.\nThe proof that my justice had been recognized by God.\n“Gloria… don’t let your guard down.”\nMy friend behind me made an address with a stern face.\nHe was a heroic man who had fought a long time as the vanguard of God, but he was too much a worrier.\n“… That one is… strong.”\n“Affirmative. Among those maggots, he… was decent at least.”\nI turn my eyes to my front.\nNo need to be tense. He’s already gone. I’m not negligent. He’s already gone.\nThere’s no way for one who’d received God’s grace such as myself to face defeat, and absolute victory was in my hands.\nI stopped in midair.\nI folded my arms, and glared about the area from which the light had cleared away.\nMy 『Paradise Field』 Skill vividly grasped the presence of the man who was supposed to have been annihilated.\nHe was a measly man whose power quantity and quality both fell far below mine. Even among those Demons’ ranking system, he shouldn’t even be classified as a Lord.\nEven when compared to the Lords of Demons I had consigned to oblivion before, he should have been undoubtedly weaker.\nBut he was alive.\nIt only took an instant for the light to clear. Those standing proud before the swarm of Demons, my family were slightly disturbed.\n“So 『Judgement Rain』 doesn’t work. What an irritating man.”\nEven after taking up God’s rain of judgement upfront, his expression shoed no pain, and his body wasn’t damaged.\nThe man frowned a little, and gave a condescending glare. One head higher than my sworn comrade, the glare let out from that high stature was soaked in a temperature of absolute zero, and it wasn’t something a Demon of his rank should be sending at someone like me.\nThat look and bearing was something I had a recollection of. The sin embraced by a number of Demons I had purified.\n“So you’re a 『Superbia』.”\nI’ve hunted down more Demons than I can count. I have ample information on them.\nAn ability to erase another’s Skill, 『Overrule』.\nWhat impudence for him to act so overbearing before an emissary of God. They were the hardest to forgive of all those trash Demons out there.\nEven when his power was only that which would fly away if I blew on it, his body gave out a feeling of pressure far surpassing his Mana.\nThat pressure was something I had a slight recollection of, so I frowned, and observed.\nIts identity came to my mind in an instant.\nAh, that’s a form taken on by his willpower.\nIn the end, those bugs that haven’t even been blessed will become a large calamity if we leave them be.\nWhat a sad thing it is, for there to be a Superbia out to Overrule God’s Judgement.\nThe man seemed sophisticated. Yet he was a diminutive existence that needed to borrow the power of the dragons to even set foot in heaven.\n“… Hm. This is a pointless conflict, but at the very least, I’ll have you become an offering to my lord.”\n“Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha, you sure know how to make one laugh. No one lend a hand. This man is… my prey.”\nOn my laugh, the enemy army shook.\nThey trembled with fear. Your fate has run out here, at this very moment.\nI’ve destroyed hundreds, thousands of Demons. I activate a Skill I’ve used hundreds of times.\nThe light sharpens, and takes shape at the palm of my hand.\nWhat manifested was a pure-white sword… in order to cut down Demons, 『Sin Breaker』.\nI directed it at those unbearable soldiers who seemed to be under the misconception they could attain victory against God.\nSpeed. Maneuverability. Offensive power. Territorial Advantage.\nIn these skies, all of them lay with me.\n“If you think you can Overrule the Power of God, then…”\nAll creation came to a stop.\nIn a split second, I circled around to the man’s rear. Not the wyvern, nor the man, nor even any of my men could follow me with their eyes.\nReceiving my 『Iustitia』, the sword let off a dull light.\nRight, if he can overcome the might of God, then I myself will…\n“… In God’s place, I’ll deliver heavenly retribution unto you.”\n＊＊＊＊＊\nOww…\nThe depths of my head hurt. My dreams of the past were eating into my present reality.\nI slowly opened my eyes.\nThere’s no sound. There’s barely any light. That thin ink-like darkness was what illuminated the room.\nNo matter how much time passed, the dark was the only thing I could never get used to.\n“Damn 『Kaiser』…”\nNo matter how much I hate him, it isn’t enough. No matter how much will I bring up to kill him, my emotions won’t clear up.\nWhat still existed in the depths of my memory was what despised above all else.\nOver the space of many years, that name that had receded to a corner of my memory gained color, and floated up like a bubble of soap. The reason was clear.\n“Rank One… The Prideful Kaiser, Heard Lauder, is it…”\nHow useless.\nIt’s true that the wall between general and Lord is a severe one. But staying as a General Class, he was a Demon who had power rivalling the Lords of Heaven.\nNow as a Lord, I seriously wonder just how much power he’s amassed.\nEven if Rank One was an excessive position for him, there’s no doubt he’s a superior Demon Lord.\nI was sure I was already gone and done with that matter from long ago.\nSo why is it that that the Soul Core in my chest is acting up once more?\nThere was no one about to listen to the words I threw out.\nI raised myself from the large canopied bed.\nIt was a vast bed, where even my two meter build could lie, but in my current state, it might be a little too wide.\nAround the bed stood a number of humanoid forms.\nWordlessly, they merely looked over me with their glass-ball-like eyes. Countless Demons. Men, women, all ages. An infinite variety. Their beat was a little faint, but each and every one of them was a Demon.\nI’m not sure where I had gone wrong.\nNo, I didn’t care that something had gone amiss, but I couldn’t determine what to do next.\nMy wings of light that had once shone so bright were now so dark and wet. This fallen one no longer had any allies, and all that was left was this body itself.\n“Ku ku ku ku…”\nBut that’s fine. This body is more than enough to serve my purpose.\nGod and friends, and even followers are… unnecessary.\nMy body aside, there’s but a single thing I need.\nI directed the palm of my hand towards one of the Demons standing about like dolls.\nBack when I embraced 『Iustitia』, this was definitely not a Skill I desired. But as long as I have it…\nEven if… it is the means of a Demon.\nI spread out the five sets of wings garnishing my back.\nNo, I didn’t really care about the reason.\nI’m already a Demon. Then… there should be no hesitation in me to carry out my desire.\nNow, Heard Lauder. Is it not the time for us to settle that match we were never able to before?\nI’ll teach your body the meaning of defeat.\nAnswering to my will, the eyes of those around produced a dull light.\nThe countless subordinates surrounding me all bowed at once with mechanical precision.\nThe darkness coating them was strong enough to override their Sin, and blow away their sense of self. It temporized their souls.\nNot of God, but of my power alone…\n“Oh wicked ones, perish by my justice.”\nOutside the seven sins held by Demons.\nIn the distant past, when I had been brought to the same level as those I derided as maggots, merely using it made me nauseous, The authority of the greatest of fiends.\nWhen I fell to Demonhood without even understanding the reason, it was what I had held from the start.\nAnd I naturally came to understand that authority’s name.\nOf 『Irritum』.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 6: Irritum’s Vanagloria, Part 2: The Glory I Once Embraced\nFall.\nOr so my instincts whispered to me. To trample over all aspects of creation, and put them beneath me.\nThe emotions higher than ever I felt when I was a Lord of Angels often heightened themselves, but they would never settle down.\nThat’s exactly why I’m here.\nAs I sat with my hips to the pitch black throne, a single man knelt before me.\nI’m at the summit of Demon Lords.\nThe Demon of Envy dispatched by Kanon of ruined kneeled as he directed a sharp glare at me.\n“Your excellency, what seems to be bothing you?”\n“… ‘Tis a trifling matter.”\nMy subordinate lined up perfectly in the throne room raised not a sound.\nAmong them there was only one that I couldn’t openly lay hands on. The only one able to speak.\nI’ve heard the man before me who was sent to observe was quite a skilled Demon.\nThere were five observers sent to me in total. Of them, this man was the one who had the most opportunities of coming into contact with me.\nThe vice chief of the Great Demon King’s personal military body known as the Order of Black. Eins Grayrol.\nHe had high abilities, even when compared to my subordinates, a General Class Demon.\nHe meaning behind her sending an 『Invidia』 to watch me, I could only laugh upon seeing through that little girl’s intent.\nGreat Demon King, Kanon Iralaude.\nEven if she had power, she was a Demon who hadn’t even lived ten thousand years, and she was severely lacking in experience. There were plenty of ways to do it.\nIf you want to try to control me, then it isn’t numbers you need… send in a Demon Lord Class observer, or we won’t be getting anywhere.\nIn a succinct tone, with considerable hostility packed into his eyes, he directed his gaze at me.\nBut he didn’t pay mind to anything else.\nWhat he once held when he was first dispatched here, that unease he got from my doll-like men had long disappeared from within him.\n“Your excellency, there is a single matter I wish to inquire towards…”\n“… I’ll allow it.”\n“Yes. Recently, it seems the number of soldiers in your Legion has been decreasing ever so slightly, but are you aware of this matter?”\nA small shadow occasionally flashed through the man’s eyes. That was the light of doubt.\nThere’s nothing you could call sincerity among Demons.\nA foolish question. My army exists for no other purpose than to answer to me.\nI’ve already issued orders to those forces stationed all over my lands.\n“I’ve dispatched the army.”\n“!? … Why? At present, there should not be a hostile force anywhere around your territory.”\nCorrect. I fear not the power of that Heard Lauder, and anyone else who would set foot on my soil are akin to nothing.\nIf there was a single possibility for me to fear, it would be that maiden, circling about and crushing Demon Lords.\nBut that isn’t enough. That isn’t nearly enough.\nI know the power of a Valkyrie. Even if she be on the level capable of crushing Lower Level Demon Lords, she won’t be able to touch that Prideful Kaiser.\nNo, more so, I doubt she’d even be able to stand up to that Iralaude.\nHer attributes were too low. Lower Ranks were one thing, but she was nothing but a trifle to us.\nStill, in that case this’d never work out.\nRejoice, Valkyrie. I’ll give you some achievements.\n“Ku ku ku, Angels…”\nOn those words, Eins’ features shifted into a questioning expression.\nIn silence, he blinked a few times. With a voice tinged with caution, he went on.\n“An… gels…? I deeply apologize. I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say…”\n“I doubt not your ignorance. Now’s not the time.”\nYes, you’ll understand soon enough.\nI directed the palm of my hand.\nI didn’t even have the need to bind him with my Evil Eyes. Vice chief? Useless. The caution of a Demon of this level can’t even be called as such.\nI activated a Skill.\nAn uplifting feeling no different from the exaltation I felt when using the power of God I embraced raced about my body like lightning.\nAt the man’s back, a dark fog began to gather.\nIn a silent stupor, his expression hardened as that darkness gathered before his eyes, and covered the upper half of his face.\nThe man didn’t raise a scream. His posture didn’t change in the slightest, and only his facial expression twitched mildly in fear.\nAs if he realized he was forgetting something important.\n“… Yes, I beg forgiveness for my rudeness… It was about the Angel attack incident, correct?”\n“Correct. You may go report to Kanon Iralaude now.”\nThe Angel Attack.\nA flock of Angels had suddenly launched an attack on the town of Grey Rock.\nGrey Rock was a town on the border of the Dark and Crimson Prisons.\nThe Dark Prison. In the past, it was under the control of the Great Demon of Sloth, Leigie Slaughterdolls, and right now, that vast land was placed under Heard Lauder’s jurisdiction. With three times the area of the Crimson Prison, it was exceedingly vast, and that was to an extent where even Heard’s zone was unable to cover the entire thing.\nEins’ eyes distorted.\n“… For me to forget such a thing… it appears I’m a little tired… I will report… swiftly…”\n“Ku ku, a foolish man.”\nI lifted my palm again.\nIt’s unnecessary. Your unease, and your questions are unneeded.\nNow just forget everything, and give your little report.\nI activated up another Skill. Third on Irritum’s Skill Tree. One to coat over the truth with fabrication.\n“『Outer Rewrite』”\nThat muddy darkness ate into the man’s memory, and covered up his original motive.\nLike a wall of paper, the Status Abnormality skill was easily breached.\nIt was all too simple. While a Demon Lord may be able to put up some resistance to it, a General could only muster a soft push.\nWithout changing his expression once, he emotionlessly looked thought over what had been overwriten.\nI don’t know why I gained something like this.\nI don’t, but if it is to exist, then I’m just going to put it to use.\nIn order to make those Demons I’m supposed to despise into my tools.\nI waited a little for his mind to smooth over, before addressing him.\n“It’s a simple matter, is it not? Noy go forth, loyal apostle of the Great Demon King.”\n“Yes, I’ll go… and report.”\nEins left. I watched him off.\nEven while my eyes were following him, my mind was occupied by one thing alone. Of my sworn enemy from the past.\nI stood, and looked up at the ceiling.\nThe emotional voice that gushed up from the depths of my soul were released from my mouth.\n“HEARD LAUDEEEEEEEERRRRR!!”\nIn this throne room without another capable of thought, only my wail resounded.\nWhy, why is it? Why does my sentiment extend to this extent!?\nI never felt this for the past few tens of thousands of years, and yet why is it exploding out of my come this far in time?\nIf I just wanted to destroy him, if I merely regretted having failed to kill him, then all of this would have been easier had I acted before he became a Demon Lord, so why now!?\n“Ku ku ku ku ku.”\nI naturally poured out a sneer.\nIn response to that, the systematically lined up thoughtless army raised an ovation.\n“Vanity! Vanity! Vanity!”\nIt didn’t make me happy at all. I’m not sure whether the chills I felt racing around my body were fighting spirit, or fear.\nIn order to learn that, I’ll have to make him face defeat.\nI’ll take down his 『Pride』 with my deceit.\nFive sets of wings sprung from my back.\nIn the past, they were enveloped by a white phosphorescence, but now black mud molded their shape.\nAt the same time, the worn out body I had hastily made for the time being crumbled away into mist. It was the shape of a militaristic man I had mockingly devised.\nI looked at my palm. It was my original body, half that large man’s size, of back when I was still an Angel.\nNot specializing in physical strength, but magic, the body known as the 『One who Protects the Throne』 was always disguised as Vanity that I was starting to wonder which one of my shapes was the true disguise.\n“Now, stand before me, my beloved maggots.”\nMy subordinates silently assumed their position in the line. To the swarm of Demons who had lost their wills, and had their desires overridden, I directed my palm.\nHe is strong. I know that.\nEven within this Demon World, Heard Lauder’s strength was heresy. Going at him straight on is close to impossible.\nHis ability allowed him to escape my hand when he had yet to even become a Lord. Now that he’s reached Demon Lord Level, it will be all the more difficult.\nAnd that’s why my authority lives on.\n“… I’ll grant the sky to you.”\nIrritum is to hide truth, and make it meaningless.\nI activate a Skill.\nTheir cores. Just the cores are enough.\nThese low ranking Demons are of no use at all. So I’ll be the one to give them power.\nTheir existence will take to the air for my sake.\nNow dance to my tune if you will.\n“『Outer Decorate』”\nAs I invoked the Skill, the Demons’ bodies started to bubble.\nThey were diminutive existences. And to conceal that fact, the wriggling darkness took them in, and it only took a few seconds for them to take shape.\nOut of lumps of mud, wings begin to form.\nPure white wings.\nThe masks that had been covering their eyes also turned white, and expanded to cover their entire faces.\nWhat was standing before me was Angels.\nTheir power was a fabrication, yet a reality. That ostentation was great enough to fool even the world.\nThere was no difference from what was dwelling in their bodies to the power of light. Therefore, that power existed for them to bring ruin to Demons.\nThe power to brush away the darkness had been brought forth from a Demon’s ability.\nThat’s why I had no need to argue with the power I had been granted. There’s no way the beings born from me could be anything else.\n“Justice… is it…”\nWhat resided in their body was the authority of『Iustitia』 I once held.\nBut at this point, that was a word without meaning.\nStill, to kill Demons, there was no better suited ability.\nThose wings constructed from the blood stained darkness began to shine like light itself.\nStrangely enough, the expressions of those inorganic hardened forms of my vanity were barely any different from those subordinates that followed my lead when once I took God’s will to heart without question.\nBetween Angels and Demons, there wasn’t a single difference.\nFrom when I was an Angel in service to God, to now with no one to follow, all that I had lacked was an absolute sense of self.\nIt merely piled up. The glory I once embraced.\nIt merely piled up. The sins I built up after I fell.\nI don’t care whether it’s a fake or a lie. The truth is meaningless before my objective.\nPower requires a compensation. Decorations require a base.\nMana, power, desires, they all drain out whenever I use a Skill. But even that was something I only experienced as joy.\nIn proportion to that, my troops became more and more beautiful. With that deceptive light forged of darkness.\nCreating Angels was the work of God.\nThen even if it be transient, for me to be able to do that, there’s no doubt I’m closer to God than ever I was with those white wings on my back.\nWhen I was part of the vanguard of the sky, I had power. Overwhelming power, God’s love, justice.\nHow ironic. Even after falling to Demonhood, that power hasn’t fallen in the slightest.\nNo, more than that…\nI licked my lips.\nHeavenly troops need a leader. To create a sense of crisis in this land of Demons, a considerable amount of power is necessary.\nI selected one from the line, and stacked on even more fabrication.\nBefore long, an Angel with enough light to call excessive was completed.\nI can’t have my power use itself up. Even if he may be lower class among Saint Lords, there should be no hindrance to the destruction of Demons.\nThe soul colored by Irritum.\nThe glittering light it gave was the color of an Angel’s, and I found that terribly irritating.\nWithout letting out a single voice, the Angel stood there.\nA shite mask to cover the face. But under that, no expression existed.\nOn these lands, a presence of light stands out. With the Abyss Zone Skill, their natures would be sensed from a long ways away. If I stayed by their sides, I could eliminate their presence with Skills, but that will become difficult if we separate.\nNo, even if that isn’t the case… these Angels cannot reside in heaven.\nJust as I once did to command my troops, I raised my hand to the sky outside the window.\nThat sky of chaos stained in a bloody red.\n“Conquer.”\nThe line of Angels all flew out at once.\nBut in my heart, not a single feeling of nostalgia surfaced.\nEven when that scene surely resembled when I was still an Angel, the world I saw back then.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 6: Irritum’s Vanagloria, Part 3: Each and Every Desire Should Just be Devoured\nBoth Demons and Angels had instincts.\nDemons and Angels were just right souls and wrong souls. Between them, there was an instinct for them to reject the others’ existence.\nAn incomprehensible feeling of impatience that would rock the soul just by having one next to another.\nUnable to stand an encounter without trying to kill one another, it could be called a second Desire.\nBefore my eyes, 『Vanity』 was blown away.\nI saw the built up months and years of training behind the speed of that punch.\nEven that body I had modified to be able to stand up to a Demon Lord’s might , that impregnable fortress of a body was torn apart without being given a chance to react.\nRegardless of its truth, not even its soul core remained.\nAs I thought, the position of Rank One was no decoration.\nDammit, Heard Lauder.\nHis power was greater than I anticipated. Going at him head on is… nothing more than a stupid move.\nI am in no way a warrior. My goal isn’t conflict, but victory.\nNot the process, but the glory. From the start, that man was a beast. I’ve no intent to exchange blows with such a brute.\nIt’s precisely because of their Pride, that Pride Demons are full of weaknesses. That guy’s weakness was especially clear.\nI’ve already determined my thoughts on the matter.\nBut before that…\nAfter Heard ran off to chase Zebul, I walked up in front of the clueless girl he left behind.\nShe was a young lass with golden hair, and an impertinent expression on her face.\nOblivious to the world, unknown to tragedy, and without any foundation she was one that looked down on everything in creation. Her condescending expression made my skin crawl.\nWhile humming a merry tune, she calmly walked through the lines of soldiers, and regardless of the fact that she hadn’t done a single thing herself, I didn’t feel te slightest hint of indebtedness in her.\nI believe Heard called her Hiero. She was cowering behind Heard during the meeting as well.\nShe was an existence so helplessly weak I couldn’t fathom why that man chose to drag her along.\nI hate fools and weaklings.\nIt’s always been that way. Both Angels and Demons regardless.\nFor both those Demons that only pursued their desires, and thought everything could be solved with an exchange of blows, and those mindless dolls that thought all they had to do was listen in to God’s orders.\nWhy is it that I… have to play part to something useless like that?\nThey’re the ones who should be learning their place.\nBy the time I noticed it, I was staring fixatedly at her form.\nEven when her power was one that would go out if I blew on it, her recklessness on staying in this place was the very thing I hated about Demons of Pride.\nThen, if it’s like that… right.\nHow about I… give you some wisdom.\n“Mm? What is it…?”\nI extended the arm of the Demon closest to her.\nHaving her shoulder grabbed, Hiero turned with a blank expression. Her face indicated she believed there wasn’t a single thing to harm her here.\nWith nothing but pure curiosity, she looked deep into the single Demon’s mask.\nIt was a humanoid Demon with a large build. The upper half of his face was covered up by a grey mask.\nThat mask wasn’t just some accessory.\nCovering their faces, their expressions, held meaning.\nOne’s expression was their individuality itself, and by hiding it away, I could bring about changes in their psyche.\nIt was a means to overwrite their measly spirits with an image of strength.\nIt was a single ritual.\nA way to paint out right and wrong and Angels and Demons with chaos.\n“Oh, could it be that you guys can actually move without orders? Kusu kusu kusu… I had thought of you all as nothing but dolls.”\nEven when grasped by one two heads higher than her, Hiero’s expression as she looked up at his face was a bright smile.\nHis arm let out a dull sound as it broke. But the face of the woman who did such a thing didn’t seem to hold the slightest interest in what she had done.\nAs one who also governed Pride, I had a clear grasp on what power she held.\nUnbefitting that soul of hers, a powerful 『Overrule』 Skill.\nAh, how surprising it is.\nWithout a fragment of understanding as to just what she was talking to, Hiero widened her smile, and tilted her head.\n“And, what is it you need?”\n… But how interesting.\nA sharpened soul.\nThe power hidden in it had far surpassed her own self. That『Overrule』, the very definition of pride… just what basis does it act on?\nAnd why is Heard dragging a useless woman like this about?\n“Interesting…”\n“!?”\nThe arm was released, and Hiero instinctively retreated a distance.\nThe pride on her face from before vanished, and a stiff expression looked over me.\n“W-who are you!? What’s this all of a sudden!?”\nThe eyes of this girly who hadn’t even lived through a tenth of my life inspected my body quite rudely.\nWhile she did seem wary, she didn’t even get stanced for battle. I’m not sure whether that was supposed to be her Pride or not.\nOr perhaps it was her bearing that didn’t even see enemies as enemies that formed the mold for her firm mindset.\nI touched the mask covering my own field of vision.\nIt was a cold sensation in my hand… the gray mask sunk away without a sound.\n“… Hah…? What are you supposed to be… are you Vanity-san’s… subordinate?”\n… Fool.\nThe ability to even paint over the presence of my own soul, and conceal myself from search Skills was Irritum’s greatest advantage. Even a Demon Lord’s Abyss Zone was unable to pick me up.\nRather than Superbia, whose output rose the more one showed themselves off, the authority of Irritum was one to hide one’s self, yet still decorate it. Truly one suited to resourcefulness.\nI ignored the girl’s panic, and started observing again.\nRight, no matter how I look at her, I can only see a frail Demon.\nWhile she did, more or less, have a strong ability to 『Overrule』, that level wasn’t at Demon Lord Class, and if I had to say, her only real special point was the very fact Heard was taking her around. Even if I did absolutely nothing, she was an ant-like existence that could easily be crushed by my army.\nThat confidence against enemies she knew she could beat, and this dismay against the unknown. Her body was unconsciously preparing to take flight… I don’t think she’s even a warrior, this one.\nA demon I’m surprised to find anywhere near Heard’s side. Just what part of her tugged at his heartstrings?\nI can’t even possibly see her as someone that battle enthusiast would fall in love with.\nWhatever the case, that’s all irrelevant to me.\nWhat’s important is… if this girl can work as Heard Lauder’s weakness.\nI cast aside the thoughts surfacing within me at once.\nNo, I doubt she’d do any of that. There’s no way she would. If he could be destroyed that easily, he’d have been killed off at a time long passed.\nMy interest is starting to escape me.\nWhile she certainly was an interesting woman, no matter what sort of existence she was, she was irrelevant to Heard Lauder’s impending destruction. Seeing the way she stuck by his side and followed, I can’t even see her as an assistance, but more than anything, this girl… is too young.\nShe wasn’t even a pebble by the wayside. A single Demon whose life or death wouldn’t bring about any influence at all.\nI ignored Hiero, as she directed scared eyes without even a hint of fighting spirit, and used a Skill.\nA dark grey light covers my entire body.\nThe authorities of Superbia and Irritum.\nMy Mana becomes my armor. To pass by all of creation, and bring about a miracle.\nWith my soul at the base, I create the form of a hero.\nI show off. My own power.\nI pile it up. Only to some day show it off to the world.\n… To look down on the high and distant heavens.\nIrritum held a contrary nature to Pride, but at the same time, they both held but a single place to aim for.\n… Higher than, greater, than anyone in all the lands.\nSurpass God, and look down on him.\nI understood. From the time when I was the one protecting his throne.\nIn truth, I had always understood it. Just why it was I became a Demon.\n“Ku ku ku ku.”\nThe reason was that I… subordinates alone, I don’t even remember the name of my only sworn friend in the world.\nI must have been strong. My desires had exceeded my loyalty to my God. That’s all it was.\n“Hah ha ha ha ha!!”\nAs light ran all about my body, a pleasant feeling akin to intoxication went through my mind.\nIt covers up each and every part of my body. Even if it were to be a body of fiction, it did contain my own soul.\nI was already more accustomed to the body I had used for many years than my own real body.\nHow many years has it been that I even laid my own form bare? It’s already beyond my memory. I doubt there are many out there that even remember my original body.\nMy white skin turns black.\nMy golden eyes to silver. I lost my argent hair, and gained a height that exceeded even that man.\nMy breasts that were nothing but a hindrance were covered over with muscle, and the pitch wings on my back were hidden away.\nMore ominous, more exaggerated, and more strong.\nAn impulse like an electric current flowed through me.\nThat which I could never get used to no matter how many times I did it was, to put it simply…\n… An almighty sensation.\n“Hii…”\nHiero’s dumbfounded expression warped along with her increased understanding of the situation.\nHer face was one as if she were peering into the cauldrons of hell.\nNow, to you who holds not the slightest of roles in this play, let me give you glory.\nGlory to stand up against your own lord.\nI grabbed the arm of the girl, whose expression was still quite stiff.\nThose arms were so slender, it felt that if I gripped them any harder, they would break. I lfted her up into the air.\nAs if remembering something, fear colored her face, and her limbs flailed about, but that resistance is futile.\nNone of those punches or kicks can do a single thing to this body. That was the difference in our abilities. My buildup of years made the distance between us something akin to an adult and an infant. I’m not something to break under the Overrule of the like of you.\nWith her body still in hand, I pushed her against a collapsing wall.\nI ignored her hand’s attempts to wriggle free, and looked into her blue eyes.\nIn order to scoop up whatever emotions she held within them.\n“Guh… Wh… why are you alive… N-no, that form from before was…”\nA gray light circled around my hand.\nTo pretty up the mud with gold, and repaint her existence.\nHer body, her soul, her power, her meaning, her memory… her being.\nThe mask was to denote a Persona.\nA mask of the soul to show off one’s personality, it was easily able to cover up whatever mask they wore before.\nI won’t change her form.\nI doubt Heard Lauder’s ever going to hold back, but there’s the million-to-one chance he might be mildly disturbed.\nI may be able to sway his emotions.\nI grasped her had with the palm of my hand.\n“N-no, unhaaaand me! What? Are you saying I did something to you!?”\nHer body kicks around some more to offer some pointless resistance.\nAnd on her futile plight, I was momentarily taken in silence.\nSeriously, why was that man keeping this girl at his side? There isn’t a hint of pride in her pitiful behavior.\nFor one who prioritizes hubris over all, she should be the type he hates most.\nPerhaps it was my error to sink to silence, as Hiero started letting out words like a turbulent gale.\n“I-in the first place, the one who attacked was Heard-san, right!? D-definitely not me. I didn’t do nuffin!! P-please forgive me. I didn’t even have the time to stop him or anything! H-honest. I really did think about stopping him… r-right. If you try laying hands on me, my master won’t keep quiet, you know!?”\nUnsightly. It was just so unsightly that I didn’t even feel any contempt.\nYou’re seriously trying to threaten me here?\nCan your fear fulfill the desire in your heart?\n“This is my… Irritum’s… 『Outer Decorate』!!”\n“Kuh…”\nHiero opened her eyes wide in fear. Her body was assailed by shivers akin to convulsions.\nMatching her emotions of terror, her eyes talked to me.\nFear, reverence, panic, flattery.\nDance on my palms. Become my doll.\nThe young girl’s slim figure shook. As if to crawl into the depths of her body, a deep gray light encroached her.\nNo matter how much a hopeless weakling she may be, if I decorate her, she’ll at least be able to buy some time.\nI didn’t make a mask for her. That would have stood out too much. Also, if I go as far as to cover up her eyes, then perhaps Heard Lauder won’t even recognize her as Hiero. I don’t change her personality or memory either.\n… What I plant in her is loyalty. Absolute devotion to me was appended to her nature.\nAround her finger, light gathers in the place of a mask, and a single boorish ring took shape.\nIt didn’t matter what it was. There’s no doubt that to bring changes to one’s personality, a mask to cover the face held the greatest efficiency, but for a Demon of her level, I don’t even have to use one.\nShe gave one last large convulsion, before she ceased movement.\nHer sloppily lowered arms held no vigor, and on her pale features, her eyes sluggishly closed themselves.\nI release my hand. I ignore former-Hiero as she fell onto the ground, and turned to my army.\nNo will to speak of. Over a perpetual amount of time, the souls whose glory I’ve piled up.\nNow, Heard Lauder. You who’ve dragged me down from Heaven.\nA few tens of thousands of years passed, let’s have another meet.\nA will I never had before offered power to my body.\nI surveyed my troops gathered around.\nI have no right hand man.\nIn my army, everyone was everyone, and they were my power in itself.\nThat means, that all were all, and all were me. An individual, yet Legion.\nSensing my will, the military body lined up next to their mounts.\nRegardless of what form they may be in, what was before me was undoubtedly the Legion of a Demon Lord. I nodded.\nThe masked Demons let out a quiet, wordless battle cry.\nThe delicate body prostrated on the ground lifted itself.\nWhat was once an existence known as Hiero sent a hollow gaze in my direction.\n“The Prideful Kaiser, and the Devourer, I’ll swallow you all in my sin.”\nFor the Devouring Lord, who once ate up a countless number of my brethren.\nWho I let escape, and who became the trigger for my fall, the Lord of Pride.\nThose frail Angels who protected the silence while knowing of Demons.\nThat pitiful Valkyrie who had been attacking this area as of late by chance.\nFor enemies… they’re worthy enough.\nI already have the preparations in order.\nNow, let me cover all creation in my deception.\nHaving been effected by unconsciously soaking up my power, the residents of Grey Rock peered at me from the windows with colorless eyes.\nNear me, a Demon leading along a conspicuously large Dragon kneeled.\n“Vanity-sama, your Dragon has been prepared.”\n“… Huh?”\nNormally, that voice shouldn’t have been there.\nWhat was there was the Demon I had just decorated.\nI glared.\nHer voice as she kneeled didn’t hold the slightest hint of indebtedness, and her frame and hair and eyes and voices and powers hadn’t changed in the slightest bit from before.\n“What are you supposed to be?”\n“Pleasure to meet you, Vanity-san. I’m called Hiero.”\nI wasn’t asking for your name.\nI’m sure I overwrote part of her personality. I didn’t make a mask, so it wasn’t perfect, but I did add on to her nature. I never thought that she would be capable of conversation so quickly.\nThe ring of Irritum I produced was unmistakably intertwined around Hiero’s right index finger.\nI’m not sure what she was thinking, but the fear on her expression from before had disappeared.\nBoth her face and posture were the epitome of superficiality. It was much removed from the form I had anticipated. Was her affinity with the Skill exceptionally good?\nIn the few tens of thousands of years since I began using Irritum, it’s a scene I’m witnessing for the first time. Even so, as long as I’ve forced her loyalty, I can’t think she’ll go against me.\nIt was an unexpected reaction. Should I just destroy her now, or leave her be?\nThere’s not even the need to think of it. This turning point is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I can’t be paying so much mind to a trifle of this level.\n“Is your master not Heard Lauder?”\n“No, the one I serve… is surely not Heard Lauder.”\nI looked down over her as she said that without hesitation.\nI didn’t feel the cover of falsehood over her words.\nHmm… this is but another bit of entertainment, I guess.\nThe greater the forces the better. The stronger the structre, the more stable.\nI doubt I’ll need a shield, but having one should be better than not. Of all else, I already gave her a portion of my power anyways.\nNo matter how great my power may be, it is my no means unlimited.\nOf all else, I already brought forth three Sacred Lords, and a countless number of normal Angels.\nI should keep as many forces as possible on hand.\n“So be it. Follow if you will.”\n“… Understood.”\nMy army mounted atop their dragons raised a tremor as they dashed forth.\nI already know where they are. Those huge colliding powers were something I could sense, perhaps even if I didn’t use my Abyss Zone. It would be harder for me to ignore that those presences stirring up my soul.\nThe moment I put myself over my own dragon, Hiero called out again.\n“… What?”\n“… Vanity-sama, for your purposes, I do believe that rather than a beast to race across the earth, a flighted one would be to your benefit. Clashing with that man from the front is a poor choice of move. Even if he be the Prideful Kaiser, he has not the widest variety of strikes to launch across the sky.”\n“… You’re the one that brought this flightless dragon to my side, are you not?”\n“No… I mean… I never thought you would be bringing me along, so…”\n“…”\nI felt my own brows become stiff.\n… No seriously, why did that man take her along?\nAfter she disappeared from my field of vision with natural movements as if to run away, Hiero returned with a flying dragon.\nIt was likely the one she had used to transport herself here. As expected of the possession of Rank One, it had a splendid build.\nWith movements as if to try raising my affection points towards her, she closed in, and pulled on my arm.\nThat utter lack of anything resembling Pride made my pity well up before my anger had a chance.\nNo, perhaps it’s something I brought about with the power of my Skills…? If that’s the case, then really, I apologize. No, no…\n“Now, now, Vanity-san, over here.”\n“… Yeah, fine.”\nWhile feeling somewhat unsatisfied, I put myself over the flying dragon.\nFollowing that, she boarded a smaller… Flying Dragon, likely for her own use.\nOddly enough, it made me associate the scene with the form of Hiero cowering behind Heard.\nI should have just killed her without using any power…\nThis personality of hers…\nI started imagining a spectacle of Heard crushing this girl without a moment’s hesitation, and my own expression naturally distorted.\n＊＊＊＊＊\nThe town of Grey Rock was close to the Dark Prison. For ground dragons specialized in land transport, and for flying dragons that rivalled them in speed, we were able to set foot into those lands in little time at all.\nFrom the start, Grey Rock had been a town stationed on a national border, and it was once the front most line of the conflicts between the hostile Demons of both lands. It was also one of the few of such towns that remained after both the Crimson and Dark Prison were taken in under the Great Demon King’s army.\nHeaven and the Demon world were heads and tails. In contrast to the world up there carefully governed by law and order, this Demon World was rampant with disorder.\nOn contrast to the scarcity of their activity, the great Demons Heard Lauder, and his former master, Leigie Slaughterdolls of the 『Slaughterdolls』 were Demons of power much too vast.\nWhile I could tell his strength partly from how that Prideful Kaiser who thought nothing of God served him for such a long time, what clearly demonstrated his strength was the extensity of his Zone, that was able to cover the entirety of the Dark Prison several times larger than my Crimson Prison.\nThe extent of his 『Abyss Zone』 was likely the greatest within the King’s Army. The current Great Demon King, and even the one before her couldn’t extend theirs anywhere near his territory, which was already worthy of being called a single world.\nIt was much too vast, too powerful. There are even rumors that it had never been broken by a hostile Demon Lord, and many suspected that it wasn’t just through pure Mana, but through the as-of-yet unknown nature of Acedia Skills that granted enhancements to it, but the only one to know the truth of the matter is the Lazy King himself.\nThe Zones were pretty much a Demon Lord’s turf.\nBy touching it, or even getting close, the oppressing feeling that ran through one’s entire body was something like a threat brought about by the land’s ruler.\nAnd that fact that Leigie’s territory had absolutely nothing like that was one of the few pieces of information I held about that Lord of Sloth, as the owner of a neighboring territory.\nBut I mustn’t forget. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t hold any hostility.\nIt simply meant… that he had no interest, and that’s all it was.\nWhen I entered the Dark Prison, I felt a differing presence cover my body without the slightest resistance.\nThe proof I had infiltrated a Zone.\nThe presences of Heard’s Pride, and Zebul’s Gluttony, and at the base of the two of them, Leigie’s characteristic air of Sloth.\nIn the extent of this endless desert, I couldn’t see the form of any life yet.\n“Ku ku ku… we’re close.”\nBut I understood.\nEven if I closed my eyes, I could tell.\nThe distance to Zebul. The Distance to Heard.\nIt was something that my soul, my instincts sought out. What they’d been seeking for many years.\nIt was… the presence of an enemy.\nThat urge that didn’t able, even for a Fallen Angel, was definitely not something from the instincts of an Angel, but something that existed because I was me.\nZebul’s presence was stopped. Regardless of how far she was from the Castle of Shadows.\nIt looks like she didn’t bring along that Greed Demon from before, and there didn’t seem to be any lifeforms around them.\nShe should have just rushed her way through while this land’s guardian was away at the meeting, but did she really believe my words? Or could it be that she noticed Heard’s presence leve the Dark Prison?\nZebul no longer has an option of escape. She was already within Heard Lauder’s range. Once you’ve stepped into the extent of that man’s Zone, you’ll never be able to flee from his power.\nThe distance between them was something that Lord of Pride could span in a number of seconds.\nNaturally, the fact she had stopped before that inmistakable presence was likely because she understood that fact as well.\nIt would by difficult to intercept him on the run. She plans to meet him in the middle.\nI remembered Zebul’s eyes.\nThose eyeballs of hers were soaked in a bottomless hell of desire. That color wasn’t something anyone could let out so easily.\nIf it were to satisfy that longing of hers, then no method in the world would be beyond her.\nRanking wasn’t so simply linked to strength. Especially with that beast Zebul… the ultimate predator who would even suck up the world.\nAnd while they’re clashing like that, an opening is sure to be created.\nEven if they’re fakes… Angels painted to life by my Irritum still held the same movement speed as the real thing.\nWhile he’s busy dealing with Zebul, my army will break into the Castle of Shadows.\nThat was the prideful weakness of Heard Lauder. The existence that was once his ruler.\nHis source. Even with his personality, it wasn’t something he would be able to permit.\nRiding atop my flying dragon, Hiero, who was riding behind me raised a clouded voice.\n“Vanity-san, I think it’s best you stopped, you know~?”\nBut she really is an impudent woman. This attitude after receiving my authority, perhaps this is just her base personality. For me to have overwritten her ego, carving an absolute sense of loyalty in her, and for her to have not changed in the slightest is just plainly amazing.\nShe’s surely a Superbia with a nature close to mine. That character of hers is clearly different from Heard’s.\nGiven the time, perhaps she’ll even set foot into Irritum. But honestly, I don’t really want to be grouped together with her.\n“Vanity-sa~n, if you calm down and think about it… we’re screwed, I’m telling you.”\n“… Screwed, you say?”\n“Yes.”\nI peered behind me. What is this woman saying at this point in time?\nIn the first place, even if it may be something from a Skill, the way you naturally let yourself follow behind me pretty much means you have no other path in life then to continue on as Heard Lauder’s servant.\nI let my senses take in the world, as I continued looking to my back.\nMy physical condition is great, and my soul perfect. I’ve been saving up Mana for a long while. If I wanted to, I could even create a few Saint Lords at this moment.\nI should even be able to destroy the Great Demon King right now.\nAnd you say I’m screwed!?\n“I mean, Vanity-san, you plan on fighting Heard-san, right?”\n“…”\n“And~ that~ means~…”\nBecause of the flap of the Dragon’s wings, it was quite difficult to pick up sound.\nBut within that, without working herself up at all, she let out her words as if she were just voicing a natural fact of life.\n“Vanity-san, you plan on making an enemy of Leigie-sama?”\nWhat escaped her mouth was the name of a completely irrelevant Demon.\nSama.\nLeigie-sama, is it?\n“… Ku ku.”\nI understood.\nThis woman wasn’t of Heard Lauder, but of Leigie Slaughterdolls… his vassal, perhaps.\nNo wonder she didn’t act very subordinate-like to Heard.\nShe likely wasn’t expecting an answer, as her mutterings seemed to fade to dusk somewhere along the line.\nThey were whispers too light to even be erased by the strong sound of the wind.\n“I’m fine with going against whatever it is you want, but Leigie-sama alone is someone I’d rather not oppose.”\nHer tone, her emotions differed from the frivolous atmosphere she had created up to now, so I found myself asking.\n“… Why?”\nI’m not sure if she heard me or not, but no matter how long I waited, no response came to me.\nBut so be it.\nFrom the start, I didn’t plan on opposing that man, and more importantly, there was no point.\nIf he stood in my way, then I’d have no mercy, but for that Lord who’d tempered his Sloth to the extreme to impede me, was in itself an impossible story.\n… Right, unless some miracle were to happen.\nWe preserved the silence as we continued to fly on. Before long, we closed in on the battlefield.\nWe should have still been a few kilometers away, but the air experienced a clear change. The smell of a battle, that couldn’t just be explained away with us having entered a Zone.\nThe finest pray I hadn’t chanced upong in thousands of years. My fighting spirit towards my enemy danced.\nThe sky, the earth was crying.\nEach and every blow was fatal. Fists that sent my eyes into distress shaved awy at the land, and split the empty air.\nThe thunderous roars that echoed through the high heavens, and Mana that far transcended that of a normal Demon Lord rose up along with it. It was likely something anyone could have noticed, even if they didn’t possess the perceptional power of a Demon Lord.\nIn truth, even without putting my eyes on it, I could clearly tell this was a battlefield.\nIt seems Zebul was doing an ample job of stalling him.\nMy army was also fulfilling their role sufficiently.\nDemon Lord Class Demons were a form of calamity.\nTheir rage was to destroy the world, and kill God. The power of soul released by the two beasts was stronger than any Demon Lord I had ever fought before.\nSomething that in the old world of humans would have been hailed as a legend, and even in the present state where none dared to intrude on the surface world anymore, it would surely be passed down.\nThat level of finality existed in this space.\nHumans, no, even Demons would throw down their desires the moment their eyes were to capture this battle of legend.\nKill. Slaughter one another. My greatest foes.\nBesides my own, each and every desire should just be devoured.\nA clash of high level Demon Lords.\nWhat had yet to even enter my eyes as of yet was, by no doubt, quite repulsing.\nBut the moment before I could clearly capture the scene, the dragon followed my will, and suddenly, its upper half jerked.\nIt used its long tail to regain balance, and began ascending into the air at a fearsome pace.\nWithin the thunderous wail of the wind, we were colored with the blood red moon of the high sun. It was surely a sight one could never see in the heavens basked in light.\nIf we were to go any closer they would notice. That I understood.\nBy power is working. My Skills are completely erasing my presence.\nBut even if Irritum were to hide one’s presences, it couldn’t fool one’s intuition.\nAnd those two Demon Lords over there could likely easily sense a presence-less existence or two.\nThose Lords of Demons were beings that reached close to the Lords of the heavens without even having received the blessing of their God.\nEven if I can grant my men with power equal to Angel Lords, before Heard Lauder’s power, they would be obliterated in an instant.\nBut still, there’s no way that wingless man would be able to capture a countless number of Angels fluttering around the sky. Even if he can move with the world appearing stagnant to him, his body was one that could only covet the ground.\nI feel them over yonder, my subordinates… let me grant even greater glory to that Angel flock.\nI’ll give them a portion of my power, and add more fuel to the blaze of their souls. The flocks speed rose even higher.\n“Oh filthy souls. At the very least, burn yourselves out radiantly in the name of my Vanity!”\nNow, give chase if you will. To those invading the lands of your lord.\nShow me the depths of your desire, Superbia!\nThose ancient battles of heaven flashed through my head again.\nWithout a single smile on their faces, to accomplish their justice, those vast legions of white, and those that were under the control of absolute power to pursue their desires, the black legions.\nBut I noticed one point that differed from the truth of my memory.\nI freely manipulated the flying dragon around that biting mass of fighting spirit.\nYes, it truly was but a trifling difference…\nThat I myself was no longer a part of either of those Legions.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 6: Irritum’s Vanagloria, Part 4: This is why Demons are…\nDemons and Angels were contrary entities. But it’s not like their existences were counterbalanced by one another.\nAgainst the light released by Angels, the darkness a Demon could amass was easily cleared away.\nNo matter how powerful a Demon’s Skills may be, the disadvantages they were born with weren’t something so easily overturned.\nMy memory let oud a grating sound, and ached.\nEven if I was up against a Demon of Pride powerful enough to repel my 『Judgement Rain』, in the end, there shouldn’t be any reason why I lost to one who hadn’t even reached Lord Leve.\n… But, for some reason, the conclusion of our bout had been cleanly wiped from my recollection.\n“Vanity-san? Are you finally losing your nerve at this point in time?”\n“… How foolish.”\nFaithfully following close to my rear, Hiero breathed out a whispering voice.\nI accepted those words with a smile, and cast them away.\nLosing my nerve?\nI, the one who was once the closest in the heavens to God, am losing my nerve to nothing but a single Demon Lord, you say?\nUseless provocations.\nAnyone who embraces such an emotion has not the qualifications to become a Lord.\nBut at the same time, I was vigilant. I have no reason why I faced defeat the last time.\nI’m sure Judgement Rain was blocked. Repelled, dissipated.\nBut still, I really can’t thing that something of that extent could triumph over the abilities I had at the time. Much less for one who wasn’t a Lord.\n… And in actuality, I’m still right here without having lost any power.\nUsing the eyes of my subordinates, I observed the scene below. Their eyes had already reached the battlefield. Without wasting time, they raced straight through it.\nHeard Lauder and Zebul Glaucus were approximately equal.\nHeard with his godspeed mobility, and Zebul with her abnormal regeneration, and high offensive power. It looks like the Devourer’s more competent than I gave her credit for. Between them, there wasn’t as much difference as indicated by their Rank.\nRight now, Hears Lauder is likely regretting his decision of trying to take care of Zebul before moving on to other matters. Even if he could only take them on one at a time, he should have chosen to deal with my Angels in the sky.\nThe current difference in ability. Heard had the advantage, but if he showed the smallest of openings, then the Devourer, with her Gula’s large area of effect would immediately send high level Skills at him. If he took a single one of those attacks, then the damage he’d suffer would be severe.\n“So I’ll have to make a move… no.”\nAs long as I’ve yet to determine what sorts of trumpcards he has, negligence is forbidden.\nAnd anyways, I have no reason to assist Zebul. Having them take each other out is the outcome most convenient to me, but I don’t think that’s possible… still, if they’re going at it this hard, then even the winner should have a considerable deficiency in power. I just have to wait patiently.\n“… A~hn, I can’t see what’s going on at all~…! Vanity-san, Vanity-san, let’s ambush them…! It’s alright, while he’s fighting with Zebul, if you secretly send an attack from behind, then even that Heard-san will…”\n“…”\nJust what is this one saying?\nI’ve decided to ignore this girl completely.\nOf all things, Hiero seems to be trying to tease me. Just what was Leigie thinking when he took her on as his subordinate… no, perhaps she arbitrarily became one…\nIf he could be done in by a surprise attack, he’d be long dead by now!\nIn the first place, there’s no guarantee that Zebul’s my ally.\nIf I show the slightest negligence, then I don’t think that woman would have any qualms with swallowing me up from behind.\nI give my subordinates some more power. I raise the flight speed some more.\nI know. Among Superbia Skills, a long range attack… does not exist.\nHeard Lauder has no means to stop a flock of Angels, and if he lets them by once, the until they reach the Castle of Shadows… until they reach his former master’s stronghold, there’s nothing to stop them.\nCan your Pride permit such a thing? No, it can’t. That’s the sort of Demon he is.\n“… In the end, that’s all there is to the man…”\n“Vanity-san, just one hit! How about you just put in one nice hard blow! Just a single clean shot as you pass by!”\n“… Do you happen to have some grudge against the man or something?”\n“… No, not particularly. See, I’m your loyal, loyal subordinate, so I thought…”\nHer nonchalant tone and figure as she averted her eyes was, no matter how you look at it, completely lacking in something called sincerity.\nHeard… looks like you’ve had your share of troubles too.\nI gave an order to the selfish Demon blessed with a twisted form of will-power. I just kinda want to get rid of her already.\n“If you’re going to say that much, then why don’t you go forth, Hiero.”\n“… Fweh!? Eeeeeh, no no no, look, I… don’t have any power, and…. I-i-i-it’s impossible. Heard-san is Rank one, you know? Demon Lord Rank One. I’ll be killed in a single breath. That person doesn’t know the meaning of holding back!”\n“… Ku… ku ku… Power… power, is it? You say you don’t have power. Then very well… I’ll grant it to you!! With this power in hand, strike down Heard Lauder!! 『Outer Decorate』!”\nIf you want it, then take it! Now go, go, go already!\nI put in much more power than when I first used on her. I still had a little left over. I’ll give her so much that she won’t be able to offer a single excuse anymore. I’ll stuff you so full, it would be a waste for such a small fry like you!\nI’ll give you power to your hearts content. I’ll bet General Class is insufficient. I’ll keep pouring it in until you’re a splendid Demon Lord!\nIn the end, I had powered her to at least the level of a Lower Ranking Demon Lord. Among those in service to that Kanon Iralaude, she’d likely get within the top ten if ranked.\nPerhaps she’s around the same level as those that are getting killed off by that Valkyrie, but there’s no doubt she’s a Demon Lord. If you were to compare it with her previous level, it’s likely over a hundred fold.\nNoticing the power that had piled up in her own body, Hiero shuddered.\n“Now, I gave it to you, Hiero. With this, there shouldn’t be a problem. Now go!”\n“Ah… eh… for real… Wait… n-no, please wait a minute!! T-the truth is, I’m not actually a soldier!”\n“Dammit… even after all that, you still plan on giving excuses!?”\n“I-I mean, I don’t know how… to use my Skills at all, and… Ah, V-Vanity-san! Look, this presence is…!”\nHonestly, I was quite irritated. For someone to piss me off more tha Heard, I don’t have any recollection of anything like that for the past few millennia.\nIf it’s like this, then even if she doesn’t put Heard off his guard, then taking away her personality, and giving her a new Persona may be my best bet.\nHowever, it looks like I’m not going to have the time to do that.\n“… What is the meaning of this? Why is she at a place like this…”\nOne of my subordinate Angels in my range of perception vanished.\nAbsolute flames. By that fire heralded as the strongest force in the Demon World, a number of those Angels’ bodies disappeared in an instant.\nFlames of destruction. To reset everything, the flames of Ira.\nThe fact that she hadn’t entered my Zone was linked to why my recognition of her came late.\nNo, it’s because I never believed she’d be at a place like this. I mean, that one’s…\n“Why is the Great Demon King on these lands!?”\n“I-I don’t know, sir. Maybe she’s out on a walk?”\nOh, but of course!!\nThis is completely unexpected.\nBut having come this close, I felt it. Without a chance of misreading, this is the Great Demon King’s Mana.\nThe current generation’s Great Demon King… despite the Wrath that little girl Kanon governed, she had quite the calm, intellectual composure going on.\nShe didn’t do anything too illogical, and these days, she rarely ever goes out like Heard to solve the problems extending beyond her territory. Therefore, she’s easy to read. She’s certainly powerful, but that mind not to openly wander into danger was one I was sure wouldn’t get in my way.\nAnd in that previous meeting, she didn’t even show any intent to go to the front lines.\nThe angels I created go down one after the other. Kanon was launching attacks on them.\nPersonally… she personally came to these lands just to wipe out an Angel Army of this level!?\nNo, even if that’s the case… I can’t let my concealment of Irritum break.\nMy plans are falling apart. It’s impossible. Against one possessing top class destructive power like her, this army of Angels is close to nothing.\nI disperse my forces. In order to reduce the chances of being shot down as low as possible. But one by one, she began deleting those divided Angels moving at a considerable speed.\n“This can’t be… this is bad…”\n“For so many high ranking Demon Lords to gather in one place, how rare…”\nRare? It’s completely unheard of.\nPerhaps regaining their momentum because of Kanon’s arrival, or because they lost the need to pay mind to the Angels above, the magnitude of the tremors below increased in scale.\nAnd in the next instant, Kanon’s Mana swelled up.\nIt was a flash.\nA wave of fire instantly spread over the sky, and died it a crimson that foretold the end of the world.\nThe heat wave swept over to burn up all creation. Its force worthy the name of Ruin.\nThat little girl… she used a high ranking Skill against opponents of far lower class…\nThere should be a limit to overkill.\nThe reactions I felt from the Angels went out all at once.\nAgainst the fire coming at me from top to bottom, left to right, I used my own 『Overrule』.\nIt was an enormous amount of pure energy, fitting for her title.\nShe must be storing up quite a bit of rage over her everyday life.\n“Ugwoooooooooooooooooooooooooh!!!!!”\nAt most, it’s been ten thousand years and a little since her birth. Kanon’s accumulated years didn’t even match up to a tenth of mine.\nMy Overrule, the superiority I felt as a leader, the sentiment of supremacy I once felt as a Lord of Angels blocked the unavoidable flames, and began to extinguish them.\nMy power, my Mana is leaving me. The power I had stored up for so long, the power I’ve amassed, in order to avoid my absolute destruction, I have to unleash it.\nI know not whether the flames had continued on for a few minutes, or perhaps only a number of seconds.\nAnd in the end, I came out on top.\nThe sky cleared. Nothing remained within it.\nNot even a trace of that heat was left behind. It was as if that phenomenon that had enveloped me had been part of a dream. But my expended Mana, and the continued nonexistence of my Angels indicated the reality of the matter.\nDammit.\nWith this, Heard has lost his reason for lament. With two High Level Demon Lords here, Zebul’s defeat is inevitable.\n“Ku… 『Outer Decorate』!”\nOf my army racing across the land… of my stock, I convert three of them into Angels.\nAlong with a pure white light, the rising false Angels were shot down with arrows of fire from the side, before leaving behind not even an ash as they burned away.\nIt ain’t gonna cut it, I see.\nOur affinity is too bad. If it was Heard alone, that would be one thing, but even without wings, Kanon possessed the capability to destroy whatever troops I deployed to the sky.\nI have five hundred units left in stock. But I can’t just convert all of them to Angels. It would look much too unnatural.\n“Tsk… damn that little girl. She came to stand in my path at the worst possible time… my power… my power is insufficient.”\n“Vanity-san… you know, you could have just dodged…”\nHaving calculatedly jumped off of her flying dragon to evade the fire in the sky, Hiero shouted to me from the ground. Her own mount had burned to death.\n“SHUT THE HELL UUUUUUPPPP!!! DAMMIT, DAMMNN IT AAAAAAAAAALLLLL!”\nI’m not enough. I cannot reach.\nThree of them. Three Demon Lords of the highest class. No, even if it were just Heard and that little Kanon girl, I can’t think I’d be able to destroy them.\nI looked down on Hiero. That one’s no good. That over there is trash. In the first place, a low rank Demon Lord won’t even buy time from those two.\nMy luck was in that I’d still managed to uphold my disguise. Neither my true face nor stature had been revealed. No, I can change both of them at will with my power.\nThen should I run? I of all people would choose retreat? Can I permit such a thing?\nNo, no, no! You’re saying I, I’m going to flee before Kanon and Heard Lauder?\nPermit… there’s no way I could do that.\n“Vanity-san, calm… calm down! Please calm down, and give me some more power!”\n“… What?”\nOf all things, that trash was saying some incomprehensible things with an earnest expression.\n“What are you trying to say?”\n“Please listen carefully, Vanity-san!”\nHer blue eyes were sparkling.\nHer arms were forcedly folded, and while she stared at me, I couldn’t feel any sincerety from her. Just what is loyalty supposed to be to that girl?\n“The enemies number two, what’s more, against Kanon-san and Heard-san, even you would be in nothing but a tight spot, Vanity-san. Because it would be two on one.”\n“As stands to reason. Now try going on.”\n“And so, it’s time for your loyal, loyal subordinate Hiero to shine! If I’m by your side, that makes it two versus two, and at the very least, we’ll have a tie in numbers. But with my current powers, be it against Kanon-san or against Heard-san, I won’t last for anything more than an instant.”\n“I see… meaning what you’re saying is that if I pack some more power into you, you’ll take on one of the two. That’s what you want to say, correct?”\nThis bitch, as if someone of your level could take on either of them.\nEven if you had an overwhelming difference in power, you’d lose out in battle experience. In the first place, you said it yourself, did you not? That you weren’t even a soldier.\nThere’s nothing left to hear from you.\nHearing my words, Hiero seemed to have some difficulty speaking on.\n“No… I likely won’t be able to stand up to either… but I will cheer you on, I assure you. Aha.”\n“THEN YOU DON’T NEED ANY POOWEEER, RIGHT!!!? DAMMMNNN TRAAAAASASSSSHHHH!! Are you perhaps trying to make a fool of me!! What about it?”\nDamn. This one just keeps on saying things to egg on my animosity!\nI don’t care anymore. I’ve wasted my time. Let’s just… confiscate my power back from her already.\nIf I get back whatever I granted to her, it won’t amount to anything great. But it’s infinitely better than leaving it to her.\nI dismounted the dragon. Whatever the case, since I’ve become unable to use my Angels, my options have been divided into retreat, or attack.\nI glared at Hiero, who was standing upright on the ground. Come to think of it, I get the feeling that fate abandoned me the moment I took you in as a subordinate.\nSo be it. As the greatest sympathy I can offer, I’ll give you a painless death.\nThe moment I extended my arm to try to take back my power, Hiero frowned.\n“Ah, but… it’s that… they seem to be fighting one another now.”\n“… What?”\nThe Manas of Pride and Gluttony and Wrath mingled to raise a powerful whirlwind.\nFrom the eyes of my army halted a distance away, Hiero was, sure enough, telling the truth.\nHeard’s fist was directed at the flames surrounding Kanon, and Zebul’s Wave of Starvation expanded explosively to swallow all of them altogether. This malice, this spirit, this scenery, they truly were going at each other’s throats.\nBy what logic do the Demon Lords under the same banner start fighting one another? What’s more, one of the three is the Great Demon King, you know.\nThis dreadful lack of cooperation. In the tens of thousands of years since I fell to Demonhood, I think I’ve come to understand it, but… damn, this is why I hate Demons!\n“This is starting to feel stupid, so I’m going home, okay… How about you return as well, Vanity-san? No, it’s not like I’ll stop you if you want to participate in that battle front…”\nHiero arbitrarily mounted herself on the dragon I had gotten off of.\nYes, this truly is starting to feel stupid. It’s stupid, and I can’t understand the reason either, but this woman sure does say some unbelievable things.\nStill, that three-way-struggle… no, participating in that battle royal truly will be a pointless waste of power.\nThere was a clear tendency when there were two of them fighting, but now, it’s just beginning to become complicated. Originally, those of the same camp should have been cooperating, but it does look like Kanon is aiming at Heard of her own volition.\nOn the other hand, Heard is putting up an equal fight, and I’m not sure where that confidence of his comes from, but it seems his present level os power is still rising. All three of them held the sins with the highest offensive capabilities, and it wouldn’t be strange for one of them to come out on top over a single incident.\nWhile I was stuck hesitating, the flying dragon had taken to the skies, and left. I failed to take back my power.\n… But, right. That girl was surely quite clever. For her to be capable of that in this situation… it all just goes to show that I’ve much learn…\nI sighed. Seriously, why is Kanon here… on top of that, this fight seems endless.\nThe minimum goal of me sending Angels out has been accomplished, but it looks like I’ll have to go work over my plan again.\nOf all else, I should start searching into Kanon’s intentions, and her personality… My number of troops has also declined considerably. I’ll have to supplement those as well.\nPerfectly at that moment, at the very end of the end, I heard Hiero’s voice from up high.\n“Ah, Vanity-san. One more thing I might add… You’ve cut off your 『Abyss Zone』 for now, so perhaps you haven’t noticed it, but… it seems like a white presence is headed in our direction, so if you don’t want to take it on, I highly recommend you change your location. Because based on where you’re standing, you’ll be the first one in its path. Kusu kusu kusu, today sure was lively.”\nShe said whatever she wanted, before the shadow of the flying dragon disappeared into the distant sky. I’m not sure where to, but surely so as not to get herself involved. In the opposite direction from the Castle of Shadows.\nWas that report she gave at the end her form of loyalty? … Well, I guess it’s something better than zero.\nA white presence… white, is it? All of the Angels I created have been expended. And that means that what’s left is either another one that wandered down from Heaven, or perhaps the true Valkyrie.\nWhatever the case, she’s not my enemy, but… if I’m found, it really will be a pain. Even if I can hide my own presence, I can do nothing to the white one coming closer.\nBut I’m doubtful as to whether those three will notice while they’re so focused on one another…\nNow then, what should I do?\nAs I tilted my head to think, I did indeed pick up that entity in my perception. It was surprisingly close.\nRegardless of the fact I had concealed my presence, that entity was coming straight in my direction like an arrow. The distance was something around one kilometer. A considerable speed, and even if I retreated, it’s likely it would catch up to me.\nI activated a Skill of Pride. It was a Skill to leave behind the flow of time. It’s been quite a long time since I last used it. My cognizance sharpened, and time around me slowed by several levels.\nAnd I used the smallest possible movements to dodge the woman clad in light coming down at me from up high, smashed her sword of light, and implanted my fist into her head.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 7: Fortis’ Courage, Part 1: I’ve not a Fragment of Courage\nThis is, perhaps, the oldest memory I possess.\n“Congratulations, you have been chosen as a Hero.”\n“…? W-what… is this, who are…”\nThat black robe that draped over her head, and covered even up to her eyes was the vestment of a magician. A robe you would occasionally see along the main street.\nThose that covered their eyes would develop the ability to see ‘something’ unknown to an ordinary man. But it was a long time later that I came to know that fact.\nWithout a single harbinger, the magician that had appeared all too suddenly said that to me, who, sword alone, had never even held up a kitchen knife.\nI’m not sure what she was seeing with her eyes, or what she had discovered with me, but in the end I never had the chance to find that out. If I were to refer to that encounter in a clichéd fashion, I’ll bet it was fate.\n“… So… what is… a Hero?”\nFor the dubious mage that suddenly appeared, and the shady-as-hell voice she threw out, the reason I decided to take her seriously… no, the reason I even confronted her was just a coincidence… or maybe something else.\nI’m sure that I just didn’t have the will to ignore one who had come to inform me of something of her own accord. If perhaps I had such a will at that time… I should have been able to settle it then and there. But in the end, as if thrown about by the tide, I ended up hearing her speech just like that.\nThe shady, suspicious magician spoke.\n“A hero is one who lights up the darkness with their valor. Who crushes the strong, and saves the weak, the sword of hope to save the human race from the invaders of darkness. And you have the makings of one. I can… see it.”\nHonestly, I was troubled.\nBy the magician who claimed to see something I couldn’t. No, of the magician who spoke as if she were looking at it the entire time.\nFor one without a single friend, with my only form of conversation being when I occasionally went out shopping, I had absolutely no idea how to deal with her, and I could only give a vague reply when it came down to it. I couldn’t help it.\nWithout even asking what quality she was seeing. Just thrown around by the waves.\n“Um… becoming a Hero is… um…”\nI don’t have a reason. I don’t have any reason to become one. I doubt I’ll be able become one, and up to that point, I never even imagined for that option to appear before me. I never thought I’d ever want to become one.\nI was… what you find in any city out there, the lowest rank of the city’s middle class. Nothing more than a single child.\nThe magician smiled at my bewilderment.\n“You will become a hero, Serge. If you do, then someday when the time comes that those dear to you, your parents, lover, friends’ lives are put at risk by the forces of evil, your power will surely come through to put a stop to it. In order not to come to regret it someday, your power is to become… the 『Sword』 of humanity.”\nThose dear to me? Parents? Lover? Friends?\nHuh? Um… I don’t really… have anyone like that.\nMy parents weren’t there from the time I gained awareness of my surroundings. I don’t know whether they’re dead or alive.\nEven I had always hated my own hair and eyes, the dirty color of gray sewer rats. With my lack of sociability, there’s no way I would make any friends.\nAll that I have… are some whose faces I know of, and complete strangers.\nI repeated the magician’s words to myself, and thought.\nSurely, this magician had only ever seen heroes like that. Those with dear ones, parents, lovers, friends. Heroes with the courage and ability to fight the dark forces, or whatever, for their sake.\nBut I was always alone. Even when no tragedy out of a fairytale had befallen me, I was just alone.\nNone too smart, and quite weak physically. On my feet, I lost to children three years my junior, and I couldn’t even read or write decently. I never felt a sense of crisis from such a thing. There were more than enough of such people around me.\nI could only look upon her with cold eyes.\nFor what purpose did this magician come before my eyes? Just what sort of talent does she see? Did something like that really exist? All these sorts of questions… I could care less about.\nThe mysterious atmosphere, and her hood that seemed to fit it. I didn’t even care whether she was a fake or the real deal.\nOf the magician’s expression, all her robe allowed me to see was her mouth curved into a smile.\n“Please think over it a night. Serge, you have the right to choose. To live as a hero to light up the dark, or… to waste your entire life as a normal civilian…”\n“I’ll do it.”\nI replied immediately.\n“… And please decide it by your own will. Your fate is… huh… eh?”\n“I will… become one.”\nAt that moment, I definitely sensed that her concealed eyes had opened wide.\nSurprise. That was the first emotion I managed to give to the magician. It was somewhat enjoyable.\n“… Are you sure you don’t have to think about it? If you do end up becoming a hero, you can never return to an ordinary life. Perhaps whatever happiness awaiting you in the future would disappear. Your dear ones, lover, parents, friends, you may be forced to part with them for eternity.”\n“…”\nAnd I’m telling you I don’t have anyone like that. Even whatever sort of worth was there having those four in my life was unknown… to me.\nSeriously, what’s with this woman, and her obsession with dear ones, lovers, parents, and friends?\nThe magician’s mouth warped slightly. She let out a long sigh.\n“Even if your resolve is of that level, I must call your choice to hero-hood to be premature. While I do commend that resolve of yours…”\n“I’ll do it, dammit.”\n“…”\nThe resolve to lose what didn’t exist?\nPerhaps if I had but a single one close to me, than as weak as I was, I never would have been able to take that option.\nBut in all truth, I had no one. I had nothing I could call a dear one. With no one I needed to protect, I had no reason to hesitate. My present state was the worst, and as long as I can’t think of a life lower than that, then I might as well just press forward whenever the opportunity comes to me.\nMy ignorance was named as recklessness, and at that moment, it was misunderstood as courage.\n“… Why? Why is it that you can be so strong? Even if I call you a hero, you’re still human. If you face defeat at the forces of darkness, and face a tragic demise… no, the probability of you facing a fate worse than death is nothing low.”\nWhy am I strong?\nI’m not strong at all.\nI’ve not a fragment of courage. I’m just… alone.\nIf you’re going to call me strong, me, with no knowledge or power to boast of… if that were to be reflected on this magician’s eyes as strength, then I’m sure…\nIf the strength of the heroes of the past lay in that they had people to protect, then I’m sure…\nMy strength is that… I don’t have a single thing to protect, and not even the need to defend my own life. I can permit any sort of sacrifice, and that’s all it was.\nBut the magician couldn’t understand that.\nThe reason I would become a hero.\nI forcibly moved my facial expression I hadn’t changed in a long wile, and formed a stiff smile to the magician’s bewildered air.\n“Because it’s… for the sake of the world.”\nIf I have the power to save it, if my own power can be of the least amount of use to something, if you’re going to give me a reason to exist, then I’ll sacrifice myself to it. That’s what my child’s mind thought. That’s all there was to it.\nI’ll throw out my worthless self, throw out my vague standing in life, throw away the idleness I felt from my own ignorance… as if I was just tossing aside some trash on the side of the road, I was able to discard it all so easily. That’s all there was to it.\nEven if I didn’t know how to read or write, I understood.\nIt wasn’t for my dear ones, or my parents, or lover, or friends, and of course, it wasn’t for the world. It was plain and simple… self-satisfaction.\nFrom the eyes covered under the hood, water started to flow.\nSo even magicians weep. I ended up thinking something useless like that.\n“… You will surely become a wonderful, and… tragic hero. Serge, I can do nothing but commend that courage of yours.”\nWhat the magician gave name to was nothing like courage, but seeing that selfless smile on her face, I kept my mouth shut.\nThe magician’s hand gave off a faint light. To me, it was the first time I had ever seen magic, and it looked like the work of God.\nThe lights quietly poured down over my head. It was as she were covering me with a hat of it. And what existed in that flow was a power strong enough to stir up my existence.\n“For your strong and noble will, I grant the Class of 『Hero』 onto you. Serge. I pray for light on… the path you are to travel.”\n“… Yes.”\nHer words stained the insides of my mind along with that power.\nMy senses understood. It was likely something powerful. Surpassing the bounds of humanity, a powerful Mana of light to overwhelm the Demon Race. My soul was written over. As one to light the dark.\nIf you were going to give out something like this, then anyone… even a civilian could be a Hero. Even I could do it.\nWhat is this… so effort and talent… had nothing to do with it.\nCompared to the power granted by the 『Hero』 Class, all the effort I had ever put in, and those classmate, upperclassmen, lowerclassmen I had always been jealous of equally… felt like nothing but rubbish.\nAnd on that truth, I felt a great sense of guilt.\nPower I gained by cheating. My heart gave a dull ache.\nWhat a terrible tale it must be.\n“Now, Serge. Please go forth. With that power… to clear away the darkness. To save the world. Here, from this moment forth… you are a Hero, Serge.”\n“… Yes.”\nHero. Serge the Hero.\nIt doesn’t really feel real. No, I don’t need it to. I mean, it’s not like I actually wanted to become a Hero in the first place.\nThe inside of my head was incomparably clearer than ever before, and my body unbelievably light.\nThe power to clear the dark. I knew how to use my power by instinct.\nWithin my head floated the Brave Skilltree. The tree with all the powers of a hero loaded into it.\nFrom one to one hundred, the Skilltree that had every slot on it opened from the start. I instinctively selected thhe final Skill on it.\nA light descended from the sky, drawn to my left hand, before it began to take shape.\nI felt no heat from it. It was a light that was only cold.\nThe 『Brave』 Skill Tree.\nWhat existed at its depths, the weapon of a Hero. A Skill to bring forth a Holy Sword.\n『Luster』.\nIt was a slender long sword. Its pale blue body was about one meter in length, and its design-less boorish hilt rested in my hand.\nThe Holy Sword I produced by expending an amount of Mana I wouldn’t even have felt if I were as I was before obtaining the Hero Class was simply beautiful… and cold.\nThe Holy Sword. Its name surfaced in my mind… Solitus Argentum.\n(TL: Latin, Solitary Silver)\nLight reflected off the blade with a lonely name perfectly suited of me, making it shine silver.\nIn the center of it, light, wind gathered, and gave blessings to the sword. The magician merely stared up at that sword in a trance, and at that moment, I felt the truth of my role as a Hero for the first time.\nI hung out the blade’s tip towards the heavens. A holy pillar of light rose from it.\nIn my new life, reborn as a Hero, I couldn’t help but think a little.\nIf I’m the Hero, I wonder if I can make any friends.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 7: Fortis’ Courage, Part 2: What’s Necessary isn’t Power, but Courage\n… I failed.\nI had been too lacking in caution due to my place in the sky. When I manipulated the wings on my back to charge with all my might, I was easily dodged.\nAt the same time, I received an impact great enough to crush my skull.\nDemons are strong. Especially in the miasma of the Demon World, they were able to gain extraordinary powers. It’s completely different from fighting them on the surface, or in the heavens.\nOnce they reached the highest rank… Demon Lord, I wonder how strong that would be.\nI thought I had understood it.\nI mean, it wasn’t my first time fighting a Demon or a Demon Lord.\nI’ve defeated a number of them A number of them fell.\nI never thought I could deceive the wide ranged perception abilities of a Demon Lord. The surprise attack I launched with the premise that they knew it would be coming was brilliantly evaded, and I was smashed.\nStrong. Within my fading field of vision, I thought.\nOn top of it all, this enemy hadn’t gotten serious at all. As if it were a part of their daily life, they activated a Skill with natural movements, and without even any killing intent, they naturally intercepted me.\nI can’t even imagine how many months and years they had placed into their strength. But there was quite a bit of menace packed into that single blow of theirs.\nThe moment I realized my failure, what flowed out from my heart wasn’t fear… an anxiety great enough to crush me.\nWith my vision smashed, and my five senses fading, my mind dripped out, and my soul well into darkness…\n… And a Skill activated.\nMy memories flashed back through me.\nMy limits as a Hero. My defeat. Being picked up by God, and made a Valkyrie. The power I devoted my life to. The power I devoted myself to defeat Demons. The Power I devoted myself to destroy them.\nOn the 『Question』 that came up in my mind, I selected 『Yes』 without hesitation.\nMy breath returned. Light came back to my world. My smashed head, and burst brain, and my split body, and any and everything else returned to normal.\nA rewind from death. No matter how many tens and hundreds and thousands of times I got a taste of it, it was an unfathomable sensation I could never accustom myself to.\nPower reentered my body. I slowly stood up.\nThe large shadow looked down over me. Golden eyes observing me. That calm giant stood stagnant like a pillar of rock.\nAnd of all else, he was greater than any Demon I had faced thus far, and his reaction as he looked at the scene surely wasn’t that of one seeing revival for the first time.\nThe Demon was a mountainous bald man, whose body height exceeded two meters. His brown skin was draped over a great armor of muscle coating his entire body. The way he held himself was closer to humanity than any other Demon K had seen before. I didn’t see him to be holding any weapons, but with that body of his, perhaps such a thing was unnecessary.\nThe greatest thing for me to focus on was that, despite us being a mere two meters apart, I couldn’t feel a single hint of power from him.\nA Demon’s power is high. Originally, I could detect them instinctively from quite a distance. If that opponent was to be an exceptional Demon Lord, then I could even feel it kilometers away.\nNo matter which of the seven sins a Demon was to reign over, that should hold true.\nBut the Demon before my eyes was a type I’d never seen before. I had nothing in my knowledge to indicate the ability to completely erase one’s presence.\nIf I had acted without prior information, and without adequate caution, I wouldn’t have even noticed this man’s existence.\nIs this man… what God had feared of… the calamity?\nBefore the unidentified man, I held up my Holy Sword.\nThat would have been a favorable chance for him to give a followup attack, but the man didn’t move his body at all. He folded his arms, and looked down on me, those golden eyes letting off a fiery radiance. A heavy pride clung to his mouth.\n“… I see, that sword is… so you’re Serge Serenade… I never thought the real one would show up… why must everything always go astray.”\n“… Hah!”\nI have no words… to exchange with a Demon.\nI sucked in a short breath, and gave the ground a strong kick\nI poured power into the Holy Sword.\nThe blade was one imbued with high divinity. The strongest sword in the wor… no, perhaps just the strongest of the Human Race. But still, Demons that climbed up to the surface were one thing, but it wasn’t imbued with the power to kill a Demon in the Demon World with a single stroke.\nThat’s why I have to put power, Mana into it. In a time so far back I can’t even remember when it occurred, it was what I once laid hands on as a human, Hero’s power.\nThe pale blue edge was clad in a pale light. It was an armament to cut down darkness. The power that the frail human race had devoted itself to in order to stand against Demons. A sword of light to repell all sadness to befall them.\nThe Demon Lord didn’t move.\nAs I thrust the tip forward with the intent to rend him toward that Lord’s trunk of a body… towards the area with the highest probability of containing his Soul Core, the left of his chest, one of his log-like arms easily knocked the blade aside.\nThe blade lightly cut into his flesh.\nJet-black blood scattered, and before that could fall to the ground, he embedded his foot into my solar plexus.\nMy breath was knocked out. My internal organs were hollowed out. My brain let out a scream.\nMy body that had been strengthened as an Angel, the defensive barrier surrounding it was shattered in an instant, and an unpleasant creaking sound from my own bones reached my ears. My field of vision blinked on and off, before the pain tinted all before me pitch black.\nFor a few seconds, my body danced in the air, before I was thrown onto the ground. My entire body hurt from the pressure of the impact.\nIt hurts. I’m in pain. I’m scared. He’s strong. I ignored all those notions going through my mind, and thought.\nI couldn’t see the instant he moved. Normally, in the moment an enemy made a move, I could see a small waver in their being, but I saw none of that at all. He was simply too fast.\nHe’s strong. The three Demon Lords I defeated were nothing compared to this.\nI can’t even see where to start. The difference in power between us was hopeless. My dynamic vision was unable to follow him at all. And of all else, a Skill to erase his presence is… too abnormal.\n“… u…”\nI barely managed to swallow down the scream forming at the back of my throat.\nI allocate the parts of my mind heading in a negative direction from the pain and power gap towards analyzing my resources on hand. That was, in all the years I’ve fought on, the method of fighting I’d cultivated to keep fighting without having my heart fold in on me.\nJust as there were different types among Angels, the Skills a Demon could use varied by the Sins they governed. With pure physical abilities this high, speed beyond my perception, and the ability to pierce a barrier with his bare hands…\nFrom that blow, there was but a single sin I could surmise that he held.\nSuperbia.\nAmong the various sorts of Demons around, it was the type that required the most caution.\nI didn’t『Die』, so the pain won’t go away. The option isn’t coming up in my head.\nHe’s going easy on me. My magically strengthened body, and the barrier of an Angel, before this Demon, they were no more than walls of paper. I’ll bet he had enough power to turn me into a lump of meat in a single blow if he was up to it.\nIn that case, it would be a lot easier on me if he just killed me…\nOn the non-fatal damage assailing my body, I started to go through all options I had to preserve my continued existence, and at that moment, the man raised his voice.\nFitting his stature, it was a voice like a subterranean rumble. But opposed to that thunderous tone of his, the contents held some intelligence. That was one of the reasons Demons were something more than simple beasts.\n“That authority is… 『Fortis』 I see… a troublesome one it is… no…”\nThe wrinkles on his brow smoothed out, and his frowning expression warped.\nHis voice wasn’t leaving him anymore, but he was quite clearly showing scorn.\nWhat is he scoffing at? If he laughing at me for trying to attack knowing full well the gap between us?\nNo, there’s no way I’d ever understand a Demon’s thoughts.\nI confirmed my damage. There was still some pain left across my body, but it won’t influence any offensive actions. In the first place, the option of retreat never existed.\nI used my sword like a cane to lift myself.\nMy knees trembled. My arms shook. I stopped the quivering across my body, and stood up. I had no choice but to stand.\nHero was the general term to refer to those that opposed the dark. Therefore, as long as a darkness to oppose stands before me, and my own soul is undying, I must strongly impose myself on it.\n… Because if I don’t… I won’t be able to fight on.\n“It’s useless. Your power will never reach… me.”\nI won’t reach. I know.\nI could feel it from a single blow. Even if I didn’t measure his power by the disparity in our Mana, I knew well enough of the gap between us. Of all else, this Demon Lord is… simply too fast.\nBut still…\nI remembered the days of battle I had spent.\nThere was never an enemy within them that wasn’t strong. I had always fought with my life at risk.\nSince descending back into this Demon World, the three Lords I took on were all strong and troublesome existences holding desires strong enough to paint out all existence.\nWhat’s necessary isn’t power, but courage. As long as that doesn’t run out, my defeat is… unthinkable.\nI concentrated power to my eyes, and send malice and fighting spirit towards the Lord whose name I had yet to learn.\nBlack soil, dark emotions, and a miasma full of stagnant air, yet within that my blood and soul cried out. My spirit was excited.\nOn the edge of the horizon are three more great presences. They’re undoubtedly Demon Lord Class. I have no idea for what reason such a number of them have gathered.\nI don’t know, but within my perpetual existence, within all the battle experience I had built up, I had a premonition that I was diving in to the longest battle I’ve ever faced.\nSurprisingly enough, even when I directed my intent to kill at this Demon Lord, he still shows no will to fight. That reaction I had never witnessed from any Demon of Superbia thus far was too ominous to bear.\n… I’m scared.\n“… It doesn’t seem you understand, 『Fortis』. Courage and recklessness are… different things entirely.”\nThe Demon Lord sneered.\n『Fortis』\nThe name of the authority I gained the moment I became a Valkyrie after my death. One of the Virtues governed by Angels.\nHe saw through that just by locking blades with me twice!?\n… No… that’s wrong. What’s to be feared the most is that, even after inferring it, the Lord had yet to lose his composure.\nStill with a brilliant smile on his face, his figure leisurely swayed. That brown body, that large build started jiggling about like a Slime, before it dissolved away.\nThe sudden fear send shivers down my spine. While his head had already disappeared, that voice continued to ring out.\n“No matter how you may try to prove that brave heart of yours, no matter how many tnousands of times you’re prevailed with it… it’s all… meaningless. Serge Serenade. Valkyrie, Valkyrie, is it… ah…”\nI cannot comprehend. On the unknown that didn’t correspond with any of the experience I’d built up over my life, my hands shook.\nThat muddily oozing body flowed over onto the ground, and as if it were an illusion, it vanished entirely.\nFrom top down, that large build surpassing two meters had melted, and within it… a body three times smaller revealed itself.\nShe was full of openings. I knew that, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the one who emerged from the giant.\n“Eh… that can… ‘t be…”\nMy breath stopped.\nUpon the destruction of that muscular mass, what came out was… a young girl.\nEven when my own stature wasn’t that high, she was considerably smaller than me. Unbefitting her petite build, her features were quite mature. A sharp glare, and an excessively bulging chest.\nWhite skin, and golden eyes. On her back grew five sets of dark wings, and from her head grew platinum blond hair that reached all the way to her feet.\nWhat she wrapped around that body looked like nothing more than unornamented, colorless old rags, but while there were some differences here and there… that figure, and presence was something I could never mistake.\n… In the distant past, it was an honorable form I had happened upon before.\nI only saw her for an instant. A single short moment. In the depths of my memory, behind the haze of things forgotten, all that remained of my recollection of her was that brief scene.\nIn my life much longer than a normal human, where a majority of my memories had been long buried, what I could still remember was… when I was brought to the heavens by the Valkyries… the moment right after.\nIt’s likely that the other party never took me to sight. She likely doesn’t remember. It’s because we never even exchanged words. It’s because our statuses and powers were too far removed for something on the level of conversation to be permitted.\n… But I remembered. From that single glance, a powerful charisma that burned itself into my soul.\nThose ten wings of light.\nOf all those that enforced Iustitia in all the heavens, she was one of the scarce Sacred Lords that could be counted on two fingers.\nA Lord of Lords. One who was granted the fruit of glory by the supreme God of the celestial realm.\nThe jet black pointed tail she hadn’t grown back then slapped messily against the ground.\n“How can this… why are… you…”\n“As I thought, so you’ve scene this form of mine before… Ku ku ku, should I call it a strange twist of fate…”\nThere was a difference. The Angel I had looked up at back then had wings that glimmered as if they were light itself that had taken shape. Her eyes weren’t gold, but a clear emerald greed. She didn’t have a tail either.\nBut if you looked at it the other way, besides those traits, not a single thing had changed. Her face, her body, her height, tone, expression. That blazing power that could scorch one at a glance hadn’t faded at all, no matter how many hundreds of thousands of years had passed.\n… No, that’s wrong.\nThere’s no way that’s true!\nI shook my head, and mustered up my courage.\nThe girl before me is one blessed by the vice of a Demon. One who would creep unseen through the shadows of the hearts of man, to devour their souls.\nWord by word, I asked as if I was posing the question to myself.\n“That can’t… be. What trickery is this… Demon Lord. Why have you chosen to take up such a form at this point in time…?”\n“Hmm… interesting. You’re an interesting one, Valkyrie. Having seen this form, and knowing my name, you still maintain the willpower to stand before me…”\nQuite different from before the girl scoffed at me in a gentle voice like the ringing of sleigh bell. Her lips curved, and her right hand directed itself at me.\nThat was her activation nose. Without any warning, without a single movement of Mana, light poured out. Enough to cloud over my eyes, an untainted white light.\nForgetting the burning sensation in my eyes, I unintentionally opened them ever wider. It was a Skill I was accustomed to, but that’s exactly why I couldn’t believe it.\nThe meaning behind it caused my body to quiver.\nThe overflowing light took shape, and in her hand, a single sword was created.\nWith the hilt, the blade and all else forged of a shadowless white, a straight sword.\nAmong the authorities granted to Angels, it was the power most specialized in bringing ruin to Demons.\nThe 『Iustitia』 Authority.\nA Skill to manifest a sword of light to dispel the dark.\n『Sin Breaker』\nThe point of the sword that looked to have been delicately folded out of light itself was directed at me. Normally, it was a sword of justice that would never have found its way to be pointed there.\nOn the pressure that shortened my breath, I instinctively held my Holy Sword aloft.\nBy assuming a stance for battle, the shaking across my body came to a stop. But the sway of my emotions wasn’t so conveniently ceased.\nI have the greater reach, but something like that… doesn’t matter if I can’t hit her.\n“The real… deal?”\nStill, even when confronting her, what formed at my mouth was a question.\nIn contrast, my opponent’s lips only returned a smile.\nThis is no good. Even if I found myself asking it, I already knew the answer.\nThis woman before my eyes was undoubtedly the genuine article. This pressure, that form. No matter what illusions she were to use, it would be impossible to replicate it to this extent.\nA true Angel… no, former Angel.\nHolding the name of Glory, one of the heavenly messengers closest to God.\nThe glory that kneeled beside the throne.\nGloria Seidthroan.\n“I’m also short on time, but, ku ku ku, how… pitiful. I’ll play with you just a bit. Think it an honor for your body to be receiving my blade.”\n“You are… no, you should be dead…”\nAt the very least, that’s what I’d heard.\nIn a time an uncountable number of years passed, against the greatest army of the Demon World’s forces, she commanded all the forces under her command, and managed to repel them, but after confronting the enemy’s Demon Lord, her whereabouts were lost. As she never returned, she was proclaimed dead.\nThe death of a high class Lord made quite an echo through heaven. I remember it. No, there’s no way I could forget.\nDue to the outcome of that battle, the war was brought to a temporary armistice.\nI have no idea as to why she became a Demon.\nIn the first place, as I never associated with her, I only knew of her personality and bearing from hearsay. All I knew for sure was how extraordinary her power had been.\nDo I have… any chances of victory?\n… No, at the very least, I can’t go down before our blades have even locked once.\nWith all the power I could muster, I glared.\nI built up my courage.\nI remembered the reason I had been sent to the Demon World by God.\nThe appearance of a powerful Demon of prophecy. The birth of a calamity.\nAnd… for some reason, the one with the highest possibility of being able to take care of it was me.\nA Fallen Angel who once stood at the summit of all Angels. I doubt there’s a calamity greater than this.\nI can’t leave this Lord to run free.\nIn that overwhelming pressure, I wrung out even more courage from the depths of my heart. I used it to coat over my fear.\nThe heroic power I cultivated in my battles as a Hero. That Fortis authority I laid hands on when I became a Valkyrie.\nIt’s fine, it’s fine.\nAs long as I have both of them, my defeat is… impossible.\nI put power in my arms, the power of my soul. The Holy Sword was clad in an even greater light, and let off a silver blue glimmer.\nAnd the moment I held that sword allot…\nA familiar message came up in my mind.\n『Serge Serenade has Died. Cause of Death: Decapitation』\nMy vision suddenly went dark.\nI couldn’t move myself in the slightest.\nWhat had transpired, what did she do? I couldn’t understand any of it. I couldn’t even perceive it. There wasn’t even… any pain to be felt.\nA followup window faded into view.\n『Do you want to try again?』\n『YES / NO』\nI can’t move my body. My five senses have already gone out. Within that nothingness, the message alone was all I could perceive.\nThe answer was… already determined.\nLight returned to my eyes again. The hands that had unconsciously began to predd down on my wounds… came to a stop.\nGloria’s Sin Breaker was artlessly smeared with a slight hint of red.\nThe message. I should have been cut. I should have been killed.\nEven so… now, I can’t even tell what part of me was injured.\n“So you revived… were you able to follow that attack? Fortis… truly troublesome, and a truly worthless authority.”\n“…”\nMy body could move perfectly.\nNot even the pain that had afflicted me before I was cut remained.\nI swallowed some air. I narrowed my eyes, and observed every one of her movements. I held my sword, and took a step forward.\n『Serge Serenade has Died. Cause of Death: Blunt Force Trauma』\nMy eyes went pitch black again. It was a feeling of loss great enough to swallow my soul.\nI instinctively gave my response to the message that came out.\nAnd I felt the light again.\nGloria was a mere few meters away. If there was nothing to obstruct me, it was a space I could span in the blink of an eye.\n“… Serge, what did you even come here for?”\n“!?”\nBlack again.\nCause of Death: Decapitation.\nI can’t see. I couldn’t see her sword. I couldn’t even see its afterimage.\nNo matter how much effort I put in, I wasn’t able to see any of it. The Gloria of my vision had always just been standing as she was. She hadn’t done a thing. That’s all it looked to me.\n“Could it be that you’re under the delusion that as long as you keep having a go at it endlessly, you’ll eventually win?”\nIt went black. The speed was too fast.\nMy blackouts and revivals. It was like a flickering lantern.\nAnd every time, I would spam YES whenever that question was to come up.\nI can’t see anything. I can’t hear anything. I’m scared. My senses are going cold, and this feeling of nihility is much too great.\nI compelled myself to keep reviving. Without permitting myself even a moment of waver, I forced myself to come back.\nWhat’s necessary was never power, but a heart that couldn’t be crushed. Just as when I was human, no matter what fear, no matter what enemy I stood to face… courage. Brave Heart.\nI rejected the deathful feeling of all my body’s heat being robbed away.\nRight. Courage.\nAs long as that doesn’t break, my defeat is… impossible.\n“Brave Heart. That only Skill granted to Angels that govern Fortis. With you power, no matter how many tens of thousands of times you’re to revive yourself, Heard aside, you’ll never even match up to Kanon or Zebul.”\nI let her provocations slide passed.\nThe moment I revived I retreated a stem. But even then… black again.\nIt wasn’t just once, each time the Cause of Death was displayed as Decapitation. The red staining the jet black earth was gradually growing thicker.\nThere’s no doubt I’m being cut at. There’s no doubt about that, but…\nMy field of vision slowly swayed. I’m not sure if that was because I was on the verge or collapsing, or because of this crushing pressure I felt on myself.\nGive up on life. Death is the inevitable result. That thought started growing in my head.\nThere was just one thing Gloria was wrong about.\nYes, the power bestowed upon Fortis Angels was unlimited resurrection. As long as the soul, as long as one’s courage doesn’t break, then the 『Brave Heart』 Skill was one that promised victory. And that’s all Fortis Angels were given.\nMany months and years have passed since I became a Valkyrie, and attained that authority. I don’t have any fear of death left anywhere within me.\nMy hazy vision. As if I was being swept about by the waves, this unreliable sense or reality.\nThe speed at which I died was much too fast. It was so swift that I didn’t even have the time to feel any pain, and that was my only saving grace.\nI revived, and in the slight moment before I died again, I poured some power into the sword in my right hand.\nThe Mana I could pour into it during that brief instant was truly small. But it was surely accumulating within my blade.\n“… I guess you’re not going to die off so easily… If I had the time, I’d personally sing your requiem, but…”\nGloria stopped her hand. From the start, she seemed to be concerned about time. I wonder what she’s so worried about.\nBut it’s my chance. In that moment, I poured my all into my Holy Sword. The blade received my will, and cloaked itself in a greater light. It was no longer some faint glimmer, but a definite darkness-destroying Sword of Light.\nI directed the tip towards Gloria, towards the Demon who was once the aspiration of all Angels.\nEven if this body is to fall apart, the will imbued in my sword will never go out.\nRegardless of what speed she may boast, what power she carries… she cannot avoid the light.\nThe energy gathered within my Holy Sword compressed in an instant, and converged at the end of the sword.\nWithout a single twitch of her brow, Gloria stared at the shimmering sword.\n… And I let out my power as a Hero, the power that had taken down all darkness in my path.",

They were human-shaped weapons to turn all creation to ash.\nThey were the weapon the human race devised to destroy any enemy that stood before them. The Holy Sword was nothing more than one of their methods to carry that out.\nBy its pure simplicity, it held no weakness, and therefore it had the power to destroy both Light and Dark equally.\nThe light cleared.\nThe inside my mouth was parched. Even when I hadn’t died yet, I couldn’t breathe. My throat was blocked up.\n“Well, well, well, it seems you’ve still yet to understand…”\n“Eh… why…”\nAfter the light was dispelled, what was revealed was Gloria standing with the exact same expression as before.\nHer body, and those tattered rags she wrapped around herself as clothes weren’t damaged at all.\nThat isn’t… possible.\nI’m sure it was a direct hit. Gloria hadn’t moved a single step.\nA decapitating blow at an unperceivable ungodly speed. That truly was fearsome. Bu this one… far surpassed my prior shock.\nSuperbia.\nOf all a Demon’s Seven sins, it held a high offensive potential, and an overwhelming level of Speed.\nIf so, then what is with that defensive capability? If I had failed to kill her from too low an output, I could accept it, but…\nA single blow with all the power of a Hero… the power that had brought ruin to three Demon Lords before. It’s surely impossible for her to be unscratched. Unthinkable.\n… Like this, it’s as if she’s not a Superbia, but a…\n『Serge Serenade has Died. Cause of Death: Decapitation』\nMy mind went white. On the display that suddenly popped up, my response was a beat later than before, but I somehow managed to select YES again.\nI revived. Around me spread a vast empty ground. I used my left hand to prop myself up, and rose. There aren’t any followup attacks coming gown on me.\n“It looks like you want to ask ‘why,’ Valkyrie.”\nGloria’s expression, her features that had been put in place like a fine work, were slightly bent.\nI’m not sure if the reason behind that face of hers was hatred, or perhaps compassion.\n“If you had been placed under my charge, I would have trained you up from the ground again… but, you’re not bad, I guess.”\nI had let out all the power stored in the sword. A second shot will take some time.\nBut without even jumping at that opportunity, she let out calm, and knowing words.\nNo, I doubt she even had to wait for a chance from the start. In the past few minutes, I don’t even know how many tens or hundreds or thousands of times I’ve been killed. That’s how big the difference in power was between us.\nI gradually began replenishing my power. The time I need is around ten seconds.\nThere’s no way a former Angel didn’t know about that, but as I thought, her expression didn’t change.\n“Hey, Valkyria. Do you not know of it? No, there’s no way you’re oblivious. The 『Superbia』 authority, the power to 『Overrule』 all things in creation.”\n“…!!”\nRecharge complete. I concentrated every nerve in my body to fire it off again.\nAs expected, Gloria showed no signs of dodging. The air distorted, and the destructive energy tore through the wind, as it swallowed up her small body.\nBut in response to that, all that returned were some disinterested words.\n“… So you really don’t get it. There’s no way I’ll be defeated by you. No, it precisely because it’s me, that there’s no reason for me to lose. I don’t even have to dodge. Serge Serenade, why is it that you, a mere 『Valkyrie』, the lowest possible rank of Angel, believe that your attack can get through to a former Saint Lord Class like Gloria Seidthroan?”\nI cannot listen. It’s all a fabrication. She’s just trying to break my heart.\nBut it’s not as if I had a chance to cover my ears, so those words jolted my brain.\nBut from the battle theory that I had forged over countless experience, I was quickly able to discern her meaning.\n『Overrule』\nOf course, I knew of it. It was a Pride Demon’s prideful way of dealing with things.\n… And it included the power to nullify powers they thought of as beneath them.\n“Ah… eh…”\nCertainly, if you go by that logic, then all of my attacks would… just be nullified by her Overrule.\n“… Eh? Then…”\n“Even if you repeated one hundred million attacks, that blade will never reach me.”\nWith eyes as if she was lecturing an incompetent student, Gloria declared as such.\nIt wasn’t a problem of output, but of principle.\nIt was law. Just as water was to flow towards the earth, my attacks were never to get through to this woman.\nMy vision went dark again.\nIt wasn’t just an illusion. The message displayed before my eyes was proof of that.\nWithin that darkness, the floating YES and NO.\nAll of my attacks will simply fall flat?\nI definitely cannot win?\nMy base attack power, and speed. The effort I piled up, and the power I’d tempered. Our base statuses as Demons and Angels were too far apart. It was hopeless.\nAfter staring at those words for several tens of seconds, I…\nSlowly, timidly selected YES.\nLight came to my eyes once more. With the same fed-up expression as before, she was there to greet me.\nYou won’t die? … How incorrigible. Is that courage, or thoughtlessness…“\n“…”\nThat piercing glare, and the feelings of scorn contained in it.\nI swallowed up the fear extending from my feet, and the basic fear I felt as a warrior.\n… I won’t lose.\nMy defeat is unthinkable. Impossible. My inability to understand when to give up was the only thing that never lost out.\nThe moment I became a Hero, I had already resolved myself to swallow down all feelings of loss.\nIf something of this extent… were to make me accept defeat, I would never have been called to Heaven, nor would I have become a Hero.\nMy breathing had been cut off for a while. My own tension, and the intimidating air Gloria let out stiffened my body.\nEven when I should have fully recovered, I felt it difficult to move.\nWithin my mouth, I wordlessly encouraged myself.\nI had always been fighting alone. No matter how hopeless the challenge, I took them on.\nI can win. I won’t lose. There’s no such thing as absolute. Yeah, that’s right. If giving up means death, then I am immortal. I’ll come back no matter how many tens or hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of times it takes. I’ll destroy you.\nSerge, you’re strong. Strong. Strong. Stronger than anyone.\nOverrule?\nThat surely is powerful. At Demon Lord Level, overcoming that is close to impossible by normal means.\nBut there should be some way around it.\nNo, the very fact that she needs to use Overrule to render my attacks useless means that if she didn’t use it, it would be possible for me to inflict damage on her. That fact I was able to give her a slight cut on my first attack is proof of that.\n… With all things taken into account, it’s not like she has defensive capabilities to get out of everything without a scratch.\nI’ve a countless number of experiences of having defeated Demons of Pride. I even know their weaknesses.\nThe countermeasures for Superbia.\nThe greatest one is… having them feel fear.\nAs Gloria recognizes me as an existence below her own, I need to give a Skill with an output enough to threaten her, and make her wary.\nI licked my dry lips, and got my breath in order. I calmed my pulse, and sharpened my awareness.\nGloria’s unbelievable beautiful eyes of gold continued jeering intently at me.\nThe emotion within them was contempt. The way one with absolute strength would look down on a lesser being.\nI bit my lip, and shut off the incessant ringing of my instincts not to fight the one before me.\nI pretended not to notice my fright. I fooled my own heart. All the way to now, that’s how I always fought. Back when I was human, and there henceforth. Fear was my enemy, and my friend.\nI clenched the hand holding my sword. What I need is my attack with the highest firepower. An attack with the sword itself would be best.\nI stored all my energy into it, and instead of emitting it, I collected it around the edge… I’ll cut her up directly.\nNormally, actually hitting her with a swing of this sword would be the most difficult option, but right now, this woman is being negligent.\nAnd in that, there was a small, ridiculously small chance for my victory. And as long as there’s a chance… I won’t break.\nBut at that moment, the moment where I stepped forward for the sake of that slim piece of hope, Gloria curled her face into a smile.\n“Still… that power… even if it isn’t to get through to me, perhaps it may work on that man… but I’ve no time to paint her my colors…”\nGloria’s wings opened up wide.\nThose ten appendages were likely the vestiges of back when she was an Angel. Something one wouldn’t find on any ordinary Demon.\nThey fluttered a little, and her body gently rose into the sky.\n“Struggle all you want… just how far will that power of yours go… how far can you prove your recklessness on these lands…”\nMy thoughts took a turn.\nShe’s running away. Can my wings catch up?\nIt’s no good. She’s running away. If I want to kill her, this is my last chance. There’s a high probability the speed of those wings of hers exceeds mine.\nThere’s no way I can catch her if she takes flight.\nThose spread wings of darkness. Unlike when she was an Angel, their form and color had become much more sinister.\nI took a step forward. I took to the sky. I kicked the air. I brandished my sword. Gloria’s body moved. My target vanished from my sight. She appeared again ten meters to my side.\nIt’s no good, I still can’t see her. Even in the air, those movements of hers were still in good health. I have no means to give chase.\nShe’s running away. No, perhaps I’m the one being spared? They’re both the same.\nBy the time I noticed it, the words were coming out of my mouth. It wasn’t to buy some time, but out of honest curiosity.\nAlways alone, I barely let my voice out since coming to the Demon World. The sound I let out after all this time was terribly cracked.\n“Wait, Gloria! Please, answer me one thing!”\nThat Angel was surely one of the brightest stars in the sky.\nA single holy Angel, who embraced strong trust from God.\nA woman who earned much reverence from her brethren. Enough that, when we never even talked, she remained firm in my memory, a woman whose names wrung across the Heavens.\nAnd why…\n“Why are you alive!? I’m certain that you were…”\nWithout waiting for me to finish, she climbed up higher and higher.\nI didn’t follow, but simply looked up, and shouted.\n“… felled in a battle against a mighty Demon Lord.”\nGloria Stopped.\nIn a brief moment, her expression underwent a complete change.\nHer eyes were directed at me once more.\n“… What?”\n… From a crooked smile, to an expressionless face. An expression I had never seen before.\n“Demon… Lord…? Felled in… a battle with… a Demon Lord…?”\nHer frightened voice rung out higher than the heavens. Her small form blurred.\nMy breath became short. Those golden eyes appeared before my eyes, and finally, I realized I was being clasped up by the neck.\nBut the one who had lost their composure wasn’t me… but the woman before me.\nBlack emotions swirled in the depths of her pupils. Disorder, or perhaps hatred.\n“A Demon Lord, you say!? What nonsense, at the time, Heard Lauder was…”\n“Herd… loader…?”\nThe bones of my neck let out a creaking sound. I can’t breathe at all.\nI’m going to die. I’m going to be killed. My neck’s going to be wrung out to death. My field of vision flickered on and off, and my soul raised a wail.\nWithin that uncollected consciousness, I thought about the meaning of those words.\nIt was a name I had some recollection of.\nA name on that list of powerful Demons that had been circulating about heaven.\nA Superbia Demon who held the epithet of the Prideful Kaiser. He stood at the forefront of the army, and slayed a number of Angels. An infamous Demon.\nBut that’s wrong. That’s not how it is. It’s different from the rumors I’ve heard.\nIn the first place, there’s too much a difference between a General Class Demon, and a Saint Lord Angel. Even more so with the Angel commander being the greatest anti-Demon Iustitia Angel. Even if they came with an army of Demons, such a difference wasn’t so easily overturned in a head-on battle.\nBut at the same time, it was the talk of the town back in heaven. That’s why I remember it well.\nGloria Seidthroan engaged in battle with the army of the Lord of Depravity.\nShe was able to repel the General Demon leading their main forces, but…\n“What does this… mean? I lost to… a Demon Lord? I. Was. Defeated!?”\nMy body was swung around. It was as if she was a child throwing a tantrum.\nMore than me, the woman herself was much more confused.\nShe was letting out the presence I couldn’t sense at all before. That smothering atrocious presence of a Demon Lord saddened me, in proving well enough that the woman before me was no longer a Lord of Angels.\nA chance.\nIf I were to attack right now, wouldn’t the damage get through? I tried to lift the hand clasped around my sword, but I couldn’t put any power into it. Angels and Demons didn’t require respiration all too much, but even so, the throat was still a single vital point.\nWith all my might, I glared at her. But while Gloria’s eyes seemed poised in my direction, she wasn’t looking at me.\nIt was a hollow glance as if she were staring into a world of dreams.\nWhy… just what is it that she’s seeing…?\nSuddenly, the crushing feeling about my neck disappeared. Power returned to my body.\nLosing my support, I began to plummet, but before I hit the ground, I managed to move my wings, and raise myself.\nI took a deep breath, and corrected my posture. When I had gotten myself in order, a bizarre spectacle entered my eyes.\n“Ah… no, nonsense… wha… this power is…”\nFrozen in midair, Gloria’s eyes were wide open.\nBut that position of hers was my chance.\nHer wings weren’t moving at all. No, more than that, it looked like her entire body had been glued fast to space. As if there was something locking her to the air.\nBut the strangest thing of all was… her face.\nWithout surprise, without scorn, her expression was surely… what one would call impatient.\nThe words flowing out of her mouth were the emotions of rage she had never directed at me, even as I held a blade against her.\nHer golden irises seemed to be searching for something, as they made large swaying motions.\nAnd Gloria’s body shot off.\nWithout even moving her wings, she started gliding down diagonally with fearsome momentum, collided with the ground head-on, and bounced a couple of times before coming to a halt.\nNo, rather than gliding, she crashed and burned.\nRaising a cloud of dust, she crashed, but she immediately corrected her stance, and landed properly, before lifting herself into the air again.\nThe hair that reached all the way to her feet was standing on end, and as if something had grasped her, she floated aimlessly around space.\nIt was a scene I had never seen before. An unknown phenomenon.\nI mean, for a Demon who could easily brush off all attacks, and moved at ungodly speeds unperceivable by the eye, who would think she would let herself be grasped like that?\nGloria’s eyes were locked on empty space. There was absolutely nothing in that direction, but her gaze was surely seeing something.\n“I see… so it was you who…”\nWithout finishing her sentence, her body began to rotate with her hair at the fulcrum, before she flew off again. This time, it wasn’t to the ground, but parallel to it. As if that small frame of hers was a bullet leaving its chamber, she shot forth, and raised a tuft of smoke at the horizon.\nWhat was that phenomenon… wait, phenomenon?\nNo, that’s wrong. Gloria was definitely directing her words at someone.\nIt was without a doubt that her actions held intent. She was trying to attack something.\nI remained vigilant. But within the web of my perception, I could only capture the three large swaying powers a few kilometers away, and a number of smaller forces, a flock of Demons coming closer.\nEven at the moment Gloria flew off, I couldn’t see anyone around me.\nAn invisible enemy… no, a long distanced assault?\nAn enemy launched an attack on Gloria, but nothing on me. I don’t get their standards.\nI can’t see. I can’t see anything. It wasn’t something like Gloria’s speed that exceeded my dynamic vision.\nBuilt on a different principle than Pride, a power of invisibility.\n… That power didn’t align with any of the abilities I had learned about in Heaven.\nAnd to the one who took it on… even Gloria herself seemed to be in an abnormal state.\n“LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGG\nGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE!!! WHAAATT’S THE MEANING OF THIS YOU BAAAAAASSSSTTTTTAAAAAAAAAARD!!!”\nThat voice of resentment that seemed to come straight from the depths of hell made the air shake.\nLike the howling of a beast. Despite having been blown across the horizon, Gloria returned before my sight in an instant, and a following her, a delayed strong wing swept over the scenery.\nWhile there was some black dirt staining her joints, there weren’t any notable wounds on her body.\nBut her eyes had completely snapped.\nThe face of a devil. Her pupils had opened completely, as she glared in every direction to find this unseeable enemy.\nHer power had completely been freed from its previous concealment, and her idiotically high Mana stirred up the miasma, scattering pebbles left and right.\nAs if a curtain had been lowered over it, the world grew darker.\nPerhaps noticing this abnormality, the three large clashing forces put their movements on hold.\nMy thoughts haven’t caught up the present situation. I don’t know. I don’t know anything. I’ve too little information.\nThere’s no doubt it’s the work of some third party. But I can’t see their form. There must be a meaning to it. That’s what Gloria, who’s swinging around her malice left and right goes to prove.\nIt must be…\nSensing something Gloria gave her wings a large flap, and drew a spiral in the air, as she ascended higher and higher.\nAt just about the same time, the ground began to shake violently. If my legs had been on the land, I would have felt an unbearable earthquake.\nAlong with the tremors, some parts of the ground were projected up, and cracks began to spread.\n“…”\nAfter a few seconds, a strong wind began to blow. From up to down.\nI struggled to fight against the bizarre wind flowing towards the land.\nI looked up at the sky, kicked the air below, and moved my wings.\nIn my widened vision, the blood red blinding sun. A wide-open sky. Not a single cloud to be found.\nI soared through the sky. To Angels, that was a natural action akin to breathing. After a few seconds, the wind ceased, and I looked back at the ground to understand the intent of the attack.\n… No, the ground hadn’t risen at all, it had caved.\nSpreading many meters, indented soil as if it had been crushed underfoot.\nI wonder what sort of Skill would have to be used to bring about such a result.\nNo, it it’s just boring into the earth, then Gloria, and likely a majority of the other Demon Lords could do it. I’m sure I could as well.\nThe problem was, that I couldn’t discern the means ot attack, and I couldn’t see the form of the third party that had accomplished it anywhere.\nA mysterious attack. A power to control the wind? No, if you think about the nature of the attack Gloria took on…\nRight below me, Gloria stood on the land. Her attention was completely removed from me.\n“S-show yourself… Leigie! Why, are you…!? All of this is your…”\nBloodshot eyes. Her expression held no disdain, and what it displayed was an anger close to madness. The Sin Breaker that had manifested in her hand was recklessly cutting countless lines in the air.\nOut raced countless shockwaves of light. The air pressure senselessly rended the earth, and as if it were crying out, the wind played out a high pitched sound.\nThose slashes flew out. A few of them came at me, but passed by my sides.\nThe reason they didn’t hit was because they weren’t something aimed at me. But if one of them had shifted just a little, I would have likely had my wings ripped off.\nI was no longer in Gloria’s eyes. No, there wasn’t anything reflected in them.\nHer screams and malice were certainly directed at something, but I couldn’t see what.\nThere was only one thing I knew.\nMore calmly than even in this chaos. The theory I had always been reminded of made me issue my judgement. It’s not like I haven’t seen it play through enough times.\nThat was what Demons were. I felt an illusion of all the blood in my body freezing over, and shook my arms.\n… There’s always someone greater.\nWithout a doubt, there’s someone higher.\nOne called Gloria, of the highest Rank of Angels, and now Gloria Seidthroan, one who held the authority of both an Angel and a Demon. There was someone much greater than she.\nOtherwise, there’s no way Gloria would display so much rage.\nI’ll run. I have to run. I have to report this.\nEven if her characteristic may be Pride, with me falling so far behind her, the chances that I won’t be a match for this new challenger are exceedingly high.\nWhile that power has yet to be directed at me, I’ll return to heaven, and report…\nI moved my wings with all my might, and started rising up to the sky. The spiraling chaotic miasma to my back, I rapidly closed in on the sun. The wind I felt all over my body instantly dried off my cold sweat.\nThe point to connect the Demon World and Heaven wasn’t a specific place.\nI stopped one high in the air, and looked back down at the ground.\nThe small speck that was likely Gloria. The three Demon Lords I had been sensing for a while.\nAs I thought, even when I look from up high, I can’t see any new enemy. I can’t feel anything.\n… But there was one thing I figured out.\n“… This is…”\nThe attack’s… identity.\nNo, I still don’t know that. I have no idea where the attacker’s authority lay.\nBut the marks left in the earth by coincidence or inevitability, had taken on a form I was familiar with.\nFive long trenches, with a wide area connecting them… right, that center. There was one large cavity at the base of all of them. The hollowed out ground, and the slight differentiation of color made it all too clear. From the ground it was something too big to make out, but that form I hadn’t expected was…\n“… The palm… of a hand…!?”\nAn absurdly large palm.\nIt was as if I was seeing a dream. I widened my eyes, and climbed higher.\nIt’s… big.\nIts scale was off the charts, but I’m sure that’s… the shape of a human hand. That caving I had been a witness to, that denting of the ground had… only been but a single finger. I can’t think any of this is without meaning.\nAs I stared in a daze at the unexpected situation, the ground raised a tremor.\nThe remains of that attack dotted that black wasteland again and again. An intense sound, as if to indicate the end of the world, made me forget the thunderous wail of the wind racing past my ears.\nIf this truly is the work of a single lifeform’s hand, then there’s no doubt its weilder is large enough to reach for the heavens. Greater than any lifeform I’ve ever happened on before…\nCompared to the marks left behind by it, both me and Gloria, with our statures of less than two meters, were nothing more than ants. The scale was too extreme.\nGloria’s body was picked up, and was sent flying again. As she was shot off, she used her wings to correct her posture.\nNow I can understand it. She truly was being thrown about. By invisible hands.\nAnd taking the attacks, Gloria herself realized as well.\nThe blade she swung around absurdly was to counteract those hands.\nAnd she wasn’t doing that good of a job at it.\nWhether it was possible or not to do anything about it was another story. Gloria should withdraw. She should flee. Whether there’s a means or not, the way she flailed about meaninglessly no longer had any of the level-headed thought she displayed when taking me on.\nI concentrated my eyes. It seems Gloria has yet to take any actual damage.\nShe was in distress trying to evade those unseeable, and wide-scoped attacks, but the blows from those hands didn’t boast too much firepower. Regardless of how many times she took those attacks, there weren’t any notable injuries on her body, and as a Demon Lord, her light wounds would heal in no time at all. It would likely take quite a long time for an end to be drawn to this.\nA small waver was produced in my mindset for retreat.\nWhat should I do?\nIts identity was one thing, but I didn’t know its objective.\nWith the size of that hand, unless there was a specific intent to avoid me, I should have been crushed as well.\nThe master of that power… is Gloria its only target?\nShould I observe for a little longer?\nGloria and the hand’s master. At the very least, there are two out there outside the recognition of heaven. A little, just a little is enough. I need as much information as possible.\nI flapped my wings, and made it so I could run at any time.\nAt that moment, the responses from my perception disappeared.\nFor a brief while, the presences of the three Demon Lords that I always kept wary of in a corner of my mind went out, before appearing again. No, it wasn’t just those three that had disappeared.\nIt had been but a short flicker. Just the blink of an eye, but the scenery before my eyes had, in the pause it took to go over a single comma, changed entirely.\nWhat had made its abrupt appearance was a countless number of Demons. Besides Gloria, and those three Demon Lords, a flock of Demons below Demon Lord Level had gathered before I realized it.\nI looked over them with my enhanced vision. I could even make out the expressions on those Demons that were like specks of dust from up here. Perhaps they hadn’t expected it either, as they all seemed to be dumbfounded.\nThe situation just kept on changing.\nI couldn’t move. I hadn’t the time to avert my eyes.\nI hadn’t the time to feel the stir of the wind, or that repulsive and wild miasma act up. I hadn’t even the chance to determine whether or not a Skill had been used.\nMy field of vision was filled by darkness. Within it, I was finally able to regain my self-awareness.\nMy feet shook, and my soul froze over.\nI grasped my situation. I looked over my surroundings in a daze. I made my decision.\nIt’s not like what I saw had changed. It’s not that those Demons had disappeared.\nGloria and the others hadn’t gone away… but I myself had been transported.\nA horridly gloomy corridor constructed of jet black stone. As if placed to measure its depth, the candlesticks stationed at regular intervals. This heavy and cold air.\nThe dim light put out by the candles contrarily made the places that remained unlit- the nooks of the corridor, and the corners of the ceiling- give off a deeper sense of darkness.\nWhat I had definitely sensed before, the presences of Gloria and the other Demons were no longer there. In their place… I felt a somewhat nostalgic aura.\nAs if pierced by an icy sword, the inside of my brain gave a cold pain.\nIn a past beyond memory, it was a presence I’d felt twice before.\nMy hand creaked.\nWithout my notice of it, I had begun clenching my sword with all my might. I was putting in enough power for my knuckles to turn white.\nAh, there’s no way I could forget it. I didn’t even have to try to remember.\nNo matter how long ago it may have been, even if it was in my time of humanity, my era as a Hero that I had almost completely lost my recollection of to the flow of time, ‘That’ was something I could never forget.\nIt was a bitter memory.\nWhat I fought as a Hero, my final enemy.\nAt that moment, I forgot about Gloria and the other Demons, and even the prophecy, as I thought back to a time passed.\nIf I had been a true Hero, then the bards’ songs would have ended with a triumph, or perhaps a noble sacrifice, yet this tale only ever found its close in one-sided defeat.\n＊＊＊＊＊\nThe Hero and the Demon Lord.\nThat pairing that I’m sure every human in the world thought of as equal was, in truth, not equivalent at all. I knew that more than anyone.\nAs a hero, my sworn enemy was the Demon Lord, but that was the one who had climbed to the surface. The one of the Demon World wasn’t something to be dealt with by human hands.\nThe Under Ground.\nIt was a sort of taboo. In order to avoid mayhem, there were barely any who even knew of its existence, the world’s greatest haunt of evil.\nA hell that only existed in bed-time stories. A hell bad kids were sent to for disobeying their mothers.\nIt was an abyss of a world, where the highest class of Evil Spirits, Demons stood at the summit.\nThose fields with miasma swirling about incomparable to what one would find on the surface gave the Demons that already boasted strong powers unsurmountable enhancements. The powers of whatever ones you could find on the surface were something like scraps. When compared to Demons of the Demon world, they wouldn’t even reach their feet.\nThat fact was one that I, as a hero having devoted my life to forging an enormous power, and having racked up my achievements of dispelling any and all evil I could find, learned after finally being permitted to set foot into that world.\nHeroes were hope. Against ones who sided with the powers of darkness, defeat was not permitted.\nAmong the world’s few Heroes, the reason that information was passed to me was likely because I was the Hero who threw myself into and triumphed over hopeless situations at a rate incomparable to the others, but still, in the end, I was nothing.\nJust as the words implies. Nothing.\nI closed my eyes.\nWhat I grasped in my perception was a Mana gloomier, and quieter than all.\nAs if to show it off, that power pulsed.\nI’m being watched. This Demon Lord should already know of my presence. Even so, he doesn’t move. It was as if he were telling me to come over to him.\nThere was no malicious intent, and that power held no impurities, but in size it was larger than anything.\nPerhaps… it was even greater than the piercing Mana Gloria displayed at the end.\nIt wasn’t sharp at all. That power merely hung heavily over me. I finally noticed. The identity of what had been stirring my blood and soul when I confronted the Fallen Angel. The presence I didn’t notice because of all the Demon Lords mixed in.\nI felt a meaningless pressure. Within that, I went forward, step by step.\nMy memories pumped up, one after another. The power I felt when I fought him as a Hero. It had far exceeded that now.\nBut my heart was frighteningly calm.\nI had conviction that he hadn’t been killed off yet. But at the same time, I doubt I would find it strange if he was.\nThe Demon Lord followed the law of the jungle. Unlike the Angels, that generally never waged wars among themselves, the faces of powerful Demons changed too often. No matter the case, the probability of a Demon that offered absolutely no resistance living such a long life can’t be too high.\nThe passages branched off like a labyrinth. Black walls. The systematic markings carved into them. Perhaps I’m in a Demon Lord’s castle.\nWithin myself, I continued to hone my power, as I disinterestedly walked forward.\nThey’re not here. The overflowing amount of subordinate Demons one would usually find in a Lord’s Castle were nowhere to be found.\nBut even that felt natural to me.\nI refined my power.\nIt was perhaps the only regret I still held for my past life.\nFor one who cut down all manners of Evil Spirits, all manners of Humans, all manner of sinners, the girl who continued to save the world for her own sake alone, the only lingering attachment to this world.\nThe reason why, even when I didn’t actually like to fight, I chose to continue down this path, even after death.\nThere wasn’t a single one before me to hinder my advance.\nWhat I arrived at was the deepest chamber. A giant set of doors.\nThe power I felt by putting myself against one of them made me close my eyes. I took some short breaths.\nI see… it’s on another level.\nI finally began to grasp why Heaven dispatched me here.\nThis must be fate… no, destiny.\nI am a hero, and he is a Demon Lord. I’ll risk every bit of life I have left in me as a Hero, to take back the defeat I suffered long ago.\nIn a split second, I had finished mustering up all my resolve, and opened up those doors. Just as I did once, long ago.",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 7: Fortis’ Courage, Part 4: Until We Meet Again\nThe Demon Lord was there.\nAtop the boorish pitch-black throne. The chamber without a sound.\nHis hair a deeper shade than black, and those slovenly eyes. A jet-black coat draped over his entire bocy. With shadows stuck to his face, and an irritating look to his eyes, a delicate-looking man.\nCompared to any other Demon Lord I had chanced upon before, his appearance was lacking in majesty, and on that, my memories of the past played back. Nothing had changed in his figure since the last we locked blades.\nThere wasn’t another Demon to be found. Even when he was supposed to be a Lord, he had no one to follow him.\nThere was only one point that differed from my last memory of him. Simply the fact that the man was not asleep.\nIt seems he truly was waiting for me.\nWithout saying a word, without any preparations for attack, only his eyes followed me, and those pupils of his were stagnated with an unfamiliar darkness. They didn’t even take in the glint of the Holy Sword gripped in my right hand, and all they met with were my own eyes.\n… I’m scared.\nI took a step forward.\nThe gap between this pressure pushing down on my entire body, and that dignity that equated close to nothing.\nThe fact that I felt no fear from looking at him was all the more scary. If it was my first meeting, then I would likely have been caught off guard.\nAs if I were walking through a bog, my feet were heavy.\nThe moment I thought to let out my voice, the Demon Lord opened his mouth.\nBefitting his appearance, it was a depressing and dark voice. A voice I was hearing for the first time.\nWhat was he to say to me? I tensed up my shoulders, and waited, but his words made me forget my very situation.\n“Back hip circle.”\n“… Eh?”\nBack hip… circle?\nWhat is he talking about…? I sought out meaning from his expression, but the Demon Lord’s face didn’t change at all.\nThe man before me continued to look in my direction, with eyes that didn’t seem to be focused on me, as he talked on.\n“In the past, I couldn’t do a back hip circle. Do you know of it? Back hip circle? You use a metal horizontal bar, and you do this sort of spinning motion around it.”\n“W-what are… you even…”\n“I think it was around elementary school… they tried to make us do it in gym class, but I just couldn’t do it. I never even thought of trying to be able to do it. Because I never thought myself capable, I didn’t even put in the effort. In the end, up to the very last moment, I couldn’t do it. In the first place, I was never the best at physical activity.”\nI couldn’t understand any of the words he was letting out at length.\nNo, besides a small portion of it, I could comprehend the vocabulary. However, I cannot understand the reason of such a talk unfolding here.\nI can’t read his intent.\nLeaving me to the wayside, the Demon Lord went one.\nHe was full of openings, but I didn’t even have the will to attack him.\nThe only thing I could understand was that this meaningless banter wasn’t the sort of thing to occur before the world’s decisive battle.\n“And so, naturally, even when I went graduated to middle school and graduated to high school, and even after I entered college, I could never do it. Well, I’ve never seen anyone in college doing a back hip circle on a horizontal bar, but… I guess that doesn’t really matter. What I’m trying to say is that, in the end, even when I went out and became a working adult, I never became able to do a back hip circle. Even when most of my past memory’s faded away, I wonder why that’s the only thing I can remember.”\nFuuuh. The Demon Lord let out what was clearly a sigh, before his lips curved.\n“… But it seems that right now, I can do pretty much anything.”\nI had never even imagined this Lord as one to laugh, but what had dimly grazed his face was surely… a smile. It wasn’t one of ridicule like Gloria’s, and it wasn’t anything like an honest smile of joy. I’m sure it was his self derision.\nThe Demon Lord’s words didn’t stop. It was as if he was a completely different person from the one I met before.\nHis words came out disinterestedly, but I could feel an emotion I couldn’t understand behind them.\nThe topic changed quite suddenly.\n“Then have you ever heard of the Magic Lamp?”\n“Magic… Lamp?”\nListening to his words is a waste of time. I should initiate an attack. But my hands won’t move.\nThese words without meaning, without intent, were binding my movement. It wasn’t something like a Skill.\nI knew. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to move. I wanted to listen.\nI had the feeling that the reason for both of my defeats lay somewhere in there.\n“Yeah. It’s in the One Thousand and One Stores… A fairy tale from the Arabian Nights. A tale of a genie that came out from rubbing a musty oil lamp.”\n“I don’t… know it.”\nFairy tale.\nIt’s a story I’ve never heard of before, and I’m not sure what he’s trying to say. Perhaps there nothing I should say here.\nI couldn’t see an atrocious nature in him, and yet my shoulders trembled.\nIn this case, having him direct killing intent at me would be… much easier.\nI had forgotten about it. The cold feeling running up from my navel. Fear.\nThe Demon Lord raised his voice into a laugh. It was a dry chuckle.\nLooking upon the scene, I doubt there’s a single one who’d call this man a Demon Lord.\nI finally noticed the reason. He was much to lacking in anything one could see as desire.\n“Just by brushing up against a lamp, all sorts of wishes could be granted. That sort of story. Having lost any and all restrictions, a magic tool to grant any prayer. I sometimes thing. Of lucky Aladdin whose hands it happened to fall into… just what sort of thoughts went through his mind.”\nI don’t know. I don’t know anything.\nWith an aloof attitude, he avoided my wary eyes. And the Demon Lord’s face changed.\nA sigh, and a sinking voice.\n“Hero…”\n『Hero』\nIt was a word I hadn’t heard from another in a long time.\nThere’s barely anyone left in this world to call me by that name. It had truly been a long time since anyone named me as such, that it took a moment for me to realize he was calling out to me.\nPerhaps this man is all that’s left to call me by that name. The final enemy I failed to kill. The final enemy to know me as a Hero.\n“Hero… I’m… surely a 『Cheat』.”\n“Ch… eat?”\nHe folded over his legs, sent those abyssal eyes at me, and sighed.\nI couldn’t tell the motives behind that word. But it had been the one with the single most emotion packed into it.\nA voice that sounded as if it was tired of everything. Back when I was a human, when I had lived as a Hero, the voice used by those with things they should have protected. A child who’d lost his parents, a young man who’d lost their lover, a soldier who’d gone up against the forces of evil, and survived their own defeat.\n“Even without doing anything, I’ve become able to accomplish anything. Without any of the effort, I’ve become able to do anything. I’m sure there’s no worth left in any of it. That’s why, to me, you’re the only lingering attachment I have to this world.”\nI couldn’t possibly understand the words from this Demon Lord.\nBut it’s not like I didn’t have anything left to think.\nStill, more than that, I understood that the die had been cast. That the formalities had been gone and done with.\nDemon Lord and Hero. What we had to do had been determined long ago. I was already resolved. I wasn’t negligent.\nThat was something my opponent was well aware of.\n“Now, it sure has been a while, Hero. You, who may be the one to kill me. You, who may be the one to be killed by me. My arch nemesis. The only one I’ve ever recognized as an enemy of my own volition. Have you trained yourself enough? Do you remember our last battle?”\nOur last battle. The blows from my Holy Sword that were unable to leave a single scratch on him flashed back in my mind.\nThe Demon Lord who barely moved.\nAfter tens of hundreds of thousands of years, just what has changed in this man? His face held a gentle spot of delight.\nThe fact that I was to meet him the first I stepped foot into the Demon World was just a coincidence.\nThe second time, I sought him out, and demanded a battle.\nAnd surely, this third confrontation is fate.\nThat’s why, no matter the numbers that Demon Lords exist in, thie man is the one that must be killed by me.\nAs a Hero.\nI put more light, more soul into the Holy Sword.\nMy past retreat. Where even in his normal state, he boasted immense defensive power to render any blade inept. The Demon Lord who broke my blade.\nAnd I didn’t know his name. The man introduced himself for the first time.\n“… Right, my name is Leigie. The Lazy King governing the sin of 『Sloth』, and your… enemy. I’ve already taken care of anyone to interfere. Now, Hero, come and…”\nThe Demon Lord’s fingers mover ever so slightly. My senses were honed to a level higher than ever before.\nI immediately jumped to the side to evade. The door behind me was blown off its hinges.\n『I’ve already taken care of anyone to interfere.』\nAs I thought the one who launched an attack on Gloria was this man!\nThe Lazy King who named himself as Leigie muttered in a slovenly tone without any intonation.\nI kicked the ground, and used my wings to accelerate.\nLeigie’s gaze intersected with the killing intent in my eyes.\nWithout letting out any words, the Demon Lord’s lips moved to themselves.\n『… try to kill me.』\n＊＊＊＊＊\nWhat I was given as a Hero, and honed as an Angel were all directed towards battle.\nThe shaking of my hands, and the shaking of my body had ceased.\nI stepped in. The floor shattered before my feet. The strongest concentration. The strongest condition. There wasn’t any space left in my soul for me to feel fear against this Demon Lord. The greatest, and most powerful enemy of all was before me, and the all the experience I had ever gotten over my life was whispering for me to defeat him.\nMy awareness was suddenly delayed. I could clearly see the bags that had formed under his eyes.\nLeigie. Leigie the Depraved.\nThe name rolled around my tongue.\nWithout his name, there was never a way to look into him.\nEven if I may have been a human, I wielded the foremost power of the Surface World, and his ability to block that without anything to guard himself meant there was no way he wasn’t a long lived Demon.\nBut I think I was just running away. With that power before me, I had broken. I was running from his existence. Because if I was to learn of him again, I would have no choice but to fight him.\nBut at times, I did wonder whether I would see him again. Even if I didn’t as one on the vanguard of heaven, most information about Demons naturally entered my ears. As natural as it may be, I did have knowledge of that name.\nLeigie. Leigie the Depraved.\nOne who pulled their bowstring against the Heavens, one of oldest Demon of them all. Leigie Slaughterdolls.\nI already knew his characteristics. The characteristics of an Acedia Demon.\nIt was an absolute defense. That was all.\nThat enhancement was separate from his base specs, but there’s no way his offensive power or speed is anything too high. At the very least, he should be less than Gloria in that aspect.\nThe threat of his invisible attacks lay in that he sent them out from a distance impossible to detect. If Leigie and Gloria had directly confronted one another, then she would likely have been able to employ some form of tactic.\nWhat I need is a destructive power great enough to destroy his soul, and that was my… reason for defeat.\nHave I trained myself? … There’s no need to ask. At the start, it was just something that had been handed to me, but I surely trained that power. As a Valkyrie, so as not to face defeat a second time. In the years since I was reborn, there’s no way I was just playing around.\nRegret, regret, regret.\nThere was no way I could fill it in with my human body… the sheer difference between us.\nThe magician’s words of pity repeated within my head.\nI don’t need to think of defense. The power I have now, what I never had before. The Fortis Authority. My heart will never break.\n“The truth is… I did feel a little sorry for it.”\nThe moment my sword was about to reach him, before my eyes, Leigie, who should have been but a step away, grew farther.\nMy sense of distance was upturned. My suppositions, and the disparity of truth. I used the momentum that was causing me to topple over, and took another step. With all my power, I gripped the sword in both hands, and aimed for his heart.\n… And at that moment, he became farther again.\nIt’s not my imagination. It’s not an illusion.\n… Farther? No, that’s wrong. Leigie was still sitting on the throne.\nThe one moving away was… me.\nThe throne was just a few meters in front of me. I put more power into my feet, and dove in. the moment before the blade reached him, my field of vision shifted.\nIt wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me. It wasn’t that my body was being manipulated.\n“I’m sorry for not taking you on earnestly last time. Well, I was sleepy, so there really was no helping it, but… if I had been a little more serious back then, perhaps I wouldn’t have to go through these regrets. The thought alone kept me up at ni… oh, wait, well, um…”\nWhile talking on, Leigie’s arm gave a small movement.\nAn impact sent my entire body flying.\nOh shi…\nBy the time I noticed it, it was too late. My body crashed into the wall, and was pressed against it. By an invisible feeling of pressure.\nIt was a force that made my body feel it would be ripped apart. My creaking body and the wall both let out their screams.\nLeigie presented out the palm of his hand. He started turning his hand in a circle. Accompanying that motion that looked like a joke, the points of pressure twisted.\nWhile looking upon that scene carelessly, Leigie politely, as if he was trying to buy time for something, began to explain.\nWhat foolishness is this… no, it would be strange for me to think that he only had a single power.\nI’m fine, the damage is within expectations. My bones aren’t broken, and I haven’t suffered anything fatal.\nAnd more than that, I was impressed. On the fact that Leigie initiated an attack on his own.\n“『Aport』”\nTurning my blade on a being without resistance, yet having it fall flat.\nIt was a situation as if my everything had all been meaningless, and that had been the greatest fear I held.\nThe Demon Lord is to attack me, and I’m to counteract. In that case, I can still be a Hero.\nEven if that Lord had yet to even rise from his throne.\n“『Teleportation』 and 『Psychokinesis』. Of course, here, they have different names, but… it seems that all the powers I ever wished for have come into my hands.”\nWhile he went on about his own Skills, his face held no scorn, or anger, or sorrow.\nThe Demon Lord stood. Even when there was no need to stand, he rose. The past two times, he had laid sprawled out the entire battle, and yet he stood.\n“Hero, I will pay respect to you as a Demon Lord, by killing you. You will kill me, and I will kill you. Even if it felt like a pain, I’m sure that’s what I should have done.”\nEven when all he did was stand, even when it’s not like his power rose at all, a premonition of my entire body being swallowed up made my arms tremble.\nI frantically moved my crushed body, and touched whatever was pressing down on me with the Holy Sword.\nAn invisible something was ripped through, and vanished. My body was released. I landed over the carpet. I had a slight hope, but it doesn’t look like Leigie took any damage.\nI let out a short breath. My head hurt so much it felt it would split. I didn’t have enough oxygen. I didn’t have enough Mana.\nI’m sure my heart felt fear. Before the existence who defeated me without me having any means to resist. It was a form of trauma.\nBut I’ll ignore that. I had confidence. I had always fought on. A majority of my enemies had been above me.\nThe reason I won against them was simply… because I never gave up.\nFirst, I’ll have to land an attack. A blow with all my might.\nMy target is the Demon’s heart… his soul core. As long as Leigie is taking up human form, its location should be in his left chest… where a heart was supposed to bear.\nI can’t release energy at him. I’ll have to slash at him directly…\nI put my breathing in order. My sword was already fully loaded with power.\nTeleport, Aport. It will be next to impossible to approach him, but if I fail the first time, then perhaps I can close in the second.\nI wanted an opening. I chanted magic.\nLeigie’s movements were slow. That psychokinesis thing was linked to the Demon Lord’s movements. I saw that clearly.\nI cut away the palm shot at me. It’s difficult to dodge, but as I thought, it’s fragile. As long as I inflict an attack on it, it’ll disappear.\nWhite light flickered on and off as it gathered in my left hand.\nWith depressing eyes, Leigie looked at me.\n“Hah… hah…”\n“… Ah. You’re really looking the part there.”\n“『Crescent Thunder』!!”\nLeigie’s slovenly posture was swallowed up by the white thunder I released.\nIt was a lightning attribute offensive magic possessed by Heroes.\nThe carpet caught fire, and the throne was taken in by it. Imbued with a holy element, that lightning was originally supposed to deal heavy damage to dark forces. But General Class was one thing, and I didn’t think that it would have any effect on this Lord.\nThe moment I fired it, I let my body dance through the sky. I took flight. The ceiling was high, and I was able to soar about.\nI took a great spin, and swooped down to try and behead him from behind. At that moment, the scene before me changed.\nLeigie, who was supposed to be before my eyes, disappeared, and the blade’s edge cut through the air.\nI had predicted it before hand, so I didn’t stiffen up.\nI carefully examined the power of my foe. Aport. There’s no forewarning of it. I can’t go against it. From before Leigie’s eyes, I had been transported to the end of the room. A wall close in up to my nose.\nI was able to tell the Demon Lord’s positioning in an instant. When I’m this close, then I can tell every one of his actions, even without looking at him. I hit down the invisible hand lowered on me with my sword, and ripped through it.\nI kicked the wall, and moved my wings again, as I accelerated towards him. Ours eyes met. Those eyes of his were certainly keeping up with my movements.\nI put power into the sword, and simultaneously sent out an incantation-less 『Cresent Thunder』. Leigie’s befuddled expression disappeared into the light.\nI continued to raise my speed even further, and dived straight into the light. The moment I entered it, I heard a voice from within.\n“AS I thought, I’m not suited to killing… hah… it was something I already knew, but…”\nLeigie’s presence disappeared. No, it moved.\nFrom in front of my eyes, to behind. This time, it wasn’t that I had moved, but Leigie.\nA few meters to my rear.\nMater transportation. It truly is a fearsome power. But sometimes, such fearsome power comes with restrictions.\nIs it effective time? Distance? Or perhaps limited uses?\nI won’t give him the time. Can he use it consecutively? Various thoughts flew through my head.\nI began moving a speed that felt it would make my heart burst. It doesn’t really matter if I die. My body creaked as it displayed abilities beyond my limits.\nMy consciousness accelerated. I turned around, and shot lightning again. Speed and power. I want an opening. Just a small gap, a space of a single breath is enough. Without him avoiding, a small space without him using a Skill.\nI shortened the few meters in an instant. I instinctively cut off the invisible power lowered on my right arm.\nI kicked the ground. My step was too powerful, and my right ley let out an ominous sound. It’s likely broken. I don’t feel any pain. I don’t really care.\nHaving had Mana poured into it past its limit, the blade of the Holy Sword expanded. A materialization of pure energy, a sword of light.\nJust one step. One more step, and I’ll reach him. Leigie turned his eyes from my blade, and directed his gaze on my hand.\nAt that moment, my field of vision fell.\nAs If I were falling, I approached the ground. My mind went blank for an instant.\nI tried to move my arms, but they wouldn’t move. What I should have had held up before me, the sword that should have been in my grasp, was falling alongside me.\nAn impact. My chin hit against the carpet. My arms won’t move. My legs won’t move. As if I were watching a long dream, my body lacked a sense of reality.\nAnd it was there, that I finally noticed my arms weren’t connected to my body.\nA heat as if to burn through my body broke out through my torso. It was, as if to corrode away my body, moving up.\nI didn’t feel any pain. The arms that casually rolled on the ground before me. Still clutched around the Holy sword, their cross section, as if finally remembering their original form, began to spurt out blood.\nMy conscious became distant at once. I somehow withstood that with will power, and glared at my arms.\nIt was a slash. My disembodied arms. It was something that I had seen time and again on the battlefield, the traces left behind by a blade.\n… That can’t be… when did he…\nLeigie wasn’t holding a sword. When I had just been a step away from reaching him, the Demon Lords hands were surely empty.\nThis is bad. It isn’t such a bad thing to die, but it’s bad for an incomprehensible attack to assail me now.\nI don’t have any more time. Having lost its weilder, the Holy Sword’s power would dwindle the more time passed.\nRight before my consciousness was to go out, Leigie looked down over me, and muttered.\n“… Do you know of dolls? Hah…”\n… Human… form…\nMy flickering sight. On those words, I finally realized that a power besides that of Leigie had been close.\nHuman… form. Leigie Slaughterdolls. The last name was one’s way of life, and his way was Slaughterdolls.\nI… see…\n“It was a nice match, Hero. My regrets have, more or less… died down, perhaps.”\n“Don’t… screw with… me.”\nRegrets have… died down?\nNice match?\nNot yet. I’ve yet to lose.\nI had stepped in more than enough. The distance to Leigie was already less than a single Meter.\nThere was still power left in the Holy Sword.\n“Don’t… look down on a 『Hero』!!”\nThe form of the Demon Lord turning his back to me right above. A clear gap.\nI wrung out my remaining power, and yelled.\nA new 『Cause of Death: Blood Loss』 message came up, and I revived. Jumping up, I moved forward.\nIn concert with my will, the sword sparkled.\nThe strongest blow. With all my Mana, with all my existence backing it, that blow closed in on the Demon Lord’s back.\nAt around the same time, the heat ran up my chest again, but it’s too late.\nThe tip of the sword pierced into his left chest from behind.\n“… So you were… still alive…?”\n“Wha…”\nThis can’t be…\nThe sword I had wrung out all my power into. The strike that should have pierced through his flesh, and then his Soul Core, had come to a stop.\nMy hand felt numb. I felt a hart response all over my arm.\nThe heat and pain encroaching on me, bit by bit. I ignored whatever response was sent by my sense of pain, and rotated the holy sword.\nIt’s no good… he’s too hard. I got through his flest, but I couldn’t inflict anything on his core.\nI have… no chance of winning.\nJust like before. No matter how much courage I wring out of myself, no matter how much Mana I have, no matter how many Skills I learn, no matter how far I withdraw, if I can’t even damage him, my victory is… impossible.\nMy knees buckled, and the ground closed in on me. Power was leaving my body. What was pierced was my own left breast… the aim was my soul core. It’s a fatal wound.\nIt’s… alright. I’m not scared. I won’t lose. I’ll beat him. I have to beat him. If I don’t stand here… then who will?\nI’m sure that my heart… has yet to break.\nIf Leigie’s regrets were to be me, then the final regrets left in me… the reason I, reluctantly enough, fought on half by habit, yet still chost to stand on the battlefield after death… That reason must be… none other than this Demon Lord.\nA scene like a revolving lantern passed through my head.\nWithout being able to move a single eyelid, I died.\n＊＊＊＊＊\nIf I wasn’t able to find any particular reason, then I’m sure that was the reason that I had no choice but to live in solitude.\nMy grey rat-colored hair was constantly bathed in a highly concentrated Mana of light, and at some point, it had changed to a vivid silver color.\nIt wasn’t just an ordinary silver, but a silver close to blue.\nNo matter how many times I looked at it, the silver blue hair reflected at me never truly felt like my own.\nEven though, by now, I should have been accompanied by that silver a far longer time than my association with that gray.\nThe form reflected in the water’s surface, smoothed over lie a mirror.\nAll that was there was a single Hero.\nAn aloof hero. Having obtained the epithet of 『Silver Blue』by others before she noticed it, a lone Hero.\nSerge of the Silver Blue. Serge Serenade.\nNot taking about a single comrade, the one who continued to fight against the enemies of humanity. The sword of hope.\n“Haha… ha…”\nMy laughing voice was shaking.\nThe Hero Class was powerful. It was to force a single human to live the life of a single sword.\nIt improved the human body to fight against those of evil. It enhanced physical strength, inflated one’s Mana, and granted powerful Skills. Enough that a village girl who had yet to even come of age, could fell monsters by her hand.\nThe only thing that one couldn’t obtain with the Class itself, was the all important 『Courage』. That alone was something one had to make do with their own efforts.\nStrong. Its power was certainly strong. But even so, I was scared.\nMy breath was rough. My hands shook, and my heart gave a heavy beat.\nI looked at the palm of my hand. Having overcome hundreds of thousands of dark forces, yet come out without a single wound, those white and elegant fingers, as if to reflect the inside of my heart, were shaking.\nI clenched my fist.\nIt was a fear I’d tasted countless times, and nothing to me at this point.\nTo those cut down by me, they must have felt a fear much greater than this.\nAs if to encourage me on, the Holy Sword gripped in my right hand gave a small pulse.\nI wonder when it was that I noticed whispering to myself would more or less calm me down. Perhaps it was in that distant time when I first started fighting against abnormal monsters. If that wasn’t the case, then surely I would have… broken long ago.\n“I’m not scared. I’m not scared. I’m not scared. I’m not scared. I won’t lose. I won’t lost. I won’t lose. I won’t lose. There’s no way I can… lose.”\nEven if I never had anything precious.\nEven if I never had any comrades to fight alongside me.\nI just looked ahead.\nThere was no one to listen to me. No, there never should have been.\nAs if to read off a line to myself alone, I whispered.\n“I mean, I’m… a Hero.”\nI strongly gripped the sword.\nThe smell of blood and iron and death. The presence of war, and the abnormal cries.\nA battlefield where, if a normal man were to happen upon it, he would all but fall to madness.\nEven if I was bad at talking with people, I could cut down monsters.\nNo matter how helpless I may be, as long as I don’t let it reach my face, no one will notice.\nThat’s why, no matter how far I went, I accomplished my role as a Hero.\nI packed power below my navel, concentrated my attention on my heart, and excited the Mana over my entire body. Concentration great enough for it to take on tangible form, silvery blue Mana blew over as a wind, and drew spirals as it circled up around me.\nThe wails of the magic beasts ceased. The spirits invisible to my eyes trembled, the world stopped.\nWithin that noisy world, I was alone.\n“See, aren’t I… strong?”\nHaving I gained the Hero Class, and rushed across a countless number of battlefields, there was something I came to understand.\nHeroes were weapons. Even if there was no technique in their arms, and no good in their hearts, they were envoys of light that could cut down anything with their pure volume of Mana. Those needlessly powerful Skills, and the Holy Sword that inflicted enormous damage on the vassals of darkness were merely a byproduct of that.\nI remember the words once imparted on me by the king of a country I stopped by long ago.\n… Hero Serge, never forget that the lives of tens of thousands of civilians rest on your back. Every time you hesitate, human lives will perish. Every time you retreat, human lives will perish. If you’re to ever face defeat, then… a countless number of lives that could have been saved will be lost forever.\n『… Yes…』\nBack then, I had thought it a horribly selfish thing to impart such a burden on a simple little girl But it’s also a truth that I found solace in it.\nA light like an aurora emitted from my sword.\nThat beautiful spectrum that had entranced me the first time I emitted it, after tens and hundreds of uses, was only something I had grown accustomed to.\nThe grotesque eyes gathered on me.\nAll sorts of seeds to become the enemies of humanity. Against the forms of various monsters, I smiled with my face alone, and let a light that was nothing but bright flow out from my Holy Sword.\n“…”\nThe first time, I let out an unsightly cry. Because if I didn’t, my mind would have been paralyzed by fear.\nBut now, I don’t even have to raise a single word.\nI inhaled in a shallow breath of air. I exhaled. With just that, I could divert my fear. I overwrote it with fighting spirit.\nThe point I became a Hero was the point I cast away my tears.\nFrom a hill overlooking a vast land, I ran as if intending to tumble. No matter how steep the slope, I was never tripped up.\nIf it was just for a short time… I could even soar through the sky. I trampled over all the obstacles. Enhanced by my power as a Hero, my physical abilities didn’t fall short of a magic beast’s.\nEvery time I swung the Holy Sword, the monsters would be bisected in a flash, and the lightning would strike through them. My visual and auditory senses and all else were taken in by blood. The feel of cutting into meat, repelling the survivors.\nNormal beings of the monster race held dreadful figures, but to me, they were nothing more than scraps of paper. In just one swing of the sword, the monster that would have taken hundreds of human lives was killed.\nMy objective was always… the ones clad in the greatest miasma. The enemies of humanity.\nOn the battlefield, in the center of a wasteland, I found them. Among piles of corpses.\nThe greatest for of Evil Spirit to appear on the Surface World. With numbers countable on a single hand, they could take down an entire country. And before those strongest Evil Spirits, I alone brandished my sword.\nMy own foolishness no longer produced anything from me but a quivering laugh.\nFriends? Comrades? Something like that… there’s no way I could have anything like that.\nA Hero’s power was something extraordinary.\nEven among those that held the Hero class, the one heralded as the strongest was me… there’s no way there was anyone in humanity who could keep up.\n＊＊＊＊＊\nMy consciousness returned.\n“… So you can still stand… that’s strange… I’m sure you should be dead by now…”\nBy the time I realized it, I had already stood up again.\nWhat raced through my head were the battlefields I once ran across. The lantern turn itself for but an instant.\nI knew. What’s left in me is… not courage, but just my dignity as a Hero.\n“I’m… not… scared.”\nThe Holy Sword was the same as before. As if to cheer me up, it let out a glimmer.\nI followed my experience, and at the presence I sensed behind, I turned my body, and let the Holy Sword come down.\nThe weight I felt on my arms. The sharp sound of metal colliding.\nWhat had appeared at some point in time, something with its entire body shrouded in black armor, locked blades with me. If it was just in physical strength, the other side had the advantage. It was a fearsome force, and a fearsome speed, but in technique, I’m… the greater.\nTwo strikes, three strikes, our blades met one another, but on the third time, what it should have blocked with its sword, it took with its body. Caring not for the flesh it bisected, the Holy Sword cut through that trunk of a body from left to right.\nThere was a tough resistance, but I was certain of my target’s destruction.\nThe body close to two meters in size vanished, and on top of the bloodstained carpet, what took its place was a black chess piece divided in two.\nThe Fortis Authority could return light to my eyes. But the rolling piece wasn’t to become my threat again.\nI overcame my shaking body with fighting spirit, and confronted the Demon Lord again.\nI pretended not to notice the hopeless chances of victory swirling about my head.\n“… What is… with that…”\n“… I won’t… lose…”\nThe Demon Lord quietly sat back on the throne. While furrowing his brow, there was no sign of him initiating another attack.\nIf I can’t pierce through his core, I’ll have to aim for his neck. If not the neck, then an arm or a leg. Anyways, I’ll have to inflict just a little damage…\nI gripped the Holy Sword in both hands. I can’t hear anything. I can’t see anything. I can’t understand anything. I stepped in, and swung to take his neck. The muscles of my arms cramped up, and let off creaking sounds. I paid no mind to my own damage.\nLeigie wasn’t even looking at me. He let out a sigh, and opened his right hand.\nThe space before my eyes turned pitch black. But the kinetic energy I had given my body did not die down. My sword was definitely coming towards Leigie’s head, and…\nThere was so much resistance, it felt like my heart was painted out.\nWh… y… his skin is…\n“…”\nI couldn’t let out my voice. I frantically tried to scream.\nI was able to pierce him before. I was definitely able to pierce all the way to his soul core, and yet now my blade… won’t enter his flesh!\nWhat!? How!? Why!?\nThe character string appeared again. I didn’t even give the 『Cause of Death: Destruction of Soul Core』 a second glance.\nI can’t move at all. Only my field of vision turned left and right. Within my stagnant time, I thought.\nIs it that I can’t rend his bones? No. I didn’t make it to the bone. It stopped on his first layer of skin.\nIf it was metal armor, I would have sliced through with ease, and I could just as easily cut through the barrier of any high class magic barrier, yet a hard sensation remained in the Holy Blade.\nIt was, strangely enough, the… same as the last thing that had been left in my hands in my final battle as a hero.\nUntil just now, until this moment… it definitely got through!!\nMy heart shuddered like never before.\nHaving obtained 『Fortis』, there was a great unrest I felt when I experienced death for the first time. This was an impact surpassing that.\n『Brave Heart』 shook. I’m sure it was a Skill that was supposed to be peerless. The path that I never lost sight of, despite my fear and my shivers, was starting to feel unsteady.\nBefore the selections laid out before me, my will to stand whispered quietly to me.\nThe simple 『YES』 and 『NO』gained greater meaning that ever before, as they pressed down on my choice.\n『Do you still have the will to fight on?』\n『Before a great darkness, before an existence much greater than your own, do you have the reason to stand and face him?』\n『Do you have the courage?』\nThe magician’s old words echoed with them.\n『Serge, you have the right to choose. To live as a hero to light up the dark, or… to waste your entire life as a normal civilian…』\nI would think back to that question from time to time.\nIf perhaps I had chosen the path of a normal person, then would it truly have been so useless?\nPerhaps it was my life as a hero, and my afterlife as a Valkyrie, descended to repeat endless battles day after day after day that was the wasted one?\nThe answer had yet to come. That’s why, just once more…\nBy the phenomenon brought about by my Fortis Skill, my extracted Soul Core was brought back to life. Light blessed my eyes once more, and from the depths of my body gushed up the heat of life. It was an uplifting feeling as if to blow away my fears.I’m sure that for all this time, Fortis Angels have fought on with nothing but that courage as their weapon.\nMy hazy vision came into focus. At some point in time, Leigie’s gaze from his seat on the throne had quietly directed itself down on me.\n“Ye s… I’ll fight…”\n“Hero, could it be… you can’t die? Even if your heart is destroyed, you’ll revive?”\nAs I thought, unlike Gloria, this Demon Lord knowns not of my authority.\nIn Leigie’s right hand, that should have been empty, a transparent crystal appeared. That item that was basked in the glimmer of a finally cut diamond, was promptly crushed in his palm.\nLight was extracted from my eyes again. Of course, I had never seen it in my eyes before, but I understood by instinct. That was… my heard.\n『Aport』\nIt couldn’t be… no, there’s nothing… else I can think of. Matter transportation from within my body.\n『Cause of Death: Destruction of Soul Core』. The words danced before my eyes.\nA ridiculous power. A peerless… ability. Be it Angel or Demon, no matter how strong they may be, there wasn’t a single one who could live without their heart.\n… Besides me.\nI no longer have any hesitation. My spirit blazed up.\nIn order to clear away all the darkness. In order for my existence to hold meaning. That’s why I became a Hero!\nDeath distanced itself. The feeling of nihility assailing my body was overwritten with the reality of life.\nI clenched my teeth, and stood up again. Again and again. I’ll stand as many times it takes. You’ll see.\n“I won’t… lose…”\n“Hero… I… see… Hero.”\nThe blade I put my might behind, my wishes behind, was brought to a halt by Leigie standing still.\nHe stopped the Holy Sword that, if he were a Demon, if he was one in cahoots with darkness, it should have burned through his entirety. It wasn’t his neck. The blade came into contact with his unhealthy-looking face, and stooped as if I was living a nightmare.\nMy hopes were smashed. Not a single drop of Leigie’s blood flowed. He took it head-on, and without even making preparations to defend, he took on the power of a Hero, and the light to destroy all darkness without a scratch.\nI let out a piercing yell, and thrust again. Leigie didn’t dodge.\nBut what I aimed at his left chest was stopped without even piercing the flesh.\nIt’s no good… he’s hard… he’s too hard. The skin I was able to get through once, I couldn’t pierce again.\n“Hey, please tell me one thing, Serge.”\nShould I retreat? Should I pull back once, and face him again? Can I even face him? Is there… an existence that can triumph over this Lord?\nThere is. There has to be… In the heavens, there were plenty of those wielding powers greater than mine. If it’s them, then…\n… Right, the Demon World… if I pull him out of the Demon World, perhaps I can win. But am I… capable of such a feat?\n“Hey, Serge Serenade.”\nI thrust the blade, and receiving an additional attack, Leigie didn’t direct the slightest hostility at me.\nI struck my lightning into him. The world was filled with light, and the intense discharge caused an echoing sound, but the voice reverberating from within it didn’t stop.\n“Can you… not die? Is your valor, your courage… a result of your lack of death?”\n“…”\nThe lightning disappeared.\nThe abyss was peering into me.\nThe abyss was questioning me.\nA black to suck in all sorts of light. Those darkness colored irises were examining me.\n“Courage born of an inability to die. Could that truly… be called the work of a 『Hero』?”\nI’m sure it was an honest query. There was no good or bad intent behind it.\nBut I cannot listen to him. I can’t deal with him head-on.\nI can’t be brought in by the darkness. Rather than my heart shattering, I was much more afraid of my will falling apart.\nThe question lasted a few seconds. There was no answer. But I didn’t remove my eyes from him.\nThe Demon Lord moved. Separating from the throne, one step forward. The slash I released in desperation, Leigie received with the palm of his hand.\nThe Holy sword slid through and cut off half his hand frighteningly easily.\n“… Ah, I see. So you were a 『Cheat』, same as me…”\nI never thought an attack would get through.\nFor an instant, my thoughts froze. Like a separate lifeform, his fingers flew off, and rolled along the carpet.\nWithout paying any attention to them, Leigie’s face continued to approach me. The bags stuck under his eyes. The mediocre face of a man one couldn’t see as anyone strong.\nHis breath hit an area around my ear.\n“It’s fine. You’ve no need to despair… if it’s me, I can issue an end to your life without death.”\nDiffering from before, a cold Mana started welling up.\nI instinctively tried to retreat back, only to notice my legs would no longer move.\nLeigie’s face had approached to a few centimeters before me. In his eyes, reflected the scene of my features freezing over.\nThe chill gradually rising up from my feet. I tried wringing out my power, but my lower body wouldn’t budge in the slightest.\n“… Sleep for the rest of your days. I won’t forget you.”\nThe tips of my fingers were iced over. The area below my navel lost its power, and my face was suspended.\nI didn’t feel any pain. Only my heat was being robbed away. A cold something was passing over my spine. It wasn’t just a hallucination.\nLeigie raised a quiet voice like one of a parent to their child.\n“I think I’ll… wait for the next Hero, whom I’m not even sure exists.”\n“Ah… ah…”\nThe nature of Leigie’s power had changed. From one the was simply heavy, to one heavy and cold.\nHis finger was fixed on my chin. I didn’t look down. I can’t see what’s becoming of my body. But I know.\nMy time is stoping. My Soul Core is freezing.\nEverythign I have in me is losing its heat. My body, my will.\nIs this… death?\nThe ice came up to my chest. Slowly, and as if to harass me, oh so quiet. But it was certain.\nContrary to my desire, my lips began to move.\n“Am I… going to… die?”\n“No, you’re not going to die. You’re going to end. Thank you for staying as my enemy. You can… rest now.”\nA one-sided verdict. His calm words, and his dark eyes.\nMy chest was frozen over, and it continued up my collar to cover my throat.\nYeah, I already knew. I’m sure… this is… the end.\nThe Holy Sword lost its light. My arm had frozen through long ago, and it wouldn’t move in the slightest. Even if that blade had still been clad in light, I no longer had the hands to move it.\nFrom the core of my body, I was frozen. No, this must be just as the Demon Lord said… suspension.\nEven with my breast frozen over, the selection didn’t appear to me.\nIt was a phenomenon I had never seen before. No, if you count the time I felt it when I lost my human body, this was my second… end.\n“…”\nMy voice would no longer come out.\nUnrest. My emotions were rocked by an incomprehensible wave.\nRegrets? Hesitations? Anger? Grief? Or perhaps… Relief?\nI don’t know anymore. I don’t know anything.\nWhat I heard at the end was, differing completely from the rewards of foreign kings, and the ovations of the people I saved, and the oracles given to me by the Angels, uncalculated, and honest commendation.\n“Until we meet again, my old friend.”",

      "content": "Volume 2, Chapter 8: Luxuria’s Affection\nJust Take it as it Comes\n… Thus, the Lord was there. Today as well.\nThe transcendent being. An ancient and great Demon. The master of Depravity and Sloth. The eternal ruler. Slaughter Dolls.\nEvil God. Leigie Slaughterdolls. The… master I am to serve.\nThe Lazy King.\nHis existence itself evaded all the glimmering lights of creation. A King of darkness.\nFrom the endlessly distant past, a Demon who reigned over this world.\n“Good work… my liege.”\n“… Yeah.”\nHaving woken up for the first time in a long while, Leigie-sama’s behavior hadn’t changed in the slightest.\nThe jet black throne. It was said to have existed long before the Castle of Shadows was completed, It was the only seat that the Lazy King alone was permitted to sit in. I sent it a hollow glance.\nWhat was at the end of my eyes was a single girl.\nVibrant silver hair and eyes. Her somewhat innocent eyes gave off a strong, and dangerous sort of charm, and the pure white wings growing from her back gave off a strong light, even in the darkness, as if to display her will.\nBut she wasn’t to move again. From her feet to the roots of her hair, she was covered with a highly transparent wall of ice, and now, she looked nothing more than a work of art.\nValkyrie. A mere shadow of what once was Serge Serenade of the Silver Blue.\nThat beautiful form enough to make my heart skip a beat, regardless of the fact I was a Demon, or that I was of the same gender, caused my feelings to move a little.\n“… How was it?”\nThe words I unintentionally let out had exceeded my authority.\nWith my only role being to offer assistance to Leigie-sama, I did not have the right to ask of his opinion. Even if… Leigie-sama himself held no strong emotion towards that fact.\nIt was of the server and the served, the servant and the lord. A clear line.\nWithout even taking a fleeting glance at me, Leigie-sama spoke, as if giving a soliloquy alone.\n“… Alright, I guess… when it’s all over, this is all to remain… That’s how most things go in the world, anyways…”\nIt’s not… alright.\nThe figure of him letting out a deep sigh truly gave off the impression that he felt nothing at all.\nBut I had a slight idea of it.\nOne governing Sloth, Leigie-sama personally waited on the throne, and he let out his impression in more than three words.\nOf course, no matter how long I had been in service to him, my Lord’s Will wasn’t something someone of my lowly status should have been judging, but… I’m sure that an emotion other than Sloth had moved him.\nFor some reason, it pained me.\nEven if understanding that fact was what truly was beyond my authority.\n“It seems I’ve… become too strong… I’m not sure if she came too early or too late… No, it’s all just useless supposition.”\nThe black briefcase propped up against the throne transported itself to his hand.\nIt was a power to draw in whatever one wanted.\nWithin my long years of service, that power that even I had never seen before was one that Leigie-sama had obtained quite recently. A power transcending Demon Lord Level.\nPerhaps the clasps hadn’t been fastened properly, as the contents were exposed.\nInside, numerous chess pieces had been stuffed. It was one of Leigie-sama’s few personal belongings.\nChess pieces. It’s not definite what era they were manufacuter in, but the pieces were pitch black.\nAt the start, there were likely six types, sixteen pieces in total, but now, there were numerous empty spaces dotted around it.\nthe Pawn that had been split cleanly in half teleported, and filled in one of those holes. Though a piece that had once died shouldn’t be able to be used again.\nThey were weapons. Boasting the epithet Slaughter Dolls, Leigie-sama’s important, and unique weapons.\nThey had likely been by his side for far longer than I had ever served him…\nOriginally, I should have been the one to pick it up for him. I knew that. I knew, but I couldn’t get any closer.\nLeigie-sama’s expression was just too sad, too depressed… even though it wasn’t through fear, my body wouldn’t move.\nHis power had been too far above, and he couldn’t stand alongside the one he wanted most.\nThat body of his was unbelievably greater than that of all the Demon Lords who underestimated, and despised him.\nNo matter how many years passed, how many tens of hundred of thousands of tens of thousands of years were to pass, he was too far for them to even see his feet.\nLeigie-sama slowly moved his right hand back and forth.\n“… My liege, what may be the matter?”\n“… You’ve been being quite… annoying for a while…”\n“!? Annoying… is it?”\nThe words suddenly directed at me made it feel as if my heart was to stop, but I soon realized that wasn’t the case.\nLeigie-sama’s eyes were watching some far off place that wasn’t here.\nSomewhere much to distant for my eyes to see. I’m here to look after my lord. For that sake, I underwent training, and a majority of my life had been devoted to that. But how deplorable it was there there were still things I was incapable of.\nEven if I knew that was just my ego speaking…\n“Ah… hah… even if I have the means, what a pain it is… if I ignored them, I doubt it would become a problem, but no matter what, they catch my attention.”\n“… Is there anything that I can do?”\n“Ah… no, you may leave. Iyo.”\nAfter letting out a deep sigh, Leigie-sama raised his face, and pointed to the ice sculpture with sluggish movements.\n“Please bring that over to my room.”\n“Your room… is it?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Understood.”\nWithout asking any more, I gave a deep bow. I folded my hips, and put both hands to my apron.\nThe opponent he went as far as to sit on the throne for. He probably has much to think of.\nHe drove both me and Medea out, and wished to confront that opponent alone. He must have much to consider.\nI approached the ice sculpture, and touched it with the tips of my fingers.\nIt held no temperature. It was neither cold nor warm. What looked like ice, but couldn’t be, was surely a seal. A fragment of the power that had sealed all the land in ice a year ago.\nIf by this result, Leigie-sama is saved in the slightest, then that’s fine. I won’t think anything of it.\nThe brief case in his hands disappeared. To where it originally should have been… likely a corner of Leigie-sama’s room. Up to quite recently, that had been my role, but I had not the right to complain of his selection to use a Skill to transport it in an instant.\nI should merely find joy in the grand task of transporting this statue.\nI’ll care for Leigie-sama, and at the same time, receive from him. In the distant past, that was the relation my first ancestor that came in service to Leigie devised.\n“It’s no good… all of it just seems… tiring.”\nHis ghastly gallant expression sent a glance towards my feet.\nOur eyes met. As he often never looked one in the eye when speaking, it was quite a rare occurrence.\nAn impact like an electric shock raced from my legs up my spine, and that alone caused my body to stiffen. It was an impulse similar to pleasure, and quite an honor for me. Gaining recognition from one who governs Sloth such as Leigie isn’t something that happens too often.\nHis lips formed my name. My heart shook and heated up. I caution myself not to let it show on my complexion too much. I am but a loyal servant.\n“Lorna?”\n“… Yes…”\nBut the next words to come out of his mouth had completely exceeded my imagination.\nNonchalantly, truly listlessly, he gave out that declaration.\n“I’ll grant you some free time.”\n“… Eh…?”\nI didn’t know what he was trying to say.\nAfter a few seconds, I finally comprehended, and the truth hit me like a pan to the face.\nA vertigo greater than anything I had ever felt before. All before my eyes went pitch black.\nThe candles were properly lit, yet the entire world seemed heavy and dark.\nI naturally put my hands to my ears, and shook my head. My heart stopped for a moment, before starting itself up with a beat that felt it would rupture.\nMisheard … no, there’s no way I would ever mishear Leigie-sama’s words.\nMy lip trembled. I tried to take a deep breath to calm myself, but was pressed for air.\nThe words that came out after several seconds quite cut up, contrary to my will.\n“Ha… have I… made some… sort of err.. hic.. or?”\nMy words mixed in with my tears were nothing suited of Leigie-sama’s perfect servant.\nBefore the overwhelming wave of emotion, it felt like all the training I had done to now had been meaningless.\nNo… just crying would be… more decent.\nWithout noticing the reverberation of my soul core, that felt like it would shatter itself at any moment, Leigie-sama answered.\n“No… wrong. My regrets have… faded. I have yet to see my future prospects. So I’ll just sleep… and wait…”\n“… What will you do… about your meals?”\n“They’re unnecessary. In the first place, eating is unnecessary to me.”\n“… Cleaning the room is…”\n“I can sleep anywhere.”\n“… Y-your clothing is…”\n“… Iyo.”\nPerhaps it became a pain, as he only returned one word in the end.\nBut his face didn’t give off the impression he was speaking a joke. In the first place, Leigie-sama doesn’t do anything as troubling as joke around.\nThe role I had been given in life was to follow Leigie-sama’s mighty will. My predessor, and the all the predecessors before her had lived their lives just like that. If this truly is what Leigie-sama wishes for, if I truly will be an obstruction to him… I must swallow up my tears, and depart from my master’s presence.\nNo, while we’re at it… it would be best for me to die. Right. Death would be the better option. I know not any other way to live. I have nothing that I want to do.\nI knew. I had realized it long ago. There’s no way I couldn’t have.\nTo Leigie-sama, my devotion… no, my ancestors devotion included, all of it was something liss than garbage. Leigie-sama was able to live his life alone.\nThe one relying on his grand power had been me.\nI asked for confirmation once more.\n“… So you… don’t need me any longer?”\n“Iyo.”\nLeigie-sama gave a truly curt response.\nMy thoughts turned at full throttle. Not needed… no, what should I…\n…\nFor the first time ever, I tried arbitrarily interpreting his words.\nIyo…\nI’m satisfied with your work… no, I’ll leave it to you.\n“… My liege… no, Leigie-sama… I want to serve you no matter what… um, well, I’ll do any… thing… just as always… can you not keep me by your side?”\n“Iyo.”\nLeigie-sama’s short answer.\nIyo…\nI am satisfied with your work… no, I’ll leave it to you.\nHe’s going to leave it to me…\nThen I can do whatever I want…\n“T-thank you, Leigie-sama… for your lenient judgement, I hold the greatest of gratitude.”\nAs I timidly presented my flawed proposition, Leigie-sama stared at me with eyes as if to say, ‘this one sure is a pain,’ but he didn’t say anything.\nMy field of vision was bluring. I deeply lowered my head.\nBy the time I raised it, Leigie-sama’s figure had already disappeared. I’ll bet her returned to his bedroom.\nI looked towards the carpet that was a mess, and the cracked walls. It’s unthinkable for me to leave such wreckage in the Throne Room. I’ll have to fix it…\nAnd after that I’ll have to make Leigie-sama’s, and Medea’s meals… It may be best to start the preparations for Leigie-sama’s right now.\nOf course, it’s not going to pose much of a problem right now, but so as not to abandon it, I should properly carry out my duty…\nI started to put together the list of things I had to do, as I cast my eyes onto the ice sculpture of Serge Serenade.\nIt was a quiet expression, without rage or sadness, or fighting spirit. I have no idea what she had been thinking at that moment.\nEven if I had my theories, the nature of Leigie-sama’s regrets remained unknown to me. I can’t really ask him, and even if I do, I doubt I’ll get an answer.\nBut I’m sure…\n“Leigie-sama, your regrets will… fade away someday…”\nI was not a unit for war. Just a simple maid, that existed to take care of the matters around Leigie-sama.\nBut the state of affairs was all within my head.\nMy clan. The clan of shadows in service to Leigie-sama didn’t just consist of me and Hiero. Back in ancient times, in the Demon World covered in a high casualty rate, with Leigie-sama’s protection as our base, the gradually expanding clan had become the one with the greatest scale in the world. They were scattered all about it.\nThe information gathered from all over spoke tales of it.\nOf the start of Heard Lauder’s rebellion. Of how the state of the Demon World, that had been stagnant for so long, was finally on the move.\nAnd power was naturally drawn towards greater power.\nRight. Just like… the moths drawn to the flames of a torch.\nVanity Seidthroan’s movements.\nThe movements of the Angels and Valkyries descending.\nShifts great enough that the Great Demon King’s army couldn’t turn a blind eye to it.\nOf all else, the one that seemed to be the greatest pain was… the 『Church』’s movements.\nI’m perhaps the only one to know of it. Only the one who adores you so.\nWhat my power of Luxuria told me about you, your 『Power』, my dear.\nGoverning over Sloth, the 『Evil God』.\nEven when put against to the ruling power of the Demon World, the Demon Lords, it must be something incomparably heavy.\nIt wasn’t just that his power was strong. The meaning behind the God in his title.\nThe second greatest power in the Demon World.\nThe first was the 『Great Demon King’s Army』.\nThe second, the 『Malign Deity Faction』.\nBut that power balance is being destroyed by a reduction in the Demon Lords allied to Kanon.\nWith their creed at the base, the discipline of that Church that suppressed its own desires for a greater cause was abnormal. It’s not like they were strong, simply… abnormal.\nFor those ones that revere the Evil God, as unworthy as they may be, it’s likely they will target his personage.\nAll I’m permitted to do is stay by Leigie-sama’s side. But I’d like to think that’s more than enough.\n“Please have some rest, Leigie-sama. Just take it as it comes…”\nThe Lazy King. From near and far, those that knew of him closed their mouths, and those that didn’t waited in fear.\nHis glory of the past was merely a scratch, a short interval on his eternity. And little by little, it all fades to gray. But his majesty is ceaselessly handed down.\nI don’t mean to hold any pride about it, but if it is to sate his boredom, then if he wished for it, I’d always be by his side.\nI took the ice sculpture over my shoulder, and departed from the throne room.\nNow then, in this room, on that throne, will the chance ever come for him to entrust his body to it again?\nAs if to extinguish my incoherent thoughts, the door let out a resounding creak, as it shut closed.",
