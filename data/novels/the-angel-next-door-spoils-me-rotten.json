      "content": "“…What are you doing?”\nIt was raining, and she, Mahiru Shiina, was seated on the park’s swing when Amane Fujimiya first spoke to her.\nAmane had begun living alone soon after just starting his first year of high school. Living in the apartment to his right was an angel.\nOf course, the Angel was a metaphor. Nevertheless, Mahiru Shiina was so pretty and cute that the metaphor was truly not a joke.\nHer flax-colored straight hair was well-maintained, smooth, and glossy, her clear white skin smooth and unblemished. She had a nice nose, a pair of large eyes beneath her long eyebrows and fine-looking bright pink lips, and combining all these traits, she had a delicate, doll-like beauty.\nShe was in Amane’s school and in the same year, and he often heard of what others said of her. Most said she was a girl of brains and brawn.\nIn fact, she had maintained first place in every exam they took, always acing during gym classes.\nAmane knew few details about her as they were in different classes, but if the rumors were true, she was a perfect superhuman.\nShe had no obvious flaws, a nice face, outstanding grades, and was humble and obedient. It was no wonder she was popular.\nSome boys would be utterly envious at the prospect of living next to such a pretty girl.\nDespite that, Amane did not intend to do anything to her, and did not think he could.\nOf course, Amane too felt that the girl Mahiru Shiina was truly charming.\nDespite that, they were simply neighbors. Amane never intended to get involved with her, nor did he have the chance to talk to her.\nIf he did, he might garner the boys’ envy. Truth be told, if they could get along just by living next to each other, the boys infatuated with her would not have to suffer so.\nAnd to add on, love was different from a mere infatuation with the opposite gender. As far as Amane was concerned, Mahiru was a pretty girl most suited to be marveled from afar.\nFor that reason, Amane never expected a sweet and sour relationship with her, and naturally would not expect to get involved with her. He was merely living next to her, never actually interacting with her.\nSo when he saw her spacing out alone without an umbrella in the middle of the rain, he wondered.\nWhat is she doing?\nThe rain was so heavy that everyone else had already ran home. Yet here she was, alone at the park between the school and the apartment, on the swing.\nWhat’s she doing in the rain?\nDark, thick clouds covered the skies, and there was no light shining through, making the surroundings dim. It had been raining since morning, and he could not see her clearly. But the eye-catching flax-colored hair and uniform clearly identified Mahiru.\nAmane did not understand why she was there without an umbrella, letting the rain soak her.\nIt appeared she was waiting for no one in particular, and she was not reacting to the fact that she was wet. She was merely staring listlessly in a certain direction.\nLooking up, the face already lacking in color pigments looked pale.\nIf she was not careful, she could catch a cold. Despite that, Mahiru sat there quietly.\nIt seemed she wanted to do so, and had no intention to return home. Perhaps it was inappropriate for any bystander to voice their concerns to her.\nSo he thought as he prepared to cross the park, but at the last moment, he saw her contorted teary-looking face and scratched his head.\nHe had no motive to get involved with her at all.\nBut his conscience would ache if he left someone be with such a pained look. That was all.\n“…What are you doing?”\nAmane spoke to her with an aloof voice, showing that he had no ulterior motives. She shook her long hair, seemingly bogged down by the absorbed water, and looked towards him.\nHer face was pretty as usual.\nEven though she was drenched by the rain, her glow was unhindered, and the rain emphasized her beauty like an ornament. A fine girl soaked in the rain, it seemed.\nHer undine-like eyes looked towards him.\nAt the very least, it seemed Mahiru knew Amane was her neighbor. They would meet occasionally in the morning, after all.\nBut as she was approached by a complete stranger, spoken to, and her caramel-colored eyes were a little wary.\n“Fujimiya-san. Is there anything you want from me?”\nAh, so she remembered my name\n, he thought. At the same time, he could tell this wariness was impossible to relax.\nThey did meet before, but they were still strangers after all. It was expected that she would be on guard after being addressed.\nShe probably did not wish to interact much with someone of the opposite gender. Typically, there were boys of various years confessing to her or approaching her, and she probably thought they had impure motives.\n“Nothing much. Just that I’m concerned seeing you alone in the rain like this.”\n“I see. Thank you for your concern, but I do wish to remain here. Please leave me be.”\nThe voice was neither shrill nor wary, and while gentle, her faint voice warned him not to probe further.\nWell, guess that’s that.\nClearly, she was hiding something, but Amane had no intention to probe further, given how standoffish she was.\nAmane merely asked in the spur of the moment. It was natural that he ended up asking her, not that he was that concerned.\nIf she simply wanted to remain there, he was fine with that.\nMahiru, in turn, might have been wondering why he would be talking to her or feeling something like that.\nShe stared at Amane skeptically with her fleeting, pretty face. “I see,” Amane answered.\nHe felt he would be detested if they continued talking, so perhaps it was time for him to retreat.\nLuckily for him, whether she had a good impression of him or not, they did not have any relationship. Amane readily decided to return home and leave her be.\nHowever, he did not feel good about leaving a girl alone, soaked in the rain.\n“You’ll catch a cold. Take the umbrella. You don’t have to return it.”\nUltimately, Amane decided to be a little busybody.\nIf she caught a cold, Amane would not be able to sleep well. That was his thought when he handed the umbrella covering his head to her.\nShe received the umbrella, or rather, he shoved it to her. Before she could speak, he turned away.\nHe hastily left, and behind him, Mahiru called out.\nBut the voice was so soft, it was overwhelmed by the rain. He paid no mind and quickly darted through the park.\nHe merely hoped that she would not catch a cold when he shoved the umbrella to her. Perhaps it was for that reason that his initial guilt of wanting to ignore her subsided a little.\nSince she refused to talk, Amane did not intend to get involved with her.\nSince there was nothing going on between them, that would be the end.\nThat was what Amane thought, back then, as he returned home.",

      "content": "“Amane, your nose is noisy.”\n“You’re noisy.”\nThe following day, it was Amane who caught a cold.\nHis classmate, or rather, bad friend Itsuki Akazawa, noted how noisy Amane was, and Amane wanted to snort back, only to fail.\nInstead, he was sniffing while trying to breathe through the nose. In a sense, he was snorting away.\nHe was feeling utterly unwell, and his head was in stinging pain, either because his nose was blocked, or because of the cold.\nHe had taken some medication he bought from a pharmacy, but the symptoms never faded, and he ended up like this.\nHis face contorted as his nose met the tissue again. Itsuki in particular looked more dumbfounded than worried.\n“Weren’t you feeling fine yesterday?”\n“Got caught in the rain.”\n“You alright? You didn’t bring an umbrella yesterday?”\n“…Lent it to someone.”\nNaturally, he could not say that he lent it to Mahiru, so he vaguely brushed it off.\nOn a side note, he found Mahiru at school looking fine, somewhat vibrant. It was laughable for him given that he was the one who handed the umbrella to her.\nBut he truly deserved this, for he did not take a hot bath thereafter to warm his body.\n“But seriously, lending an umbrella when the rain’s so heavy? Aren’t you too good a person?”\n“Not like I got a choice. I just lent it to someone else.”\n“Who did you lend to for you to even risk catching a cold?”\n“…A kid who got lost?”\nIt was better than saying someone with a childlike stature. Actually, she was in the same year as he was.\n…Ahh, I see. She had the look of a lost kid.\nOnly when he said it did he realize what it was.\nBack then, Mahiru’s expression was that of a lost kid looking for her parents.\n“You’re a good guy.”\nItsuki knew nothing of Amane’s current feelings as the latter thought about Mahiru, and giggled mischievously.\n“Well, I don’t know who you lent the umbrella to, but you just wiped your body and left it at that, right? That’s why you caught a cold.”\n“…How do you know?”\n“Anyone can tell how little you care about yourself just by looking at your house.”\nThat’s why you caught a cold, you idiot.\nOnce he was told off, Amane had to remain quiet.\nAs Itsuki said, Amane never cared about his own situation.\nTo add on, he was bad at cleaning up, and his room was in a mess. He usually ate bentos and supplements bought from the convenience stores outside, or ate out.\nAnd you say you’re living alone.\nItsuki stared dumbfoundedly.\nTo Itsuki, it was no wonder Amane caught a cold when his lifestyle was overly lax.\n“Hurry back home and rest already. We have a weekend coming up. Get well soon.”\n“Yeah…”\n“Will be nice if you have a girlfriend who can take care of you.”\n“You’re noisy. And you have a girlfriend. Shut up.”\nItsuki smiled proudly. Amane reached his hand into the tissue box, annoyed.\nTime passed, and Amane’s health had worsened.\nThe cold symptoms he had were headache and runny nose, but now they were accompanied with sore throat and fatigue, crippling his entire body.\nAfter school, he looked forward as he hurried home, but the cold was worse than he thought, his steps extremely heavy.\nDespite that, he managed to make it to the entrance of the apartment complex. Dragging his heavy feet into the elevator, he leaned his body onto the wall.\nHaa,\nhe found himself breathing more erratic than before, hotter.\nHe managed to endure it at school somehow, but he might have felt more relaxed as he was about to reach home, and his body felt unbearable at once.\nHe was usually fine with the elevator’s lack of gravity, but at this point, it pained him.\nNevertheless, he was about to reach home.\nThe elevator stopped at his level, and he slowly alighted, dragging his feet over, only to freeze.\nBefore his eyes was a girl with flax-colored hair, one he assumed he would never talk to again.\nIn terms of appearance, her adorable face was full of life, her skin looking fine.\nAnyone would have assumed she was the one who caught the cold, but in fact, she was still fine. Perhaps it was because she usually took care of herself well that there was such a huge difference between them.\nMahiru’s hands were holding the neatly folded umbrella he had shoved to her the previous day.\nHe told her she did not need to return it, but she did.\n“…You don’t have to return it.”\n“But shouldn’t I return what I have borrowed…?”\nHer words trailed off. One might say it was because she saw Amane’s face.\n“Erm. Are you, running a fever…?”\n“…That has nothing to do with you, right?”\nShe appeared at the worst timing possible,\nso Amane frowned.\nTo put it extremely, it did not matter whether the umbrella was returned.\nBut now was not a good moment for them to meet. She was wise, and could easily deduce why Amane caught a cold.\n“But it is because I borrowed the umbrella…”\n“That’s just what I did. Has nothing to do with this.”\n“It does. I was there, so you caught a cold.”\n“It’s nothing. You don’t have to worry.”\nAmane did not want others to worry just because he did something for self-satisfaction.\nBut it appeared that Mahiru would not leave him be with just a few words. Her pretty face was worried.\n“…That’s enough. See you.”\nAmane was uncomfortable to be questioned, so he decided to force his escape from Mahiru’s questions and worries.\nStumbling, he received the umbrella, and reached into his pocket for the key…he was fine till this point.\nAfter Amane opened his door with lethargy, he suddenly lost strength.\nHe might have relaxed as he was finally about to enter his house. His body stumbled into the wall behind.\nUh oh,\nso he thought, but the railing on the corridor was really sturdy, and would not break from just a little impact. It was sufficiently tall, and there was no way he could have fallen outside. It would hurt a little crashing into it, but that was to be expected… and so he braced himself.\nBut his arm was suddenly tugged at, and he managed to regain his posture.\n“…I cannot leave you be at all.”\nThe soft voice entered his somewhat faint consciousness.\n“I shall return the favor.”\nHis head was feeling fuzzy, probably because he was feverish, and he could not comprehend her words.\nFor before he could, Mahiru dragged Amane’s limp body and opened his door.\n“I am going in. Please forgive me, but I have to.”\nThe quiet voice demanded compliance.\nAmane, affected by the cold, let himself be dragged without resistance; it was the first time he returned home with a girl his age.\nWhile he did not have a girlfriend to care for him while he was sick, it appeared there was an angel taking care of him instead.",

      "content": "Because of his fever, Amane realized too late the situation of his own house; he regretted letting Mahiru in when he saw reality before him.\nThe apartment Amane lived in was a 1SLDK.\nIt contained a vast living room, a bedroom, and a storeroom, an extravagant space for a person living alone. As his parents were sufficiently well off, after considering security and location, he decided to stay here.\nHis parents were the ones who demanded that he stay here, and he was fine with that . Nevertheless, he felt they did not have to spend so much. He really could not handle living in such a massive apartment alone.\nThat aside, while Amane lived alone, he was bad at cleaning up.\nNeedless to say, the living room, and even the bedroom were in a mess.\n“This is really unsightly.”\nThe Angel, or rather, the savior, did not mince her words despite having such an adorable appearance.\nIt was really horrible, and Amane could not refute. He would have moved a few things if he knew someone else was coming in, but it was too late for that.\nMahiru’s glossy lips let out a sigh, but she did not leave. Instead, she moved Amane into the bedroom.\nOn the way there, both of them nearly tripped over. Amane himself was painfully aware that as the one who made the apartment so messy, it would be bad if he did not clean up for real.\n“I shall leave for the moment. Do change before I return. That should be fine, no?”\n“…You’re coming back?”\n“I would not be able to sleep well if I leave a sick person on the bed.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had the exact same thoughts Amane about that prior incident, and he could not comment.\nOnce Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as told, changing into his home clothes.\n“…It is a mess, and there is no place to step on…how do you live like this…”\nHe heard a perturbed mutter while changing, and felt really apologetic.\nOnce he changed, he laid down, and seemed to have fallen asleep. After he opened his heavy eyelids with much effort, the first thing he saw was the flax-colored hair.\nHe looked above the hair, and found Mahiru standing there, looking at him silently. It appeared what happened before was no dream.\n“…What time is it now?”\n“7 pm. You slept for a few hours.”\nMahiru tersely answered, and right when Amane was sitting up, she handed over a cup of isotonic drink.\nFeeling gracious, he brought the cup to his mouth, and could finally look around.\nHe found himself feeling a little better, probably because of the nap.\nHe then noticed his head was a little cold. He touched it, and felt something cloth-like on his fingertips, though it was a little hard.\nThere was a cooling sheet pasted on him, one his house would not have. Having noticed that, he lifted his head towards Mahiru. “I brought it from my house,” she simply responded.\nHis house had neither a cooling sheet nor an isotonic drink. It appeared she brought the isotonic drink here too.\n“…Thanks for bringing it here.”\n“No worries.”\nThe aloof answer had his grimacing.\nIt was likely she took care of him out of guilt, and not a desire to talk to Amane. In any case, it was impossible to talk intimately when she was in the house of a boy she had just met.\n“Anyway, I brought the medicine on the table. It is best not to consume with an empty stomach. Do you have any appetite?”\n“Hm, sorta.”\n“I see. I made some porridge, so please have that.”\n“…Eh, you made that, Shiina?”\n“Who else is here? I shall eat it if you do not want to.”\n“No, no, I’ll eat it. Please let me.”\nHe never expected her to care for him, let alone make porridge, and thus was a little flustered.\nTo be honest, Mahiru’s cooking skill was unknown to him, but he never heard rumors of her failing home economics class, so it was probably not too bad.\nAmane immediately lowered his head, asking to eat it, and Mahiru stared at him blankly. She nodded as she handed over the thermometer on the side table.\n“I shall bring it over. Do measure your temperature.”\n“Okay.”\nHe did as she said, unbuttoning his shirt, and took the thermometer. At that moment, Mahiru looked away.\n“Please do so when I am not in this room.”\nShe sounded a little frantic, and Amane looked over to find her face a little red.\nAmane found Mahiru’s reaction a little intriguing, since unlike girls, boys did not need to hide their chests. Perhaps Mahiru had no resistance against the color of skin however, for she hastily looked aside the moment he unbuttoned his shirt.\nHer white face was dyed with a light shade of rose, her face still looking aside as she quivered. One had to wonder if he was imagining it, but Mahiru’s ears too were red, showing how embarrassed she was.\n…Ahh, I’m starting to see why the guys around her say she’s so cute.\nAmane too considered Mahiru a beautiful girl, but nothing more. There was no doubt she was pretty and cute, but that was all to him.\nShe was beautiful like a sculpted piece of work. The impression she gave was similar to that of an art piece.\nBut at this point, Mahiru was evidently slightly embarrassed , making her look a little more human, and thus, strangely adorable.\n“…Then hurry and take out the porridge?”\n“I-I will without you telling me.”\nTheir relationship was not close enough for him to plainly state how cute she was. She would have found him weird if he did so, so he swallowed his thoughts.\nOnce he said that disinterestedly, Mahiru teetered out of the room.\nShe was a little slow, probably faltering, or because the room was too messy. It was likely to be the latter.\nAs he watched her leave in a daze, Amane let out a little sigh, wondering how it ended up this way.\n…Well, I guess it’s the sense of responsibility and guilt.\nA girl typically would not enter the house of an unfamiliar boy just to take care of him. It would be bad if she was attacked.\nYet Mahiru did so despite the risk, so it seemed she was feeling really guilty. Amane clearly showed no interest in her too, and this might be cause for her relief.\nIn any case, there should be no doubt that Mahiru started taking care of him because there was no other way.\n“…I brought it here.”\nWhile Amane had such thoughts in his slightly feverish head, Mahiru knocked on the door tentatively.\nIt seemed she did not enter immediately, worried that he was not dressed fully. He then remembered that he loosened his clothes to measure his temperature.\n“I’m not done measuring yet.”\n“I said that you should measure your temperature when I am not in…”\n“Sorry, I spaced out.”\nHe apologized, tucked the thermometer under his armpit, and soon heard a dull electronic sound.\nHiii, he took it out, and it showed 38.3°C. Not bad enough to be hospitalized for, but it was relatively high.\nAmane wore his clothes properly. “Come in,” he told Mahiru, who had not entered. She cautiously entered with a tray or porridge.\nShe obviously looked relaxed, for he had finally put on his clothes.\n“Your temperature?”\n“38.3°C. I’ll get better with some medicine and sleep.”\n“…The medicine sold in shops mostly deals with the symptoms, and not the virus itself. Do rest well and work on your immune system.”\nWhile he was being reproached, Amane knew that Mahiru was simply concerned, and his heart felt ticklish.\nGoodness,\nshe sighed as she placed the claypot and the tray on the side table, opening the lid.\nIt contained porridge with plum. The porridge was thin, considering the burden on his stomach, probably at a ratio of 7:1 of water and rice.\nPlum was added not for flavor, it seemed, but because it was said to be good for colds.\nThere was no steam oozing, but it was warm, which meant that it was not made moments ago, but deliberately cooled thereafter.\nWhile Amane stared at the porridge, Mahiru ignored him as she served the porridge in a bowl. The plum bits were gently scattered within, the seeds carefully removed, the red flesh faintly blended into the white.\n“Here. It probably is not hot anymore.”\n“Nn, thank you.”\nHe received it, took a scoop with the spoon, and stared at it. Mahiru was surprised to see his gesture.\n“…What, do you want me to feed you? I am not providing such a service.”\n“Nobody’s saying that…no, I’m just thinking that you know how to cook.”\n“Anyone living alone should be capable of doing so.”\nFor Amane, who had never been able to live a proper life alone, those words really hurt.\n“Fujimiya-san, before you cook, do clean up your room.”\n“That too.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had somewhat known what Amane was thinking as she proceeded with another jab. He muttered away, trying to pass off this matter as he brought the spoonful of porridge to his mouth.\nThe sticky porridge spread in his mouth, along with the original taste of rice and little salt.\nBut the sourness and saltiness of the shredded dried plums were really appetizing, establishing a fine balance.\nAmane did not really like salty dried plums, but he did like the slight sweetness in this mild sourness. If he were healthy, he would have put the dried plums onto white rice and made chazuke.\n“It’s nice.”\n“Thank you for that. But anyone could have made the porridge without much difference.”\nMahiru answered with a blank face, but there was a little smile on her face.\nIt was different from the smile he could occasionally see at school. It was a smile of relief, and he subconsciously stared at her.\n“…Fujimiya-san?”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nThe kind smile soon vanished after a single moment, and he found it a pity.\nSo he thought, but Amane did not say anything as he tried to brush it off, eating the porridge in little scoops.",

      "content": "“…Anyway, please rest for today, and do drink plenty of water. Use this to wipe your sweat. I have prepared a basin of water; please soak the towel, squeeze it dry, and wipe it.”\nAfter dinner, Mahiru quickly brought another packet of isotonic drink, a basin of water, a towel, and a spare cooling sheet to the side table.\nAfter all, she should not be staying in a stranger’s house, especially one of the opposite gender; Amane too would have felt awkward, so he accepted her actions.\nAnd as Amane stared, Mahiru checked if she had omitted something.\n…For someone doing it out of her sense of duty, she sure is thorough.\nMahiru might sound vicious, but she was serious and thorough in whatever she did. Amane gave a wry smile as he started getting used to her.\nWell, we won’t get involved with each other after this. Thanks for the care though.\nIt was unlikely he would be more involved with her. After all, she was just taking care of him this once.\nAnd since they would not interact again , he would use this opportunity to ask something he was curious about.\nThe medicine might have been taking effect, for he was starting to feel a little groggy, but the fever seemed to have subsided a little. His thoughts were clearer compared to before.\n“Erm, can I ask you something?”\n“What is it?”\nOnce everything was set, Mahiru looked over to him,\n“Why were you sitting on the swing when it was raining? Had a quarrel with your boyfriend?”\nHe was still curious about the previous day’s incident, which resulted in this.\nBack then, Mahiru was on the swing, soaked in the rain; why was she there?\nHaving seen her wear the expression of a lost child, Amane was concerned and shoved the umbrella to him.\nBut he did not understand why she had such an expression.\nShe appeared to be waiting for someone, so he wondered if she had a quarrel with her boyfriend or something, but Mahiru looked towards him, dumbfounded.\n“My apologies, but I have no boyfriend, nor do I have any intention of getting one.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“On the contrary, why do you think I have one?”\n“Since you’re so popular, I thought you would have one or two at least.”\nBeing able to talk to her like this, Amane felt she was a more resolute, yet popular, ordinary girl. It did not seem the case to those around him though.\nShe was an adorable, innocent, obedient, and humble pretty girl with an angelic appearance that was love at first sight.\nShe was the top ranking student for the year, adept at sports, and as he just learned, great at cooking. Surely she would be popular.\nHe had seen others actually flirting with her and knew that a few of his classmates had considerable interest in her.\nShe was spoiled with options; he could not imagine her not dating at all.\nHe used the term, one or two at least, as he meant, but Mahiru’s face froze once she heard that, and it contorted a little.\n“Not at all. I do not think I am one without restraint to be dating a few males at once. Absolutely not.”\nHer eyes turned cold as she flatly denied it, and Amane immediately realized that he stepped on a landmine.\nFor a moment, he felt a chill, but it was probably due to the cold. For some reason, it seemed the room turned frosty.\n“Sorry, this isn’t what I mean. My apologies.”\n“…No, I might have been a little heated myself.”\nBut the moment he lowered his head, the cold atmosphere dispersed.\nRather than say that she was feeling heated, it seemed the room was frigid like a snowstorm, but he dared not to mention this.\n“…Anyway, that was not the reason. I just wanted to calm my head a little… I caused you worry, and you caught a cold. My sincerest apologies.”\n“It’s fine. I’m just being a busybody. Actually, I don’t want you to feel guilty just because I was being a busybody. Anyway, this is where we stop getting involved, Shiina.”\nAs expected, Mahiru was taking care of Amane out of guilt, and once she heard that, she blinked and stared at Amane incredulously.\nWas she that disturbed by him saying they would stop getting involved?\n“There’s nothing common between us, so that’s where it stops. You’re the angel, the pretty genius girl who’s top of our year, and I don’t want to get carried away. Did you think I’m feeling fortunate for having you owe me a favor?\nMahiru awkwardly averted her eyes.\nI guess so.\nAmane betrayed a wry smile.\nShe, however, probably was not getting ahead of herself however, for that probably happened before.\nSelling favors to a pretty girl and getting involved in a relationship might have been a passable method.\nBut it seemed Mahiru had quite a few experiences of that, and it was no wonder she was so wary on that rainy day. He could not blame her for being so defensive.\n“Well, it’s troublesome to you, getting involved with guys you don’t like.”\n“I guess so.”\n“Of course, isn’t it?”\nHe was a little bemused to hear her confirmation.\nShe, famous as the obedient honor student of an angel, had her own likes, dislikes, and troubles, which made him a little familial with her.\nIt appeared Mahiru might have accidentally let slip, for she glared at Amane, who baited her into saying so, with a little resentment.\nThis was the biggest proof thus far that Mahiru was a person with emotions.\n“It’s fine though? Well, I’m relieved to see that the Angel has troubles just like a human.”\n“…Please do not call me that.”\nIt seemed she was bashful about being called an Angel; she still wore a peeved look.\nAmane laughed once again, having found it similarly amusing.\n“Well, it’s not like it’s anything urgent. I don’t have a reason to pester you.”\nSo he said, and Mahiru widened her eyes in shock, wryly smiling herself.\nAmane recalled Mahiru bowing seriously and returning to her apartment as he laid on the bed, looking up at the ceiling.\nThe medicine was effective, but his body remained tense. Once he relaxed, it seemed the drowsiness would strike.\nHe closed his eyes, recalling the events that transpired on this day.\nNobody would have believed him if he said he was cared for by an angel (vicious), and it was nothing worth talking about.\nWhat happened on this day would be a secret only to Amane and Mahiru.\nSecret\n, his heart tickled from this term, even though he found it a hassle to mention this to others.\nThe next day onwards, they would revert to being unfamiliar strangers.\nSo Amane convinced himself as his consciousness slowly faded.",

      "content": "As declared, the relationship between Amane and Mahiru remained that of passing strangers.\nHe recovered the day after he was cared for, and just so happened to bump into Mahiru while shopping at the convenience store, but they did not truly interact. It appeared Mahiru was a little relieved to see Amane looking fine however.\nClass started on Monday, and nothing changed. Same for the others.\nBut if there was a tiny change, it was that when he went to school, he would lower his head while greeting others.\n“Ohh, you’re looking great there, Amane.”\n“Thanks to your care.”\nItsuki was worried to see Amane half-dead the previous week when they were headed home. He had waited for Amane at the school building entrance, wanting to check on him. Over the weekend, he sent Amane a message, “You ain’t dead right?”\nAmane messaged back, saying he was fine, but Itsuki remained skeptical. It was only after seeing Amane all lively did he sigh in an exaggerated gesture.\n“Well, even I would be worried seeing you like that. You’re better now, but you should pay more attention to how you live. Start from cleaning up.”\n“Sounds like what someone else said.”\n“Nn?”\n“Ah, it’s nothing… I knew that over the weekend. Will be cleaning up these days.”\nNo, you get down to it now,\nwent the retort, but Amane ignored that.\nThat probably could not be done within half a day.\nSo he shook his head, and Itsuki did not pursue the matter further, instead looking dumbfounded.\n“Well, it’s your house, so do as you please. Make sure there’s enough space to step on the next time I go there.”\n“… I’ll see how it goes.”\nWhile Amane frowned as he changed into the indoor shoes, he heard a commotion in the neighboring classroom, and inadvertently looked over.\nHe looked through the window, and found Mahiru showcasing her usual beauty, surrounded by both boys and girls.\nShe was smiling calmly as she responded to them, yet she looked a completely different Mahiru from several days ago, so he thought with a wry smile.\nAnd Itsuki, having seen Amane’s expression, looked over as well, understanding once he caught sight of Mahiru.\n“Ahh, Shiina-san? Still as popular as before. She’s a pretty girl after all.”\n“Well, she’s the angel after all…you find Shiina cute too, Itsuki?”\n“Of course. I have Chii around, so she’s just there to be marveled at.”\n“Stop flexing already.”\nTo be precise, the ‘Chii’ Itsuki spoke of was his girlfriend, Chitose Shirakawa.\nThose two were a lovey-dovey couple, and whenever they were together, it was just too bright for Amane’s eyes.\nStop flexing over here,\nAmane gestured towards Itsuki, but the latter did not look unhappy. After all, it was normal for them after all. “This guy’s hopeless,” he laughed.\n“What about you, Amane? Don’t you find Shiina cute?”\n“She’s a beauty. That’s all.”\n“That’s boring.”\n“Well, she’s a flower on a peak we can’t reach. There’s no reason for us to get involved with her; all we can do is look.”\n“You’re not wrong.”\nDue to some coincidence, Mahiru took care of him days ago, but they were living in different worlds after all.\nAmane did not foresee a future where he would get along well with Mahiru. Outstanding humans would only mesh well with other outstanding humans.\nAnd Amane, painfully self-aware of how useless he was, could not possibly have anything to do with Mahiru, so cute and capable she was.\nYes, Amane himself assumed he would have nothing to do with her anymore.\n“…What are you eating?”\nAnd that notion was turned upside down when Amane was at the veranda, sipping his jelly juice as he looked outside.",

      "content": "Amane found it a hassle to go down to the convenience store, and was slurping at the jelly drink he usually kept at home, leaning on the railing as he breathed in the air outside. It was then that Mahiru appeared on the veranda herself.\nOnce Mahiru spotted Amane, she leaned over the veranda, noticed the jelly juice he was drinking, and frowned a little.\nAmane never expected to be approached, and could only remain momentarily rooted.\n“You understand, right? It’s jelly that replenishes my energy in just dozens of seconds.”\n“…Are you planning to eat this for dinner?”\n“What else then?”\n“…A high school boy with a big appetite is eating this?”\n“Stop being a busybody.”\nTypically, he would have lived on bentos from the convenience stores or sides from the supermarket and not eat that little. He was not in the mood to cook dinner, nor have cup ramen, so he decided to have jelly juice instead.\nIt was unlikely he would have sufficient food, and he might have some snacks or sweets thereafter.\n“…What about cooking?”\n“Can’t do, and won’t do. You know that, right?”\n“…And you cannot tidy up. It is amazing how you are living alone…”\n“Shut up. That has nothing to do with you, right?”\nThe scathing truth hit him, so he frowned and finished his jelly juice.\nHe had suffered days ago, and was planning to clean up, but being told this for days turned his determination to the opposite direction.\nAmane, in turn, was curious as to why Mahiru was being a little naggy; she stared back at him and let out a little sigh.\n“… Please wait for a moment.”\nBefore he could respond or deny, Mahiru returned from the veranda to her apartment.\nUpon hearing the windows clatter shut, Amane asked. “What was that?”\nShe said to wait, but what did she want him to wait for?\nHe looked towards Mahiru’s apartment with surprise, but naturally, there was no response.\nGuess I’m cooled down. Time to go back.\nHe waited for her as told, but the winter night was colder than he thought. A sweater was insufficient.\nIn any case, he did not know why he was waiting so obediently.\nThe temperature was so cold, he was breathing white air. He exhaled, and there was an electronic buzzing sound from the corridor.\nHe immediately turned towards the door once he heard the bell.\nThere was only one visitor he would expect to arrive.\nHe did not know why she would appear, but he avoided the messy pile of clothes and magazines as he went towards the corridor.\nHe knew who it was even without looking through the peephole. He dragged his sandals towards the door and unchained it. As expected, slightly beneath his eyes was flaying flax-colored hair.\n“…What are you doing?”\n“I had enough seeing how poorly you live… these are leftovers, but here.”\nMahiru retorted tersely as she stretched her hands outward.\nThe hands, which were much smaller than Amane’s, were holding a tupperware container. The translucent lid gave Amane a sneak peak of the cooked food inside.\nThe contents were still warm, and there were some water droplets on the lid. It was hard to see, but there should be some cooked food inside.\nHe blinked a few times, and once she saw that his eyes were trying to comprehend why, Mahiru let out a deep sigh.\n“You do not eat properly. Supplements are simply supplements, not to be taken as the main course.”\n“Are you my mom?”\n“I do think what I insist here is normal. Also, you should be cleaning up your apartment, no? It is difficult to stand in there.”\nMahiru glanced behind Amane, and narrowed her eyes in exasperation, leaving him speechless.\n“… I can still walk through.”\n“Not at all. Clothes typically should not be on the floor.”\n“Well, they just dropped.”\n“They will not if you wash them, dry them, and fold them properly. Please pack up all the magazines you have read. It will be troublesome if you slip and fall.”\nThere was some spite in the words, but Amane knew well that Mahiru was concerned for some reason and could not retort to every point.\nIt was true that the last time she took care of him, both of them nearly slipped because the room was too messy. It was no wonder he was being told off.\nGrrr.\nAmane, unable to retort, grimaced and pursed his lips together as he received the tupperware container from Mahiru.\nThe warmth slowly spread through his palm, and it was comforting amidst this cooling weather.\n“So, can I eat this?”\n“I will discard it if you do not want to.”\n“No, no, no, I’ll eat it. It’s not often we get an ordinary dinner made by the Angel herself.”\n“…Please do not call me that. Seriously.”\nHe tried to get back at her by using her nickname at school, but her white face was clearly starting to turn red.\nIt seemed calling her ‘Angel’ was truly embarrassing. Looking from her viewpoint, Amane too felt uneasy about it, and it was to be expected.\nHer cheeks were flushed, and she glared at him with a teary look, which Amane could only grin at.\n“Sorry. I won’t call you that again.”\nAny more, and he would really ruin her mood, so it would not be appropriate for him to joke anymore about this. Plus, they were not on such familial terms that they could joke about, and it would be better not to go overboard.\nIt appeared Mahiru really did not want to be called such, and she cleared her throat, regaining her composure.\nHer cheeks remained strangely red however, and she looked not too different from before.\n“Well, I’ll be accepting this graciously. You don’t have to be sorry about me getting sick.”\n“Not at all. We are even now after I had taken care of you. I am doing this for self-satisfaction… but I am relatively concerned by how you are not living a proper lifestyle.”\n“I get that.”\nAmane had always been in a hapless state whenever she saw him, and her decision might be expected from a certain perspective.\nEven at this point, the entrance behind Amane was a complete mess, and Mahiru had seen it all when she took care of him. There was no point hiding.\n“… Do eat proper meals and live a proper lifestyle now, will you?”\n“Are you my mom?”\nWhile Mahiru lectured away with a completely serious look, Amane retorted back in exhaustion.\nHe brought the gift handed to him back, frisked for disposable chopsticks from the supermarket, and sat on the living room sofa.\nHow would the food Mahiru shoved to him taste?\nHe was thinking that the porridge from before tasted good. His tongue was insensitive due to the cold, but the taste of the porridge, cooked from uncooked rice, did enter his stomach gently.\nGiven the prior experience, Mahiru’s cooking skills were fine. How would it taste this time?\nHarboring some expectations, he opened the tupperware lid with some apprehension, and drifting out was undoubtedly the fragrance of cooked food.\nIt contained some root vegetables and chicken. The soup was mild in color, the bright colors of the carrots and the green bean garnish stood out.\nFood of various colors were chopped into bite-size, whetting the appetite of Amane, who had only consumed jelly.\nHe quickly split the chopsticks and brought the carrot to his mouth first.\n“It’s nice.”\nThe taste was obvious at once.\nAs to be expected of the health-conscious Mahiru, the seasoning was mild, but the fish stock was rich. This was not the powdered stock that was usually bought from the supermarket. It was stock boiled from bonito flakes and kelp. The taste was completely different.\nHe slowly chewed, savoring the flavor of the stock, seasoning, and vegetables spreading in his mouth.\nThe freshness of the vegetables was thoroughly emphasized while the soup flavor was absorbed. Amane himself disliked eating vegetables, but even he could enjoy it.\nDo eat more vegetables, so the message implied, for there was little chicken inside. The chicken was really fresh, tender, not overdone. There was nothing to nitpick about it aside from quantity.\nThe ingredients were relatively plain for a high school girl’s cooking, yet it clearly emphasized her skills.\nOne could say it demonstrated a stark difference from those who had just learnt how to cook.\nIt would be better if there was some rice or miso or soy sauce, so he thought, but unfortunately he did not cook any rice… or rather, he had finished his supply of rice, and this little wish was left unfulfilled.\nIt was too late for him to say so, but Amane regretted not going out to buy two packets of rice.\n“The Angel’s really amazing.”\nSo Amane praised the superhuman who was perfect at studying, sports, and housework, yet terrified and unhappy about being called that. He continued to savor the ideal taste of these root vegetables.",

      "content": "“I’m returning this. It’s really delicious.”\nThe following night, Amane brought the borrowed tupperware along as he visited Mahiru’s house.\nThough Amane was truly bad at doing housework, he was fine with washing. It was proper etiquette to wash and return after all. So he thought as he brought along the thoroughly washed and dried tupperware.\nHe could not say that he had a tough time washing it however.\nMahiru might have expected Amane to ring the bell at this time, for she opened the door without checking.\nShe was dressed in a bordeaux red knitted one piece dress, and narrowed her eyes slightly.\nShe glanced at the tupperware container and said, “It is impressive that you washed it well.” She praised him as she would to a child, causing him to frown unconsciously.\n“Thank you for doing this much. This is for you.”\nMahiru received the tupperware, and that would be fine, but she then passed another tupperware container to Amane’s hands.\nAs expected, or so it seemed, it was warm.\nInside it was probably fried pork and eggplant. It was a little colder, so the lid was not covered in steam. He he could see the eggplants, the cooked meat, and sesame seeds sprinkled on top through the lid.\nLooking at the color, it seemed the sauce was made from miso. The slightly charred eggplant and glossy meat looked appetizing.\nThis really looked delicious\n, he thought.\nBut he could not understand why she brought him food again.\n“…No, erm, I’m just here to return the tupperware.”\n“This is tonight’s dinner.”\n“I know that, but,”\n“Just to ask, you have no allergies, right? I do not care about your food preferences.”\n“Not really? But if I keep taking more from you…”\nHow would it turn out if he was to have two consecutive dinners from her?\nAmane was utterly grateful, especially given his improper balance in nutrition, and Mahiro’s cooking skills were far superior to girls her age. The taste would be remarkable.\nSo too would the food inside the tupperware container be delicious.\nBut it would be an utter tragedy if the people from his school were to see this. Of course, the tragedy would befall Amane’s calm high school life.\nEach apartment here was designed to accommodate a person, but the rental was expensive considering the facilities and geographic location. He never saw any schoolmate aside from Mahiru nearby, and he did not need to worry about them being spotted, but he was apprehensive about such a relationship being exposed.\n“I made a little too much for myself. I will be glad if you accepted some of mine.”\n“…Well, I’m glad to accept this, but usually, this gives others a wrong impression that you like them.”\n“You think so?”\n“Nope, not at all.”\nAre you an idiot?\nGiven that she was making such a face, Amane had no reason to think that much.\nFurthermore, it was impossible to imagine the beautiful prodigy Mahiru showing any goodwill after witnessing how useless Amane was at cleaning up.\nIt was true that receiving dinner from a cute neighbor would be fitting for a romcom manga plot, but there was no love or comedic elements. No love, no comedy in their conversations. Just to note, Amane had no rice at home.\nThe only aspects present were the Angel’s vicious words and her pitiful compassion.\n“It should be fine then…You are planning to buy some bentos from the convenience store or some side dishes at the supermarket, no?”\n“How do you know?”\n“The kitchen did not look appear to be used properly, and there were a lot of disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and supermarket on the table. Also, anyone can tell without thinking, given how unhealthy you look. Your face clearly looks unhealthy.”\nShe saw through everything with just a single trip to his house, and Amane’s face twitched. It was an undeniable fact however, so he could not say anything.\n“…Now then, I shall be returning.”\nThud!\nOnce she was done with what she wanted to say and give, Mahiru closed the door.\nClank.\nThe chain behind the door was latched up, and Amane looked towards the tupperware in his hands.\nWithin his palms was the still-warm dinner, and he let out a sigh before returning to his apartment.\nThe eggplants and pork with sesame seeds were really delicious, and he had a craving for rice.\nThus, every day, he would exchange an empty tupperware container for one with food, his food nutrition taking a drastic turn for the better.\nMahiru’s cooking was not particularly heavy in flavoring, but it was extremely appetizing, so every dinner, he would prepare pre-cooked rice to eat with these dishes.\nThere were different dishes every day; whether they were Japanese, Western, or Chinese, they were all delicious, impossible to refuse, whetting Amane’s appetite.\nThe opportunity to eat these every day had Amane looking forward to them. He was apologetic about it, but it seemed he was being domesticated, melancholic if he never got to eat her food.\nPerhaps the Angel’s cooking was truly addictive. While thinking this was not a good thing, Amane obediently accepted the tupperware container, and indulged himself in the food.\n“…You’re looking great recently. Got your food sorted out?”\nAmane was looking a lot better, probably due to having sufficient nutrients from dinner. It was lunchtime when Itsuki stared at his face.\nAmane was having udon at the cafeteria, and was shedding cold sweat in the face of the perceptive Itsuki.\n“Itsuki, I think you’re looking scary.”\n“What, did I hit the bullseye?”\n“No…well, I had to reflect on that.”\nHe would be told off whenever he met Mahiru at the apartments, and given that he was receiving dinner from her, it was to be expected that his quality of life had improved.\nHe wanted to express his thanks to the Angel, but at the same time, he felt she was somewhat a busybody.\nSo he confirmed ambiguously, and Itsuki gleefully giggled.\n“Of course. Your old unhealthy look was because of your living habits after all.”\n“Shut up.”\n“But you managed to get it fixed just like that?”\n“… I was forced, sorta?”\n“Haha. Your mom knows?”\n“… Not exactly, I would say.”\nMahiru’s tone was similar to his mom’s.\nShe was way too young and cute to be called his mom, but Amane did not want to reject Mahiru who had been taking care of him for some reason.\n“Say Itsuki. Did I look really unhealthy?”\n“Yeah. Mostly because you looked too pale. You’re tall but skinny, and your face just looked unhealthy.”\n“But my face’s like this.”\n“I know. You can be livelier in your expressions though.”\n“That’s impossible…I see, a dead-looking face…?”\nAs he hardly checked his face in the mirror, Amane hardly knew how he looked, but to others, he appeared to be utterly sickly.\nPerhaps Mahiru was worried about Amane because he usually looked dead.\n“Amane, you should pay attention to how others look at you. You won’t look like this if you sort it out.\n“Are you just rubbing it in?”\n“No, what else can I do without saying it plainly that you look dead?”\nItsuki took the opportunity to coax Amane into focusing on his health and appearance. “None of your business,” he said, and looked aside.",

Honey flavored.”\nSo she said as she gently applied it. Well, there actually was the word ‘honey’ written on the packaging.\n“They come with flavors nowadays…?”\n“You do sound like a grandpa…they do come with flavors recently, like chocolate, strawberry, green apple. I usually use medicinal lip balm because of the school rules, but Chitose-san said this is fine too.”\nIt appeared to be Chitose’s recommendation. Mahiru herself seemed to like it as she capped the lip balm back excitedly.\n“Oh.” So Amane said as he stared at Mahiru’s lips. They were softer and bouncier because of the balm, giving off an indescribable, refreshing scent.\n“…What is it?”\nOnce she noticed herself being stared at, Mahiru tilted her head incredulously.\n“Well, just wondering if it’ll be sweet to kiss.”\n“Hm hm, do you want to try?”\nShe smiled impishly as she pointed at her lips, thinking it would just be a joke. “Don’t mind me.” but Amane answered as he bit at her lips.\nShe shivered, never expecting him to really do so, but she never intended to stop him, for she was the one who invited him.\nSo Amane enjoyed the moist lips, softer than usual as he felt his way along her lips, the sweet taste of honey spreading in his mouth.\n“…Well, that’s really sweet.”\nSo he muttered, and a blushing Mahiru glared up at him.\n“…You said that and you’re the one embarrassed now…owww, I get it, I’m sorry.”\nAs he was slapped by her, he decided not to taunt her anymore while he continued to savor her lips.\nHe felt a different sweetness from the usual kiss, and whenever he licked her, she would fidget bashfully, leaving him desiring more.\n“…But it’s really sweet.”\n“Nn…E-erm, my balm’s going to wear off.”\nOn the verge of surrendering, Mahiru pressed her palms on Amane’s chest, her bashful and moist caramel-colored eyes staring back at him.\n“I can’t continue?”\n“Uuu…I am reapplying it now. Hmph.”\nIt appeared he was allowed to continue.\nFinding Mahiru to be adorable for choosing to forgive him again, Amane brought his lips onto hers again.\nThe following day, Mahiru sat next to Amane with lip balm applied, the color of her lips different.\nAmane unwittingly smiled, and realizing that, Mahiru retreated back tentatively.\n“Wh-what is it?”\n“Well, my girlfriend’s cute.”\n“What is with that out of a sudden…nn”\nBefore she could finish her eyes, Amane stuffed her lips with his own, the rich sweetness of the sweet and sour fruit spreading in his mouth.\nHe bullied Mahiru for deliberately changing the flavor, and his lips naturally relaxed. He felt she wanted to be kiss when she applied a different flavor, and for some reason, the kiss lasted longer\n“Strawberry today?”\nAfter a while, he removed his lips, asking her, and found her face to be completely sizzling, resembling a red, ripened strawberry.\n“What’s the flavor tomorrow?”\n“…Chili peppers?”\n“Your lips will swell, Mahiru.”\n“They will swell when you are kissing me so many times, Amane-kun.”\nShe muttered with a pout, and having messed up this time, Amane gave a wry smile as he kissed her gently.\n“In that case, we’ll make them swell with sweetness. You can help me with that, Mahiru.”\n“…I want to apply chocolate lip balm on you, Amane-kun.”\n“As you wish.”\nSo we can kiss, huh? He wondered, but never voiced it out; he was bemused by how enthusiastic she was for some reason as he thoroughly enjoyed her lips.",

Mahiru was seated next to Amane on the sofa when she smiled at him.\nAmane himself knew it was a joke, even before he thought further about it. Looking at her attitude till this point, he was confident there was no boy she would like more than him.\nFurthermore, it was April 1st. In other words, April Fools.\nMahiru appeared to be hoping for him to be caught or something as she showed a smile. She usually had no interest in such events, so it was very likely Chitose taught her something weird.\nThen, he would simply play along.\n“I see. So you’re abandoning me?”\n“Heh?”\nIn response to Amane’s words, Mahiru exclaimed in surprise.\n“I thought I’m the only one for you, and I’m already thinking about the future…I see. Can’t help if there’s a guy you really like, Mahiru. My fault for not noticing your feelings there.”\n“…It appears you know, even though you are into this, Amane-kun.”\n“Know what?”\nAmane deliberately retorted back, and Mahiru groaned,\n“…A-about, me lying to you…”\n“Well, I know that you like me, Mahiru.”\n“Th-that is right, but…uuu”\n“You like me, and you lied to me while trusting me, right?”\nHe was asking a question, but Amane was really confident.\nThe proof of that truth was how Mahiru was looking down with her face all red. It seemed she did not expect to be seen through completely.\nHe gave a wry grin at her uselessness, patting her head.\n“Well, I lied too, so tit for tat.”\n“Lied?”\n“I won’t leave you. I would have thought of leaving if it’s in the past, if it’s for your sake, Mahiru…I can’t do that now though. I hate this.”\nIf it were in the past, he would have left Mahiru if she had fallen for someone, and back then, he did not express his feelings.\nBut it was impossible for him at this point. He could not endure the thought of not being next to her.\nHe hoped that Mahiru’s feelings would never leave it, and if there was a possibility of her finding another boy who was better, he felt he was willing to better himself, and have Mahiru fall for him again.\nHaving said that as he stared at her caramel-colored eyes, her cheeks turned red instantly.\n“A-Amane-kun.”\n“Mahiru, you’re mine…can’t I?”\n“No-not that, you cannot…for I am yours, Amane-kun.”\n“Nn.”\nOnce he got Mahiru’s promise, Amane embraced Mahiru firmly as though he was ensuring his possession of her, and she smiled away in delight, looking a little bashful.",

There was a strong feeling of naivete on her face, as she showed no understanding of what was going on.\nIt appeared she was shocked by his reaction however, and started to panic a little.\n“Erm, I-I do know of bubble tea though. It is made from tapioca powder. High school girls do drink it often.”\n“…You never drank it before, Mahiru?”\n“Embarrassingly, no.”\n“That’s surprising. You don’t drink it with Chitose?”\n“Chitose-san said, 『I prefer crepes to bubble tea』…”\n“Ahhh…”\nThat big eater of a high school girl would surely say such things. Another reason might be that both of them often ate the crepes from the shop at the station, which were really good.\n“But, erm, sorry for not hearing about this, but I do not know what this bubble tea challenge is…though I heard there is a condition to be met while drinking bubble tea or something…”\n“Ahh yeah that’s about it…you don’t have to mind.”\nIt was great that she quickly wrapped her mind around it, but challenging that was pretty much a lost cause.\nIf she failed, Mahiru would be troubled, but if she succeeded, Amane would be troubled over where his eyes should go.\n“Ehh, I am a little curious now that you say so.”\n“You don’t have to be.”\n“Mmm…but that aside, since girls do like to drink bubble tea, I shall buy one.”\n“O-oh.”\nSince her curiosity was piqued, she informed Amane of her intentions, and joined the waiting queue of high school girls.\nIt appeared this would take a short while, so he had a look at his smartphone.\nAbout five minutes passed as Amane watched Mahiru and waited for her to queue, before she finally returned.\nShe was holding a drink, apparently milk tea, with some black beads inside it. He saw one first glance that it was bubble milk tea, and was a little impressed.\n“Sorry to keep you waiting.”\n“Ah, it’s fine.”\n“This is the first time I am drinking it. It seems the bubble tea challenge is to put the drink cup on the chest and drink it.”\n“Pfft.”\n“It is convenient to search things on the web. Almost all answers can be found there.”\nIt appeared the wise Mahiru had turned to the instrument of technology without hesitation. Amane usually felt it was a good thing for her to adapt so quickly, but this time, he was left vexed.\n“Shall I challenge it?”\n“N-no, erm.”\n“Amane-kun, you have been looking here for quite some time.”\n“Sorry about that. No, erm…I-I’m a little curious, and it looks like you’ll succeed…”\nWhile he had no guts to stare at her, he had a rough gauge of her bust size, having spent much time with her.\nHe did not know the exact cup size, but it appeared hers was a little larger than average, with ample space to put items on it, and she should be able to succeed the bubble tea challenge without difficulty.\nIt would be actually distracting if she were to succeed at doing so before him, so he wished she would not do so, if possible.\nBut as a male, he had a desire to see her do so after all, and it left him in a dilemma.\n“I will do so if you let me try, Amane-kun.”\n“…Ahh, erm.”\n“I do understand it is natural for males to be curious about the females’ chests.”\n“I feel conflicted that you’re being so understanding…”\n“It is scarier if you are not interested, no?”\n“Well, when you put it that way.”\nIt would be strangely scary to see a high school boy without any sex drive. At the very least, Amane was just like the others, but not showing it out of concern for Mahiru.\n“…Do you want to look?”\n“…I want to.”\nAnd just like ordinary people, he lost to the temptation.\nMahiru only suggested to try the challenge because Amane was the one who mentioned the bubble tea challenge, but he had this feeling that she was trying this because of him, and felt an itch within his heart.\nEverything Amane wanted her to do before, Mahiru did so, and that was scary, “Now then.” she was about to put the bubble tea on her chest.\nThen, Amane grabbed her wrist.\n“Mahiru-san, erm, it’ll be hard to deal with your clothes if you fail here. Better to do it when we go home.”\n“I guess so.”\nShe nodded away understandingly, and he was relieved. He looked around, and found other males glancing at them from time to time, averting their eyes once he looked back at them.\n(Can’t take any chances here.)\nThey were looking here, having realized that a pretty girl with a really nice body was about to do the recent fad that was the bubble tea challenge, but Amane did not want others to see.\nHe was not bemused to have his own girlfriend being part of their delusions.\nBut he could not simply express these thoughts, and he showed his usual expression as he patted Mahiru’s head.\nHe felt a little regret as he heard the chatter regarding her gentle smile, but he too smiled once he remembered that her smile was directed at him.\n“Speaking of which, I have just thought of it. Is it not safer to use water if I want to try putting something on my chest?”\n“Well, when you put it that way, yeah.”\nAlready used to his headpat, Mahiru looked a little shy, before she stared at the bubble tea in her hands.\nIt was called the bubble tea challenge, but it was simply a measure of whether the bust size was sufficient in holding up a drink, so there was no need to do the challenge with bubble tea. Rather, it would be better if the container had water instead.\nA reasonable choice, so Amane thought, and Mahiru looked up at him.\n“Shall I take the chance to drink and see if it is delicious?”\nIt appeared Mahiru had more interest in the bubble tea than the challenge itself, and that she was embarrassed about wanting to buy it without a reason.\nAs she stared back at him with a look of anticipation, he could only marvel at how cute she was. “Well, you bought it, Mahiru, just do what you want.” so he answered as he patted her on the head again.",

She appeared to be dressed in a nurse uniform.\nWhere did these clothes come from? He averted his eyes as he wondered, but Mahiru appeared a little displeased by the weak reaction shown, and sat next to him, poking his upper arm.\n“…Or do you not know of Halloween?”\n“No actually, I know what it is, but…”\n“Please give me sweets. If you refuse, I shall prank you.”\n“Sweets huh? Alright.”\nHe pulled out the mint gum he bought after school from the bag next to him, and handed it to her, causing her to frown in intrigue.\n“I am surprised that you have some, but gum…”\n“It’s a sweet.”\n“That is true, but this probably is not sweet.”\n“It’s not sugarless.”\nThere were some zero sugar gums sold out there, but this was one with sugar added, so he could pass it off as one.\nMahiru looked extremely peeved that she never got to prank Amane, and this time, he reached his palm out to her.\n“So, it’s time you give me something now right, Mahiru?”\n“Fufu. I have prepared this in advance, just so that I will not be pranked.”\nShe seemed to have expected Amane to say this, smiling away as she took out a syringe filled with some colorful fluid.\nIt was not to be used for medical purposes. It was a plastic case in the shape of a syringe. The tip was not sharp, the hole on the tip and the cylinder itself being very big.\nIt probably contained some colored water candy.\n“We made it like that to go along with clothing. We also have ramune in the form of medicine capsules.”\n“Well, you’re being thorough here…”\n“Chitose-san and I thought about this…just to ask, Amane-kun, what do you think?”\n“Well, that’s cute…cute, but.”\n“But?”\n“…I really hoped you wouldn’t choose to wear a miniskirt.”\nFor cosplay purposes, she was wearing an outfit with a design and length not seen in the actual job, but perhaps it was a little too stimulating.\nHe could not see the undergarments, but he could see the legs. It was a little awkward to Mahiru, with her nice body, wearing this uniform.\nTruly it was Chitose’s idea, so he muttered as he looked aside, hearing a chuckle.\n“…Does it not suit me?”\n“It does…but if you’re wearing such stimulating clothing.”\n“You mean?”\n“I’ll be troubled, you see…aren’t you more troubled than me?”\nAmane might lose his mind and go for some skinship, so if possible, he hoped she would not wear such clothing.\nIt appeared a stunned Mahiru did not understand him, and he gave a wry smile as he reached his arms around her knees and back, lifting her up and putting her on his thighs.\nHe then lifted her face, and brought it close to his cheek. With a hand on her back, he gently caressed her thighs.\n“Since you like to wear this, can I touch?”\n“Ah, uu…th-that is something you cannot help with, right?”\n“What, you want me to touch you?”\n“I did not say so! You are to be punished with sweet medicine for saying this, Amane-kun.”\nHer face was completely beetroot as she injected the water candy onto his lips, and he did not resist.\nThe water candy that was squeezed out slightly was sweet, and Amane, not one particularly fond for sweets, did not like the taste.\nAfter eating a little, he snatched the syringe from Mahiru’s hand, putting it on the table.\nThen, he bit on Mahiru’s lips.\n“…! …Nn!!”\nSince she was displeased with the gum, he thought of sharing this sweetness with her, and when his lips left hers, she was left completely limp.\nHer body quivered slightly when he gently caressed her thighs and back, and there was an unspeakable sexy feeling to that. In fact, there was nothing particularly erotic, and he merely felt itchy.\n“…I gave you candy. Don’t prank me now.”\nMahiru pouted for a little while, and muttered away; Amane chuckled as he began to pat her head, coaxing her.",

Next to him, Mahiru began to fidget.\nHe was eating from the suspicious looking item Chitose had shoved onto him. However, he did not think much about it.\n“What is it?”\n“Eh, no, erm…it is rare seeing you eating chocolate sweets.”\n“Well, I prefer salty snacks after all, but Chitose just shoved this onto me. You want some too, Mahiru?”\nI can share some with you, Mahiru,\nso he implied, and it seemed Mahiru herself was wondering if she could help herself. What is it? Mahiru appeared to be aware of what it was, but she was just waiting.\nHe handed the opened bag to Mahiru, who made a little groan, pressing her forearms onto her forehead.\n“…Do you know what this is about?”\n“No, I know there’s something up because of you and Chitose, but I can’t really figure out anything. Sorry.”\n“So you do not know what day it is today.”\n“Yep.”\n“……Why do you think you received the sweets?”\n“Isn’t there some event going on, or some message involved?”\n“If you know that much, how have you not realized it…?”\nMahiru frowned with confusion, groaning as she put her hand on her forehand.\nHearing such words, Amane did not know what else to do, and decided to pat Mahiru’s head anyway.\n“…You do not have to rub it in.”\n“What do you want me to do then?”\n“I-I do not want it…but…I expected just a little…”\n“Expected?”\n“…You are eating that Pretz, so…I-I will not say what I want however…”\nMahiru shook in embarrassment, and Amane was left troubled as he took another Pretz.\nHe chewed at it, and Mahiru lifted her face.\nNext to him the caramel-colored eyes were wandering around, and Mahiru finally made up her mind as she stared at him, grabbing Amane’s hand that was holding the Pretz.\nIn the blink of an eye, Mahiru seemed to snap as she brought her face close to him.\nAt that moment, by the time he realized it, the blushing Mahiru put her lips onto his.\n“Nn.” A soft voice could be heard from Mahiru’s throat, her lips still sticking to his. It was rare to see her so aggressive, and while feeling ashamed, Amane gently brought his lips over hers.\nAfter a short while, their lips left each other, and Mahiru’s eyes were looking bashful. She was feeling ashamed as she started this, and Amane grinned back.\n“Th-this is what I am referring to. It is this day.”\n“Yeah, I get that.”\n“Pl-please do not laugh.”\n“Laughing, or smiling?”\n“The latter please.”\nThe distressed Mahiru could not hide her shame, and Amane chuckled as he gently caressed her hair.\n“…Can I be honest?”\n“Yes.”\n“…I just want to eat this normally. Don’t really like such games after all.”\nOnce he expressed his honest sentiments, “Yes” Mahiru lowered her eyebrows understandingly, and smiled.\nIt seemed she had misunderstood him; while Mahiru lowered her eyes forlornly, Amane wrapped his arm around her back, and brought his lips to her ear.\n“…If you want a kiss, wait till we’re done eating this.”\nOf course, one would expect a kiss to be sweet, especially when there was chocolate in the mouth. After all, Mahiru had the sweetness and bitterness of honey. There was no need to add chocolate to that.\nOnce he gently whispered, Mahiru’s face turned red like a boiler, and nodded away.\nSatisfied with that reaction, Amane embraced Mahiru in his lap.\nHe doted on the panicking Mahiru, and began sharing the Pretz packet with her.",

      "content": "“Is this fine?”\nOnce they got home, Mahiru changed into plain clothes, puffing her chest under her one-piece skirt. She was not being proud of it, but maintaining balance for the thing to be placed on it.\nThere were significant lumps on her chest, and balanced upon it was the bubble tea cup she bought before they returned home. She had finished the bubble tea, and it contained water and some ice.\n“A-ahh…I guess…”\nAmane saw her balance the cup, and his eyes just wavered.\nHe was the one who suggested this, but once he saw her actually do it, he found the destructiveness to be way beyond his imagination. She really could do it, so he thought, and there was an unspeakable sense of shame rising in him.\nMahiru was confident in her own body. One might say she had always focused on maintaining a fine figure. She never thought she would fail at this challenge.\n“…Is there anything particularly attractive about this to males?”\n“No, erm, well…it’s just the proof of big and small.”\n“Huh…is that so? Speaking of which, Amane-kun. Do you prefer them big or small?”\n“Ack.”\nAmane did think that Mahiru might one day raise this question, but since she asked so boldly, he was left conflicted as to how he should answer.\nIt was not a matter of size. Amane felt that he would not mind the size as long as it was Mahiru. The more important aspect was the touch. He had no strong bias to size, but after all, men would long for such a fluffy feeling.\nBut if he told her honestly, “You are a boy after all, Amane-kun.” she might reply reluctantly.\n“…I think size isn’t a problem as long as it’s you, Mahiru.”\n“You are avoiding the question.”\n“Ack.”\nHe was trying to give his view as a boyfriend, but Mahiru thought he was avoiding the question, staring at him with a displeased look.\n“I will not be angry. Please state your honest opinion.”\n“…No, erm, ah…you seriously want me to say this?”\n“Yes.”\n“Ah, erm…I like them at your size. Like this, just big enough to fit a hand…a-and, besides size, there’s also softness. I think you’re good like this…that’s all.”\nFaced with a reproaching stare, Amane could only blurt out his honest thoughts, and pursed his lips together.\nIt seemed Mahiru was embarrassed about the softness, for she quivered slightly, her face blushing.\nAmane did not know how to comfort her, and for the time being, he felt he should reach his hand out and pat her head to calm her down. However, she shivered greatly, and took a step back.\nSplash, it sounded like water had landed from above.\n“…Ah.”\n“Ah…”\nMahiru looked down at her chest, exclaiming in surprise.\nAs expected, the massive movement caused the cup to topple, and the liquid in the cup drenched her chest.\nLuckily, it contained water, and at most, it would cause the one-piece dress to stick upon her skin.\nHowever, Amane was struck with a massive visual shock.\nMahiru was wearing a white dress, and as she was soaked, the skin sticking to her clothes was visible. The skin, and the bra she was wearing were vaguely showing before him.\nLight green today,\nonce he knew of this information he should not have known, Amane had the urge to slam his head onto the wall.\n“…Sorry.”\n“Do-do not worry. It is my fault…”\n“No I shouldn’t have touched you.”\nThis would not have happened if Amane had not reached out to her.\n“Anyway, I’ll lend you my clothes. Go change into it and dry your clothes, or else you’ll catch a cold.”\n“U-understood…”\nHe could not let Mahiru remain drenched, so he hurried into his room, got a large T-shirt, and handed it to her. She stared intently at this shirt.\n“Ca-can’t this do?”\n“No-not that…I shall get changed then.”\nMahiru averted her eyes, and hurried into the washroom. Amane watched her back, and knelt down.\n(…I’m definitely hated now.)\nEven though Mahiru would have understood to some extent, she probably did not want Amane looking at her with such lecherous eyes. Even she would feel embarrassed and uncomfortable about him commenting on the feeling.\nMahiru wanted Amane to state his true thoughts, but he was too honest about it, and it would have repulsed her.\n(…Her impression of me’s ruined now.)\nHe should not have been honest to such extents, and reproached himself in regret, his forehead knocking into the table next to him. Then, he heard the clear sounds of the slippers on the floor, approaching him.\nIt appeared Mahiru was done changing. Amane turned towards her with his head hung low, and saw her glossy white legs.\nHe looked up unnervingly, and saw her in the T-shirt covering till half her thighs——he then stopped lifting his head, and averted his eyes.\n“Erm, why are you wearing only a T-shirt?”\n“This is what you gave…Amane-kun, your forehead’s really red. Did you hit something?”\nMahiru was wearing a one-piece dress before this. Having recalled that, Amane cursed his folly, and Mahiru knelt next to him, patting his forehead.\nShe continued her gesture, and Amane could not bring himself to look aside. He turned towards Mahiru, and found her wearing the no.1 clothing a male would want his girlfriend to wear (according to Amane’s findings)——the boyfriend’s shirt.\nLuckily, Amane was bigger, and his T-shirt was relatively larger. He chose a larger shirt for the petite Mahiru, and it was large enough cover her thighs.\nHowever, it was abnormally big on the slender Mahiru. The collar was just large enough on Amane, overly large on Mahiru, and the T-shirt was on the verge of falling from her shoulders.\nThe massive collar was showing her undergarments. His eyes spotted that faint green, and he experienced the so-called male instincts.\n“…It is red and swelling. What did you just…”\n“N-nothing, erm…just relieving some frustration.”\nHis frustration was relieved, but with Mahiru leaning towards him, a bigger frustration loomed. She was leaning forward, and the parts large enough to balance a bubble tea cup were partially exposed.\nFrustration,\nMahiru’s face too turned beetroot as she froze. Amane felt a little restless.\n“…Eh, I’m really sorry for that just now.”\n“Eh?”\n“E-erm, well…you felt disgusted, right?”\n“Di-disgusted…really?”\n“…By me looking at you like that.”\nAmane did not explain in detail, instead merely hinting. Mahiru widened her eyes once she heard that, and smiled, looking a little perturbed.\n“…You are mistaken, Amane-kun. I do not dislike that. I am just a little bashful…I am glad that you like it, A-Amane-kun.”\nShe lowered her long eyebrows, putting her hands upon the lumps. She looked adorable, and he had the urge to embrace her. However, her attire was a little worrisome, so he resisted the urge.\nMahiru blinked at Amane, giving a wry smile.\n“…Erm…it is, fine. Here…”\nShe spread her arms wide, welcoming him. He stared at her, the scales of balance in his heart greatly shaken, and when she suddenly looked a little disappointed, he hastily embraced her.\nThe cloth between them was a little thing, and Amane felt more softness than before, glancing aside and looking down.\nOnce he saw the lumps that easily passed the bubble tea challenge, he was embarrassed of his own actions.\nMahiru sensed his stare, and was a little embarrassed as she wryly put her hands behind his head, bringing him onto her chest.\n“…I do prefer the Amane-kun challenge to the milk tea challenge.”\nIt seemed Mahiru was smiling, but as Amane’s face was buried into her chest, he could not see her expression.\nThe only thing he understood that the longer he was embraced, the feelings inside his heart were harder to suppress.\nHe thought to himself that he should never let Mahiru do this the next time, but the fluffy feeling was…he decided to let himself enjoy this a little more, and enjoy Mahiru’s warmth.\nBy user ntttrung0701 on ln.hako.re:",

      "content": "“Ah.”\nA silvery bell-like voice rang behind him.\nIt was a sound Amane was recently familiar with. He was not at his apartment however; this was the snacks section of the nearby supermarket.\nThere were usually people there, but Amane never expected Mahiru to react to him, so he turned towards her awkwardly, seeing her standing there, wide-eyed.\nShe was holding a basket, which contained radish, tofu, chicken thigh and milk, ingredients for tonight’s dinner.\nLooking at this situation, it appeared she happened to encounter him at the snacks section.\n“Let me say this first. It’s a coincidence, I wasn’t stalking you.”\n“I know that. This is the closest supermarket here. I do understand this”\nHe preemptively stated, “Why do you think that?” and Mahiru groaned. She then looked towards the notebook in her hands.\nIt truly was the impeccable Mahiru’s style to write all her needs down.\nOnce she checked the contents on the cute floral patterned notebook, she looked away from the snacks corner, towards the seasonings corner on the opposite side.\n“Soy sauce and mirin,” she muttered with an adorable voice as she searched for home necessities. She was truly acting cute, but Amane found it incredulous.\n“The mirin’s here. Hey.”\n“Ah, that is not the mirin I want. Underaged people cannot buy that.”\n“This is considered alcohol?”\n“It is treated as sweet wine. The seasoning type cannot be drunk directly when salt is added, so underaged people can buy this.”\nHe wanted to pass the mirin to her, but she shook her head, and put the mirin seasoning into the basket instead.\nIt was the first time Amane, who hardly did any housework, heard of this. “Heh,” he answered as he saw her deft movements from behind.\nMahiru stared intently at the rack of soy sauces, paying close attention to the price labels, and muttered with a frown.\n“… Special discount limited only to 1 bottle per person…”\nIt appeared she wanted to buy another one, for she sighed with pity and looked towards him..\n“I’ll buy one, okay?”\n“Thank you for understanding me.”\nHe picked up the meaning in her words, and gave a wry smile as she held a bottle of soy sauce. Mahiru curled her lips into a satisfied smile.\n“… You’re unexpectedly frugal.”\n“Frugal, or I should say, save as much as I can. We should not be spending excessively.”\n“Sounds like a Japanese characteristic… but I guess that’s a given when we live off our parents’ money.”\nAmane too lived alone and relied on his parents.\nHe was born to a well-off family, and was able to live in such a clean, safe apartment. He also had ample living expenses and did not need to scrimp. Thus, he was really grateful for his parents. He had to pay for school expenses, and had to spend quite a bit on living expenses, so he would try to avoid pointless spending.\n“… I guess. We are still reliant after all, so it is very important to save.”\nMahiru responded tersely as she sorted the contents of her basket. Her cold voice was devoid of warmth.\nIt was scary hearing her tone shift to monotone, but when she lifted her head, her expression was as before.\nThe fleeting look of her dull eyes were no longer to be seen.\n“…Anyway, are you buying this?”\nMahiru tried to change the topic, it seemed, as she stared at the vacuum-packed rice and potato salad in the basket.\nWhile the portions he received from Mahiru were truly delicious, that quantity was insufficient for him. As usual, he would buy some rice for the main course and salad as side dishes.\n“For dinner.”\n“These are not healthy.”\n“Come on. I bought salad, see?”\n“But it is potato salad… how have you not ruined your body living like this…?”\n“You’re worrying too much.”\nYou should be eating more vegetables,\nso Mahiru narrowed her eyes as she exerted silent pressure on Amane, who turned aside and paid no heed.\nWhile they continued to talk, Amane finished paying and stored his items in the plastic bag. Mahiru in turn took out a recyclable bag and stored her items inside it.\nShe truly was a plebian Angel who cared for the environment.\nHowever, while she had put her items in, the quantity left him a little worried.\nThe milk, soy sauce and mirin seasoning totaled 4 liters, and while they were slightly different from water in terms of density, it was still 4kg. Furthermore, she had purchased some ingredients, especially the radish, which would be really heavy.\nShe did pack them all nicely and zipped it up, but it would be physically taxing for her to carry it back to the apartment.\nSo she bought this much seasoning and ingredients because of me.\nIt seemed she would cook more than usual and share some with him. All this while, Amanue had been receiving a portion’s worth of food. She said she had been cooking too much, but it appeared she had been deliberately cooking excess food recently.\nIt seemed Amane caused her much trouble. He would be worthless as a male to not do anything for her.\nOnce he saw that she was done zipping, Amane tried lifting it, and while it was not too heavy for him, it would be considerably taxing for a girl to carry a long distance.\nWhile Mahiru was really athletic, her physical strength was another matter. One could tell that beneath her clothes, her slender arms did not have much strength.\nAmane’s gesture had her caramel-colored eyes blinking.\nShe seemed grateful rather than shocked.\n“… I’m not stealing yours.”\n“I am not worrying about that… I can carry that much, at least?”\n“You’ll be cuter if you just accept this honestly, you know.”\n“You are making it sound like I am not cute.”\n“Compare how you act at school to how you treat me.”\nShe might have some self-awareness; she flinched a little.\nEveryone agreed that she was so cordial, kind and humble at school, but she acted nothing like that when it came to Amane.\nTo be precise, while she did treat Amane well, she was blunt towards him. She never cared for any courtesy when it came to him, and always said what was on her mind.\nIt was much better than lying, however, so Amane did not really mind.\nWhile Mahiru remained silent, Amane seized the opportunity to carry the recyclable bag chocked full of ingredients along with his and hurried towards the exit.\nThere seemed to be some frantic movements behind, but Amane paid no heed as he ignored their increasing distance, heading straight towards home.\nHe did not bother to slow down enough for her.\nThey were already together at the supermarket, and if anyone was to see them walking home side by side, things would get out of hand.\nFor them, this would be the ideal distance.\nSo Amane pretended not to have any relationship as he hurried on. “… Thank you very much,” a little whisper behind him echoed.",

      "content": "Amane was bad with all kinds of housework, the worst of which was cleaning up.\nHe could cook, if the definition of ‘cook’ was getting injured and willfully ignoring the appearance and taste.\nHe could cook, if he went with the idea that he could just heat it, and put it into his stomach; it would look and taste unappealing however,\nOf course, he did not want to cook or eat such things, and naturally would never attempt to do so.\nHe could at least wash clothes, for if he could not, he might not be able to live at all.\nWorst case scenario, there was a coin laundromat nearby, and he could simply dump his clothes in, add some detergent and water, and let it spin. He could handle his laundry.\nHowever, he was completely hopeless at cleaning up.\n“What do I do with this?”\nIt was the day off, and Amane, having been nagged at by Mahiru and Itsuki, finally decided to start cleaning, but he did not know where to start.\nHe knew it was his own fault, but there were too many things, resulting in him unsure how to begin.\nFor the time being, he washed his futon sheets and dried them.\nAnd then, he had no idea how to start cleaning.\nHis clothes and magazines were all over the place, and he practically had no place to step on.\nThe silver lining here was that since any food-related rubbish would smell foul, Amane would dispose of them promptly. Thus, the apartment did not have any oil stains or foul stenches. Well, the room was still in a mess.\nDespite that, the mess was the matter most troubling him.\nAnd while he sighed, there was a chime from the entrance.\n“Ah!” he blurted.\nAt his door would be the visitor he was familiar with, or rather, the blessing from Heaven, the courier-like existence who would leave after each delivery. She was a savior in his eyes.\nHe hurried towards the entrance, nearly slipping as there was no place to step foot on, and supported himself off the wall as he opened the door.\n“Sorry, I am here to retrieve the last tupperware…what are you doing?”\n“… Getting ready to clean up.”\nMahiru saw him on the verge of tumbling over and stared exasperatedly at his face.\n“Thought there was a loud sound.”\n“… I nearly fell.”\n“I guessed so. You have not started cleaning, no?”\n“Didn’t know where to start.”\n“I assumed as much.”\nIt is really difficult to start when it is so messy,\nso Mahiru noted bluntly as usual. Amane’s face twitched, but he could not deny it.\nIf he really argued with her until the very end, he really would have no idea how to start cleaning.\nBut how would he ask?\nHe wanted to ask her for tips on cleaning, but was she truly willing to provide… So he stared at Mahiru tentatively, and she looked behind him, towards the messy entrance.\nUwaah…\nShe looked towards the devastation behind him, her eyes basically screaming such. To her, it appeared the entrance was already a mess in itself.\n“Goodness…please allow me to clean the apartment completely.”\n“Huh?”\nAmane thought it would be brazen for him to ask Mahiru to help, so he merely intended to ask her for cleaning tips.\nBut he never expected Mahiru to offer her assistance.\n“It is unbearable to think my neighbor has such a dirty room.”\nHer words were always so blunt, so he was not angry. After all, she was telling the truth, and he had no room to refute.\n“And you are living alone without being capable of doing your housework? I suppose you spend your days with the optimistic mindset, thinking you will get used to it. Right now, you do not know how to do anything. How about you reflect a little on your lifestyle?”\nHe had nothing to say.\nHis mother had said it would be easy if he had done his housework studiously, but he always left it be, resulting in this situation. He too realized he reaped what he sowed.\n“Furthermore, this would not have happened if you had cleaned up daily. This is a result of your daily laziness.”\n“… ou’re right.”\nOne reason he was not angry despite Mahiru’s words was because she had been taking care of him, which he was indebted to her for. After all, she did correctly guess his past trains of thought and deeds.\nIt all ended up like this because he never took it seriously, thinking he could finish it later. He could only quietly nod away at what she said.\n“May I clean up this apartment?”\n“… Can I ask you to do so?”\n“Of course, since I suggested it. I shall begin preparations then. It is best if you lock away any personal items you wish to hide any personal items or valuables in the storeroom.”\n“You don’t have to worry about that.”\nWhile her words were blunt, she was very earnest in offering to help. He had no reason to worry about her stealing anything.\nAfter all, she, a busybody who always abided by common sense, could not possibly harm others.\n“… Are you not worried?”\n“You’re not the kind of person to do that anyway.”\n“Not that… are you not worried that I will see the things you will want to hide as a boy?”\n“Sorry about that, but I don’t have such stuff.”\n“Well, if you say so. I shall change my clothes and bring my cleaning tools over… I shall clean this apartment thoroughly.”\nMahiru shrugged and returned to her apartment. From behind, Amane watched her leave with a wry smile on his face.",

      "content": "Mahiru returned to Amane’s apartment in different clothes, a long white T-shirt and khaki cargo pants.\nThe T-shirt clinging to her body emphasized her defined, curvy body.\nShe tied her hair in a bun, revealing her pale nape, which left Amane a little uncomfortable.\nShe would usually wear a one piece dress or a skirt, so this was a new sight for him.\nHe always wondered if this boyish look would be suitable for Mahiru, but it seemed he was overthinking it.\nIt was then he thoroughly realized that beauties would look good in anything they wore.\nNevertheless, while this clothing looked easier to move in, it was also passable as casual wear. He wondered if she was fine with it getting dirty.\n“Are you fine with it getting dirty?”\n“I intend to dispose of it some time later. It is fine even if it is dirty.”\nSo Mahiru said as she looked towards the devastation that was Amane’s apartment, and sighed.\n“Just to say this, we are doing this thoroughly, understand?”\n“…Got it.”\n“If you do, let us hurry. I am not going to hold back, nor am I going to let you compromise.”\nIs that alright?\nMahiru implied silently. “Yes.” And Amane could only abide.\nThus began the cleaning operation launched by the Angel.\n“First, put the clothes into the laundry basket. Cleaning should go from top to bottom, but we need to sort that out if we want to use the vacuum cleaner. The floor is all covered. There are many clothes, so we need to separate them in batches. Also, split those that you have worn and those that you have not. We can wash them all, right?”\n“Ahh, I’ll do as you say…”\nAnd as expected, even though they had a vacuum cleaner, they had to start at the mess on the ground.\n“…You do not have any undergarments lying around, no?”\n“I do keep them in the closet at least.”\n“Good. We will deal with the clothing later. Even if we wash and dry them now, the dust will fly when we clean it up. There is insufficient space to dry. If you are not really in need of them, we can wash them once we are done cleaning.”\n“Yes.”\n“… The magazines can be discarded. It would be one thing if you are collecting them, but I am assuming not, given how they are all over the place. Cut out the pages you want to keep and deal with the rest. Tie them up and bring them to the waste collection area.”\nMahiru quickly got down to cleaning, instructing Amane to keep his clothes in the laundry basket as she stacked the magazines up one by one.\nShe had asked if he had any magazines he really wanted to keep, but Amane shook his head as he was not really bothered with that. Seeing that, Mahiru bundled the magazines with the vinyl string she had brought from her house.\n“Once you are done with the clothes, please come here and sort out the other items on the floor. Same goes for them. Sort out what you want and do not want, and discard the ones you do not want. Understood?”\n“… Oh.”\n“If you are unhappy about something, do say so.”\n“No, not exactly… just that it seems very orderly.”\n“We will not have enough time otherwise. I do not wish to see your room in a mess.”\n“You’re right.”\nIt was their day off, but time was limited. They could only work during the day, given that the noise of the vacuum cleaner would disturb their neighbors.\nAnd the work before the vacuuming was laborious as it was. Mahiru understood this and told him to hurry with the packing.\nHe was apologetic about having to trouble Mahiru this much, but thanks to her, there was more space for footing. He was truly impressed.\n“Instructor Shiina…”\n“Since you are addressing me as ‘instructor,’ hurry up and learn. I cannot determine which are your personal belongings, so please sort out those that you require.”\n“Yes sir.”\n“Please do not treat me like a boy.”\nThe grim-faced Angel retorted as she cleaned up with her nimble hands, sorting out the things she could.\nAmane himself had the urge to keep anything and everything, and thus he was grateful and envious that she could be so decisive.\nIt was another person’s room, but Mahiru really spared no efforts in cleaning up. She was truly acting like a homemaker.\nHer brisk movements made it seem that she could have easily cleaned this apartment herself.\nBut she might have been too hasty, for she did not notice her footing.\nWhat happened next was undoubtedly Amane’s fault, for Mahiru stepped on his clothes on the floor and lost her balance.\n“Ah!” Mahiru blurted, and at that instant, Amane instinctively slid towards the floor she was about to fall upon.\nHe felt a soft sensation and a sweet scent flooded his nose along with some smell of dust, probably caused when he hurried over.\nHis buttocks felt a blunt pain as he landed, but it was still bearable and he only grunted softly. At the same time, he could feel her weight boring upon him.\nHe was fortunate that he was able to stop her at that instant.\n“…… Fujimiya-san.”\nMahiru lifted her face, staring at him with a stunned look. She did not appear to be fuming, but it appeared she had many words on her mind.\n“Sorry for falling over. Well, we are cleaning the house because this could happen.”\n“My sincerest apologies. I’m reflecting about this… you hurt anywhere?”\n“I am fine. Thank you for catching me. I should be the one saying sorry.”\n“No, this is my fault…”\nShe had already been supplying him with dinner, and now she was helping him clean. It would be unspeakable for him if she was to be hurt because of this.\nOne might say he was so apologetic, he dared not look at her face.\nIf Mahiru was willing, he would have considered knotowing towards her, but it seemed she had no intention of blaming him for her falling over.\n“We are cleaning up to prevent this from happening, you know?”\n“I know. I’m really sorry.”\n“…No, you do not have to be so sorry. I came here to help after all.”\nShe seemed to panic as she looked up at him.\nHer eyes appeared uneasy while she clung onto him, and he found it very difficult to calm down.\nAmane, who had no luck with women, was already having a cardiac arrest at this distance…let alone with a pretty girl in close contact with him.\nNeither of them were in love with each other, but he found it really inappropriate.\nMahiru herself seemed not to have noticed her posture, so Amane gently grabbed her shoulders, splitting them apart, and stood up before the shame overtook his face.\n“… Shall we, continue?”\n“I guess.”\nLuckily, it appeared Mahiru did not notice Amane faltering, and she held his hand, standing up.\nHer face remained stoic like usual, not caring that they made contact.\nAmane himself was thinking that a girl like Mahiru would not be so bashful given that so many boys showered her with affection, brushing this matter aside.\nHe looked towards her with a wry smile, apologetic for having her help. So he motivated himself and got down to cleaning again.\n“… That shocked me.”\nCleaning was truly a hassle for him, given that he was unfamiliar with it.\nAnd thus, he never noticed her little whisper and the slightly reddened eyes hidden by her faint colored hair.",

      "content": "“… Fuuu, it’s finally clean.”\nThey spent an entire day cleaning up Amane’s house.\nFor several hours, they cleared the personal belongings on the floor, and then washed the clothes, wiped the lights, the windows, vacuumed the floor, and the sun was setting by the time they were done.\nThe sun was visible when Mahiru entered the house; this was sufficient proof of how long they toiled on this.\nBut it was this reason that Amane’s house looked pretty once again.\nThe floor was cleaned thoroughly, cleared of discarded items. The windows and sills were cleared of dust, and so were the lights, looking brighter than before.\nAmane’s room too was cleaned, so there was nothing scattered on the floor. Finally, he could comfortably rest in there.\n“We spent an entire day on this.”\n“Well, it’s that messy…”\n“All thanks to you.”\n“You’re right.”\nAmane could not lift his head towards the Angel/savior, and could only look towards Mahiru with respect (he wanted to kowtow, but she refused), given that she had helped him so much.\nMahiru, having spent her valuable day off on this, “Goodness gracious,” muttered so as she tied the trash bag.\nShe might have sounded brutal, but she did not look displeased, and instead looked accomplished. Nevertheless, she was a little lethargic, and that was to be expected given that she had toiled an entire day.\nHe could not allow her to make dinner after this.\nLeaving aside the issue of whether she would cook for him, he would feel sorry if he let her work in such a tired state.\n“I don’t want to go out and buy dinner now, so let’s order some pizza for dinner. I’ll pay for today, since I’ve taken much from you.”\n“Eh, but.”\n“If you don’t want to eat it with me, you can take a slice back to eat.”\nHe could not stop Mahiru if she did not want to eat with him, but he could let her bring some home.\nMore than wanting to eat with her, he wanted to thank her, so he was fine eating alone.\n“… Not that. I have never ordered pizza before though, so I am a little shocked.”\n“Eh, you haven’t?”\n“I have not ordered pizza before since I live alone… though I have made it myself.”\n“It’s amazing how you thought of making pizza yourself.”\nTypically, one would order pizza either as a take-out, or as a two for one.\nThere might be a mere few like Mahiru who would spend the effort to start over from the dough.\nSo this is the mindset of those who really can cook,\nAmane thought.\n“It’s normal to order a takeout. I often do it for myself. Wait, you’re not the type to go to a family restaurant alone?”\n“I have never been there once.”\n“It’s rare to hear that. I do go alone, especially when my parents are too lazy to do so. Do your parents dislike going out to eat?”\n“…Our housekeeper would cook for us.”\n“A nanny? Guess you’re loaded.”\nIt would be expected if she was a rich person.\nHer etiquette, clothing, and belongings looked posh.\nGiven how she had the refined vibe to her, it would not be strange to assume so.\nAnd once she heard Amane say so, she showed a faint smile,\n“Yes, relatively rich.”\nThe smile on her face was neither delighted nor proud, but self-deprecation than joy and pride. Amane started to regret saying too much when he saw that smile.\nHer response was muted when he mentioned about her parents, so it seemed she was on bad terms with them.\nIt seemed that this was not a matter she really wanted to talk about, so he had no intention of probing.\nEvery person had one or two things they would not want to mention or let others know. Not asking about certain things might be courtesy towards a person he was relatively unfamiliar with.\n“Well, just think of it as an experience. Here, choose what you want.”\nHe decided not to talk about her parents, and showed her the pizza advertisement instead.\nIt was the shop Amane frequented, the best-tasting of the delivery services he knew of in this area.\nIt certainly was not as good as one baked in a pizza kiln, but the toppings ranged from standard to kid specials. Surely, there would be some matching Mahiru’s tastes.\nSeizing the change in topic, Mahiru took the menu and quickly scanned her eyes over it.\nThe transparent-looking roasted tea colored eyes stared at the photos of various pizzas.\nThose eyes, always devoid of emotion, seemed to be sparkling with life.\n…Wait, is she actually looking forward to this?\nPerhaps he was thinking too much, but she appeared a little excited, for once she had a look at the menu, she pointed at a four-topping pizza typically found at parties, “This is what I want.” she said.\nMahiru peered over to him, seemingly hiding behind the menu, and once he agreed, her eyes began to glow.\nHe smiled wryly at her obviously elated face, and with a single hand, he dialed the number listed on the advertisement.\nAbout an hour later, the pizza arrived, and Mahiru quickly ate it.\nThere were four flavors, and she seemed to have trouble deciding which one to choose from, before she started with the bacon and sausages.\nNot unexpectedly, she showed a princess-like side as she chewed on the pizzas in small bites.\nShe was holding it in her hands, but there was some elegance to how she ate. It was likely she was raised to do so.\nBut at the same time, he found her as adorable as a little animal.\nShe narrowed her eyes at the stretching cheese strands, the relaxed cheeks of her smiling face looking strangely adorable.\nTypically, she looked really mature, poised even, but right now, she was acting her age.\nAnd as she munched down on the pizza in little bites, Amane had the urge to pat her on the head.\n“… What?”\n“Nothing. Just that you look like you’re enjoying this.”\n“Please do not stare at me.”\nBut her displeased frown was not cute in the slightest.\n“… Well, to say this, you aren’t cute at all.\n“That does not matter. After all, you will be uncomfortable with me acting like I would at school, no?”\n“Sorta. I’m more used to you being like this than at school.”\nHe never interacted with Mahiru at school, let alone talked to her.\nAll he could see was the flawless, genial, beautiful smile that everyone else saw.\nAnd in contrast, she was showing no heed to others this time.\nThis might have been the true Mahiru, and her gestures at school were simply her ‘going outside’ mode.\n“For me, this part of you right now isn’t that tiring.”\n“The un-cute part?”\n“Don’t be so vindictive…but well, I don’t know what you are thinking of at school.”\n“Mostly about dinner, and lessons.”\n“You’re still playing the fool?”\nAmane was implying that Mahiru was hiding something, but the latter merely took him literally.\nIt appeared she was not pretending, and she looked at him with a displeased look.\n“No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that I can’t see your heart, so like, I don’t know what you’re thinking at school, and you’re still unfriendly now, but it’s easier to interact when you can express your feelings honestly.”\n“… Is my behavior at school inappropriate?”\n“That’s how you deal with things, and I don’t think that’s bad. But you’re not tired?”\n“No. I have been like this since young.”\n“Guess it’s ingrained.”\nIf she was ingrained with that mentality since youth, her etiquette was understandable. However, this meant that she was consciously acting like ‘an ideal child’ and was doing so because she had no choice.\nBut he could not bring himself to ask more about such family details she had vaguely hinted at.\n“Well, it’s good to be able to relax though? I managed to relieve some of your stress.”\n“… I cannot relax when you are so hopeless.”\n“Sorry about that.”\nHe shrugged in an exaggerated manner, Mahiru giggled happily.",

      "content": "Ever since that cleanup, it seemed the wall between Amane and Mahiru had eroded just a little. The distance between them did not close much however,\nAt school, they were akin to strangers, and even after school, they would merely exchange a few words while sharing dinner.\nA few days ago, Amane was reminded to maintain the cleanliness of his house. She was harsh, but he understood very well she was a girl who loved to care for others.\nThanks to the timely reminder and cleaning advice she gave, Amane’s house remained clean.\n“Ooh, it looks a lot better.”\nOnce he heard the apartment was looking better, Itsuki came running over on the weekend. He could only marvel in amazement at the sight of this rejuvenated house.\n“Never thought it would become so clean, especially when it was so messy. I did help you clean up the last time, and not even two days later, it got dirty.”\n“Shut up.”\n“No, I don’t want to nag at you, but think about how long it has been since you last threw something all over the place.”\n“Don’t worry, it’s a new record. Two straight weeks.”\n“Can you please be ashamed that your new record is only two weeks?”\nYou don’t usually throw your stuff onto the floor.\nItsuki nagged, Amane frowned, but could not refuse Itsuki’s earnest pleas of common sense,\nIn fact, he was actually troubling Itsuki before Mahiru helped out, so he was unable to retort harshly.\nGrrr.\nAs Amane clamped up, Itsuki chirped happily.\n“But well, since it’s so clean, I want to bring Chii here.”\n“Don’t. Why do I have to see you two flirt with each other in my house?”\n“You don’t have to be so courteous.”\n“Don’t treat my house like a dating spot.”\nHow tragic was he for him to see his friend flirt around with his girlfriend?\nHaving seen what others called the idiot couple being all lovey-dovey, he hoped that they could show some consideration for him.\nHe could not laugh despite knowing Itsuki was joking, given that he had been seeing them every day.\nHe hoped they would do it at their own place.\n“Well, enough with the jokes. I guess it won’t be dirty now that it’s so clean, right?”\n“I’ve been dealing with it.”\n“So I say… whatever. It’s good to have the habit of putting back the things you took out though.”\n“Are you my mom…?”\n“Seriously, Amane, you have to start cleaning your house more often, you know~?”\n“That sounds disgusting, and also scarily, disgustingly similar to my mom.”\nAmane felt a chill up his spine when Itsuki made a falsetto impression of his mother.\nWhile Itsuki had never seen Amane’s mother, it was scary how much he resembled her.\nFurthermore, a boy faking a woman’s voice was really disgusting, and Amane really had the urge to stop Itsuki there and then.\nHe stuck his tongue out in a pretentiously repulsive gesture, and Itsuki kept laughing away.\n“So your mom’s like this, Amane? My mom’s pretty hands-off.”\n“Guess I’ll say that I envy you. My mom’s the type to keep talking.”\n“Just a good mother worried for her son, no?”\n“But the kid won’t become independent.…”\n“No, you’re being so terrible that your mom can’t leave you be.”\n“Shut up. She’s still being too much of a busybody to her son.”\nIt might have been because he was an only child, but Amane’s mother really cared for him.\nShe did not dote on him, but rather, she was the type to interfere with everything and worry about everything. While Amane himself did not hate it, it was a hassle dealing with her.\nShe said lots of things when he chose to stay alone near his high school, often dropping by to check on him. She was quite the hassle.\n“Well, that at least means that she really finds you important, right?”\n“This love is too heavy.”\n“Just give up. One day you’ll understand how precious that is.”\n“You’re the standard rebellious kid, and now you’re sounding so mature.”\n“Hahaha. Can’t do anything when it comes to Chii.”\nItsuki had quite a few disputes with his father because of his girlfriend, so these words really sounded unconvincing, but what he said did make some sense, so he listened to him..\nGuess he has his own problems to deal with after all,\nso Amane thought as he let out a long sigh. Itsuki himself remained optimistic, not looking weary in the slightest. “Those who dare get between Chii and me can get run over by horses.” He did say such scary stuff before.\n“Anyway, I’ll do something about my dad. You need to spend your days well Amane?”\nItsuki grinned, saying, “I know that without you telling me that.” Amane retorted with some frustration. He then realized Itsuki’s words were exactly the same as a certain person, and made a wry smile.\nBut Itsuki visited Amane’s house… not because he wanted to check on the latter’s living habits, but just to play games. The topic of the house soon ended, and they started playing.\nThey were supposed to be reviewing for the exams that were to be held the following week, but before they knew it, they were playing video games.\n“Hey, stop wasting healing items man. We might not have enough later.”\n“We’ll figure it out.”\n“No, not that, you haven’t increased your level. It’ll be problematic later…”\nWhile Amane was wondering how he should retort at the thrill-seeking Itsuki, the doorbell rang, creating an entirely different problem.\n“Hm? A visitor?”\nItsuki paused the game, showing the menu as he lifted his face.\nHe knew Amane hardly informed others of his address, and hardly any friend would visit. Even if there was, they would be stopped by the apartment block gates and press the speakers instead.\n“I don’t know. The neighbor maybe? Probably got some news on the notice board.”\n“I see.”\n“I’ll go check for a moment.”\nHe restrained his facial muscles from twitching as he tried to pull a fast one over Itsuki before hurrying towards the door.\nIt was fortunate that she did not call out after ringing the bell.\nHe opened the door without checking, opening a little slit just in case he was seen, sneaked out, and closed the door.\nAs expected, Mahiru was outside the door, and she blinked away upon seeing how Amane was being out of character. “Shhh.” he made this gesture with his index finger.\n“… Please be quiet. Itsuki’s in my house.”\n“Itsuki?”\n“My friend. He’s here to play.”\n“Ahh, I see.”\nShe understood why he was being so stealthy, nodded, and did not pursue the matter further. She handed the tupperware over to him, as usual.\nIt appeared she had been preparing this since morning. Inside was oden; it was the perfect dish for the soon-to-be chilly season.\nAmane accepted the tupperware graciously, letting out a sigh as he looked at Mahiru, who looked as though it was to be expected of herself.\n“…ERm, well, I’ve always been grateful of the care you showed me, but I never had the time to express it. Sorry.”\n“I am not doing so to be thanked by you…but it is impressive, your place is presentable enough to invite your friend.”\n“Do I have to prostrate and express my thanks?”\n“Not at all. Please do not.”\nStop making me look like a bad girl.’\nShe gave such a dumbfounded look, and Amane could only give a wry smile.\nHe really was indebted towards her, so he was somewhat serious with what he said. After being in her care for so long, even a dogeza might be insufficient.\nShe brought quite the ample portion of dinner, and he was sorry about being a freeloader. He intended to find a chance to talk about dinner money.\n“…Since your friend is here, I shall not disturb you for long. Please excuse me.”\n“…Thanks for all the help. I won’t tell Itsuki about you.”\n“Please do so.”\n“Well, even if I do, he’s not going to believe me.”\n“I guess.”\nAmane felt conflicted that she affirmed his statement so readily, yet looking from Itsuki’s perspective, he would have wondered if Amane was delirious if he said,\nShiina is actually cooking for me.\nAfter all, the Angel herself was a flower at an unattainable place.\nIt would be one thing if he was a talented, handsome guy, but it would have been impossible to assume a lazy, useless bum like him could have her cooking for him.\n“… May I ask you something?”\n“What is it?”\n“Since you cook for me every day, are you planning anything?”\nLabor cost money, and such free meals typically would be impossible. Amane himself would not have done so if he was in her shoes. While he had no expectation of a one-in-a-million chance that she liked him, his curiosity got the better of him.\nMahiru lifted her head a little as she pondered. “Just for self-satisfaction,” she said without changing expressions.\n“It is not difficult at all. It is easier for me to cook two servings instead of one, and I simply like to serve others.”\n“So you just like to cook?”\n“That may be one reason. I too feel relieved that you do not have any strange misunderstanding, just expressing what you think. I worry whenever I see what you eat, so I am doing so for self-satisfaction.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Of course. You do not have to worry about it. Do think of it as fortune falling from above.”\n“Fine, fine.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had no intention to talk further. “Please excuse me,” she bowed courteously and returned to her house.\n…Is that really the case?\nAmane did not think it would be enough reason for free dinner, so he muttered as he too returned to his house.\n“Who was that?”\n“Just a neighboring sharing some food. I’ll put it in the fridge. Don’t continue without me.”\n“Ah sorry, I finished off the boss.”\n“Damn you.”",

      "content": "The park Amane and Mahiru first met was along the road home.\nAmane’s apartment was more suited for fewer people, and it would be a little difficult to house a family. Thus, there were few children in his apartment block, and it seemed the other apartments nearby were the same.\nThus, the little park not too far away looked a little forlorn.\nIt was an empty place the children would not come to play at…and it was there that he spotted Mahiru on her way home.\n“What are you doing here?”\n“…Nothing.”\nMahiru was seated still on the bench, and narrowed her eyes once she spotted Amane.\nUnlike the last time, they were more familiar. Amane could comfortably talk to her, but her answer was terse.\nShe did not seem wary, and instead, it seemed she was unable to say something.\n“If it’s nothing, don’t just sit there looking helpless. What happened?”\n“… It is nothing…”\nWhile curious about how she appeared to be in a crisis, the latter did not say her reason.\nThere was a silent agreement that they would not get involved outside their apartments, but once he saw how troubled she was, he could not help but talk to her.\nMahiru might have hoped for him not to be a busybody.\nIt’s fine if she doesn’t want to talk about this,\nso he thought as he stared at her stiffened face, only to notice a few white strands on her blazer…to be precise, fur.\n“You got fur on your uniform. Did you play around with a dog or cat or something?”\n“Not at all. I just saved a cat that was unable to climb down a tree.”\n“This old cliche… ahh, I get it.”\n“Eh?”\n“Sit there, don’t move.”\nHe immediately understood why she was seated on the bench. He made a long sigh and left for a moment.\nMahiru would definitely stay still.\nOr rather, she could not move at all.\nShe’s always acting tough for strange reasons,\nso he sighed. He went to the nearest drugstore, bought a damp cloth and bandage. He then went over to the convenience store, and purchased ice typically reserved for coffee. He returned to Mahiru and found her at the same place.\n“Shiina, remove your tights.”\n“Huh?”\nMahiru glared at him icily once Amane stated so bluntly.\n“Eh, even if that’s your response… look, I’ll turn away so that I’m not looking at you. Just cover yourself with my blazer and remove your tights. Cool the painful area, and stick the wet cloth on it.”\nHe shook the grocery bag in his hand, indicating that he took no pleasure in seeing her remove her tights, but her face clearly froze.\nBullseye.\n“… How did you know?”\n“You removed one loafer, there’s a slight difference in size of your ankles, and you don’t want to stand up. It’s so cliche how you twisted your ankle while saving a cat.”\n“You talk too much.”\n“Yes yes yes. Now remove your tights. Stretch your leg out.”\nIt was obvious, but she never expected Amane to notice her injury, and grimaced away.\nShe, however, took the blazer and laid it over her knees, probably intending to do as told.\nAnd so Amane turned away from Mahiru, took the cup of ice from the convenience store, and poured water into it.\nHe sealed the opening, preventing water from leaking out, and took a towel from his bag, making an ice pack on the spot before he slowly turned around.\nAs told, Mahiru removed her tights, showing her bare legs.\nBare before him were the taut, soft, curvy legs devoid of useless fat, along with an unnatural swelling of the ankle.\n“Looks like it’s not too bad, but it’ll worsen if you move too much. Let’s ice the injury for the time being. You may find it a little cold. Once it’s not so painful, I’ll put the cloth on you. Just rest.”\n“… Thank you very much.”\n“Next time, just be honest and ask. I’m not helping you because I want you to owe me a favor.”\nAmane himself was hoping to at least repay some of the favors she showered him with.\nMahiru put her leg on the bench and cooled her ankle. There was no change in facial reaction, but she did not refuse Amane’s intent and merely sat still.\n“Is the pain subsiding?”\n“… A little better.”\n“I’ll get you a wet cloth… don’t get angry at me and think I’m a pervert or stalker okay?”\n“I will not say that to one I owe gratitude to.”\n“That’s good.”\nAmane once again emphasized that he had no impure thoughts as he knelt down to Mahiro’s position. He wrapped the damp cloth over Mahiru’s red swelling ankle.\nHe asked her how much pain she was in, and she said she could stand up and walk. But she remained seated to prevent the injury from worsening. At the very least, it was still a minor injury.\nOnce he sealed the damp cloth with the tape he bought, Amane found Mahiru looking down at him.\n“You are unexpectedly useful here.”\n“Well, I can treat some injuries here and there. Cooking’s impossible though.”\nHe shrugged in a joking manner, and she too giggled back.\nAll this while, she had maintained a stiff look. It would be great if she could relax because of this.\nSeeing her a little relaxed, Amane was relieved, and took out a pair of jersey pants from his bag.\n“Here.”\n“Yes?”\n“Don’t give me that look. Your legs are exposed, and you can’t wear your tights when there’s a damp cloth. I haven’t worn this. Relax.”\nA large bundle of tape was wrapped around her ankle, and it would be difficult for her to wear her tights, let alone unnatural. It was better if she wore his pants to shield against the cold and exposed upskirt.\nOnce she realized he did not mean anything else, she took his pants obediently.\nMahiru put on the pants, and Amane took back the blazer he had lent her. He removed the parka he was wearing, and handed it over to her.\n“Here, wear this.”\n“No, why?”\n“You want others to see me carrying you?”\nHe could not let an injured person walk back alone, and he did intend to carry her back.\nAfter all, they were returning to the same place. It would be efficient to carry her back, and beneficial to her injury.\n“Ah sorry, you mind carrying my bag? I can’t carry my bag if I carry you.”\n“Is there an option to not carry me?”\n“You twisted your ankle, so just do as I say. It’s one thing when there’s no one around, but since I’m here, just make use of my good legs.”\n“Legs?”\n“What? You want me to carry you in my arms? Carry you like a princess?”\n“Do you really have the strength to carry me home?”\n“Are you underestimating me? … Well, I don’t have confidence about that.”\nHe was fine with the idea of carrying Mahiru horizontally, but it would be taxing for him to walk her back to the apartment while carrying her. Also, it would garner too much attention, and thus, it would be better not to do so.\nHe knew Mahiru was making a little joke, and did not get angry just because he was belittled. He chuckled, seeing that she should be fine given how she was in the mood for such a joke.\n“Look, once you’re done, put on the hood and the bag. Also, I’ll carry your bag once I lift you up. I can’t do that right now.”\n“… Sorry.”\n“It’s fine. As a guy, I’m not so despicable as to leave an injured person behind and go home.”\nHe knelt down, turning his back on her, and she cautiously shifted her body onto him.\nEven through the parka and so many garments, Mahiru’s body felt so soft and delicate.\nHe made sure her hands were latched onto him tightly, but not strangling him, slowly stood up, and lifted her up.\nAs expected, she was really light.\nWhile she had always nagged at him about this and that, her body was so petite, one would worry if she ate well. Well, it might because she had a petite figure to begin with.\nHe could smell a faint sweet scent, and was starting to be overwhelmed with anxiety as she continued to latch onto him nervously. He did his best to remain steadfast though as he went home.\nThe sight of a person carrying someone on their back would attract lots of stares, but luckily for them, Mahiru’s face was hidden and lowered, and Amane did not attract much attention.\n“Alright, we’re here.”\nHe carried her to her entrance, and intended to only go this far as he heartily walked away.\nShe probably was not that injured since she was able to support herself off the wall and stand upright, her injury probably was not bad. Luckily, the following day would be their day off, so a few days of rest should be sufficient for her to recover and walk properly again.\n“You don’t have to worry about my dinner today, so just rest well. How about you live on some supplements too?”\n“No need. I do have some leftovers.”\n“That’s good. Bye then.”\nLuckily for him, he did not have to worry about her dinner. Also, it was great that she could walk on her own.\nAmane saw Mahiru go to her door and open it, and he too frisked for his key.\n“… Erm.”\n“Hm?”\nHe looked towards her as she spoke to him. She was clinging onto her bag firmly, timidly looking up at him.\nHer slightly faltering eyes left him a little skeptical. Her eyes wandered around, looking a little awkward, but it seemed she made up her mind as she stared intently at Amane.\n“… Thank you very much for today. You really helped me out.”\n“Ahh it’s fine. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care of yourself.”\nAmane himself would be troubled to be too concerned about Mahiru, so he merely brushed the matter aside. He saw her lower her head towards him, and unlocked his door.\nHe then remembered that his parka and pants were still with her, but assumed that she might return them in a few days, so he entered his apartment without looking back.",

      "content": "“Oy, are you now the energetic type who likes to wear shorts all year round?”\nAmane was feeling a little melancholic during Monday’s gym class. He was bad at that, and in this freezing weather, all he could do was wear a pair of jersey shorts.\nLong sleeve jerseys were commonplace in this season, but everything beneath Amane’s knees were exposed, and thus, he stood out.\n“Not at all. I just forgot.”\n“You’re an idi.”\n“Shut up.”\nHe did not meet Mahiru during the weekend, and did not retrieve his pants from her, thus the situation. But he could not say this to Itsuki, so he said he forgot.\nHe could take being laughed at, but when Itsuki gleefully slapped him on the back, he retaliated.\nItsuki groaned like usual, and Amane merely sighed as he looked aside.\nThey were at the grounds, but the girls were at the same area running their own activities , so they could spot the girls around. There were more people around, for there were two classes attending lessons together.\nThey were having a track meet or something and appeared to be waiting, so they were looking towards the boys.\n“Do your best, Kadowaki-kun!!”\nTypically, the boys and girls would have separate classes, but the girls’ presence had the boys riled up… the girls were looking towards the famous handsome boy, Amane’s classmate Yuuta Kadowaki.\nAmane never really talked to him, but he knew Yuuta was really popular, had good grades, and was the ace of the track team. Also, he was really popular with the girls.\nAmane felt that yeah, maybe the heavens would bless some with a few talents here and there, but the other boys did not take it well, a few of them scowling away.\n“Ohh ohh, he’s still as popular as ever.”\n“I guess.”\n“You’re not interested?”\n“We don’t really have anything going on. Even as classmates, we don’t talk. It’s fine.”\nAmane felt that Kadowaki was not hurting him in any way, and since they had nothing going on, he would care less about the latter.\nHe understood that he was in the minority, but he was not jealous of Kadowaki as the other boys in his class.\nNo matter how perfect Kadowaki might seem, he felt there was no point in feeling jealous.\n“You don’t seem very jealous there, Amane.”\n“What, you want me to say, gosh I’m so jealous of his popularity?”\n“That’s not like you.”\nAmane gave a snickering Itsuki a bored look and looked towards a smiling Kadowaki, still basking in the cheers of the girls.\nTo the boys, he had an ideal body, a sweet looking face, and truly resembled a prince. In fact, his nickname was the Prince, because there was no obvious flaw to him at first glance.\nHe waved his hand in the face of their passionate eyes and shrill voices, and Amane thought to himself that Yuuta was truly a socialite.\n“Well, the Prince’s really popular.”\n“Of course. I can’t make such a smile.”\n“The girls sure are getting excited.”\nItsuki himself had no apparent interest in the other girls, because he doted on his girlfriend Chitose dearly. He spoke as though it had nothing to do with him.\nChitose herself seemed to have no interest in Kadowaki, and Itsuki probably did not worry that Kadowaki would have such feelings for Chitose either.\nThis school has way too many embarrassing nicknames like Prince and Angel.\nSpeaking of the Angel Mahiru, Amane wondered if she was resting well.\nIt appeared she did not leave her house on the weekend and probably rested quietly. He did not know how her recovery was going.\nIt so happened that they were having gym class with Mahiru’s, so Amane scanned around, and spotted the outstanding, beautiful girl in a corner of the grounds, despite her being amongst the crowd.\nShe did not change into her gym clothes and was not among those attending the lessons. She was probably just watching.\nSo she sat there quietly, watching, and garnered the stares of quite a few boys.\nThose they were far apart, Amane and Mahiru’s eyes met, and he awkwardly looked aside, while her lips curved to form a faint smile.\nAnd because the smile was directed at Amane…or rather, the group of boys, “Was she smiling at me?” “Of course it’s me!” everyone else just exploded.\n“This is a good chance. I must showcase my good points for Shiina-san.”\n“Can’t have the Prince steal the show.”\nA simple smile triggered so many reactions, and one had to wonder if they were amazing or mere simpletons.\n“… They’re simple-minded.”\nItsuki echoed the same sentiments, and Amane chuckled.\n“Well, this affects our grades, so let’s do our best here.”\n“What, are you working hard after seeing the Angel too, Amane?”\n“No, I said I don’t have any interest in her.”\n“Well, of course, you don’t have interest in anything after all.”\nMy girlfriend’s great right?\nAs Itsuki began to boast about his girlfriend again, Amane brushed him off with a few affirmatives as he gave a wry smile in Mahiru’s direction.",

      "content": "“Thank you very much for the previous day. Here, the parka and pants you lent me.”\nMahiru delivered dinner in the tupperware as usual, along with a paper bag.\nHe could see something inside the bag…probably the parka and jersey pants he lent her the previous Friday. It seemed she had folded them neatly.\n“Hm, how’s your injury?”\n“It does not hurt anymore. I shall not do heavy exercise until I am completely healed.”\n“That’s fine. I remember you were sitting by the sidelines during gym class, right?”\n“Yes.”\nAs a precaution, Mahiru watched them from afar, which was the right thing to do. She did not seem to be in pain, but she was a little mindful of that ankle, so it probably was not healed completely.\nAmane nodded in agreement, and then recalled the smile back then.\n“But well, I guess the Angel’s really popular. One smile got all the boys enthusiastic.”\n“I told you not to call me that… I too was troubled. Was it something worth being that happy about?”\n“Well that’s what happens when a beauty smiles at them. Didn’t you see the girls squealing when Kadowaki waved at them?”\n“… Kadowaki… ahh, that really popular one?”\nMahiru looked disinterested, or rather, she had no interest at all. She could not remember him, and only recalled him after Amane’s explanation.\nHe was no Angel, but Kadowaki was a relatively famous boy in school, so it was surprising that she did not recognize him just from hearing his name.\n“You don’t have any interest in him?”\n“No. We are in different classes, and there are not very many chances to get along.”\n“Hmmm? But the other girls look interested in him, saying that he’s cool.”\n“He is good-looking after all. I have not spoken to him, and never got involved with him. He does not matter to me.”\n“You’re pretty blase about this.”\n“If people can fall for each other just because of looks, how have you not fallen for me?”\n“Oh, so now you realize how cute you are.”\nBut Mahiru’s words hold weight.\nA beautiful appearance was a reason to harbor feelings for someone, but not so much to like.\nHaving agreed that, he had to admit that Mahiru was a pretty girl, though he was a little surprised that she had some self awareness of that, and would actually agree with that sentiment.\n“There is always a commotion around me, and I will know even if I do not want to. Objectively, I understand that my looks are passable, and I have not been neglecting them.”\nMahiru said as a matter of fact, not a hint of arrogance in her voice.\nIn fact, she probably did everything she could to maintain her beauty.\nHer face itself was pretty, but she was not satisfied with just that.\nHer hair appeared to have a halo befitting her moniker as the Angel, and her skin was perfect and unblemished. She was always doing housework, but her hands did not coarsen, and she did trim her nails.\nShe had a fine, curvy body, and that was not something attainable within a single day.\n“You’re right, what you just flatly said is the truth, and I’m not uncomfortable with that. So, does that mean that you’re not embarrassed to be praised?”\n“I will find it annoying if others praise me too much.”\n“A beauty sure has her troubles.”\n“Along with the rewards that come with that, so it is not all bad.”\n“You’re making it sound like someone else’s business…”\n“What? Is it better for me to answer ‘that is not the case’ with a bashful look?”\n“No, I know it feels really awkward for you personally.”\n“I guess so. I do also feel it is pointless to put up such a facade with you.”\n“Yeah.”\nHe would feel gaudy if Mahiru was to correct her unfiltered manner of speech, and would feel some goosebumps if she treated him as she did to others at school. He hoped she would remain the way she currently was.\nHabit sure is scary. If she acted like the Angel at school here, he would find it surreal.\nThe Mahiru Amane knew of was the one present before him, not the one at school.\nBoth of them concluded it was for the better, so Amane looked towards the tupperware brought towards him.\nIt was a larger portion than usual, containing several dishes. It was more of an early-bird bento box than mere leftovers at this point.\n“Quite a lot today.”\n“You took care of me after all.”\n“Didn’t I tell you that you don’t have to worry about that… ooh, there’s a croquette.”\nOne should never underestimate the croquette.\nIt was often sold as a side dish and commonly sold, but it was tedious to make, and infamous for being the most tedious dish to cook at home.\nOne had to steam the potatoes, fry it, add ingredients like beef and onions, shape it, cool it, coat in batter and deep fry it… It was a bunch of ordinary, yet tedious steps.\nAmane, who could not cook, saw how much of a hassle when his mother made it.\nThus, his mother was often unwilling to do so whenever he asked of it.\n“I simply fried the frozen stuff together.”\n“So you made fried chicken too?”\n“Yes.”\nThe only fried food Amane ate while living alone were the side dishes from the shops, and he was really grateful to receive handmade ones.\nIf he were any greedier, he would have asked to eat it when it was fresh and crispy together with rice.\n“… I do want to eat something freshly made though.”\nOut of hygienic concerns, she would cool the food before putting them into the tupperware, and he had to reheat it before eating. An oven could replicate the crispiness, but it was nothing like the texture fresh out of the pan.\nOf course, that too would be delicious, but the best would be if he could eat it fresh out of the pan.\nHe merely blurted out his own wish without any other intent, but he might have been a little too loud, for Mahiru frowned.\n“You want me to enter your house?”\n“I didn’t say that. You shared food with me, and it’ll be too much if I ask you to do that.”\nTo shake off all suspicion, he shrugged and denied so. Mahiru put her palm under her chin, looking down.\nShe seemed to be thinking of something and did not look at Amane in the eyes.\n“… Half.”\n“Hm?”\n“If we each contribute half of the ingredients’ cost, I will consider cooking for you at your house.”\nMahiru finally said so, and the vigor in her words left Amane’s flabbergasted.\nIt was merely a joke…or a notion he accidentally blurted – but he was taken aback by how she seriously considered and agreed to it.\nTypically, would anyone cook in the house of a boy she was not well acquainted with?\nEven if that was more efficient, he was still of the opposite gender, and they were not on close terms. Surely she would be uneasy.\n“Look, I’m more than happy to share half the costs, since I’m getting too much from you… won’t you find it dangerous?”\n“If you do anything, I will crush you. Physically. Irreversibly.”\n“Woahh, you scare me.”\n“After all, even if I do not do so, you will not try anything. You do understand my position at school, no?”\n“If I do anything to you, I’ll be dead meat.”\nThere was a vast difference in popularity between Amane and Mahiru, the latter a weak girl at that. If Mahiru said that Amane did something to her, there was no doubt Amane would never be able to step foot into the school again.\nHe knew the consequences of social suicide.. After all, he was no fool, at least not one without restraint.\nOr rather, he himself had no such intent.\n“And also.”\n“And also?”\n“You do not seem interested in people like me.”\nThe conclusion, coupled with the serious face, had him smiling wryly.\n“What if I say you’re my type?”\n“You would have talked to me incessantly, and I would keep my distance.”\n“So I guess you recognize that.”\n“Well, I do know you are a safe person for now.”\n“Thanks for the compliment.”\nI guess that’s fine,’\nso he thought, but he really had no intention to do anything to Mahiru, so he did not deny it.\nNaturally, he would seize upon this opportunity for dinner fresh off the pan. While putting on the title of the harmless boy, he also gained the privilege to eat together with her.",

      "content": "When Mahiru agreed to cook at Amane’s house, she raised the following conditions.\n・Amane was to pay for half the ingredients, along with labor costs.\n・If they could not eat together, one was to notify the other a day in advance.\n・Both of them would have equal responsibility buying ingredients and cleaning up.\nThe labor costs in the first condition was suggested by Amane, who was sorry about taking advantage of Mahiru’s time. The latter compromised on this, and there was not much dispute about the rest, so they managed to work out these details.\nIt was established that she would be the one cooking, so there was nothing to worry about.\nOn the day after it was decided, Mahiru arrived early with a grocery bag in hand, or rather, two hands as she prepared to cook.\n“…It really is new and unused…”\n“Shut up.”\nA girl was dressed in an apron, standing in his house. Amane was practically living in a man’s romance, but for some reason, he was on tenterhooks.\nOne reason was that he was not used to that sight of Mahiru with a ponytail. The main reason however was that she pointed out that the kitchen was unused.\n“You have so many good things here, and you let them rust away.”\n“They won’t rust when you use them, right?”\n“That will be the outcome. These utensils are crying from being unused.”\n“So use your cooking skills to get them to stop crying.”\nI can’t do that,\nso he bluntly admitted, and she gave him a dumbfounded look. She might have expected that however, for she merely sighed and did not grumble much.\n“So do you have any seasoning lying around?”\n“Of course, you think I’m an idiot? No issues with storage and expiry here.”\n“Oh that is surprising.”\n“They’re still sealed, that’s why.”\nMost of the seasonings remained sealed in a cool, dark place, so he probably did not need to worry about that.\nHe bought them, but he never had the chance to use them. In fact, Amane never once touched them since he never actually used the kitchen. Truth be told, the seasonings were in good hands given that someone like Mahiru would be cooking.\n“That is not something to be proud about. If there is insufficient, I can just go back to take them.”\n“Thanks for the assist.”\n“I should be able to cook something with the basic seasonings. Ah, I decided on the menu myself. That is fine with you, right?”\n“I don’t really get all these things, so I’ll eat whatever there is. I’m not that picky either.”\n“I see. I shall get started then…please tell me where the seasonings are.”\n“In this basket.”\n“They really are unopened…”\nShe glanced aside at the seasonings, and frowned in bewilderment, but she quickly reverted back to her usual expression as Amane had briefed her beforehand, and she went to the faucet to wash her hands.\n“I shall get down to cook. You can wait in the living room or the bedroom.”\n“Sure. I’m useless here anyway.”\n“That was really honest from you. But it is true that I will find it difficult to cook with you walking around.”\n“You’re pretty blunt yourself.”\n“That is a fact though. I have no need to be discreet about that.”\nAs Mahiru had said, Amane would only be a hindrance, so he went straight to the living room, and watched her from behind as she cooked.\nAfter she washed her hands, Mahiru hurriedly got down to seasoning.\nHe did not know what she was about to make, but looking at the ingredients, it was probably a Japanese dish.\nHe was incredulous that he could invite Mahiru to his house to cook those delicious dishes, and wondered if he was dreaming. Once he saw her hair swaying in a ponytail however, he knew it was reality.\n…Why does it feel like I have a wife?\nThey did not have such feelings for each other, but the current situation seemed that she had made this place her home, and he could only imagine so.\nHe truly did not have an inkling of interest in Mahiru, but with such a pretty girl cooking in his house, the situation would have caused his thoughts to run wild.\nAs expected, whether he had feelings for her or not, the sight of a cute girl being willing to cook for him caused his heart to throb a little.\n“…You are not thinking of something weird now, are you?”\n“Don’t make any wild guesses.”\nShe asked without looking back, and his face twitched as a result, but as she did not look back, his ruse was not blown.\nShe’s a sharp one\n, so he marveled, a shiver ran up his spine as his still innocent heart of a man watched her from behind.",

      "content": "An hour or so later, dishes started to appear on the table.\nMahiru decided the dishes on this day, and they were all Japanese foods favoring her preference for healthier food.\n“These utensils and seasonings are somewhat useful, and I do not have to take much. I should be able to make more exquisite dishes starting tomorrow.”\n“Well I’m grateful that you’re willing to cook for me.”\nMahiru was unsure of how many utensils and seasonings she could use, so the dishes were relatively simple. Nevertheless, they were colorfully vibrant and well plated.\nThere was steamed fish, vegetables with toppings, omelettes with miso, and various Japanese dishes laid out that he would not have dreamed of making.\nAmane himself was not really a picky eater, but he liked Japanese food. Once he saw how apologetic she was, he had the urge to blurt that this was what he wanted.\n“…These look really good.”\n“Thank you for the compliments. Let us eat before it gets cold.”\nMahiru said as she sat on the chair. Amane then took the chair opposite her.\nThe dining table for one was pretty small, and the duo were seated very close.\nLuckily, he had two spare chairs for guests, but there was something indescribable about a pretty girl seated before him.\nOnce he started eating however, Mahiru’s beauty did not matter.\nItadakimasu,\nso he said, and first tried some miso soup.\nThe moment his lips touched the soup, he savored the miso and the fish stock in his mouth, the tastes spreading upon the tongue along with the fragrance.\nIt was a gentle taste different from instant miso soup, and was definitely achieved after much effort and deliberation.\nThe miso was not too rich, and the taste of the fish stock remained even with the saltiness.\nThe first taste was a little mild, probably because Mahiru considered it would be eaten with other dishes. Only after one drank the soup completely would he find it sufficiently concentrated.\nMore than lacking, it was a relieving taste that piqued his appetite for rice and other dishes.\n“It’s delicious.”\n“Thank you very much.”\nHe honestly admitted his feelings, and she was relieved, narrowing her eyes.\nWhile he had been praising her for her dishes, she might be nervous about him stating his thoughts directly to her.\nMahiru, who had been worried about Amane’s reaction, started eating, and the latter too reached for the chopsticks.\nAfter tasting all the dishes on the table, he found Mahiru’s cooking to be really palatable.\nThe steamed fish was really delicious, while preserving the moisture in the flesh.\nMoisture would be lost if she heated it for too long, wanting to get the flavor. It would have made the fish too dry, but the steamed fish was really tender and smooth.\nThe omelette had the flavor he really liked.\nLured by the bright yellow color, he took a bit, and tasted the gentle fish stock flavor.\nThere were some who liked their omelette sweet, someone who liked it salty, but the one here was made from fish stock, a little sweet.\nThe faint, soft sweetness might have been honey.\nNot a lot was added, it seemed, but the lingering sweetness added to the richness of the flavor.\nOf course, Amane did not dislike either sweet or salty omelettes.\nHowever, he loved those with stock, with a little sweetness, and the perfect amount of seasoning. He was so moved that he was able to eat such an ideal omelette.\nDelicious,\nso he muttered to himself, talking another bite.\nThe fire control was perfect. He slowly chewed on the soft omelette with the fish stock, savoring flavor.\nDefinitely better than my mom’s,\nso he quietly thought to himself these insolent things to his mother as he chowed down. Then, he noticed Mahiru staring at him intently.\n“…Looks like you are enjoying it.”\n“It’s delicious after all. I should be grateful for good food.”\n“Yes, that is true.”\n“And well, it’s better to eat with a honest look than just scowling away. We’re both happy here, right?”\nEven though the food may be delicious, the cook would feel uneasy and curious if one did not express his feelings honestly. Sometimes, saying it was delicious with a frown would leave the chef wondering he was sincere.\nMore importantly, it was better for both of them to express their feelings on their faces. The one thanking and the one being thanked do like to be in a good mood after all.\n“…I guess so.”\nMahiru seemed to have accepted Amane’s explanation as she showed a little smile.\nThe gentle smile seemingly expressed relief, and she was so adorable, he found his mind space out for a moment.\n“Fujimiya-san?”\n“Ah…no, it’s nothing.”\nHe was mesmerized by her…but naturally, he could not say this. He suppressed the rising shame within him as he continued eating, not wanting to be found out.\n“…Gochisousama”\n“Glad that you like it.”\nAmane finished the food on the table, indicating he was full, and Mahiru tersely answered.\nNevertheless, she looked calm, probably elated that Amane finished the food completely, not leaving a grain of rice.\n“It’s great.”\n“I can tell from that.”\n“Better than my mom’s.”\n“I think it is taboo to compare a girl’s cooking to one’s mother.”\n“Only when I’m trying to insult, you know? Anyway, are you curious about that?”\n“Not at all.”\n“That’s fine then. It’s a fact that it’s delicious.”\nMahiru’s cooking skills were not honed simply with some experience.\nAmane’s mother had more cooking experience, but she had a different taste palette, and was blase about it, so there was no way she could have fine tuned the taste like Mahiru did.\nHis father might even be better than his mother, let alone her.\n“…Well I think I’m very fortunate here. I do get to eat it every day after all.”\n“Only when both of us have nothing else going on.”\n“…Are we seriously okay with eating together every day?”\n“I would have suggested so if that is not the case.”\n“Well, that’s true.”\nHe knew very well that a straightforward person like Mahiru would not have suggested so if she disliked it, but despite that, he was wondering if this was fine.\nHe paid for half the ingredients, along with labor costs, but he was worried that it would be too taxing on Mahiru.\n“…Do you normally cook for guys you don’t like?”\n“You are living too unhealthily. Also, I do enjoy cooking, and I do not dislike seeing you enjoy the food.”\n“But,”\n“If you are still concerned about that, I do not actually have to cook for you?”\n“No please cook for me thank you very much.”\nHe instinctively answered, and it showed how much her cooking was a necessity, something he liked.\nFor him, getting Mahiru’s cooking was a matter of life and death.\nHe had some awareness of his own stomach, but the problem was that her cooking was too delicious. It was likely that if he went back to eating side dishes, every day would seem bland, and that scared him.\nOnce she heard his instant answer that was easy to understand, Mahiru showed a wry smile.\n“Please accept this.”\n“…Oh.”\nAmane had to sigh with elation, anticipation and guilt, thinking about how the days of eating together with this great merciful Angel would continue.",

      "content": "“Amane～, how is it?”\nThe term end exams finally ended, and the students were finally liberated from the hellish tests, huddled with more enthusiasm in a few groups in the classroom.\nAmane and Itsuki were relieved as their exams too ended, appraising their performances this time.\n“Hm? Normal, not too bad.”\nAmane naturally responded to that question, but there really was nothing much to say. The questions were all within the testing scope, and it was not too difficult if he had revised properly.\nHe did not feel any different writing this year, and had no thoughts in particular.\nWhile Amane was one who hated the hassle, he would not slack in his revision.\nHe understood most of the lessons, and could perform as usual during exams. He might have difficulty getting full marks, he could get at least 80-90%.\n“You’re probably going to be in the top 30…intelligent, aren’t you.”\n“Just revise daily.”\n“You’re boasting about what you do daily?”\n“I don’t want to hear it from you when you’re being all lovey-dovey and not studying.”\nThe difference between Amane and Itsuki was not in brains, but because the latter had been spending too much time on his girlfriend Chitose.\nItsuki himself was no fool, and could have gotten a high ranking if he applied himself. Unfortunately, he prioritized most of his time on Chitose, and was ranked lower than Amane.\n“…A girlfriend’s nice though?”\n“Yes yes yes.”\n“Say Amane, you should look for one.”\n“I guess men have shed tears of blood wanting girlfriends.”\nThere were hordes of people wanting partners, and to certain people, Itsuki’s careless words might have been infuriating.\nAmane did not intend to be angry, and at this point, he had no desire for a lover, so he merely intended to listen.\n“Anyway, how do I go about asking for a girlfriend?”\n“A double date.”\n“So am I supposed to be dazzled along with my imaginary girlfriend?”\n“Then show off to us!”\n“You think I have the personality for that?”\n“…Impossible huh?”\n“Of course.”\nAmane too had self-awareness of his own bland personality.\nHe was one to avoid hassles as much as possible, and was overly honest. Some might find him aloof, and would have a poor impression on him. It was impossible for such a personality to find a lover.\nAnd if he somehow got a girlfriend, the relationship between them would have been really bland. At the very least, it would not be as eyecatching as Itsuki’s.\n“No but, Amane, you should find someone you like. Anyway, the girls will have a different view of you if you cut away your bangs, look a little more refreshed, and straighten your back.”\nAmane felt he had an accurate opinion of himself. He was not super handsome like Kadowaki, or the fine cool looking type like Itsuki, but he was not exactly ugly.\nIf he had dolled himself a little, and watched his habits, he would be no inferior to a typical high school boy.\nBut even if he did doll himself up, Amane was not the type to simply approach others.\n“Those that latch to you just because of appearances aren’t really the loyal type.”\n“You say that, but if she shows no interest in you, you can’t understand her personality, right?”\n“…Even then, I’m not in the mood to look for a girlfriend.”\nAnd even if he did, her illusion would be broken seeing his daily life.\nAmane was a human with zero ability to live independently, and was callous to others. Even he would grimace to himself, thinking that he would want to meet a girl who would be attracted to him.\nAfter all, he hated interacting with others, his personality was unsuited for this, and he had no thoughts of getting one.\nWith Mahiru cooking at his house, it would be a tragedy if he somehow had a girlfriend. He had no intention of getting one, and was not worried by that, but that one reason alone was dissuading him from doing so.\nAt this point, his priority was ‘Mahiru’s cooking ＞ getting a girlfriend’, and that would not change easily.\n“You really are boring, aren’t you…want Chii to introduce some of her friends?”\n“Don’t be a busybody. Most of Chitose’s friends are noisy, and just having one as a girlfriend is enough of a headache.”\n“You’re gloomy after all, Amane.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Well, if you say so, I’ll leave it be for now. But isn’t it unbearable not to have a girlfriend, just spending your time alone during this wonderful high school life?”\n“No need, and it sounds troublesome.”\nWhat do you think school life is about?\nHe did not exactly have such a thought, but a girlfriend was not entirely a necessity, and he had no thought to find one.\nBesides, it was not easy to find one, and not easy to fall in love.\n“…That’s a pity.”\n“Yes yes.”\n“But well, you’ll change when you have someone you like, Amane?”\n“Where’s that self confidence coming from?”\n“It’s because you’re such a person that you’ll end up doting on your girlfriend like a kitten.”\n“Whatever you say.”\nHe felt that he definitely would not become such a sickening sweetheart, and could not imagine himself in such a situation, so he brushed Itsuki’s words aside as he went away.\nItsuki in turn stared at Amane dumbfoundedly…and looking aside, he seemed relaxed.\n“Ikkun, you going homeー?”\n“Ohh, Chii?”\nIt so happened that Chitose popped by, and both of them seemed to have agreed to return home together. Amane’s conversation with Itsuki was merely for the latter to kill time.\nSo he turned around, and found a tomboyish girl with bright reddish brown medium length hair, beaming as she waved at them, or rather, Itsuki.\nThe lively vibe and hearty smile was a little too dazzling for Amane. As befitting her appearance, she was friendly, lively, and was always the type to cause a ruckus no matter good or bad. She had a different personality from Mahiru.\nShe ran over to them, grinning.\nAmane really hoped that she would not talk to them, because whenever she showed up, he would get bullied.\n“Say, Chii, don’t you think Amane’s the type to dote on a lover?”\n“Enough with that.”\n“Eh, what? Amane has a lover?”\n“No.”\n“Ehhhー, whatー. I would have wanted to get along with her.”\nTch, so she clicked her tongue, looking disappointed.\n“That getting along of yours is overaggressive skinship. Even I would feel sad for my imaginary girlfriend if I have one.”\n“Eh, so you have an imaginary girlfriend?”\n“I said if I have one, okay!?”\n“Just joking~”\n“It’s tiring dealing with you…”\n“It’s because you lack stamina, Amane.”\n“Even if I have, it’ll be worn out by you…”\nMore so than physical stamina, he felt his mind would be tired instead.\nAmane typically would not speak to anyone other than those he was familiar with, and would rather kept a low profile, and lived a listless school life. It would be really difficult for him to talk to a hyperactive person like Chitose.\nDespite the aloof reply, Chitose did not mind at all, “You aren’t looking good.” so she said to a tired looking Amane, beaming happily.\n“Hurry up and get used to it.” Itsuki too randomly tossed in this advice, and all Amane could do was to make a long, tired sigh.\n“…What are you doing??”\nAmane returned home, had some of Mahiru’s homecooked food, and after washing the dishes, he found Mahiru laying out the exam papers on the living room table.\nWashing dishes was a rotational task for them, but Amane took the chance to wash them first, not wanting to add more to Mahiru’s workload, and so Mahiru spent her time in his living room. She said that if she left it all to Amane and returned home, she would feel a little sorry.\n“Checking the answers.”\n“Well, I can see that.”\nShe appeared to be going through the answers, checking the textbooks, seeing if she did make any mistakes.\n“So how is it?”\n“If I did not write the wrong answers, full marks.”\n“To be expected of you.”\nHer reply remained dull as she mentioned that she had full marks, and Amane too showed no extreme reaction.\nThe lack of surprise on Amane’s part was because Mahiru was always first in the year for their school grades.\nHe felt that Mahiru could have done so, and thought that she would get nothing less than full marks to begin with.\n“I do not hate studying to begin with. After all, I have studied through everything that is to be taught a year ago, so all I need to do is revision.”\n“Wooahh, as to be expected of you…”\n“Are you not good at your studies too, Fujimiya-san?”\n“So you know my grades?”\n“I have some impression when you were listed on the rankings.”\nIt appeared she had already known about him somewhat before he first talked to her.\nHe had assumed those who were not in the single digit ranks were worthy of her attention, but she mentioned his previous ranking, so it appeared she was paying attention.\nAmane would spend some effort in studying not because of a serious thought like…a student’s duty is to study. It was a condition his family gave.\n“Well, it’s the condition for me to live alone. Maintain my grades.”\nWhen he was allowed to live alone, he was told not to let his grades slip.\nThere was also the condition of him half to return home once every half year, but that could be arranged over a long vacation, so his family would not meddle if he maintained his grades.\n“I’m just working hard enough for them not to cause me trouble, but I can’t best you. You really work hard.”\n“…It is important to work hard.”\nMahiru muttered, looking down,\nThe bangs covered her expression, obscuring it, but surely she was not happy in the slightest.\nNevertheless, she quickly lifted her head, regaining her usual expression, so he missed out on the opportunity to point this out.\nAnd even if he did have the opportunity, he would not have asked. She seemed to be enduring pain after all.\nFrom time to time, Mahiru would show such an expression.\nShe never would say why she was feeling so painful, so disgusted, but it seemed she was bound by certain things, struggling in them.\nIt was not hard to imagine the cause of it being her family environment.\nThus, it was inappropriate for him to interject.\nHe knew very well it was an area he as an outsider should not interfere with, so he kept the distance as her neighbor all this while.\nAmane too had things he did not want others to talk about. He too often sensed that outside interference was really a rude thing, and found himself more grateful when others pretended not to notice.\nMahiru did her best to hide the emotions she had, “I shall be leaving now.” She said with her usual chirp, and then kept her textbooks and question papers into the bag.\nHe did not intend to stop her, “I see” and answered tersely as he looked towards her while she did so.\nShe was done packing all the things she took out, and stood up from where she was seated when Amane noticed there was something not belonging to himself behind an empty mug.\nHe reached his hand over, and found a plastic case containing the student ID, which every student would have.\nIt appeared she had taken it out along with her textbooks, and forgot to pack it back.\nHe scanned her face along with her name, student number, birthday and blood type, simple information, and called out to her right when she was wearing her shoes at the door, about to return back.\n“You forgot this.”\n“Ahh, sorry to make you bring it to me. Good night then.”\n“Good night.”\nShe bowed courteously, and left his apartment. As he watched her leave, he gently sighed.\nHe recalled the full date written on the student ID…especially the month and day, and put his hand on his forehead.\n“…Four days later?”\nIf he had not seen her student ID, he would never have known about Mahiru’s birthday.\nIf only I had known earlier,\nso he sighed again.",

      "content": "“So, you have something you want?”\nThe next day, Amane took the opportunity to raise this issue to Mahiru over dinner.\nHe decided to give her a present, a birthday present per se, but he did not really mean anything, and just wanted to repay her favors.\nBut that would have sounded really suspicious.\nEven he found his question to be indelicate, brutish even, and started to regret it. But Mahiru stared at him in surprise.\n“Why ask this out of a sudden?”\n“Well, it looks like you have nothing you want, so I’m just asking because I’m curious.”\n“That is still too sudden…”\nHe felt he could have done better trying to misdirect her, but he could not take back the words he had said.\nLuckily or not, it appeared Mahiru did not notice it was about her birthday.\nUltimately, she felt he could not have known about his birthday, and never thought about that.\n“I see. So what do I need now…r what I want?”\n“What do you want?”\n“A whetstone.”\n“…Whetstone?”\nHe asked again without thinking, for the answer was completely beyond his expectations.\nOr rather, nobody would have expected a high school girl to want such a thing.\nTypically, they would have wanted cosmetics, accessories, bags, and such stuff. Amane could not imagine that she would have asked for a tool to sharpen metals.\n“Yes, a whetstone. I do have a few of them, but I do wish for a finer polishing whetstone.”\n“Hey, you’re a high school girl now.”\n“Please do not ask of me to be an ordinary high school girl.”\nHer words left Amane unable to retort.\nNo matter how lightly they put it, Mahiru truly could not be called an ordinary high school girl.\nShe was already famous as the Angel in school, equipped with brains and brains, perfectly capable of housework and cooking.\nHer taking care of Amane, who was completely hopeless at housework, would have one assuming she was a girl already married off.\nBut who would have imagined her wanting a whetstone?\nIt appeared Mahiru would be the only high school girl who would have wanted a whetstone.\n“You’re not buying for yourself?”\n“Not that I cannot, but I do not often have the chance to, and it is relatively pricey, so I have not. Also, I have a few polishing whetstone, so I am in no real need for them.”\nAs she mentioned how she had a few with her, he really could not imagine how she would be in the future.\n“…We have a high school girl sharpening her chopper here.”\n“There are though.”\n“Even if there are, you’re the only one I know of, never mind someone who wants to have a whetstone.”\n“Sounds like a rare thing. Not bad.”\n“What do you mean, not bad…”\nIt was really rare to see a girl with such likes, and so he did not know what she wanted.\nAmane himself was at his wits end, and Mahiru tilted her head incredulously.\n“Say, Itsuki.”\nAs he did not know what kinds of things Mahiru wanted, he could only go with his last resort, to ask Itsuki.\nHe had anticipated that since Itsuki had a girlfriend like Chitose, he would have an inkling of a girl’s thought process, a rough gauge of what a typical girl would like.\nHe did not know if Mahiru was ordinary, but he deduced that at the very least, Mahiru would not hate anything a girl would like.\n“What?”\n“What present did you give Chitose?”\nHe thought it should be fine if he asked what Itsuki gave, asking so, but the latter gave him an astounded look.\n“Eh, you want to give a present to a girl you like?”\n“You think I’m the type to do that?”\n“Nope.”\n“See?”\n“So why do you ask?”\n“Someone I know has a birthday. Just for reference.”\nHe would have taken this reference to the next level, and go off to buy one, but he did not want to say that.\n“Uh~ huh. The best thing would be something she likes. Anyway, you usually should be investigating this. This is the trick to keeping a great relationship.”\n“I said she’s not my girlfriend.”\nAmane could imagine how dangerous it would be if Mahiru was his girlfriend, in various ways (mostly the killing intent around him however), and was terrified by that notion.\nIt was true that he felt at ease being with her, but these two were simply together, with no desire to get attached. It was not love at all.\nWhile he certainly found her cute, he did not intend for the relationship to end up like that. Such was the feeling he had for Mahiru.\n“What she wants…what if I don’t know?”\n“Got to look at how close you are to her. If you’re on good terms, some accessories should be fine, but if you’re not that close, a few small items or consumables; she should be happy with flowers, but sometimes that makes things complicated.”\n“…You’re really well versed in that.”\n“I learned my lesson after all.”\nInitially, Itsuki and Chitose were not the lovey-dovey couple they became. It appeared they got closer slowly during middle school. Amane was in a different middle school from them, so he did not know the details, but it seemed they went through lots of hardships before they started dating. Even at this point, he heard rumors of their past.\nItsuki must have brooded quite a bit choosing a present for Chitose, so the choices he raised might have been made after much deliberation.\n“Ah, some hand cream should be fine.”\n“Hand cream?”\nThe unexpected choice had Amane pondering. With a gleeful look, Itsuki explained.\n“It works for whatever age groups. Students use textbooks and notebooks every day for classes, and their hands dry easily; working adults too get their hands dry typing in an aircon room; housewives usually soak their hands in water, and their hands get coarse easily. It’s really usable as a present.”\n“Hmm…it’s disgusting how much you know.”\n“Well you’re the one asking.”\nPak,\nso Amane was slapped in the back, but they merely laughed it off, for it was a joke.\nHand cream?\nIt was true this probably would not trouble her.\nAmane had made it his duty to wash the dishes after dinner, but Mahiru would surely be washing things in her house. Her hands would surely turn coarse.\nIt was certain, looking at her silky hands, that she often took care of them. In that case, buying such skincare products should be fine.\n“Well, I take that in mind.”\n“Go ask Chii later. Those of the same gender might have a different idea.”\n“……Ehhh.”\n“It’s about time you get used to her already, okay?”\nHe did not hate her, of course, but he found Chitose to be the type he could not handle, and was unenthusiastic about the prospect. Itsuki merely smiled away, patting Amane on the back.",

      "content": "Once he was done asking Itsuki and Chitose for advice, Amane finally chose the present, and on Mahiru’s birthday, he looked at her back, feeling really tense.\nHis payment to Chitose was the special crepe from the shop before the station (the winter limited berry berry special), and having convinced her to buy something else, he added that to his present…but at this point, he was wondering how to hand it over to Mahiru.\nThe one who was supposed to celebrate her birthday was making dinner as usual.\nHe did not know what the menu was, but it seemed she was making Japanese food. She was acting naturally as usual, nothing too different about her.\nHe could not sense any birthday vibe from her. The way she acted so calmly, one would wonder if she remembered it.\nEven after dinner was served, nothing changed. They did converse over dinner, but ate as normal.\nHe really did not know when he should give her the present, so he looked towards the paper bag with the present hidden behind the sofa, frowning.\nAfter dinner was over, he cleaned the table, and returned to the living room, finding Mahiru at the two seater sofa. It seemed she brought a book here.\nEven when reading a book, she was pretty like a painting. Truly she befitted her moniker of Angel.\nHe was wondering if he should sit next to her…but he could not simply remain tentative. So he raised the bag placed there, and sat next to her.\nShe suddenly lifted her head.\nShe probably noticed his presence and the ruffling of the paper bag, and her caramel-colored eyes looked towards him, and then towards the paper bag he was holding.\nShe seemed a little confused. It appeared that at this point, she had yet to notice it was her birthday.\n“Here. have it.”\nAmane nudged the bag onto Mahiru’s knees, leaving her all the more flabbergasted.\n“What is this?”\n“Isn’t it your birthday?”\n“It is…but how did you know? I do not remember mentioning it to anyone else.”\nShe had a wary glint in her eyes, “You left your student ID on the table the last time”, but once she heard that, she might have accepted this explanation, and reverted back to her usual look.\n“You do not have to worry. I do not celebrate my birthday after all.”\nAmane might not have mistaken the sudden cold, callous voice from her.\nLooking at her eyes, it appeared the word birthday itself was a taboo to her.\nI see,\nso he thought.\nEven though it was her birthday, she had no change in attitude not because she did not remember it.\nShe probably forgot about it because it was troublesome to her, probably.\nIf not, there was no way she would have used that tone.\n“Ah I see. Just think of it as thanks for the daily stuff. I just wanted to repay you somehow.”\nSo he handed the present to her, with the rationale being that, fine, you don’t have to celebrate your birthday, but a gift for your usual care. Take this as my thanks, and not a birthday.\nHe ate such delicious food every day, and she even helped him clean up from time to time. These were trivial things, but she really took care of him. Even if it was a small thing, Amane wanted to repay Mahiru.\nWhile he easily accepted her rationale, he insisted on giving her the present, which left her somewhat confused. So she frowned a little, receiving the present.\nShe looked towards the item in the bag that was wrapped in paper.\n“…May I open it now?”\n“Yeah.”\nHe nodded, and Mahiru nervously reached her hand into the bag, pulling the box out. She carefully peeled the wrapping paper, and undid the ribbon.\nAmane himself felt extremely nervous to have someone else open his present before him.\nInside it contained the hand cream Itsuki recommended. He bought it in a set, so the large box contained some snacks too.\nJust to note, it was an odorless one suitable for housework, not a scented trendy one. It was gentle on the skin, its selling point being that it keeps the skin moist.\nHe checked the reviews on the internet, and it seemed he did not need to worry about the effects, probably.\n“Sorry that it’s not something valuable. I think your hands will become dry when you do housework. There are those without scent, but I guess you already have them. I heard it’s gentle for the skin, effective even.”\n“A practical item.”\n“Actually, you emphasize much on practical items.”\n“I guess. Thank you very much.”\nYou understand me well,\nso she smiled, and his lips relaxed.\nIt seemed she did not have a bad impression of him.\nThere was one other item…but it was embarrassing to open it before her. He wanted her to notice it before she returned home, if possible.\nUnfortunately for him, Mahiru seemed to have noticed something else in the bag, and peered into it.\n“…Why is there another?”\n“Ah, no, well, actually. It’s a selfish, subjective add on.”\n“Add on?”\n“…Add on.”\nHe averted his eyes, merely answering so. Mahiru tilted her head, not understanding what Amane meant, but she felt it would be faster to open the bag, so she took the item out.\nHe used a packaging of similar color to the bag, so that it would not stand out, and stuffed it to the bottom. This item was too big and noticeable however. There was no way she would not have noticed it.\nIt did not contain a box, but a polyester bag. It was just large enough for Mahiru to hold in both hands.\nMahiru carefully undid the dark blue ribbon,\ncan I get away from here now,\nAmane wondered as he stared at her…she cautiously removed the content.\nWith two hands, she cautiously lifted the item, and looked rather surprised as her eyes widened.\n“…A bear?”\nWhat Mahiru muttered was the true identity of that thing.\nIt was a doll not too big, large enough for an elementary school girl to huge.\nIt had faint colored fur similar to Mahiru’s hair. On its neck was an aqua blue ribbon tied like a necklace. It showed an innocent look, dark glossy buttons sewn as eyes, reflecting Mahiru.\nShe might be thinking,\na doll? In high school?\nNo matter the age, girls often do like cute things.\nBut this was what he chose after hearing Chitose’s advice.\nIt was really embarrassing for a boy to go buy this thing alone, so he had Chitose buy this for him, the payment being the crepe from the station shop.\nChitose kept laughing at him from the choosing part to the very end, and perhaps he would have felt less ashamed if he went alone. Well, bygones be bygones, it was pointless to mention it.\n“…I think girls will like this.”\nHe scratched his head, muttering with an explanation to no one in particular.\nHe really was bad at this.\nAfter all, he had never given a present to someone of the opposite gender, except to his mother when he was young. He never expected himself to do this.\nWould she feel disgusted to receive such a cute doll from a boy\n…he glanced aside discreetly at Mahiru, and saw her staring intently at it.\nNobody could tell if she was happy or sad, she merely stared at it stoically.\n“Well, I can throw it away if you want.”\nCan’t be helped if she doesn’t like it,\nhe joked, having determined so. Mahiru scowled as she turned her face around.\n“I will not do such a thing!”\n“Y-yeah. Given your personality, I don’t think you’ll do that, Shiina.”\nHer reaction was stronger than he expected, and he nodded while stumbling back. Once again, she looked at the bear.\n“…I will not do, such a cruel thing. I will, treasure it well.”\nThe thin wrists were clinging onto the bear doll firmly, embracing it.\nShe resembled a kid who did not want her favorite toy taken away, and like a mother embracing it lovingly.\nOne could say that she really treasured the bear from the way she embraced it.\nGyuu\n, there seemed to be a fitting sound effect as she embraced it firmly, and looked down at it.\nThe expression on the face was not the usual aloofness, and not the usual shock whenever she was startled by Amane. It was one of relief, kindness, love, and affection.\nHer innocent smile was so pure. He stared at her with bated breath, finding her so beautiful, so adorable.\n…I shouldn’t be looking at this.\nHe inadvertently had such a realization as she stared at her expression.\nWhile he was not in love with her, this absolute beauty was showing such expression, which only he saw, and even his heart was beating wildly.\nHe saw her treasure the doll greatly, showing a faint smile, look so adorable that anyone else would be mesmerized. Even he, who knew his own bland personality, was nearly mesmerized.\nHe put his hands on his face, affirming how hot his face was, and it definitely felt much hotter as usual.\nHe was obviously too bashful, “…Damn it.” and so he cursed with a volume Mahiru could not hear.\nLuckily, she was not paying attention to him, for half her face was buried into the bear doll as she embraced it lovingly.\nThat sight of her was similarly adorable, and Amane restrained himself greatly to avoid squeeing.\n“…I’m glad that you like it so much.”\nHe wanted to say something, but he eked out these words, and the eyes stared back at him.\n“This is the first time I received such a thing.”\n“Eh, given your popularity, I thought it would be normal for you…”\n“What do you think I am…”\nShe sounded a little dumbfounded as she gave him the look, which relieved him a little, for he no longer had to see that face again.\n“…I never told anyone of my birthday. I dislike it, and I never said it”\nDislike\n, so she said as she looked towards the bear.\nThe eyes she had when she looked at the bear was so calm, completely different from her words, and Amane felt a dissonance there.\n“I feel scared receiving presents from people, even those I do not know, or those that I have no relation to, so I would not accept it.”\n“But you accepted mine.”\n“…You are not something I do not know, Fujimiya-san.”\nSo she whispered as she buried her face into the bear as she looked at him. He started to regret staring at her directly.\nShe unwittingly looked up at him, showing a relaxed innocent face befitting her age. Truth be told, she was adorable.\nShe was so adorable, he inadvertently had the urge to pat her head, and the moment he was about to, he hastily reeled it back in.\n“…What is it?”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nMahiru tilted her head in confusion, either having noticed Amane’s hand that had twitched, or the anxiety that was exploding in him.\nWith that alone, his eyes were seized. Pretty girls are truly terrifying things.\nBut if he were to admit bluntly that she was cute, even he would be ashamed. “Huh?” and he was sure this would be her answer.\nAnd if he said such words, Amane would die in many ways, so he decided to contain this impulse for now.\n“…Thank you very much, Fujimiya-san”\nAmane averted his face, and Mahiru’s soft voice entered his ears once again.",

      "content": "“Hey hey Amane, did it go well with the one you gave the present to?”\nGiven that they went shopping together, he would have to report in. The following day, Chitose was grinning away as she went to hear out from Amane.\nHe was fine with the fact that she, who was in a different class, came looking for him. However, that kind of smile was something he really did not want to deal with. He really had the urge to just go bye there and then.\n“It’s not the relationship you think of, and that development didn’t happen.”\nAt the very least, he did not choose the present out of romantic feelings, nor did he have any other thoughts.\nThere was no doubt he was delighted, but there existed none of the development Chitose looked forward to.\n“No, but well, is there really nobody that makes your heart flutter? She’s definitely not just an acquaintance, and she’s a girl. Come on, some gossip here.”\n“We don’t have an unspeakable relationship.”\nWith Itsuki backing Chitose up, Amame could only deny vehemently.\nMahiru was happy, yes, but there was still some trouble, and he did not want to discuss this with others.\nHe did not want to feed into their curiosity, so he answered as callously as possible, and Itsuki pondered a little as he had his hand by his mouth.\n“…Hmm. Hey Amane.”\n“What is it?”\n“Did you give it to your neighbor?”\nTruly, Itsuki’s high awareness and EQ was disastrous to him.\n“…Why do you think so?”\n“If we consider those you know, or those you took care of you, the only one that fits that bill is the neighbor. You ain’t a local, you hardly interact with girls, and someone has been feeding you recently, so you’re grateful to her, right?”\n“Who knows.”\n“Hmm…Amane, you’ve been looking better recently.”\n“Ah, I think so too.”\n“So, she’s been giving you food often, and you wanted to give her a birthday present as thanks?”\nItsuki was completely correct, and Amane did his best not to let his cheeks twitch.\nAnd that was why Itsuki was terrifying, for his deductions seemed as though he witnessed it all. He might appear frivolous, but he was serious and attentive, and also rather popular. However, Amane really hoped Itsuki would shower these aspects to Chitose only.\n“You’re coming up with wild guesses now?”\n“I don’t know the truth, so I’m just imagining it. So is it true?”\n“Who knows?”\n“You’re petty.”\n“Petty~”\n“Shut up.”\nNo matter what they said, he was unwilling to be honest.\nIf he accidentally blurted it just a little, he would have to spill the beans. Itsuki was one thing; the current high school girls who loved their gossip would have interrogated him like no tomorrow.\nIn this world, there were magical creatures who could turn anything unrelated to love into something involving one. Troublesome they truly were.\nGoodness\n, so he sighed as he packed his bag, lifted it, and returned home.\nIt was a tactical retreat, and also an evasion against their bombardment of his heart.\n“Bye then. Go do your lovey-dovey things and ignore me now.”\n“We’ll do that without you saying that though?”\n“…Ikkun, let’s go stalk him and find that lady…”\n“Who in the world says that before the target? And you don’t have that thought at all. The most you’ll do is to come to my apartment gates.”\n“Tch.”\nHer cute lips formed a pout, but Chitose’s eyes were serious.\nAt this point, Amane felt a shiver realizing that Chitose was not joking, and would really do it, so he left the duo behind and hurriedly left the classroom.\n“…That was close.”\n“What was?”\nOnce he returned home, Amane blurted out, and Mahiru asked him with intrigue.\nMahiru arrived immediately after buying the ingredients, but it was a little too early to make dinner, so they had a little rest. It seemed Amane’s little whisper was overheard.\nJust to note, she was being the same as usual.\nThat smile she showed the previous day was no longer to be seen. Her usual expression would have him doubting if the events of the previous day actually transpired.\nThis should be the norm, or rather, Amane hoped she would be like this. If she was to show the same expression she did the previous day, he would feel a heartache.\n“No, well, Itsuki and the others were gossiping about the present.”\nBecause I went to discuss this with them,\nso he quipped, and sighed. It seemed Mahiru had remembered Itsuki’s name, “Ahh, I see.” and she too sighed.\n“Well, those did not look like things you would buy, Fujimiya-san.”\n“That’s not what I meant.”\nThey already felt it was impossible for Amane to give a female a present, and that was why they wondered if he was in love.\nIn fact, neither of them had the sweet, sour, or bitter feelings that came with falling in love.\n“Just my own issues. Goodness, what were they guessing?”\nIt was true that Mahiru was cute, and he had the desire to touch her. He could not deny that.\nBut he felt every youth would feel this way, and after all, his heart merely jolted a few times when he once again realized Mahiru was a real pretty girl. There was no way it was love.\nEven if he did like her character, he did not think of the extraordinary, to form such a relationship with her.\nHe glanced aside, and saw her usual pretty face.\nHowever, his heart did not palpitate as it did the previous night. Once again, he affirmed that he had not fallen for Mahiru, and sighed.\nOne had to wonder what she would say if she noticed him watching her, so he turned his eyes towards the phone, only to see an unread number on a chat app icon.\nIt’s probably Itsuki,\nso he thought as he opened the app, but the name on the new message was beyond expectation.\nOnce he saw the name Shihoko, he frowned.\nAmane had only three female contacts in total.\nTo be precise, they were Chitose, Mahiru, and…his mother.\nWhat now?\nSo he thought as he opened her chat. It contained the agitated text he really was bad at dealing with, things like how his exams went, if he had any difficulty in life, and so on.\nThe reason why he was bad at dealing with Chitose was because there was someone like Chitose…or rather, an older Chitose in his family. Amane did not hate her, and could not bring himself to, but his own mother’s personality was too much for him.\n“Your grandpa sent fruits, so I’m sending some to you. Will be delivering on Saturday. Do stay at home in the afternoon! I’m not going to forgive you if you refuse or aren’t at home, you know?”\n“You just decided on my schedule like that…?”\nHe had no real plans for Saturday, and was fine staying at home, but should she not contact him earlier?\n“What is the matter?”\nMahiru might have heard the mutter as she looked towards him with her usual expression.\n“Mom’s delivering fruits she received from grandpa. Probably apples.”\n“Do you know how to peel them?”\n“…With a peeler, maybe?”\n“You may…but it is a waste of nutrients to peel off the skin.”\nMy mom says the same thing\n, so he thought, but he swallowed that notion.\n“I’ll just eat with the skin then.”\n“That is barbaric of you.”\n“I’m lazy, you know.”\n“That is lazy of you.”\nHe could only show a wry smile at her usual blunt honesty, and shrugged away.\nWhile Mahiru looked stupefied, “Well, it will end up in the stomach after all.” but she somewhat relented.\n“Oh yeah. I don’t know if I can finish them all before they rot. You want some, Shiina?”\n“I shall have some then. Fruits are expensive after all.”\nHer words might seem a dampener, but these words were truly befitting her.\n“Saturday, is it? I shall prepare lunch as thanks.”\n“I’m the one who’s always being taken care of.”\n“It is fine. I do not dislike cooking for you, Fujimiya-san.”\nShe made a sincere little smile, giggling.\nAmane averted his eyes awkwardly as her smile reminded him of what happened the previous day, “…I’ll leave it to you then.” so he tersely responded.",

      "content": "Amane planned to deliver the fruits immediately after receiving them, and thatmight be a mistake when\n“A–mane.” Once he heard the doorbell and the cheeky, high pitched voice, he realized the situation, and clutched his head.\nHe was grateful that Mahiru would drop to cook lunch on a Saturday, and thought it was a blessing from the heavens.\nIn fact, the carbonara she made was really delicious. The thick sauce and the black pepper matched perfectly, and it was really delicious.\nIt was not Mahiru’s fault, actually. Yes, she really was not at fault.\nThe fault was that he was told to stay at home, and did not notice why…along with this blood-related lady who loved pulling her surprises and the extraordinary.\n“…Erm, Fujimiya-san? It’s not the delivery…”\n“Nope. Mom took the key and went past the gates…”\nIn hindsight, he was at fault for taking his mom’s words at face value when she would have wanted to observe him no matter what.\nThere was no way his mother would not be up to something.\n“…Eh, mother??”\n“Most likely, mom wants to see if I’m doing well these days…she’s not telling me in advance because I’ll try to slip it past her.”\n“Ahh…”\n“I feel conflicted by how you look like you agree, but this isn’t important.”\nThe problem was, how would he deal with Mahiru who was here.\nIf she was at the gates, he could have Mahiru return home. However, since she was at his door, he could not let Mahiru return.\nIf he let her in, she would surely meet Mahiru, and there would be a misunderstanding. Mahiru too would not wish for the same.\nWhat shall I do?\nWhile he wondered, the intervals between the doorbell rings shortened.\n…Ahh goodness.\n“……Sorry Shiina, go into my room. Please.”\n“Eh, ye-yes?”\n“Hold this. I’ll try to get my mom outside, and then you go home. Sorry about this, but please.”\nHe really had no choice but to hide her.\nLunch was made, but they had cleaned up the place, so that was fine.\nThe shoes could be hidden inside the shoe cabinet, and he would bring her blanket and other personal belongings into the room.\nWhile she was in his room, he would offer some food once his mom was done inspecting, and she probably would agree to that. He would however refuse her if she demanded to inspect the room.\nHe would ask to make dishes using ingredients not in the fridge, and they would go shopping together. That would be the moment Mahiru would escape, or so he planned.\nI don’t have a choice here,\nso he told Amane, handed her the extra key and begged her. “Y-yes.” She nodded, despite looking troubled.\nThey were not using the storeroom, for it would be really cold without the heating during this season.\nThere was heating and a fluffy cushion in Amane’s room, so she would not be sitting on an empty floor, aching all over in the cold.\n“…I shall leave it to you then. I’ll deal with my mom…”\nAmane was already mentally tired before he even met his mom. Once he went towards the entrance, Mahiru silently slipped into his room.\nOnce he was sure she entered, he opened the door unwilling.\n“Oh my…Amane, you’re late. I thought you were sleeping, but you look very lively.”\nImmediately appearing before him was his mom, whom he had not seen since summer vacation.\nShe was his mom, but her appearance defied her age, and she was still wearing that usual cheerful look back home. One would say that it was not simply her appearance defying her age, but her actions too.\n“Yeah yeah I’m lively so can you go back now?”\n“Is that how you treat your mom…? I spent hours to arrive, you know? How about some reward?”\n“Thank you very much for taking the long trip here, please go back.”\n“Still saying such things now? You really aren’t cute, unlike Shuuto-san”\n“I’m a guy, why do i have to be cute?”\nAck,\nhe made a nauseous sound, but his mother Shihoko did not have her mood dampened, as she merely giggled away, accepting it as Amane being in his rebellious phase.\n“May I come in?”\n“Wait, I haven’t said anything.”\n“The rental is paid by Shuuto-san and me, you know?”\nHe had no room to refuse once she said that, and he could only open the door with a scowl, inviting Shihoko in.\nOf course, he walked along the wall where the bedroom was, stopping her from entering as he led her to the living room.\n“Say mom, call before you drop by. I’m an adult.”\n“Oh my, if I didn’t drop by for a sudden spot check, I would not have seen if my son’s doing well, you know?”\n“Grr…you see, it’s fine here. All packed up.”\n“Of course. It shocked me. You don’t do this at home, Amane, but you’re pretty capable yourself. I never expected that.”\nShihoko scanned the living room, nodding away as though she was marveling.\nOf course, it was all neat and tidy because he worked together with Mahiru to clean up the apartment, and maintained this thanks to her advice and reminders. It was all her contribution, but he could not mention it to Shihoko at this point.\n“Your skin looks good. Looks like you’ve been taking proper nutrition.”\n“…Yeah.”\nHe averted his eyes, for that too was thanks to Mahiru.\n“Looks like you’ve been cooking…huh, two persons’ worth?”\nShe pointed her manicured finger at the cutlery.\nTwo people ate lunch, so there were two plates. He was careless not to have noticed it, but Shihoko seemed fine with that.\n“A friend visited.”\nBut that was not a lie.\nHe was uncertain, but they were already on the level of friends, so his words were not wrong, it seemed. He never said the gender though.\nHe tried his best not to look rattled as he answered. “Oh~” So Shihoko answered, seemingly unconvinced as she looked over to the living room.\nSomehow, he managed to bluff her, but he was dripping cold sweat.\n“Well, passable…it does not feel like a boy is living alone.”\nShihoko looked around, asked a few questions, got a few answers, and surmised thusly.\nIn a certain sense, it was to be expected. Mahiru had her hands in most of these things.\n“There’s nothing to worry about now right, mom?”\n“Yes. It really shocked me. You couldn’t do anything when you’re at home. Looks like you’ve grown.”\n“…Well I can grow.”\nFrom whose mouth do those words come from anyway, so he quietly reproached himself as he answered. “You’ve worked hard there.” so Shihoko beamed.\nHe did not appreciate the compliments, for it was not him who did so.\nBut he could not say the truth, and could only endure and beg her to return home.\nAt the very least, she was done checking on him.\nMaybe she’ll go back without asking me to cook for her…but right when Amane had this thought.\n“And now I’ll check the bedroom.”\nThe final bombshell landed, and he widened his eyes.\nCheck the bedroom.\nIn other words, his room…the bedroom.\nOf course, Mahiru was inside it. If she was found, he could easily imagine how his situation would end up much worse than his initial plan for them to meet.\n“Hey what. You can’t go in even though you’re my mom.”\n“Oh, is there something unsightly in there?”\n“Normally, a high school boy would have one or two unsightly things in there, right?”\n“You’re admitting to that, huh.”\n“Yeah I admit it, so don’t go in.”\nHe had to stop her here with all he got. Even if his pride was shattered, he had to hide Mahiru’s existence until the very end.\nAt this point, if Mahiru was spotted in Amane’s room, Shihoko would surely be having happy delusions, and that was something he wanted to avoid no matter what.\nHe was stubbornly refusing to let Shihoko through, basically shouting no as he stood before the door. Shihoko quickly deduced that there was something hidden inside the room. “You’re hiding something from mom~.” she beamed as she loomed on.\nI’m really sorry, but I need to stop you even if I have to be forceful,\nsuch was his stance as he faced off against Shihoko.\nBut there was a thud in his room.\n“Amane.”\n“Yes?”\n“What are you hiding inside?”\n“…Nothing to do with you, mom.”\n“So you say. I see.”\nThe smile got wider.\nIt had a irresistible pressure, and whenever he saw this smile, Amane found himself in much discomfort, his desire to refuse greatly worn down.\nIt was a force of habit, something he could not change.\nGrr,\nwhile he groaned, Shihoko seized the opportunity to put her hand on the door.\nAnd it was too late to regret.\nShihoko went around Amane to check on the sound, and opened the door.\nAnd beyond the door………was a pretty girl leaning by the bed, cupping a cushion on her knees.\nHer eyes were closed, her breathing steady…basically, Mahiru was asleep.",

      "content": "Napping was a common instance.\nShe was in a warm room with heating on, and just had lunch. These two conditions were prime for her to fall asleep.\nDoes she usually sleep in a boy’s room?\nFor a moment, he had such a thought, but since she had deemed him as a harmless person, Mahiru might have accidentally fallen asleep.\nShe could not be blamed for this though. It was boring to wait foolishly without making a sound, and some things just happened.\nThe reason why he had his head cupped was because his mom Shihoko barged into his room at this moment, and witnessed her in this state.\nTruly, there was a misunderstanding.\nIf he was in someone else’s shoes, Amane too would have misunderstood, thinking that they were on such good terms, she could be sufficiently careless to sleep in his room.\nHis face twitched as he glanced aside at his mom, and found her eyes dazzling as she stared at Mahiru. “Oh my oh my.” so her heart started to blurt out, or perhaps he was just over imagining things.\n“Oh dear Amane, you found such a cute girlfriend! You really can’t be underestimated!”\nKyaa\n, she squealed with a voice unfitting of her age, and his head started to ache.\nShe had completely misunderstood, and was completely excited.\nTypically, no parent would be\nthat\nexcited to see her son bring a girlfriend home.\nBut she was being so excited, and one reason was definitely because she loved cute things.\nWell, it was true Mahiru had the appearance of a really pretty girl.\nShe was completely defenseless as she slept, her usual facade shed, and most importantly, her expression and actions clear to see.\nThe speckless face was in a relaxed, peaceful state.\nHe was used to it, but every time he saw Mahiru, he found her pretty face exquisite, extremely adorable.\nThe innocent sleeping face was so defenseless, so adorable that he had the urge to pat it.\nThe way she hugged Amane’s cushion strongly whetted the kind of desire Amane really did not want to openly talk about.\nThe girl was so pretty that Amane, who was on familiar terms with, had to admit so, and Shihoko assumed she was the son’s girlfriend (for the moment).\nIt was likely this was the reason for her excitement.\n“So you didn’t want mom to enter because your girlfriend is inside? Goodness, you’re becoming a man before I know it!”\n“Not at all! Absolutely not! She’s not my girlfriend, not anything!”\n“Ahh, you don’t have to find excuses now, you know? Mom’s not going to object to anyone you choose, Amane.”\n“Eh no that’s not the problem here! We’re not dating! Not at all!”\n“You say you’re not, but she’s in your room, you know?”\n“That’s because you suddenly popped by! You would have misunderstood even if she’s in the living room!”\n“Well, the main issue is that if you never intended to, you wouldn’t have invited a girl into your house. If the girl doesn’t like you, she wouldn’t be in your house, right?”\nUpon being pointed out, he tried to retort, but could not think of any.\nAs Shihoko had mentioned, Amane normally treats his house as his own territory, and would not willingly invite others in.\nInitially, he let Mahiru in because of the turn of events, but ever since that, leaving aside the cooking, Amane let Mahiru into his house because he was interested in her personality.\nWell, I can say that I like her.\nHer appearance aside, Amane really was fond of the girl Mahiru.\nShe had a conflicting personality she typically would not show in school, vicious, blunt, and yet dishonest; she looked aloof, yet she loved to care for others; she never minced her words; whenever the unexpected was pointed out, she would panic and show a look befitting her age; a few rare times, she would show an innocent smile. At this point, Amane felt these were all of Mahiru’s charms.\nIt could not be described as love, but at the very least, he found her to be a really attractive girl.\n“I like her as a friend, but don’t think it as love for the opposite gender. Also, she doesn’t have interest in me.”\nThey were not so close for him to agree with Shihoko. To be honest, Mahiru might not be happy about being misunderstood, that she had feelings for Amane.\n“Oh my, you can’t say that though? You’re not getting a little uppity just because you think you understand the complex feelings of a girl, are you?”\n“How many times, mom, must I tell you we don’t have that relationship…Shiina, please, wake up…”\nEven after saying all he could, Shihoko kept talking about romance, and Amane could only put his hand on his forehand.\nHe really wished Mahiru could wake up earlier, really.\n“Nn…”\nAmane’s prayer might have worked, or perhaps she woke up because of the commotion.\nMahiru slowly lifted her eyelids, making a sweet sound as she lifted her face.\nHer flax-colored hair slid off her shoulders.\nHer caramel-colored eyes were blurry and moist, such defenselessness left Amane unable to stare at her.\nShe looked up at Amane with sleepy eyes, probably aware that she was not completely awake, and he averted his eyes slightly.\n“Shiina, forget about how you fell asleep, please help me clear up this misunderstanding.”\n“Misunderstanding…?”\n“Hey hey, girlfriend, your name?”\nA fluffy looking Mahiru reflected on the meaning of those words, and Shihoko approached her without restraint, grinning away like a goody-goody.\nMahiru herself was confused after waking up, and faced with such an unfiltered smile and cordialness, her eyes were looking flustered.\n“Eh, e-erm.”\n“Nice to meet you. It’s important to introduce each other, you know!”\n“Eh, M-Mahiru Shiina…”\n“My, Mahiru-chan, such an adorable name! I’m Shihoko, you can call me by my name.”\nMahiru was pressed into giving her name, and she looked towards Amane, giving the “Save me, Fujimiya-san” look. Amane himself was hoping that someone else would save him however, and because he could not help, he shook his head to refuse.\nHe knew his mom really well, that once she lost control, there’s no stopping her.\nSeeing how there’s exceeding interest, it appeared she wanted to have a full conversation with Mahiru for the first time.\nThough she might not have noticed that the important Mahiru was looking troubled.\n“E-erm, mother.”\n“Oh! So you’re recognizing me as mom?”\n“Fujimiya-san！”\n“Fujimiya may refer to Amane and me. Hey, Amane.”\n“Mom, you’re troubling Shiina.”\n“Amane, you can’t be calling your girlfriend by anything other than her name, you know?”\nAmane frowned, for Shihoko really was not listening to him, but Shihoko did not appear to mind as she continued to grin away. She was either a bold one, or thick skinned at least.\n“E-erm, Shihoko-san.”\n“Wha~t?”\n“Actually, Fujimiya and I-I,”\n“Which one are you referring to~?”\n“…I-I do not have that kind of relationship with A-Amane-kun.”\nMahiru was clearly flustered by Shihoko’s taunting words, but she did her best to deny it.\nWith Shihoko prompting, Mahiru said his name after much trepidation, shooting a few looks at him. Shihoko in turn beamed away now that she got Mahiru to call Amane’s name.\n“Oh, will this be how the relationship goes in the future?”\n“Eh, e-erm, that is not.”\n“Oh dear, am I being a third wheel over here?”\n“E-erm, please let me explain! I do not have this kind of relationship with Amane, kun. Just eating together. Amane-kun cannot cook after all.”\n“You make a good bride, Mahiru-chan. Our Amane here has to live alone without knowing how to do housework. If this is so, please continue to support him.”\n“Ah, that.”\nHe felt Mahiru was doing her best.\nBut it was impossible to fend off against Shihoko’s momentum and explain what was going on.\nShihoko’s eyes were glittering more than ever once she knew Mahiru had been dropping by regularly, cooking for him, eating together with him.\nAt this point, Amane could not stop Shihoko. The only one who could would be his father Shuuto.\n“…Give it up, Shiina. My mom’s not going to listen once she gets all excited.”\n“That…”\nAmane was at the point of enlightenment, and could only give up and explain, staring slightly at his mom who was out of control.",

      "content": "“Speaking of which, mom’s shocked to see that you got such a pretty girlfriend, Amane.”\nBoth of them remained silent. Amane was too tired to deny it, and Mahirudid not know what to do.\nShihoko took silence as consent…or rather, no matter what they said, she would think they were hiding their awkwardness. She stared at Mahiru intently with curious eyes.\n“How is it, Mahiru-chan? Is Amane doing well now?”\n“Eh…well actually…I do not think he will die…”\n“Say something nice already.”\n“But when I first came to this house, it was so dirty.”\n“Don’t be so harsh now. Look, it’s clean now, right?”\n“But that is because I helped to clean up.”\n“Well err, yep, got to thank you for everything, from food to cleaning to whatever.”\nHe really was thoroughly indebted to Mahiru when it came to these.\nIt was because of her presence that he lived a comfortable life till this point, and he would have kowtowed and thanked her without hesitation, but he would not because she did not want that. However, he did intend to work hard every day to repay Mahiru.\nBut it was just that Shihoko took these words in a not-too-good direction.\n“Well, Amane, you’ve been letting Mahiru-chan help out all the time, and not just this once? What a troublesome kid you are…it sounds like you’re living together.”\n“That’s not it!! How did you end up thinking that’s the case!? She just lives next door!”\n“Oh my, this is a fated encounter! It’s nice isn’t it, Amane, you have such a pretty and capable girl taking care of you.”\n“I can’t deny that she’s pretty and capable but I have to argue about this being a fated encounter.”\n“Romantic, isn’t it?”\n“That’s not what I mean! I’m saying that we’re not dating!”\n“My my.”\nShihoko definitely assumed Amane was trying to hide his embarrassment, while the latter’s cheeks were about to twitch.\nShe always took events as food for her amazing delusions, and the son who had been tormented by such a mom countless times let out the heaviest sigh in months.\nAnd Mahiru, overwhelmed by this astounding pressure, looked back and forth between Amane and Shihoko, clearly at a loss of what to do.\n“Mahiru-chan, Mahiru-chan, I may be a parent biased to her son; our Amane here is foul mouthed and dishonest, but he’s really straightforward and gentlemanly here, so you can take it that you bought a good item. He doesn’t have any experience with the ladies, so you need to carefully control him, Mahiru-chan.”\n“What are you saying now mom, shut up.”\nThe last half was clearly unnecessary.\n“But I’m saying the truth here. Actually, why didn’t you look for a girlfriend in the first place? It’s nice that you look similar to Shuuto-san; maybe it’s because you look boorish?”\n“Stop being a busybody.”\n“Maybe you should show Mahiru-chan your cool side?”\n“I’m not going to, and she doesn’t want to see.”\n“Here we go again. Ahh, Mahiru-chan, shall I doll him up in a way you’ll like? Amane’s pretty handsome if he cleans up a little, you know?”\nMahiru saw Shihoko grin away as she nudged at him, and gave a blank, confused smile, probably because she was being hapless\nIn a certain sense, Shihoko was truly terrifying to intimidate the usually poised Angel this much.\n“Mom, you’re really troubling Shiina. Hurry up and go back already.”\n“You’re all grown up now, aren’t you? Wanting me to go back. It’s true that I’m disturbing your sweet time with your girlfriend though, so I should take my leave.”\n“Just go back already.”\nHe was too tired to deny it, and Mahiru too must be tired from how Shihoko was being all excited.\nHe looked over to Mahiru, and found her a little tired.\nIt was to be expected, for Mahiru was a fine, tranquil lady forced to participate in such a high strung conversation that left the son was completely worn.\nHe made up his mind to comfort her as he waved his hand, ushering Shihoko out of the door. The latter looked a little displeased.\nHowever, Shihoko did not say she was going to stay, probably out of concern, though in a clearly wrong direction.\n“Ah, Mahiru-chan, let’s exchange numbers. Do tell me of how our Amane is doing later.”\n“Eh, y-yes…?”\nFinally, Shihoko established a relationship that had Amane begging for mercy, and he put a hand on his forehead.\nMahiru obediently exchanged numbers over the phone, going along with the flow.\nThere was no doubt that Shihoko would start to meddle with Mahiru.\nI’m really sorry.”\n“We’ll leave our Amane to you now.” So she held Mahiru’s hands with a Cheshire cat’s grin, and Amane decided to send a message to his dad, “Please leash mom a little.”\n“I am tired…”\n“Sorry that a tornado dropped by.”\nShihoko did not stay for long, but they were already worn out, seated side by side on the sofa.\nAmanae was slouched into the sofa, covering his face as he let out a long sigh. Mahiru was a little more cautious, but her usually straightened back too was more arched than usual.\n“I’m really sorry for sending her back without resolving the misunderstanding.”\n“No, well, not much was lost…”\n“No well, there’s damage…it looks like she’s really interested in you, Shiina…she’s going to bother you with lots of things now…”\nHe caused Mahiru problems again thanks to that, and was really apologetic to her.\nShihoko saw her son’s girlfriend (even though it was a misunderstanding), and she really loved cute things, so she was really interested in Mahiru, and would really take care of the latter, to busybody levels.\n“It looks like Shihoko-san really cares about you, Fujimiya-san.”\n“That’s the nice way of putting it, but she’s annoying…”\nNot that she was being a complete idiot, but the affection she showed was something he did not want.\nAmane too was at fault for being too careless, so he could not say much about this, but even he too felt she was a busybody.\nHe was really grateful for his mom’s feelings, but to be honest, she was a hassle and someone he wanted to keep his distance from.\n“…That is nice.”\nMahiru muttered, and Amane looked at her.\n“What?”\n“Your mother is quite boisterous, but she is kind.”\n“That’s just noisy and a busybody.”\n“…But that is fine too.”\nShe was not being simply courteous, she was showing an envious look. She muttered with a fleeting tone, and lowered her eyes.\nLooking over, her face was melancholic, on the verge of shattering upon contact. Anyone would have found her fragile.\nShe did not simply look tired, but also feeble and fleeting. She seemed to have felt Amane’s stare as she suddenly lifted her head, smiling.\nShe regained her usual expression, as though nothing had happened, and in a rare gesture, reclined into the sofa.\n“Mahiru-chan, huh? ”\n“…What’s with that out of a sudden.”\n“No…it has been a while since someone called me by my name. They usually call me Shiina.”\nAmane was surprised to learn that nobody addressed the super popular Angel herself, but it was probably because everyone was too intimidated to call her by her given name.\nShe was the flawless Angel at school, and nobody dared to call her so.\nAlso, there were a few who called her by her nickname, though she herself hated it.\n“If not your good friends, then your parents, right?”\n“My parents will not call me so. Absolutely not.”\nA frosty instant reply.\nHe inadvertently looked over at Mahiru’s face, and found it to be devoid of color.\nIt was emotionless, as though they were stripped bare, a non-living thing even. Due to the perfect face before him, he had a moment when he thought she was a doll.\nBut that lasted only for a moment, for once she noticed Amane’s stare, she locked away the stoic look, frowning as though something was troubling her.\n“…Anyway, it is rare to begin with.”\nShe quietly muttered, and let out a sigh.\nHe could tell that Mahiru was on bad terms with her parents.\nShe would occasionally show a frosty look whenever her parents were mentioned. She never went out to eat with her parents, hated her birthday, and from what she said, one could imagine she had family issues…but he never imagined her parents not calling her by name before.\n“…That is nice.”\nOne had to question her feelings when she muttered that.\n“Mahiru”\nHe naturally called out the name he never once did.\nThe caramel-colored eyes blinked once.\nIt was unexpected, so she appeared to be spacing out, showing an immaturity hidden beneath her usual demeanor and expression. It would be appropriate to say she was taken aback.\n“Anyone can call you by name, right?”\n“…Well, you are right.”\nSo he quipped stiffly, and after a while, a faint smile appeared.\nThe relieved smile formed ripples in his heart.\n“……Amane-kun.”\nShe whispered his name, and the ripples grew wider.\nJust moments ago, Amane did not pay much heed as Mahiru only used it when talking to his mom…but when she addressed him so, he felt a swirling itch, something in his heart.\n“Please don’t call me that outside.”\n“…I know that. You in turn should not let it slip outside.”\n“I get that. It’s a secret.”\nHe dared not look directly at a smiling Mahiru.\n“Yeah.” so he tersely answered, looking to the side while pretending to change posture, evading that smile.",

      "content": "Ever since the sudden strike from his mom on Saturday, there was a change in the manner Amane and Mahiru addressed each other, but nothing else really special.\nNeither did the relationship suddenly improve, but as they started addressing each other a little intimately, Mahiru’s attitude had softened, somewhat.\n“…Erm, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru showed up a little earlier on Sunday evening, her face showing some awkwardness…or worry.\nAmane let her in, but he did not know why she was giving such an ambiguous attitude.\nHe wondered if she was having issues with him calling her by name, but she had no hesitation calling his name, so there seemed to be something else.\nBoth of them sat on the sofa. Amane looked towards Mahiru, and found her pull out a handkerchief from her apron pocket.\nWhile he was wondering what was going on, she opened the neatly folded handkerchief, and pulled out a key wrapped inside it, reflecting a dim light.\nHe had some impression of this key, for it was the one he gave her the previous day.\n“…I shall, return this key. I did not do so last night. Erm, I forgot about it, so I missed the chance to return it to you…I am really sorry.”\n“I see.”\nIt appeared she was concerned about the fact that she took the key home without returning.\nOnce he understood why she was acting so strangely, he looked towards the key on the handkerchief.\nThinking about it, he realized Mahiru would practically drop by every day to cook dinner. While Amane would open the door for her, there were moments when he would take the long road home, and not be at home, or when he was a little busy out there, so she would have to wait outside for a little while.\nIt would be too harsh to make someone wait at the entrance in this weather, let alone a female.\nIt was said the greatest enemy to a female’s body was the cold, and putting himself in her position, he would not have felt comfortable either.\nWell, since Mahiru would drop by every day, it would be easier for him to hand her the key.\n“Well, I guess it’s fine that you keep it.”\n“Eh?”\n“You can return it when we have nothing to do with each other.”\nTruth be told, if Amane left the key to Mahiru, it would mean she would have to take care of him for a while, but she looked back at him worriedly, for he did not receive the key.\n“B-but.”\n“Or rather, it’s troublesome for me to go open the door every time.”\n“Your true voice is leaking out.”\n“It’s not like you’re going to misuse it.”\n“You say so…”\nAt least a month passed ever since he got dinner from her and had her cook at his place, and he thought he understood her personality well.\nShe had common sense and a good conscience, and personality-wise, nobody would expect her to do the devious.\nEven though she had the key, she would not hand it off to someone else, or slip in while Amane was not around. She was someone trustworthy.\n“Well, you find it a hassle to press the doorbell every time, right?”\n“Even if you say so, it feels like you are being too careless.”\n“I gave you the key because I trust you.”\nMahiru’s eyes widened once she heard these words, speechless, and then she frowned.\nThe skepticism on her face was accompanied by a different unknown emotion.\nBut Amane merely handed the key over to Mahiru, all to save the hassle. If she really did not want to, he was willing to compromise.\nMahiru in turn looked back and forth between the key and Amane…before she sighed.\n“…Understood. I shall borrow it for now.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Amane-kun, I don’t know if you are being magnanimous or careless.”\nGoodness,\nso she said with some spite, and Amane responded with a wry smile.\n“That’s my style.”\n“This isn’t for you to say about yourself.”\nHmph,\nso she pointed out coldly, only for Amane to smile brighter than before.\nIt appeared they were already on sufficiently familiar terms for him to have such useless conversations.\nBut since she permitted him to use her given name, it would be strange to say they were not on familiar terms.\nI really had enough of this person,\nso her eyes implied, but they were filled with some warmth, rather than looking aloof.\nAnd she knew that Amane was just joking around.\n“I shall take it then. I do not care if anything happens to your house.”\n“Like?”\n“…Like if I pop by to clean up your house.”\n“I’ll be grateful for that.”\n“What if I stuff the fridge full of food?”\n“Then I’ll get to enjoy breakfast, and there’s more things to eat for dinner.”\nMahiru’s little jokes were really peaceful, or even music to his ears, what he wanted. Nevertheless, the muted reactions had her a little unhappy.\nThe threat did not seem like a threat, it emphasized her kindness, and really was something to smile about.\n“I feel that I have been treated as a fool.”\n“I didn’t do that.”\nIt appeared if he continued to tease her, she would kick up a fuss. While he really wanted to see her pout, he sheathed his smile and stared at Mahiru.",

      "content": "“Oh that’s why.” Amane saw a piece of paper with many students’ names pasted on the corridor wall, and muttered.\nThe rankings of the prior week’s exams was released, and Amane came to look, along with his peers.\nHe was 21st, not much different from usual, not exactly standing out, though decent. He did not feel anything different when he wrote, and was a little relieved seeing that his rankings were as expected.\nOn a sidete note, Mahiru remained 1st in their year.\nShe truly was an intelligent girl, but he knew she was not lacking in hard work, and could only marvel at how amazing she was.\nHe often saw her studying after dinner.\nWell, she was already smart to begin with, but what elevated her to 1st position was the relentless hard work.\n“Shiina-san’s still 1st…”\n“That Angel uses her mind differently after all, to be expected.”\nAmane heard such voices amidst the commotion, and curled his lips unhappily.\n“…What is it, Amane? You look unhappy. Didn’t rank well?”\nItsuki, who was with Amane, was a little surprised by the latter’s reaction.\nJust to note, the rankings only listed the top 50. Itsuki was merely there to accompany Amane, not to look for his own name.\n“Not really. 21st.”\n“Ohh, that’s a little better than the last time.”\n“Somewhat within the margin of error.”\n“Well, the smart ones always say things differently after all.”\nItsuki ribbed back as he smirked away. “Fine fine.” and Amane brushed it off, before looking at the rankings again.\nShe really worked hard,\nso he thought.\nShe was unwilling to show anyone the effort she put in, and while others would think it was to be expected of her, it was the result of her putting in so much effort.\nThose around her praised her for being amazing, but they knew nothing of her hard work, and could not comprehend.\nSurely that bothered Mahiru greatly.\n“…I’ll make up for that.”\n“Hm? You said something?”\n“Nothing, I’m going back to the classroom.”\n“Alrighty.”\n“Huh, Amane-kun. What is this?”\nMahiru had changed her clothes, went to the supermarket to buy ingredients, and returned to his house. She intended to put the ingredients into the fridge, only to notice this white box.\n“Hm? Ahh, cake..”\nThere was cake inside the white box, and Mahiru might have figured it out when she saw the shape, but she wanted to be sure.\nOn a side note, Chitose loved to upload photos of her favorite patisserie on SNS, and that was the place he bought it from.\n“…You like cake?”\n“Not exactly. It’s for you.”\n“Why again?”\n“You’re first in our year, so here’s a little celebration. Congrats on getting first.”\nMahiru blinked her eyes once she heard it was for her.\nIt might have been really unexpected to her.\n“I-I have been 1st every time. It is not something worth celebrating.”\n“But well, you’ve been working hard, so a reward once in a while is fine. You don’t like a strawberry shortcake?”\n“Eh? I-I cannot say that I dislike it…”\n“Hm, that’s good. We’ll eat it after dinner.”\nWhile he realized she was a little stunned, Amane cut off the conversation.\nMahiru would feel troubled if he paid too much attention to her, so he should be a little more deliberate.\nTo him, she was one who was devoting her utmost to others, but extremely strict to herself. She was the type to not relax unless something drastic happened.\nShe would have put her head down and do what she had to do, toiling without rest as long as nobody praised and coddled her. He had a feeling she did not know how it was to fawn.\nWhile they did not spend much time together, he somewhat understood her personality, and hoped to repay some of the efforts she spared him all these while.\nAmane saw that Mahiru was still rooted in the kitchen, made a wry smile, and sighed as he stared at her until she moved again.\nAfter dinner, he saw her serve the cake with some nervousness, and burst out laughing.\n“Wh-why are you laughing?”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\n“It does not feel like there is nothing.”\n“Don’t mind me.”\nHe was just bemused that Mahiru was acting so tense, and that was all.\nBut if he laughed too much, he would have ruined her mood, and his objective to reward her would be for naught, so he stopped after a short while.\nShe brought some coffee along with the cake, and placed them on the table, before sitting on the sofa.\nAll these actions made her look really unnatural, and he had the urge to laugh. However, the person herself was right next to him, and he managed to endure it.\nMahiru looked up at Amane worriedly.\n“Nn, congrats.”\n“…Thank you very much. But…”\n“Just accept it. You did work hard after all.”\n“Yes, that is true.”\n“Come on, eat it. You should relax once in a while.”\nI bought it for you after all,\nso he quipped. Mahiru looked a little apologetic as she nodded away, took the fork and the plate with the cake.\n“I am really grateful.”\n“Go ahead.”\nHe waved his hand, and she took the fork, cutting a bite size of cake cautiously, and brought it to her mouth.\nGirls typically had the impression of being picky with sweets, but it should be fine since it was from the shop Chitose often shopped at.\nThe proof was that once Mahiru ate it, her eyes widened a little, and her mouth relaxed a little.\nShe hardly showed change in her expressions, but recently, she was starting to show some range of common emotions.\nShe slowly ate the cake, showing a relaxed expression, and this one eating scene became a painting of sorts.\n“…? What is it?”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nMahiru found Amane staring at her, and tilted her head in confusion.\nThe expression was gentler compared to usual, and he, who had been staring at her, was looking aside instead.\nInstead, it was Mahiru who was staring at Amane. She then suddenly thought of something, as she took another bite of cake, reaching it towards Amane..\nAhh,\nso she ended up trying to feed him.\n“Eh, n-no I don’t really want to eat it.”\n“You do not want to?”\n“…No, well, that…since you’re giving it to me, I’ll accept it.”\nHe never imagined this scene to be possible, so obviously, he was looking bashful, accidentally agreeing.\nThey were at such an age, and of different genders. Further, it was a really pretty girl feeding him, so in a certain sense, he might be considered lucky…but Amane was not at the point where he could discard his shame and be outright happy.\n“It is something you bought after all, Amane-kun. You have the right to eat it.”\nAnd Mahiru, the one suggesting this, never realized as she brought the cake to Amane’s mouth with her usual look.\nAmane could only see a perplexed look on her face, so he made up his mind and took a bite of it.\nSpreading in his mind was an unbelievable sweetness.\n“…It’s sweet.”\n“It is cake after all.”\nIt was not simply because of the cake, but Mahiru did not seem to have noticed it.\nHe took a little nibble, and found it really sweet. His mental state might have affected him greatly.\n“…Feels like you haven’t felt anything.”\nHe experienced all of the sweetness, shame, and itchiness in his heart, but Mahiru herself appeared fine.\nAmane found it really vexing, “Give me that.” so he snatched the fork from Mahiru’s hand, doing the same gesture to her, and handed her the cake.\nWith this happening to him, how could he not retaliate?\n“Nn.”\n“…Erm.”\n“Eat it.”\nMahiru looked more perturbed than before, for his tone was a little stiff, and she took a bite of cake in the same manner, like a birdie being fed.\nHe stared at her, and found her expression increasingly red.\n“So what do you think?”\n“I-it is delicious…”\n“Not that. I’m asking how do you feel about being fed?”\n“…I would say I am very embarrassed.”\n“Of course, right? You’re going to cause misunderstandings if you do this to others. Do it amongst girls if you need to.”\nNow you understand how I feel,\nso Amane said as he looked aside, “Yes.” but Mahiru replied with a fading voice.\nShe probably did so probably because she treated Amane as a safe person.\nHer subconscious act had him really worried, but it was not a bad feeling, so there was nothing for him to blame her about.\nBut the sweetness lingered in his mouth.\nI’ll be in trouble too if she’s too careless.\nHe was glad to be trusted by Mahiru, but the unwitting careless act was truly astounding.\nSo he concluded as he looked towards a shriveling Mahiru, gently sighing.",

      "content": "“Hey Amane, can we hold a Christmas party at your place?”\n“No.”\nThe sudden proposal was rejected, and Chitose puffed her cheeks massively.\nChristmas Eve was about to come…but it was not an event related to him Amane, who was living alone and away from his family. Chitose and Itsuki wanted to spend it together with Amane, and invited him along.\nSo Chitose came running over to Amane and Itsuki’s classroom during noon break with this idea, but puffed her cheeks with Amane responded so,\n“But you’ll be alone anyway, so what’s the prob…ah, a girlfriend maybe?”\n“No no no no such person exists.”\n“Then it’s fine. Or do you hate it?”\n“Well, if you don’t like it, we’re fine with that, Amane.”\nSo they asked, but they were showing concern for their friend in their own way.\nOr another reason was that they wanted a place where they could freely fawn about.\nBut their apologetic looks left him a little sorry, and he did not hate that idea anyway.\nThe reason why he did not want to was that it would be embarrassing to see their unusually intense skinship at his own place, and he would need to spend much effort explaining to Mahiru.\nTo put it a little more extreme, he would have to tell Mahiru not to show up at his house before they left, and he would have to erase all traces of her existence in the house.\n“Not that I don’t want to…right right, 24th? We’ll split before night, so you can just go around making out and such. Just don’t overdo it in my house.”\nHe was not intending to refuse them outright, so he promised. Chitose’s face broke into a grin.\n“Guess we have no choice. This will be a compromise.”\n“Who do you think you are?”\nChitose was getting a little too carried away, and so Amane pinched his cheek, “Owwieee Ikkkunnnn, Amane is buullllyyinngggg~” she started begging for help in a slurred manner.\n“Come on Amane, stop bullying Chii. Only I get to pinch her cheek.”\n“Yes yes, just pinch her for me.”\n“Leave it to me!”\n“Don’t leave it to himー!”\nHe thought this would be a good chance for them to make out, so he gave Itsuki the chance to pinch her. And as expected, they ended up pinching and fooling around.\nWhile being pinched, Chitose was really grinning away, and Amane merely shrugged at this sight.\n“…Can I go back now?”\nHe said that, but they were in their own classroom, and he wanted to pull his own distance from them.\n“No can do. We need to plan our stuff. Got to prepare cake and food!”\n“I can’t do that.”\nOf course, Amane could not make any food appropriate for Christmas.\nMahiru probably could make a few dishes as usual, but he could not simply go to her for help.\nAmane waved his hand, insisting that he could not do it, but for some reason, Chitose stared at him.\n“What?”\n“It’s like, you can’t cook, but how are you so healthy?”\n“Don’t sweat the little details.”\n“Well Chii, Amane has his own issues too.”\n“Ehh, you know something too, Ikkun?”\n“He said he’ll tell me later.”\n“I didn’t say that.”\nDon’t make promises like that.\nHe glared at Itsuki, but the latter merely laughed out loud.\nA good thing about Itsuki was that he would not press matters, a bad thing is that he could come up with the most outlandish things like an instant inspiration.\n“Goodness…well, we can order a take out for lunch, though we need to book in advance.”\nAmane ignored the probing look as he came up with a realistic proposal.\nOf course, it was without saying that Amane could not bake a cake, and could not cook, so he could only suggest food that was already cooked.\n“Ah, then I want pizza! Let’s go to my usual place to order cake. Should be able to order in advance!”\n“We’re not eating chicken?”\n“But you prefer pizza, Ikkun.”\n“Well of course, you understand me after all, Chii.”\n“Eheheー”\nThey said on their own that they wanted to order pizza, but Amane himself did not dislike that idea, and he too found it fitting for a party.\nAt this rate, it was likely they would be ordering pizza from the shop Amane and Itsuki usually ordered from.\nBut once he heard of pizza, he suddenly thought of Mahiru.\nThe sight of her munching it down like a little animal was truly adorable, for it was because he usually saw her eating elegantly.\nHe recalled the moment when he tried to feed cake to her days ago, and felt his cheeks searing somewhat.\nI’m never doing that again.\nIt would be impossible to do such a shameless act of feeding each other again. They were not the lovey-dovey couple like Itsuki and Chitose, and probably would not have the chance to do so again.\n“…Amane, what’s wrong?”\n“Ah, nothing, nothing at all. I’ll leave the cake preorder to you.”\nFor a moment, Amane was lost in his own thoughts, and a surprised Chitose leaned over at him worriedly. He hurriedly purged that notion from his mind, and reverted back to his usual expression.\n“Yay~! Let’s order pizza too~!!”\nChitose let out an excited squeal, and hearing that, Amane decided to ask Mahiru for her Christmas plans.",

      "content": "“Christmas plans? None at all.”\nOnce she was done washing the dishes, Mahiru sat on the sofa, and answered immediately.\nHe had expected her to have a girls gathering or something, but it seemed she had no such plans.\nPerhaps it was due to the surprised look on Amane’s face, but Mahiru stared back at him, looking dumbfounded.\n“Most of the girls I interact with have their own boyfriends, and I refused any male who invited me out. I do not have any plans at all.”\n“The guys cried huh?”\nMahiru’s defenses were exceptionally stubborn when she was outside, and those boys who had some faint hope in inviting her out could only swallow their tears against it.\nAmane felt amazed that they dared to invite her out. He would not have dared to invite out the Angel if he had no self-confidence. He was really impressed with the optimistic fellows for trying their luck.\n“…Do they really want to spend time with me?”\n“If they’re lucky, they can get closer to you.”\n“For what reason?”\n“To put it, well, dating?”\n“Why do they want to date me?”\n“…They want to do this and that with you after that.”\n“Impure motives?”\nHe quietly said a prayer to all the rejected boys, “Ah, but.” and added on,\n“Not all the guys are like that, so don’t be too suspicious. You should be able to tell what kind of stares they’re giving you.”\n“I guess so. Not all are being so uncouth. You are not one of them, no, Amane-kun?”\n“I’ve never looked at you with impure eyes.”\nWhile he often thought she was cute, and did have thoughts of patting her head at least, he had no intention to do anything more.\nAfter all, if he wanted to, Mahiru would have realized way beforehand, and ostracized him.\nHe got to sit next to her because he was a harmless boy. If he showed even the slightest bit of lechery, she would leave him.\nHe never really had a wish to have a girlfriend, and to him, his hunger was more important, so he had no intention to ruin this relationship.\n“I guessed so. You did not have interest in me from the beginning.”\n“Well.”\n“And so you can be trusted.”\n“Really grateful for that.”\nFor a boy, he could not accept how he was trusted like this, but he was not displeased to be deemed a safe boy for the time being.\n“…So, since you are asking about my Christmas plans, what about yours, Amane-kun?”\n“Hmm? Ahh, Itsuki and co will be here on the 24th. Not too different from usual, but we’ll be a little late for dinner, so I want to tell you this beforehand.”\nFinally, they got back to the original topic, so he explained once again. She nodded in apparent understanding.\n“I understand. Do call for me once the Christmas party is over, and I shall drop by to cook dinner. I shall make preparations before then.”\n“Oh, sorry about that.”\n“I am fine. Please have fun.”\n“…You won’t feel lonely?”\n“I am used to, living alone.”\nHe felt his heart ache a little when she answered as though it had nothing to do with her.\nHer face showed a bitter smile of self-reproach, probably because she was suddenly reminded of her parents.\n“…Ah, erm.”\n“What is it?”\n“…It’s a really rude request, but even if you can’t make it on the Eve, can we stay together for Christmas, like this?”\nFor some reason, this proposal had him really embarrassed.\nHe had no special intent, but a typical invitation for Christmas had a special connotation to it.\nAmane really did not mean anything.\nHe just did not want to see Mahiru looking alone with her head lowered.\nIn response, Mahiru blinked her eyes.\n“Together? To do what?”\n“Eh? Ah, nothing special actually, sorry.”\nOnce this was pointed out, Amane could not bring himself to invite her.\nThere was no way they could have gone out together, considering the troubles caused if he was spotted by others.\nThe only option would be to stay at home, but there was nothing that could really pique Mahiru’s interests.\nThey could only choose to stay together and do nothing, but the vibe would be extremely awkward.\nI guess it might be better for both of us to spend our time away from each other…\nright when he was about to retract his previous thought, Amane found Mahiru staring at him silently.\n“…Then, I want to play, that.”\nUnexpectedly, Mahiru was looking really enthused.\nHer slender finger was pointing at the television.\nOr to be precise, the game console inside the TV board.\nMahiru had been around the past few nights, and Amane never switched on the game, but she looked really interested, “Well, I have never tried that…” She muttered her little wish.\nIt was utterly surreal for a boy and girl to spend Christmas together, playing games, when they were not lovers.\n“No, well, it’s not like you can’t…I guess some games are fine.”\n“We cannot?”\n“No, not that we can’t.”\n“Then, that should be good.”\n“Y-yeah.”\nIs that nough…\nso he wondered, but since this was her wish, he decided to do whatever he could to fulfill it.\nAt the very least, he hoped to bring a little joy to her. He had been in her care all this while, and she never actually requested anything. He was fine with letting her play some of his games.\n“Well, who cares about Christmas, let’s just spend the time as it is.”\n“I guess.”\nMahiru made a little smile that Amane dared not look at directly, and he nodded, nonchalantly turning his face aside.",

      "content": "“Merry Christmas!”\nAnd so it was Christmas Eve.\nIt was already winter break, and on this day, every person spent the time in their own way. Itsuki and Chitose brought their belongings as they gathered at Amane’s house.\nIt was 1pm or so.\nPizza and juice from the usual shop were on the table. They only started at this time however because there were too many orders, and it was pointless to make preorders, as the delivery was really late.\nBut it was not too late to have lunch. They showed up after noon had passed, and did not wait for long. Nobody really minded.\n“Yesyesmerrychristmas”\n“Amane, you’re not getting into it! One more time!”\n“Merry Christmas.”\n“The pronunciation is correct, but you’re still so lethargic, you know?”\nAmane really wished he would not be compared to the already hyperactive Chitose.\nItsuki noticed that Amane was already somewhat enthused, so he coaxed Chitose as he showed his usual hearty, somewhat frivolous smile.\n“Well that’s good enough. Let’s just eat, play and sleep, okay?”\n“Don’t sleep in my house, you idiots.”\n“Just joking. Of course I”m going to sleep at Chii’s house.”\n“Make sure her parents aren’t in.”\n“Ehh~, are you thinking of something H, Amane~?”\nChitose leered away, and Amane ignored her as he went to the kitchen to take out the cutlery and cups.\nWhile she pursed her lips and looked displeased,\nI’ll help out,\nshe chimed in, and followed him.\nOf course, the kitchen was really clean and tidy, since it was already Mahiru’s territory, and the utensils and seasonings already arranged as she pleased.\n“It’s unexpectedly clean.”\n“Thanks for the compliments.”\nHe answered her casually, and took some small places and cups from the utensils, passing half of them to Chitose, only to find her staring at the cupboard.\n“…What?”\n“Nothingー?”\nNimaa,\nhe had a feeling she was going to pester him when she grinned away, a chill rising up his spine, but he insisted on ignoring her.\nHe noticed she had some grave misunderstanding, but he could not figure it out as she did not say what it was.\nShe looked happier, and his cheeks stiffened. They returned to the living room Itsuki was in.\n“But this house sure is clean. It’s so big and tidy.”\nChristmas songs were being played from the room’s speakers. Chitose was almost done eating, looked around the living room with only three people, and muttered.\nThe vast room was due to his parents renting this place, and the tidiness was due to Mahiru helping to clean up this place. “Thanks.” Amane had no comments about it, so he could only answer thus.\n“Well, there was a period when it was really messy~. It’s amazing you got it clean.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Yep yep. Has a female smell to it~”\n“What makes you think that?”\nAmane had no idea how the room being cleaner had anything to do with the presence of a girl.\n“Hmm? Nothing specific. Given your personality, Amane, it doesn’t feel like you’ll be the type to clean the house. There’s also how you arrange the books, the cords, and how you put the things in a way to avoid damaging them. Some utensils aren’t exactly the type you likeー”\n“…My mom’s.”\n“Hmmm?”\nHe did put those things furthest in, but it appeared Chitose noticed them when he took out the cutlery\nAmane himself had insufficient cutlery, so Mahiru brought a few from her own house, but he never expected the crude chatterbox Chitose to notice such fine details.\n“Well, it’s fine anyway? Right Ikkun?”\nAmane made a strange pause, and Chitose stared at him with some intent, before grinning as she leaned towards Itsuki.\nThe latter did not mind as he was probably used to it, and he reached his hand out, having her sit on his thighs, and hugged her. Amane himself really could not bring himself to look.\n“Stop flexing in someone else’s house.”\n“Are you jealous~?”\n“Not really.”\nRather than envy, he might say that he would have enough, so he really wanted them to rein it in. Considering that this was their usual selves, it was unlikely such advice would be heeded.\nChitose continued to cling onto Itsuki’s chest delightedly, looking up at the ceiling and his face.\n“…Is everyone else so touchy feely now?”\n“Don’t forget the folks crying tears of blood right now.”\nIt was impossible to think everyone was doing this same thing. Some would surely be spending time with their families, and their friends. And there were some spending their time alone.\nThere were many who viewed being single as a humiliation, and Chitose’s words might be dangerous if they went public.\n“Do all boys want lovers?”\n“Probably. I don’t really want one though.”\n“But that’s because you’re a weirdo, Amane.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Well, everyone’s looking uneasy before Christmas. Especially the single guys. Speaking of which, there’s a lot of guys who went to the Angel and invited her for Christmas, but she rejected them all. There’s a mountain of corpses. She said she has an appointment with someone, so no.”\n“Heh, is that so?”\nAmane realized that the one she made a promise to was him.\nWhile he felt he became the reason they were rejected, he did not mind her using this excuse, considering the guilt she would have when refusing them. At the very least, she did not use his name, so that was fine.\n“The despair those guys had on their faces were really something. It’s rude, but I just laughed.”\n“Don’t laugh at them.”\n“But well, it’s impossible when they don’t have any relationship, and out of a sudden want to act cool during this event, you know? It’s too late when they never established a proper relationship, and how is it possible to say, we ain’t really close, but let’s spend time together and improve our relationship. Also, there’s the kind of people who say let’s party and seek out the chance for two of them to be alone. That’s scary to any girl, you know?”\nThere is no way she is a loose person who accepts any invites~,\nso Chitose spat her tongue, probably thinking of some bad memories as she clung onto Itsuki.\nWhile Chitose and Mahiru were different, the former was a beauty herself, so she too had her own troubles. Once he considered that popular girls would be troubled by relationships, Amane started to pity her.\n“Well, that Shiina’s not doing well either, given the many invites she got.”\n“…You really don’t have any interest in the Angel huh, Amane?”\n“Sorta.”\n“Amane’s neighbor is the true angel after all.”\n“Want me to chase you out?”\n“Don’t wanna.”\nYou’re annoying.\nAmane glared at Chitose, “Scary.” and the latter said with a silly gesture, clinging onto Itsuki.\n“But you can’t pretend that the neighbor hasn’t been taking care of you.”\nGuh,\nhe was speechless, and she chortled heartily.\n“Stop glaring~. sorry.”\nChitose did not sound apologetic, so Amane glared at her again. “Kyaa~” She made a cute voice, clung onto Itsuki…and looked towards the window behind Itsuki.\nAmane saw her freeze, and wondered what was going on as he too diverted his eyes over. There was a trail of white fluttering down the blue skies.\n“…Ah, Ikkun, look! Snow!”\n“Ohh, a white Christmasー?”\nIt was late December, snow itself was common.\nIt was rare to see snow fall while it was sunny out there, but perhaps it was something to be happy about to the lovers.\nNight had not fallen, but looking at the temperature, it probably would last into the night, a Christmas Eve night coated with snow.\nGuess the couples are going to be excited,\nso Amane thought as he silently watched the couple next to him open the window and get onto the veranda, thinking that they were going to make out for a while as he stood up…only to hear abnormal noises from the veranda.\n“Heh? Wh-why are you here?”\n“E-eh?”\n“Ah.”\nThe last voice he heard was one he was used to recently, the sweet, cool voice.\nHe sensed a bad premonition.\nHe sensed the duo at the veranda looking startled, and hurried over…only to see Mahiru at the veranda, probably looking at the snow, and encountering the duo.",

      "content": "This is terrible.\nAmane looked towards Mahiru who was seated properly next to him, and sighed.\nHe had no choice after the tragedy at the veranda, and could only invite Mahiru in.\nAfter all, if he tried to bluff the couple, those two would have strange ideas on their own. It would be better for him to be honest, and prevent unnecessary guesses and misunderstandings.\nAnd if he did not shush them properly, what would happen next would be really terrifying.\n“…Erm, I am really sorry.”\n“It’s not your fault.”\nMahiru sounded apologetic as much as she could, but this was the one thing she was not at fault at.\nIt was a White Christmas, the first snow of the season, so she could not help but go to the veranda to see the snowfall.\nIf Amane had heard the window open, he would have hurried over to stop the couple, but there so happened to be music blaring, so in fact, he did not hear it.\nMahiru herself probably did her best not to make a sound, and he did not notice.\nLooking at the duo who were reflecting upon their actions, Chitose’s eyes sparkled as she brought her face close.\n“So, your neighbor’s the Angel, Amane!?”\n“Erm, please do not call me Angel if possible…”\nIt appeared the Angel did not want to be called so straight to the face, so she refused demurely. Chitose however leered away, and one had to wonder if she was listening.\nItsuki in turn scratched his cheek as he frowned, looking back and forth between Amane and Mahiru, frowning.\n“Ehh, then…looking at what we know so far, Shiina-san’s living next to Amane, and often cooks for him, am I right?”\n“…Yeah.”\n“We-well…I owe Fujimiya-san a favor, and I saw that he was not eating healthily, so I was worried…”\nMahiru began to explain how the two of them met, and also how the relationship continued; “I see.” so Itsuki answered, but his face showed that he could not accept this explanation, somehow.\nIf he were in Itsuki’s shoes, Amane too would not have accepted this explanation.\nThere was no way an ordinary boy like Amane would have an outstanding girl like Mahiru taking care of him.\n“Hmm, I sorta know what’s going on, but it’s incredible that you don’t have other feelings for Amane, Shiina-san. You’re already a commuting wife.”\n“Pfft.”\nThe term he usually would not hear caused him to snort.\nA commuting wife…the situation did seem similar, now that he mentioned. Every day, Mahiru would cook dinner for Amane, and during rest days, she would accompany him for lunch, and she would occasionally drop by to clean up. It seemed the case, especially when Itsuki mentioned so.\nThe difference was that there was no love between them.\nAnd when Mahiru heard Itsuki say that, she widened her eyes, only to switch to her outside smile, “I have no intention to, and this is impossible.” she denied it.\nAmane imagined her dealing with Itsuki and Chitose in the same manner at school, and felt an itch in his heart.\n“Well, I have no bad thoughts at all, that’s why Shiina’s helping me out.”\n“It’s fine when you say this, Amane, but this is a strange combination…the prodigy’s cooking for you…wait, was the doll given to Shiina-san?”\n“…Sorta.”\n“Heh.”\n“Shut up.”\n“But I haven’t said anything?”\n“Your face is annoying.”\n“Ow!”\nChitose was grinning away…or rather, smirking, leaving him uncomfortable while he was really frustrated.\nThey were checking the facts, so she was not teasing Amane, but he did not want her to be teasing him, for it would affect Mahiru. If possible, he would want to ignore Chitose.\n“Calm down now, you two.”\nItsuki already noticed a change in Amane since the beginning, and did not tease him as Chitose did.\nHe was one who could stop before things got out of hand, and was an observant guy who could read the mood and put himself in other people’s shoes. Amane hoped that Itsuki would stop before this fact was exposed, but it was pointless at this point.\nAfter coaxing a slightly glaring Amane and a thoroughly elated Chitose who had solved the mystery, Itsuki turned his body towards Mahiru and lowered his head for some reason.\n“…Erm, Shiina-san, our Amane has been in your care.”\n“Since when did I become your son?”\n“Same to you. Thank you very much for raising Fujimiya-san well.”\n“Don’t add on to that and make it sound like I’m worthless.”\n“But you’re really worthless.”\n“You bastard.”\nHe had self-awareness, and Itsuki had critiqued him for being too lazy…but he felt conflicted to be pointed out like this.\nIt seemed Mahiru could also play along with this joke as she seized the chance to play dumb, smiling as she watched Amane and Itsuki bicker.\nWhile the smile was not as genuine as the one she would show only to Amane, it was not completely pretentious, and this too left Itsuki with a dumbfounded look.\nStop staring when you have a girlfriend,\nan annoyed Chitose jabbed at Itsuki…no, she was punching at him, which left Amane all the more bemused.\nBut once he saw Mahiru tilt her head in confusion, Amane reverted back to usual as though nothing had happened.\n“…Well, we don’t have a sweet relationship like you two, and it’ll be troublesome if the others are to know. You get that?”\n“Of course. We won’t tell anyone.”\nAmane was subtly threatening Itsuki if he ever told anyone else, but was surprised to see the latter heartily agree.\n“You too, Chitose.”\n“I’m not that talkative~ Nobody will believe that such a cute girl’s making meals for you anyway, Amane.”\n“Sorry for being so incompatible.”\n“I wasn’t going that far~”\nChitose was right, and he had self-awareness.\nNobody would believe that an ordinary boy was taken care of by the school idol they called the Angel.\nAnd if they did, they would lambast him for being incompatible.\nHe did not want others to know, for he expected so. He really did not want the hassle.\nBeing humble, aren’t you?\nChitose chuckled as she stared at Amane, but her stare was seemingly attracted towards Mahiru.\nJii,\nshe stared at the latter with a passionate gaze, sighed, and continued staring.\nMahiru herself was feeling uncomfortable, at a loss of what to do.\n“Erm, what is it?”\n“…Thinking about it again, how are you so cute, Shiina-san ?”\n“Eh? thank you very much……?”\nChitose praised Mahiru, and continued to stare at the latter’s face intently.\n“It’s the first time I’m looking at you up close; you really are so beautiful, an Angel. Pretty face, white skin, long eyelashes, silky hair, slender body.”\n“E-erm…?”\nOnce he noticed Chitose’s bad habits at it again, Amane let out a huge sigh.\nAmane was bad at dealing with Chitose.\nIt was not because he hated her, in fact, he was impressed by her personality…but there were moments when he could not handle her. She got agitated easily, overly concerned at times, and he found it too tiring to deal with. There was another similar person in his household after all, so this awareness was stronger.\nIn other words, the similarity to his mom had him unable to deal with.\nChitose’s personality and likes were similar to Amane’s mom…especially their utter fondness for pretty and cute things.\nMahiru might seem really pitiful if he did not stop Chitose.\nOh goodness.\nAmane grumbled, and dope slapped Chitose on the head right when the latter was about to return her hand out.\nHe did not use much strength as he was just trying to stop and retort, “Owie.” but a shocked Chitose muttered, pulling her hand back from Mahiru.\n“You don’t have to do that.”\n“She’s a shy one. No skinship until you’re familiar with her.”\n“So it’s fine when I’m familiar?”\n“Ask Shiina that. Before that, note which state you’re at.”\nMahiru clearly looked as though she wanted to run away. It seemed his choice to stop Chitose was the right one.\nAnd once she saw how Mahiru was…somewhat perturbed, Chitose seemed to have realized the reason why he stopped her.\n“Sorry about that. I got too excited that I want to touch you.”\n“Y-yes…?”\nChitose’s sudden confession of wanting to touch Mahiru left the latter confused. She did not know what to do, and looked towards Amane, pleading to him for help.\n“AhーShiina, Chitose’s a weirdo, but she’s not a bad person…I think.”\n“Are you even vouching for me? You’re just rubbing it in, aren’t you?”\n“Can you even deny that now?”\n“Not at all!”\nChitose heartily boasted, stared at Mahiru intently, and with a serious look, reached her hand over.\nThis time, she was asking for a handshake.\n“Let’s start from being friends. Please take care of me.”\n“Eh? Y-yes, please take care of me…?”\nUpon being asked to shake hands, Mahiru extended her hand apprehensively.\nChitose would want to be friends with anyone she was interested in, and given her personality, it felt like Mahiru was going to be at her mercy. Well, since they were going to be normal friends, he had nothing to say.\nHe could only hope that Chitose would show some restraint however.\n“Yep yep, a new friendship is born.”\n“Manage your girlfriend already.”\n“I’ll try.”\nAmane retorted at Itsuki, who always let Chitose get away with so much, and sighed again as he saw Chitose grinning away while holding Mahiru’s hands.",

      "content": "“I’m really sorry about that.”\nIt was evening, after Itsuki and Chitose left, and Amane apologized to a clearly weary Mahiru.\nThe latter was immediately harassed by people she did not know, and her secret was revealed. It was likely she too felt perturbed and weary.\nAmane had a feeling this was a deja vu from the last time Shihoko visited.\n“No, it was because I was careless.”\n“She’s noisy, isn’t she?”\n“…A real lively person.”\n“You can just say she’s really noisy.”\n“She is just a little energetic, but an interesting one, I think.”\n“What do you mean, a little…….……well, I guess it’s fine if you don’t mind.”\nAmane felt that Chitose was a loudmouth, but the courteous Mahiru was merely being demure about it, it seemed.\nLuckily, it appeared she did not dislike Chitose, but he did not know whether it would be a good thing to be friends.\nThey had different personalities…and it might be interesting for them to be friends, probably.\nOf course, if she said anything that left Mahiru troubled, he intended to remind her, but he decided to just watch for the time being.\n“I do not have such people around me, so i am a little happy.”\n“Well, it’s rare to see someone like Chitose…smack her on the head if she gets too aggressive, you know?”\n“Vi-violence is not good. I will try to coax her with words.”\nBoth of them felt Chitose would go crazy at times, and there were times she would be passionate about strange things, so such a reminder was necessary.\nSo he swore to remind Chitose later in his heart, and turned towards the window, looking at the falling snowflakes.\nIf not for this weather, this secret would not have been revealed to that couple…but snowfall might be a blessing to the lovers, so he could not complain too much.\nIt appeared Mahiru too liked the snow, and once she noticed Amane staring at the snow, she too enjoyed the sight.\nThe sun had set early as it was winter, the scenery darkening.\nIt was dark enough to be called night, and little snow fell, so one could faintly see snow from the lights in the room\n“It is a white Christmas.”\n“I guess. But it has nothing to do with us.”\n“But they are pretty. Is that not fine?”\nThey were not dating, so the meaning of White Christmas was irrelevant to them…but since Mahiru liked it, perhaps the snow was not bad after all.\nThe fluttering little snowflakes founded a white coating to the darkening world. At the rate the snow fell however, there would not be much piled up, even if it snowed the entire night.\n“But if it snows too much, public transport will be paralyzed. Moderation is best.”\n“You’re being realistic now.”\n“People cannot live on romance after all.”\n“I guess so.”\nThis little conversation might be thanks to the snow.\nBoth of them chuckled, and Mahiru stood up.\n“I shall bring dinner over.”\n“Eh, bring?”\n“I made beef stew just now. Also, two people alone cannot finish a roast turkey.…”\n“I never thought about roasting a turkey entirely.”\n“Well that is because you cannot cook well, Amane-kun. Tomorrow’s lunch will be omelette rice with beef stew.”\n“Sounds delicious for some reason…”\nHe knew before eating that it was going to be delicious, so he was already looking forward to the next lunch before he had this dinner.\n“I prefer the eggs a little more cooked.”\n“A coincidence. I do prefer this traditional style instead. I shall bring the pot here.”\nMahiru teetered out of Amane’s apartment and returned to her own, and as he stared blankly at her back, he recalled the commotion that had occurred in the day.\nIt was really unexpected that they were found out.\nAmane himself was being doubted by the couple, and expected them to be increasingly suspicious of him, …but he never expected that Mahiru would show her face at this moment.\nResults-wise, they explained themselves, they got people who understood them…but he was feeling a little conflicted.\n……If only the secret only to them could last a little longer.\nWhat am I thinking?\nAt the very least, he did not need to play hide and seek with those two, and it would be easier on his life, yet he felt a little gloomy. He too felt perturbed, not knowing what it was.\nIt was not a bad result, but he just felt something was amiss.\n“Is something the matter?”\n“…It’s nothing.”\nMahiru returned with the pot in her hands, tilting her head in confusion as she stared at Amane, but after all, he could not express this ambiguous feeling to her outright.\nAs he struggled to maintain the same facade, Mahiru tilted her head in confusion the entire time, not understanding why.",

      "content": "“…Haa, it’s delicious.”\nMahiru’s cooking was delicious, as usual.\nIt was Christmas, so the dishes served were a little more intricate.\nThe beef stew Mahiru made was converted into a pot pie, and they were slicing and eating it.\nThey enjoying cutting the pie, the crispiness matched with the rich sauce of the beef stew could only be said to be a blissful moment.\nIt appeared Mahiru bought flour just for the pie, and he was impressed by her outstanding skills, letting out a sigh after eating the second cake for the day.\nJust to note, the cake was baked by Mahiru.\nWhile baking the pot pie, she used said flour to combine with a sweet dough, making mille-feuille. She was already at the level of a pâtissier.\n“Glad to see you like it…you ate quite a lot.”\n“Nn. they’re really delicious.”\n“Thank you very much.”\nHe was getting used to her smile.\nShe would smile whenever he praised her cooking, and so it became a daily routine.\nIt seemed Amane had a special privilege to see a much tender expression from her, and he felt ticklish.\n.\n“…Omelette rice tomorrow…I’m looking forward to it.”\n“You like that?”\n“Anything with eggs.”\n“You really like eggs, I suppose…I remembered you wolfing down the egg rolls and such.”\n“Can’t help it, it’s delicious.”\nEven though he liked egg dishes, he would not eat them if they were not delicious. He had such an appetite because Mahiru’s cooking was really delicious.\nHe felt it was excessive of him to be this selfish, but Amane had no intention of sharing Mahiru’s cooking with anyone else, and would continue to enjoy it until she would stop.\n“…Amane-kun, you look happy when you eat.”\n“Well. I am happy. Your cooking’s really delicious, Mahiru.”\n“Thank you for the compliments, but this happiness sure is small.”\n“No, it’s high praise…understand your own worth…”\nAfter all, it was that Angel’s cooking, and some boys would have dreamed to have the privilege to taste it.\n“It is something I do every day though.”\n“But I’m still very happy with that.”\n“…Really?”\n“Of course. I get to eat good food every day.”\nAmane himself had little material desire, and a stronger desire for food. His biggest happiness was to be able to eat fresh, delicious food every day.\n“How are you able to make such dishes?”\n“Someone who once took care of me said,\nif you want someone who can give you happiness, capture the stomach\n.”\n“Sorry for letting you capture my stomach.”\n“Just think of it as practice.”\nMahiru smiled, and his heart unwittingly jolted.\n“…But the person who raised you is really amazing.”\n“Yes. That person’s cooking is really delicious, and I cannot beat that. The cooking is filled with the taste of happiness.”\nAs he saw her smile gently, looking into the distance, Amane felt a little relieved.\nIt appeared that Mahiru really was doted on by the person who took care of her, and it was obvious that she respected that person.\nMahiru was treated coldly by her parents, and that person took their place to teach her many important things.\nShe must have been truly lucky to be next to that person.\nFrom the sound of it, it appeared to be a lady. Amane felt that Mahiru could live a normal life because of that person.\n“Sounds like it’s really delicious, but for me, yours is the taste of happiness.”\nLeaving aside his mom, his dad’s cooking was good too, but Amane’s tastebuds preferred Mahiru’s cooking.\nHer cooking was one of comfort, the type he would not get sick of, peaceful and yet leaving him with anticipation. He would not get sick of her cooking, and would even demand more of it.\nBut it was too much of a burden on Mahiru, so he would not say these words.\nSo he nodded away, and saw her freeze.\nOne could say that perhaps it was unexpected to her….for she stared back at him, looking immature and dazed.\n“…Mahiru?”\n“Eh…I am fine.”\nOnce she heard that voice, Mahiru reeled, shook her head, and looked down.\nShe clung onto the cushion she loved, exhaled slightly. Unlike before, he could sense a strange charm from her.\n“What is it?”\n“…I am just thinking, if I can make such a happy taste.”\n“Well, I don’t know why you’re being humble, but your daily cooking’s delicious, and I want more.”\n“Ah, thank you very much.”\nShe peeked up at him, looking a little bashful, yet satiated as she smiled. This time, it was Amane who looked down and wanted to bury his face.\nHis heart jolted once she showed that extremely rare expression of hers, even though he did not like her as someone of the opposite gender.\nShe had removed her usual facade, showing a completely defenseless smile, and all Amane wanted to do was to cool his face down.\nHe did not want to expose this slowly rising heat in his heart, and it would be really awkward for both of them to be bashful.\n“Ahh, erm…yeah, Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“We’re starting from noon tomorrow, right?”\nHe changed the topic, unable to take this mood, but she did not appear to mind as she considered his suggestion.\n“Yes, we did agree, no? Lunch for dinner, and then the games we promised…right?”\n“Yep.”\n“Erm…you do not like it?”\n“Not at all. Just checking with you…the Eve’s over, but can we really spend Christmas like this?”\n“I would not have said so if I hated it…looking forward to it.”\nOnce again, she showed a little smile on her face. Amanee could not look at her, and just mumbled away as he leaned on the armrest opposite her, hiding his own shame.",

      "content": "The following day, Mahiru arrived at the house, looking a little apprehensive.\nShe was nervous about going to the house of the opposite gender on a holiday…not. Mahiru was earnest in wishing that she got to play games, and she could not contain her excitement.\nIt was said this was her first time playing video games, and in this sense, one might call her a Princess oblivious to the ways of the world.\n“I shall begin making lunch then.”\n“Nn, cook the eggs a little more please.”\n“I understand.”\nEven though the customer was being extra demanding, her mood was not dampened as she hurriedly put on the apron, hurried to the kitchen, and began preparations for lunch. Surely she was in a really good mood.\nHe felt a little ashamed to know she was really looking forward to this, itchy even.\nWell, she’s just looking forward to playing games.\nDefinitely not that she was looking forward to playing games together with him.\nSo he gave a wry smile as he stared at the swaying ponytail.\n“…How do I control this?”\nAfter lunch, they sat on the sofa before the TV, staring at the screen.\nHe tried asking her what games she wanted to play, but once he knew she had no idea of the genres, he had no choice but to choose a nationally famous 2D game, and handed her the controller…as expected, she was flailing all over, not knowing what to do.\n“Erm well, first if you want to move, use this stick, and use this button to jump…”\nThat Mahiru was usually so poised, yet at this point, she was looking back and forth at the TV and the controller in confusion, controlling it, and Amane found it extremely rehabilitating for some reason.\nShe was not used to playing games, but it was the first time he saw someone play so casually.\nAfter seeing her unable to evade the enemy’s attacks a few times and die, he realized that even the Angel herself had things she was bad at.\n“…I cannot win.”\n“You didn’t beat an enemy, let alone clear a stage.”\n“You are noisy.”\n“Well, just get used to it. It’s all muscle memory.”\nEverything’s a challenge, once she heard those words, Mahiru got down to playing the game again.\nHe felt a little encouraged seeing Mahiru challenge an entertaining game with such a serious face, and showed a smile.\nHowever, she always lost to the first enemy, and once he saw that she never progressed, he started to feel uneasy, rather than bemused.\nShe looked towards him.\nMuuuu,\nhe could hear the sound effect from her mouth, but he probably was thinking too much.\n“Ahh see, this is how you do it.”\nIf they stopped here, her motivation would be drained, so he put his hands on the controller she was holding, demonstrating to her.\nAmane himself had cleared this game a few times, and easily cleared the areas she had difficulty clearing.\nIn fact, she was really terrible at this, and even an ordinary person would not be stuck here…but he kept silent on this.\n“Look, this enemy moves random at the same speed, but once you see it speed up towards your character, just time here and jump…”\nHe operated the controller, nearly covering her little hands as he made some explanation, demonstrating to her.\nOn the screen, the character did as Amane explained, and evaded the enemy.\nIt was not some amazing move, but it was a new experience for Mahiru who kept failing, “Woah.” so she blurted.\nThe eyes ornamented by her long eyebrows widened, her expression cheerful.\nHe smiled when he saw how delighted Mahiru was, and as they were too close to each other, he discovered that her lower eyelashes were really long, and smiled a little as he saw how elated she was.\nHe looked down at her nice sidelong face, and she might have noticed his stare, for she turned her eyes towards him.\nHe had leaned over to her before this, wanting to reach the controller in her hands, so they were closer than he imagined.\nTheir elbows were already touching, and they were so close, he could sense her breathing through his skin. Thus, her warmth and sweet scent reached him.\n“Sorry.”\nOnce he noticed that his hands were about to wrap around hers, he hurriedly pulled his body back, and only then did she seem to realize, blinking a few times, her eyes starting to daze.\n“It…It is fine. I should be the one saying sorry.”\nOnce he noticed her face starting to turn red, he felt regret.\nShe did not like body contact, and no matter how familiar the two of them were, she might feel displeased about having her hands touched.\nShe appeared to be a little bashful, but she did not seem repulsed.\n“I’m really sorry.”\n“Erm, I really do not mind, you know?”\n“You don’t hate it?”\n“…It shocked me, but not that I hate it. You are not someone I do not know after all.”\nIt appeared the magnanimous Angel had forgiven his insolence.\nSince she decided to let bygones be bygones, he felt relieved, and they played the game again.\nThis time, he decided to let Mahiru play on her own, and looked towards the screen…only to see her die again. At that moment, he was seriously wondering how he should improve her gaming skills.\nThe result was that she managed to stumble past the first stage, and he decided not to play this game.\nIt was deflating for a complete novice to keep dying, so he intended for her to try a different game to reduce stress.\n“Mahiru, you’re tilting your body.”\nThey decided to play a racing game, common in the real world…and Mahiru tilted her body.\nThis game was not controlled by gyro forces, and the controller itself had no gyro sensor.\nThere was no need for her to tilt her body…but it might be a subconscious act as she tilted left and right while holding the controller.\nShe was focused on the game, and did not answer.\nThis game seemed easier to pick up, unlike the previous one, for people these days appeared to have fewer chances of riding a car. Her skills were terrible, but at the very least, she could play.\nShe swayed her body with a really serious look, trying her best to move the car.\nShe’s really cute.\nIt was strangely cute to see Mahiru rolling around like humpty dumpty, and the serious look on her face as she struggled to play the game with all her might added to that.\nOnce there was a large curb, Mahiru naturally tilted her body greatly.\nPomf,\nonce she landed on Amane’s thighs, the latter struggled not to laugh.\n“…Actually, you don’t have to turn your body about, you know?”\n“I-I am not doing this on purpose.”\n“Yep, I know that, but you were tilting.”\nHe tried his best to stop his lips from shaking, and lifted her up.\nBut it was to be expected, given how fluffy and light she was. One reason was that she was petite, but her body was so slender, he felt it could snap at any moment, and he hesitated over whether he should touch her.\nMahiru, lifted up by Amane, was shivering out of shame with her cheeks red.\nShe truly was adorable like a little animal, and he finally ended up bursting out laughing.\n“Are you taking me for a fool?”\n“No no no, I just want to smile.”\n“So you are taking me for a fool.”\n“Do you think I will take a serious person as a fool?”\n“I do not think so…”\n“See? I just find you cute.”\n“…The cute you refer to surely refers to how you want to smile at an adorable child.”\nShe appeared to be pouting as she said this, and might be really unhappy if he overdid it, so he decided to stop expressing his thoughts at this point.\nIt was fine for him not to show what he was thinking on his face, so he quietly thought.\nShe looked a little displeased, and when he smiled at her, she turned aside with a hmph.",

      "content": "There were a few situations where the Angel nearly kicked up a fuss, but once she got back to gaming, she discarded all these thoughts and reverted to looking serious again.\nShe was starting to get used to the game, after stumbling around in the beginning, and finally could play a little, catching up to the pace.\nIt was because it was a different game from the one she played at first, a game of controlling a car.\nShe often crashed out of the course, into the mud or into the wall, but she could drive the car forward.\nHe was worried that Mahiru, being bad at games, would have driven off in the opposite direction, but she was doing better than expected, and he felt relieved.\nSo he split the screen in half, joining in the game, but the subconscious gestures she did left him a little uncomfortable.\nShe seemed to have a tendency of tilting her body about, sometimes putting her head near his elbow, and then turning aside, repeating over and over again.\nAnd whenever that happened, there was a nice smell , leaving him unable to remain calm.\nWell, they were still racing at the lowest difficulty, so he was winning the entire time.\n“…How are you so fast?”\n“Got used to it.”\nAfter playing a few times, he memorized the track, and the turns were easier. Even when the opponents were trying to obstruct, he could adjust his camera angles or the obstacles to stop them.\nHe showed a wry smile while Mahiru looked incredulous, before switching back to single player mode.\nConsidering her lack of experience, he felt she should practice more on a large screen. It was better for her to race against the CPU than to race him and lose confidence.\nLuckily, she was still motivated, and kept staring at the monitor intently even in single player mode\nIf she kept this up, she should be able to deal with the CPU players, somehow.\nHe was relieved to see that her status as a hard work applied on games too, and snickered away. It seemed Mahiru had realized this too, as she slapped him on the thigh a few times.\nThe humorous reaction had him chortling, and so she frowned, muttering “Amane-kun no baka”.\n“I won.”\nIt took her at least two hours.\nMahiru stared intently at the glowing words indicating she was first, and looked towards Amane proudly.\nAfter a long battle against the TV, she won the glorious first place.\nAfter countless experiences of being last, she kept standing on the race tracks despite coming in last several times, slowly improved her rankings, and finally won. Surely she was really moved.\nI finally did it,\nso the proud expression on her face, and Amane earnestly applauded her.\n“That’s great. I saw your hard work.”\n“Yes.”\nShe was happy to be praised, and looked bashful, her usual expression softening a little.\nIt was not a simple obvious, smile, but one filled with utter, faint elation. It was so unimaginably sweet compared to the usual aloofness she showed.\nRecently, her aloof face would show an expression befitting a girl her age, but on this day, this expression was more fitting than usual, and was overwhelmingly adorable.\nIt was an innocent, pure smile, eroding away at Amane’s sanity, and the desire to pat her on the head arose.\nHis mind unwittingly ordered his arm as it went along with the impulse to pat her like a kitten…before he hurriedly retracted the hand he unwittingly raised.\n“What is it?”\n“Ahh not. Just think that you played too much.”\n“Have I improved?”\n“Yep yep. A lot better than when you first started.”\n“Thank you very much. I enjoyed myself, and started working hard.”\nFufu,\nso Mahiru chuckled, but Amane could not continue to look at her as he tried to disguise his motive, taking out a little box from a basket in a cupboard.\n“Here’s your reward for coming in first.”\n“Eh, erm, there is no need for that.”\n“If you don’t want a reward, just take it that you got it from a certain fat white bearded grandpa.”\nYes, it was the Christmas present he had forgotten to give the previous day.\nIt was difficult for him to choose a present, given how close her birthday was to Christmas, but he so happened to fancy an item, and did not suffer as much as he did for her birthday.\nOnce she heard the words Christmas present, it appeared she was reminded that it was Christmas as she blinked away a few times, before cautiously receiving the item.\nYou can open it now,\nso he said, and she cautiously unpacked the item.\nWell, it’s not a big deal.\nShe opened the box, and slowly retrieved a leather key case.\nShe would be troubled if he gave her an expensive item, so he did not choose a branded item, merely an item with a simple design, befitting Mahiru.\nIt was a simple item engraved with flowers and vines, one designed to be suitable for daily use. He was unfamiliar with flowers, and did not know what was engraved, but once he saw the fine shapes, he felt it would fit Mahiru, and chose it.\n“Well, I gave you an extra key. You don’t have to use this though.”\n“No, I will gracious use this. You have keener eyesight than I expected, Amane-kun.”\n“What do you mean, expected.”\n“You normally wear a sweatshirt and jerseys, so I thought you have some problems with your fashion sense.”\n“I don’t have any other practical clothing.”\nAfter all, he never got a chance to show himself being dressed up, and he would avoid doing so given how much of a hassle it was. Thus, the only modes he had been in were in school uniform, and in the warm house.\nThus, he might have given her a horrid impression of his fashion sense, but it would not be erased, for it really was terrible.\n“…You look handsome when you tidy up a little. You did that back when you were in middle school, Amane-kun.”\n“Mom forced me to…wait, how did you know?”\n“Shihoko-san sent me a photo, saying『he looks like this when he dolls up a little』…”\n“Damn her.”\nThere was a moment when he was forced to wear outdoor clothing because of his mom’s work. He never expected her to leak the photo, and quietly harbored loads of complaints towards her.\n“…That dress up doesn’t suit me.”\n“Is that so? I think you are just avoiding other people’s stares and hiding your eyes behind your bangs, Amane-kun, but your face is relatively handsome…”\nHer little hand extended towards Amane’s face.\nHer white palm lifted his bangs, and touched his forehead, his vision made wider than before.\nIt had been a while since his vision was so vast, except when entering the bath. His eyes looked towards Mahiru, who looked a little shocked.\nHe felt it was not something worth being shocked about, and while not particularly handsome, he had an ordinary face. He was thus incredulous as to why Mahiru was staring at him.\n“…What?”\n“Nothing. I just find your eyes livelier than before.”\nMonths ago, Mahiru said that his eyes looked dead, and while it really was rude, he could not deny that. At this point, she was staring up at Amane.\nThere was no way he was becoming any handsome the more she stared, but she continued to stare at Amane silently.\nHe was abashed to be stared at by someone of the opposite gender, especially a really pretty girl.\nHowever, he was not one to take his punishment alone, and as payback, he grabbed some of the sidelong hair on her cheek, showing her pretty face.\nWhile he was apprehensive about touching her, since she touched his hair without thinking, he should be fine. After all, he was just touching her head, and he hoped he was safe.\nBut seriously, she’s really a beauty.\nLooking at her once again, he was amazed by how beautiful Mahiru was.\nShe might be far prettier than the pretty ladies in the magazines scattered around his house, more attractive even.\nAfter all, photos could not be trusted.\nThey merely captured moments, and could be enhanced. One could publish it as it was, beautify it, or even falsify it.\nAt this point, Mahiru’s beauty and cuteness was undoctored.\nAs he continued to stare at this pretty face he would not get tired of, her eyes started to blur.\nWhy so?\nSo he wondered, but she removed her hand from his hair, and looked down.\nShe fidgeted about, looking very uncomfortable. She put her controller down, and lifted the cushion next to her.\n“Erm. Well…yes. I too have a Christmas present for you.”\n“O-oh, thanks.”\nBefore he could ask what was going on, Mahiru took out a wrapped item from the bag she covered by the side.\n“I shall prepare, dinner then.”\n“Eh? A-ah okay…?”\nSo she said, and hurried to stand up. Faced with this overly rapid development, he was at a loss.",

      "content": "Christmas had passed, and the world was now entering the end-of-year mood.\nThe night lights remained as they were, but the commonplace Christmas trees had been down, the various vibrant decorations replaced with Japanese ones.\nThe shops had begun selling New Year goodies and foods, and all signs of the Holy Night were nowhere to be seen.\nChange sure comes quickly\n, so Amane thought as he looked at how everyone was preparing for the new year around him, burying his face in the muffler to keep warm.\nThe monotone checkered muffler was the Christmas present he received from Mahiru.\nIt is important to dress the neck too, or so he was told, before receiving such a great gift from her. It was really comfortable, great at keeping himself warm, practical, and trendy looking.\nAmane was not one to wear mufflers, but seeing as how he had received it from Mahiru, he wore it gratefully. He checked the contents of the shopping bag in his hand.\nWhile they were supposedly splitting the shopping duties, it was Amane who typically bought the ingredients according to the note he would bring along, all to alleviate Mahiru’s burden.\nIt was extremely cold, and a hotpot appeared to be on the menu, for the bag contained vegetables, mushrooms, meat and the like. There were more vegetables, probably because of Mahiru’s insistence on balanced nutrition.\nOnce he saw that he did not miss out on any ingredient, he hurried home, grumbling as the weather got colder.\n“Welcome back.”\nIt was evening when he returned, and Mahiru welcomed him back.\nIt was a strange situation when an unrelated outsider welcomed him home, but recently, he was getting used to it.\n“Nn, I’m back…you don’t mind that I bought some sliced rice cakes?”\n“You are intending to scrub the pot, no?”\n“Oh. I bought some ramen for later too.”\n“…I cannot eat that much, you know?”\n“It’s fine, I’ll finish off most of it.”\nWhile Amane was not a big eater to begin with, thanks to Mahiru’s cooking, he was eating lots for dinner.\nHer food intake was sufficient enough for her to not gain fat, for she might have been worried about the calories intake; Amane was a little worried as he would eat more than her, and had begun training his muscles.\nPerhaps Mahiru was thinking Amane should have some extra meat since he was so skinny. He hoped to gain muscles, and not fat.\n“Well, it is fine if you are eating that, Amane-kun. Please give me that, I shall put it in the refrigerator. Do wash your hands, Amane-kun.”\n“Got it.”\nAmane handed the shopping bag over to Mahiru, and went straight to the washroom.\n“Anyway Mahiru, how do you normally spend your New Year?”\nAmane finished the dinner that was really delicious, as usual, and was cleaning up when he suddenly asked Mahiru in the spur of the moment.\n“I find it pointless to head back during the New Year…so I remain here.”\nHe realized his miscue when he heard such a flat tone from her, but Mahiru did not appear to mind.\nShe was not on familial terms with her parents, so she would always act aloof whenever they talked about her family.\nBut in that case, would Mahiru be spending the New Year alone?\nAmane had a promise to meet his own family once semi-annually, and before he met Mahiru, he had intended to take a long vacation at his hometown.\n“You are going back to your hometown, Amane-kun, no?”\n“I guess. They told me to show up anyway.”\nHe glanced aside at Mahiru, and perhaps it was just him, but her eyes seemed colder than usual.\nIt appeared she had expected to spend the New Year alone, and never doubted that Amane would return to his hometown.\n“…I get the feeling that if I go back, I’ll be questioned about you.”\n“That will be tough.”\n“I just need to explain to my dad, but mom probably wants to hear more about it.”\n“That will be strange given that we are often in contact.”\n“Seriously, since when did you get so familiar with my mom…?”\nOne had to wonder why and when Mahiru was on good terms with his mom, and for some reason, they were sharing photos and secrets …he felt a little weary just thinking about it, but it appeared Mahiru was interacting with her willingly , unexpectedly well in fact, so he felt that was acceptable, somewhat.\nAmane would have to hammer the point into Shihoko not to say anything unnecessary, but leaving that aside, he looked towards Mahiru, not knowing what to do.\nHe imagined her occasional hollow expression and forlorn eyes, and had the urge…not to leave her alone.\n“Well, you just met mom, so sorry about dad, but I think I don’t have to return to my hometown this time. I’ll go back during Spring break after all.”\nThus, if it was not trouble for her, he hoped to have dinner with her, like usual.\n“…I see.”\n“Nn, I want your Toshikoshi soba.”\n“You are quite the glutton.”\n“Because it’s your cooking.”\n“…Even though it is sold outside?”\n“That’s good enough.”\nHe was fine even though it was just soba bought from the market.\nMore importantly was the leisure time they could spend eating together.\n“…You are eccentric.”\n“Shut up.”\nMahiru curtly blurted, and Amane deliberately responded in annoyance, only to be met with a little smile.\n“…Thank you very much.”\n“For what?”\n“Everything.”\nMahiru said nothing more, and she embraced her favorite cushion, probably feeling somewhat better than before, her face looking brighter.",

      "content": "It was December 31st, New Year’s Eve.\nIt was the last day of the year, the day to cap off the whole year.\nIt was supposedly a frenetic day for many to prepare for the New Year, to do a major clean up—\n“Erm, Mahiru-san, ya?”\n“What is it?”\n“…Is it really fine for me to just laze around?”\nAmane was relaxing leisurely on the living room sofa, watching the back of Mahiru as she stood in the kitchen with an apron on.\nMahiru arrived since morning to prepare the Osechi dishes.\nSince they decided to spend the New Year together, two people’s worth of Osechi dishes would be a must.\nHe had intended to simply buy some from the shops, but she insisted on making them. It was shocking how a fine high school girl could handle something so troublesome even for housewives.\nHe was really impressed by her, but she said,\n“We need to order that in advance. It is impossible to do so now.”\nHe understood the reason why Mahiru would personally prepare them once he heard her explanation, but he really had to tip his hat to Mahiru for undertaking such a laborious task.\nOf course, Mahiru would skimp on any step she could. Cooking the black beans would take time, and take up a stove, so she bought them at the market instead.\n“Amane-kun, you may feel uneasy about not having anything to do, but do you think you can contribute?”\n“Nope.”\n“I guessed so. It is better for you to remain there obediently than to cause me trouble.”\nSo he obediently remained on the sofa after Mahiru stated her harsh viewpoint, but he was restless as he had nothing to do.\nHowever, it was not that Amane never did anything at all.\nThey finished cleaning up the previous day, and they had enough ingredients to last for a little while without having to go outside, including those to be used for Osechi.\nNot that he did not do anything; he did not exert much effort compared to Mahiru at this moment.\n“You should be tired since you moved the furniture and appliances yesterday. Please rest well.”\nMahiru voiced her concern to Amane, who did the heavy work, as she continued to cook without looking back at him.\nJust to note, it appeared Mahiru was done cleaning her apartment. She said she would clean it up regularly, and it did not take her much time.\n“Well, you say that, but…I feel a little sorry.”\n“I do not feel tired since I do like to cook though.”\n“But then.”\n“It is fine. I really enjoy this.”\nDo not sweat it,\nso Mahiru implied as she focused on her work. Amane cupped his head, not knowing what to do.\n“Mahiru, I bought lunch.”\nAmane realized it was overbearing to have her prepare lunch when she was cooking Osechi, and bought lunch from the convenience store. A sandwich pack should be fine, given that Mahiru would not eat much.\nMahiru took off the apron, probably intending to rest, so this might have been perfect timing to her.\n“Thank you very much for doing this. Sorry that I do not have the time to do so.”\n“No actually, I’ll be sorry to ask you to make you do that when you’re making Osechi…here, eat up.”\nIt was rest time, and lunch, so Mahiru obediently returned to the living room.\n“A sandwich and café au lait for you?”\n“Yes, thank you very much.”\nShe nodded, received lunch from Amane, and sat next to him.\n“How’s your progress?”\n“Some are already done, since they are bought, and I am almost done since I have kept the dishes minimal, most of them are simply waiting to be cooled. Since it looks like you like Datemaki, I decided to make them for you, Amane-kun.”\n“How do you know?”\n“You said you like egg dishes, no?”\nIt appeared she had baked it in the oven, for Amane had heard it being used, though he had wondered what it was for. So that was what she was making.\n“You like a little sweetness in that, I suppose?”\n“You really understand me well.”\n“It has been months, I can remember what you like.”\nFor some reason, she sounded happy when she said that as she munched on the ham and lettuce sandwich.\nAmane ate the onigiri he bought as he looked over at the kitchen, staring at the Jūbako Mahiru brought and left there.\nThat Jūbako would be used, it seemed.\nAmane never expected her to have a Jūbako even though she was living alone, taken aback even when he found it to be posh look, with gold plating on it.\n“Seriously, I’ve to be grateful about this…how do I put it, when I started living alone, I never expected to be so nourished in the latter half of the year.”\n“I myself am amazed that you are able to live till this day.”\n“That’s harsh. I can survive on convenience store stuff and what’s sold out there, you know?”\n“But that is not healthy, goodness.”\nMahiru sighed while looking dumbfounded, but there was a grimace in the sly dig, her expression clearly going, guess I have to do something, and that caused his heart to jolt.\n“With me living here, I will not allow for any unhealthy eating habits, you know?”\n“Are you my mom?”\n“It is your fault for being so callous about it, Amane-kun. I am making sure you will eat healthier next year.”\nMahiru appeared invigorated for some peculiar reason,\nso we’re together next year too?\nHe was a little embarrassed by that thought, and averted his eyes.\nHowever, Mahiru took that attitude of his as an intent to skimp and live lazily, and she stared back in annoyance. It took him quite a while and lots of effort to explain that he did not mean that.",

      "content": "The sun was about to set when Mahiru was done with all the dishes, and left them in the Jūbako. This time, she began preparing dinner.\nThat was the case, but their dinner would be Toshikoshi soba, so all they needed to do was to boil pre-cooked soba, and add ingredients to them.\nThe kamaboko was excess leftover that could be added. They just needed to boil the spinach and dice the leek.\nThe most taxing work would be to deep fry the prawn tempura, but Mahiru kept deep frying them without annoyance.\n“Since we have extra pumpkin, let us make tempura out of it too.”\n“Ohh…that’s quite the fancy Toshikoshi soba.”\n“It is fine once in a while.”\nMahiru said as she finished the Toshikoshi soba, and it certainly was fancier than the one he had back home.\nEach had two large prawn tempuras, along with pumpkin tempura, and lots of spinach and leek. The kamaboko was served in a fan shape, giving a refreshing look.\nAlso, it appeared Mahiru preferred to put the tempura atop, to keep it crispy; Amane’s tempura was served separately on another plate instead, which left him very grateful.\n“Woah.”\n“Please help yourself.”\nShe served some excess Osechi dishes on small plates, probably thinking Amane would not have enough to eat.\nHe saw Mahiru sit down, they clapped hands to give thanks, and began eating the soba.\nIt was pre-packed, but the fragrance of the soba spread as he bit into it, probably because it was a little expensive. Amane took a bite, and the fragrance of the soba spread.\nThe soup too was neither too thick nor too diluted, leaving him at ease. The warmth spread from the belly, the flavor suitable for the harsh winter.\n“Haaー…now this feels like the end of year…”\nHe drank the soup…exhaled deeply, and muttered.\nWatching TV at home, eating soba, waiting for the New Year; a nice feeling it was.\nIt was a yearly tradition for Amane to spend time back home eating Toshikoshi soba, waiting for the New Year, and watching the contest, and he was grateful to be able to do the same this year. Though, the one next to him was not his family, but an acquaintance girl.\n“You know, eating Toshikoshi soba like this, It does feel like a year’s ending before we know it.”\n“Truly…lots of things happened this year.”\nSo they said, but most of these things were his interactions with Mahiru.\nWhen he started living alone, he never imagined such a pretty girl to cooking for him, not at all.\n“Amane-kun, this is your first year living alone. It must have been tough on you.”\n“You’re rather used to it yourself.”\n“Well, I can handle most of my business. It is a no go for you to live alone without knowing how to do anything, Amane-kun?”\n“Grrr…well, you say that.”\n“You truly are a hopeless person, goodness.”\nMahiru reproached him with a smile, rather than simply looking bewildered, her face looking tender.\nShe maintained a genial smile, not thinking that it would be a hassle to take care of Amane, it seems.\n“…I’ve really been in your care this year.”\n“Of course.”\nIt stung his heart to affirm this readily, but luckily, Mahiru herself did not seem unwilling.\n“…Please continue to do so next year.”\n“Understood. You will be completely useless and wasted without me around, Amane-kun.”\n“I can’t deny that.”\n“…If you understand, you should pay more attention to that, you know?”\n“Take it as a next year goal.”\nEven if he had the heart to do so, his determination would wilt after Mahiru had taken care of him so thoroughly. He kept his thoughts to himself however, and never mentioned about it.\nOf course, he would tidy up his stuff from time to time—but it should be fine for him to ask her to cook.\nHe found himself enslaved to her cooking, but at this point, it did not matter to him.\nMahiru told him to change for the better, but he would ultimately be laughed at. He maintained a stiff look, and Mahiru showed a little smile on her face.\n“The new year is coming soon.”\n“Yeah.”\nThey finished the Toshikoshi soba, and were seated on the sofa, watching the TV concert. Before they knew it, time passed, and a new day loomed.\nIt appeared Mahiru would not watch the TV unless it was necessary, and did not seem familiar with the trendy songs. He saw her enjoy the concert silently, and time passed faster than he imagined.\nThe screen then showed the Joya-no-kane, and he was reminded once again that a new year was looming.\nNext to him, Mahiru’s eyelids were falling as she silently listened to the bell.\nAnd after hearing the 107th bell—\n“Happy New Year.”\nThe moment the day changed, she straightened her back as she turned towards Amane, bowing down, and Amane too followed suit with this New Year greeting.\n“Happy New Year…it’s strange, two of us spending the New Year together like this.”\n“Fufu, I guess…please continue to take care of me this year.”\n“Same here…I guess I should be the one asking you that.”\n“I cannot deny that.”\nAmane replied a giggling Mahiru with a wry smile, and then noticed the smartphone on his knees shaking.\nIt seemed Itsuki and Chitose had sent a few New Year greetings over, there were a few numbers on the app icons.\nMahiru too experienced the same, her smartphone was shaking. She had just known Chitose, and never exchanged IDs, so the messages should be from friends Amane knew not of.\nThe recent trend of delivering New Year greetings as messages had made things convenient.\n“I shall reply to a few messages.”\n“Same here.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had received lots of greetings. For some reason however, he felt she never informed any boy on how to contact her.\nAs she began replying nimbly,\nShe’s really like a high school girl here\n, he thought as he replied to Itsuki and Chitose.\nThe messages were normal,\n“Happy New Year”\nand\n“Are you spending the New Year with Shiina-san?”\nThey were right on the mark, but he replied denials to them anyway.\n“Stop lying now”\nItsuki immediately replied, and the process of teasing and being teasing repeated itself again.\nSuddenly, there was weight upon his arms. He then had a whiff of sweet fragrance.\nOh no,\nso he looked sideways tentatively…and found Mahiru leaning on him with her eyes closed.\n—Wait wait wait.\nHe did not voice out, but he was rather flustered.\nThere were cases of her falling asleep, but who would have expected her doing so next to him, leaning on his shoulder?\nNo further thought was needed to understand why Mahiru had fallen asleep.\nIt was past midnight at this point.\nIt was expected that Mahiru, living the prim and proper life, would not stay up late. Furthermore, she was busy making Osechi the entire day, and though she did not show it, she must have been really worn out.\nThere was no doubt she had no resistance against the sleep demon.\nHe understood the reason.\nHe knew, but he never expected her to do so at this moment.\nMahiru fell asleep while leaning on Amane, ignoring how flustered and gaudy the latter was as she showed a serene sleeping face. The long eyebrows, nice nose, pink lips were all defenseless.\nIt was not the first time he saw her sleeping face, but it was the first time he did so up close, and he froze up.\n“Mahiru, wake up.”\nHe called out worriedly, but there was no response.\nShe had fallen into a deep slumber, devoured by the sleep demon as she was too tired. She showed no signs of waking up no matter how he talked to her or shook her gently.\nHe patted her gently on the thigh, shaking her body, but she did not wake up.\nHaving done that, she started tilting a little forward, the parts touching him moving slightly and he hastily pulled her up…only to end up embracing her in his clutches, leaving him more flustered than ever.\n…That’s a really nice smell.\nMahiru went back home to shower, or something else, after they had eaten. Perhaps the shampoo floral fragrance had blended into hers, for she was giving off a sweet fragrance, leaving him very comfortable.\nAnd also, he sensed something soft on him, and was left really restless as a result.\nShe was sleeping so soundly, he could not bring himself to wake her up. He had a feeling that she would not wake up unless he hit her more forcibly.\nWhat do I do now?\nThis happened right after the New Year started, and Amane found himself cupping his head.",

      "content": "Faced with this unbelievable situation, Amane turned towards Mahiru with a conflicted look.\nShe was really sleeping soundly.\nIt seemed she assumed Amane was someone she could trust, for she slept soundly. Amane was anxious and embarrassed, his sanity on the verge of collapsing, and he had the urge to slam his head into the wall.\nHe did not want to be conscious of it, but his consciousness was gathered upon her touch.\nThe delicate body was taut and soft, with the tenderness of a female.\nEspecially on the parts that were touching, the softness that had some weight to them; they were mercilessly wearing at Amane’s sanity.\n—What do I do now?\nThis unexpected situation struck Amane along with an unprecedented softness, and he was left really confused.\nSo a girl’s this soft and nice smelling…\nit was the first time he recognized this fact, and he was a little amazed, but his sanity slammed the brakes to prevent any unsavory thoughts.\nThe more he felt he should not be thinking about it, the more pronounced the softness in his clutches, and his mind was in complete chaos.\nHe tried to figure out how to solve this situation, but he felt it was impossible to resolve this perfectly.\nFor the time being, he came up with three solutions.\n1． Force Mahiru to wake up.\n2． Drag Mahiru into her home.\n3． Have her sleep on his bed, and he sleep on the sofa.\n1, the issue was that he did not want to wake up the exhausted, soundly sleeping Mahiru. He was the reason why she was so tired, and he wanted her to sleep well if possible.\n2, this might seem the safest option, but it would represent an arduous situation of mean searching Mahiru’s clothes for the key, and entering a woman’s house. Even if it was Mahiru, he knew it was likely she would be repulsed.\n3, to have her sleep on his bed. This would be the safest option, and easiest to execute…except he believed he would be a mental wreck thereafter.\nThey were usually together, but Mahiru at this point was showing an adorable sleeping face anyone would be mesmerized by, and his sanity, along with other things, would collapse if he let her sleep on his bed.\nAny boy would be completely tempted by the thought of having a girl sleep on his bed, let alone a really hardworking, pretty girl.\nIt was no wonder that he would have various thoughts.\nHowever, this would be the safest option, the best compromise and welfare Amane could come up with for the time being.\nHe made up his mind, and put a hand on Mahiru’s back while she leaned onto him, his other hand under her knees as he slowly lifted her up.\nShe was sleeping soundly, and was light as a feather…or not, but she was really light.\nIt was unlikely that she would wake up that easily, but he cautiously brought her to his room, without shaking her. With her lying down, he had difficulty opening the door, but once he broke through this obstacle, all he needed to do was to lay her on the bed.\nHer fine body sank into the bed.\nHe laid the blanket and futon over her, and was done preparing for the night.\nIt appeared she had no intention to wake up, the rhythmic breathing sounds entering his eyes.\nThere was some naiveté to her pretty face, the usual beauty and the innocent sleeping face had Amane’s heart jolting rapidly.\nOnce he laid her onto the bed carefully, he knelt down next to the bed.\n…This is tough.\nTo surmise, the reason why Mahiru was sleeping on his bed, leaving the soft feeling in his clutches, along with a defenseless sleeping face, was because she trusted him enough to sleep in a boy’s house.\nOf course, he was glad to be so trusted, but this had him thinking that he was not being viewed as a boy.\nIt appeared that she recognized Amane as ‘a completely harmless, useless boy who needs much care’.\nHe glanced aside at her, but she knew not of his gripes as she continued to sleep with a peaceful pace.\nShe doesn’t know how troubled I am here.\nIf she’s so defenseless, shall I just slip in next to her…\nso he had a momentary thought, but denied it as he thought it would be overboard, especially given that they were not dating.\nIf he did so, he had a feeling that once Mahiru woke up, she would not talk to him. She might even give such a cold look that would be asking, what are you thinking? Thus, for his own sake, he decided not to do so.\nI think it’s fine to tap her lightly on the face,\nhe reached for Mahiru’s head instead.\nSmooth, silky, glossy; with his fingers, he stroked the smooth long hair that could be described so, and they passed through without getting caught.\nGuess she really takes care of this well too\n, he was amazed and terrified of a lady’s hard work as he gently caressed Mahiru’s cheeks with his fingertips.\nThe moist white porcelain skin was not too warm, and felt a little cold in Amane’s hand.\nOnce he was done caressing her with his fingertips, he looked at her utterly peaceful sleeping face, silently showing a wry smile.\n“Good night.”\nShe would be shocked once she wakes the next day…or to be precise, later in the morning, so he thought, but he felt it was within the acceptable boundary after she had caused his heart to tickle.\nSeriously, you\n, so he grimaced as he caressed her soft cheeks once again.",

      "content": "The next morning, Amane woke up to none of the daily sounds.\nThe house was so quiet, the bird could be heard chirping outside, and Mahiru, sleeping in Amane’s room, showed no signs of waking up.\nIt was long past dawn, but she might be sleeping soundly as she was too tired the previous day.\nAmane himself had fallen asleep, but he could not sleep well as he remembered Mahiru was on his bed, and woke up from the light sleep at this time.\nHis body was not feeling uncomfortable, but he was suffering in another way.\nHaa, he sighed, and made a deep sigh, stretching as his body had turned stiff from sleeping on the sofa, before he slowly got up.\nFor the time being, he would check on Mahiru first. His main objective was to get a change of clothes, but he thought he should check on her while doing so.\nSsss, he opened the door to his room.\nIt was completely quiet inside, and Mahiru was still sleeping soundly on the bed.\nThe only difference was that she had flipped a few times in her sleep, and was lying sideways, her hair flowing on the bed like a river.\nKuu, kuu,\nshe was making such an adorable sleeping sound as he knelt down to look.\nShe really looked adorable sleeping like that.\nShe had a cool facade most of the time, probably because she was being so tense…but her sleeping face was a lot relaxed, and so adorable, he had the urge to caress her.\n…She’s really cute when she’s sleeping.\nOf course, she was a pretty girl, adorable even when awake, but at this point, his feelings were more akin to one observing a pet.\nHe wanted to pet at the silky hair, and to poke at the fluffy cheeks. Usually, she would never let her guard down, but since she had become this defenseless, he had the urge to tease her.\nWithout thinking, he reached his hand towards her soft cheek, touching it.\nThe smooth cheek was as soft as the previous day. So fluffy it was, he wanted to keep touching, and he started poking with his finger.\nHe was touching her as softly as he could, but while he caressed her cute cheek softly, “Nnn…” Mahiru, who had been sleeping silently, let out a sweet sound.\nAnd before he could move his hand aside, she slowly began to open her eyes.\nThe moist, unfocused caramel-colored eyes were staring at Amane…or to be precise, in his direction.\nHer fluffy expression showed some traces of a young, sleepy face, and showed much innocence. He sleepy eyes had some consciousness despite being in a daze, and she looked more immature than when she was sleepy.\nShe gave a careless, completely vulnerable expression, and then lowered her eyelids, closing her eyes again.\nHe wanted to retract his fingers, but she brought her face onto his fingers, and rolled her cheeks on it, her thin throat making a sweet sound.\nPlease do not leave me,\nso she appeared to say as she rubbed her cheeks on him.\nHe knew very well that she was half-asleep.\nThere was no reason for Mahiru to fawn at Amane, and usually, she would not show such a relaxed face and gesture.\nDespite that—she was acting like a fawning kitten, and Amane’s heart and sanity were put to the test early in the morning.\nShould he retract his hand, or go with the flow and poke her in the cheek dotingly?\nEmotionally, he was leaning towards the latter.\nIt was not often that he would get to see such a fluffy Mahiru, and he was interested to know how much she would fawn around.\nBut he had a feeling that once he did so, Mahiru would start pouting away and give him the cold shoulder the moment her consciousness returned. He knew she would be utterly embarrassed, and did not know what to do.\nIn any case, she was really adorable, so he decided to stop at merely staring at her.\nHer consciousness had mostly returned, but as she was a little groggy, or that she never noticed Amane’s hand, she brought her head close to his fingers.\nAmane only intended to check on her and get a change of clothes, but for some reason, there was such body contact. His heart was filled with unspeakable itch, and heat started to gather on his cheeks.\n“Nn, nn…”\nAfter a short while, Mahiru finally opened her eyes, seemingly awake this time….\n“……eh,”\nTheir eyes met. She turned her eyes towards Amane who was up close, along with the finger her cheek was touching, and she froze.\nThe next moment, Mahiru leapt.\n“Good morning.”\n“…Go-good morning, to you…”\n“You fell asleep in my house, so I moved you here. Nothing else. Thought I should have you thank me for not doing anything.”\nAmane seized the moment to explain why she was on the bed; she did not pout, and instead listened obediently.\nHowever, the fact that she slept on a boy’s bed caused her face to redden, and she pinched at the blanket, pulling it to her lips.\nThat gesture too was strange adorable, and he averted his eyes.\nWhat’s with this situation?\nHe was merely lending his bed, but for some reason, he felt he was the one at fault.\nHe was sorry for poking her cheek, but just a little, and he had no intention of doing anything more.\nHis heart was beating because of how adorable Mahiru was, and aching because of guilt. He felt really conflicted within. He looked towards Mahiru, and found her still blushing, a little displeased…not too bad by itself, but it appeared she had something to say as she looked back at him.\n“…Amane-kun, do you like touching the cheek?”\n“Eh?”\n“Well, you did the same on Christmas, and before I slept last night.”\n“…You were awake?”\nHe did so the previous day when she was supposedly fast asleep, so she should be unconscious then.\nSince she knew that however, it showed she was awake back then.\n“…Ac-actually, well…I was awake when you put me on the bed…what else could I do other than to pretend to sleep?”\n“You didn’t think I was going to do anything?”\n“…I do not think you will do such a thing, Amane-kun…and I pretended to sleep, to make sure, of that.”\nIt appeared he was tested on his trustworthiness.\nLuckily, it appeared he was found trustworthy, but he really hoped that in future, she would not act so carelessly to actually sleep in front of a boy.\nEven Amane did not think it would end at merely a poke on the cheek the next time it happens. He would be troubled if she was not wary in the slightest.\n“…Well, glad that I got trusted, but don’t do this again. I’m a boy.”\n“Uu, I-I know that, yes.”\n“Or you want something more from me?”\n“No way is that possible.”\nMahiru denied that with a completely flushed face, and hid under the futon.\nHey, that’s my bed,\nAmane wanted to retort, only to swallow back his words.\nShe remained rolled up in the coop, shivering away until her shame subsided, and Amane decided to leave her be.",

      "content": "Once she recovered from her shame, Mahiru returned home, changed her clothes, and returned.\nBut it seemed she was still bashful, and would glance aside awkwardly whenever she met Amane in the eyes, leaving him awkward as well.\nLuckily, she was fine with sitting next to him on the sofa, but he was feeling unbearable.\n“…Forgive me.”\nHaving had enough of this, he instinctively apologized to her, who glanced back at him, and sighed.\nHer shame might have subsided somewhat, for she reverted back to her usual expression.\n“I am not angry at you. You do not have to apologize to me, Amane-kun.”\n“But then.”\n“I was just regretting my own carelessness. I have shown you such an unsightly look.”\n“It’s not unsightly…just cute.”\nThe angelic sleeping face was truly befitting her moniker as the Angel, and she looked really cute, whether it was the sleepy eyes once she woke up, or the defenseless innocent face.\nIt was contrary to the usual poised and aloof expression, a new discovery of a really innocent expression.\nIt was so adorable, he had the urge to keep looking, but she probably did not want to show such a careless look.\nHe did not find it indecent, unsightly, so he wanted to deny that; for some reason, Mahiru bit her lips, and whacked at him with the cushion in her clutches.\nIt was not painful, and she probably not was being serious, but he did not know why she did that so suddenly.\n“What?”\n“…You really are hopeless at this, Amane-kun.”\n“Seriously…what do you want me to do?”\n“You should not be saying such words so lightly.”\n“It’s not like I say this to anyone else…”\nThe only acquainted females near Amane were Mahiru and Chitose.\nChitose was relatively cute, if anything, but Amane instinctively found it a hassle to mention her, and there was no need to praise her directly. Thus, there was no one he could praise other than Mahiru.\nMahiru froze, and he was skeptical, shrugging,\n“Say, you’re already used to hearing that from others, right? Not much of a difference now.”\nHe had called Mahiru cute a few times, and found it preposterous that she was being mindful of it at this point.\nMahiru should know very well how pretty she was, and was surely used to receiving praise.\nThere was no reason for her to be so flustered just because Amane alone said a few words.\nSo he thought, and for some reason, Mahiru frowned.\n“So seriously, what’s up with you?”\n“…Nothing at all.”\nShe launched another physical attack at him with the cushion,\nhumph,\nand turned her face aside. “I shall make Ozoni now.” She wore the apron, and entered the kitchen.\nAmane picked up the cushion that was shoved onto him, and could only stare at the displeased Mahiru in the back.\nOnce they finished the Ozoni, Mahiru reverted back to her usual expression.\nShe was scowling when they began to eat, and he was a little uncomfortable with that, but the Ozoni and the Osechi were really delicious, and he found himself mesmerized. Before he knew it, he sat that Mahiru seemed to be back to normal.\nEverything returned back to normal when they left the dining table and returned to the sofa.\n“Speaking of which, are you going for Hatsumōde, Mahiru?”\n“Hatsumōde? I do not really wish to go…I do not like crowded places. It feels like I am being watched.”\n“Well that’s because…”\nYou’re an unbelievably pretty girl after all,\nso he wanted to say, but he remembered he had just ruined her mood, so he swallowed back his words. “Well, that is to be expected.” He answered.\n“Amane-kun, are you going to the Hatsumōde?”\n“Back at home, I go with my parents, but I haven’t made up my mind. I think there’s no need to squeeze through on New Year’s Day itself.”\n“Agreed.”\n“Looks like Chitose’s group is bonding back home with her family, and kids nowadays don’t really go for Hatsumōde. We’ll go a little later.”\nCompared to the past…fewer younger ones, especially those in their teens and twenties, would attend the Hatsumōde, not that Amane and the others were weird or anything.\nNot that he did not want to go, but he understood that it would be packed there, and he would only feel tired just going there. He thought it would be fine going later when there were fewer people.\n“Besides, I want to relax over these three days. I don’t really care about the New Year packets.”\n“I am interested in receiving New year packets though. ”\n“You want to go to the shopping mall?”\n“…I have no courage to charge into the crowds there.”\n“Agreed. ”\nAmane replied as Mahiru did, and leaned into the sofa.\nThey were not dictated to go anywhere on New Year after all.\nAmane would typically hope to avoid troublesome matters, and was fine with just spending the day, lazing around. It appeared Mahiru had intending to spend the entire New Year period at his place, for the convenience of cooking. They did not have to worry about having food, or someone to talk to.\nThis is one fancy New Year\n, so Amane thought as he glanced aside at Mahiru, chuckling away.",

      "content": "“Can we drop by at your place tomorrow, Amane?”\nAmane’s father sent this message at 10pm, on the third day of the year.\n“It is fine for you not to return home, Amane, but I do want to see your face. Also, I heard from Shihoko-san, so I thought I should greet the neighbor.”\nIt appeared Amane’s mother had introduced Mahiru, and told him how much their son was taken care of, so he wanted to greet her as his parent.\nAmane would have refused with all his might if Shihoko did not know about Mahiru, but she knew, and Mahiru herself had been contacting Shihoko quite the bit, so it was pointless to refuse.\nThere was nothing to hide at this point, so he was not repulsed by the idea of his parents checking on the son that had never returned.\nIf the father Shuuto was arriving with Shihoko, he should be able to rein the often rampaging latter.\nAmane determined that if he were to refuse, Shihoko would brazenly visit Mahiru again, so he agreed to his father’s request, before sending Mahiru a message.\n“Erm, is it really fine for me to intrude upon your family reunion?”\nMahiru appeared at Amane’s house the following morning, and looked a little nervous.\nIt appeared Shihoko had contacted Mahiru before…rather, they were well acquainted since they were in constant contact. It would be one thing if Shihoko was the one visiting, but the father too would appear this time, and it was no wonder Mahiru was so tense.\n“Well, you aren’t disturbing. dad just wants to say hi to you, and mom’s really interested in you, so I want you here. Actually, you have to be here.”\n“E-even though you say so…”\n“I get that you aren’t too willing, but I hope you’ll endure it for now.”\nIt might be a surreal situation for her to greet his parents, but since they wanted to meet, they had no other choice.\nAmane was sorry about taking up Mahiru’s time, but such was his father’s personality that he would feel restless if he never got to greet Mahiru, so he hoped she would just endure for a while.\n“…How did Shihoko-san introduce me?”\n“Relax. Dad kept saying you’re a benefactor. He specified that we don’t have the kind of relationship my mom’s fantasizing about.”\nIt appeared that Shihoko had deemed Mahiru a daughter-in-law, a cute daughter even, which Amane vehemently denied.\nShuuto grimaced a little,\n“Shihoko-san’s bad habit is at work again”\nas he noted understandingly. There should not be any misunderstanding.\nMahiru looked a little relieved as she put her hand on the chest, “Sorry.” Amane responded with a wry smile, and continued to wait. Right on cue, the doorbell rang.\nMahiru jolted greatly, and Amane smiled as he consoled her. He went to the door and unbolted the chain.\nHe opened the door, and found the parents he was used to seeing.\n“It’s been half a year, Amane.”\n“It’s been a while, dad.”\nAmane’s father, Shuuto, showed a calm smile, and Amane too gave a smile of some relief.\nShuuto was one who had a calming demeanor, and was one who could easily calm those around him. Amane relaxed once he met his father again.\n“You’re treating your mom so differently…”\n“That’s because you showed up out of a sudden, mom. I would have welcomed you if you told me first.”\nMost importantly, it was because Mahiru was around, and Amane would have been a lot more relaxed if he was alone back then.\n“Anyway, come in…what’s that?”\n“Various things~. That aside, where’s Mahiru-chan?”\n“Inside.”\nHe tersely answered, and accompanied his parents in, the latter having removed their shoes. An uneasy looking Mahiru was seated there, looking at them—and she widened her eyes.\nIt was not unreasonable for Mahiru to be shocked.\nShuuto’s young appearance belied the fact that he was in his late thirties. Even if she was to ignore the favorable comparison against his son, he had the face of a man around thirty.\nHe had a young face, baby-like even, and for the umpteenth time, Amane wished he could have inherited more of those genes.\nUnlike Amane, the man had a kind expression, a friendly looking youth (even though he was middle aged). So many had often wondered if they were actually blood related. When they walked together however, they resembled brothers with a large age gap.\n“Mahiru-chan, it’s been a while~.”\n“Been a while? It hasn’t been a month.”\n“That’s long enough for me.”\nMahiru saw Shihoko scurry towards her with a beaming face, “It has been a while.” Mahiru answered with a smile shown to outsiders, correcting her sitting posture.\nHowever, she looked a little perturbed towards Shuuto, the latter noticing the stare and stood next to Shihoko with a calm smile.\n“Nice to meet you. I’m Amane’s father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I have heard about you from Shihoko-san, Shiina-san. That you’ve been taking care of our son.”\n“Nice to meet you. I am Shiina Mahiru. I have been in the care of Amane-kun.”\nShuuto made a beautiful formal bow, and Mahiru followed suit with a formal greeting.\nIt appeared Mahiru was worried if Shuuto would have a similar personality to Shihoko, but Shuuto was a kind person with common sense, so Amane hoped Mahiru would calm down as quickly as possible.\nShuuto was the only one who could apply the brakes on Shihoko, and the latter was weak against Shuuto. One reason was that she was overwhelmingly fond of him though.\n“Why, you don’t have to be so humble, you know? Amane’s sloppy after all.”\n“Sorry for being sloppy.”\n“Alright Shihoko-san, don’t say that now…Amane, have you thanked her properly for taking care of you all this while?”\n“I did my best.”\n“That’s good.”\nFemales are to be treated respectfully,\nthat was what Shuuto taught, and he might be worried if Amane had thanked Mahiru properly.\nAmane was uncomfortable with leaving everything to Mahiru while he got to enjoy, and of course, Amane assumed he did all he could for her.\nShuuto was relieved to hear Amane’s reply, and again turned to meet Mahiru in the eyes.\n“…Really, how do I thank you here? It seems you were doing all the daily dishes, and even the Osechi…”\n“I’ve always been thanking her, and I’ve been helping her out.”\n“Yes…surprisingly, Amane-kun is rather concerned about me.”\n“How surprising is this surprising you speak of?”\n“Well…”\nHe might appear crude, but he does pay attention to detail,\nso Mahiru said, and Amane was left speechless, unable to refute the fact that he was crude; Shuuto showed a kind smile.\n“Looks like the two of you are really on good terms. Don’t cause Shiina-san too much trouble here.”\n“…Got it.”\n“Same to you, Shiina-san, do correct Amane if there is anything he does not do well. He might not look like it, but he’s a really honest boy. Do correct him if there’s anything you don’t like.”\n“Amane-kun is very kind; as for anything I dislike…erm, just a little.”\n“So there is.”\n“…Rather than dislike…I will say it is a flaw.”\nShe seemed to be stammering for words, and if he were to ask what was bad about him…she would be unable to reply.\nFor some reason, “Hahan” Shihoko seemed to have an idea as she burst out laughing, looking towards Amane.\nWhat now,\nwho could only muster such a response.",

      "content": "“Here.”\nEven though they were his parents, they were still guests, and it was imperative to serve them. Mahiru however insisted on serving tea, so Amane left it to her.\nHe never expected that the tea set and black tea Mahiru brought for him would be used in this situation.\nHis parents were seated on the sofa they normally sat together on, beaming away.\n“Why, thank you Mahiru-chan. You’re completely used to this.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Normally, Amane should be the one doing this, right?”\nIf Amane was to brew the tea, it was likely only the bitterness would be extracted, so Mahiru took charge. However, Shihoko looked a little dumbfounded.\n“No, I want to do this…”\n“Well, if Amane’s to do this, the tea might not be of appropriate temperature. That’s to be expected.”\nWhile she was right, he was peeved to be criticized.\nHe could not refute this, and could only shut up. Shihoko looked towards him with glee.\n“Speaking of which Amane, you have been addressing Mahiru-chan with her name now.”\nOnce she suddenly pointed this out, Amane and Mahiru froze in unison.\nHe had forgotten about this as he had been addressing her naturally. When his mother last met them, Amane did not call Mahiru by name, and Mahiru was fidgeting when she addressed him back.\nAt this point, both of them addressed each other so naturally, and Shihoko naturally would let her thoughts run wild.\n“…That’s fine, right?”\n“That’s nice, I think. Good to be intimate.”\nShe deliberately chose not to press the matter further, merely looking towards Amane with a clear smile, the latter sensing his cheeks shaking.\nPerhaps it was better for her to tease him instead. Whenever Shihoko was in such a state, her mind would be imagining all kinds of oh me oh my happy situations.\n“Shihoko-san, stop teasing Amane.”\nBut Shuuto slammed the brakes.\n“This is a bad habit of yours, Shihoko-san. Don’t tease him too much.”\n“Yes, too bad, but I have to stop.”\nShihoko would only listen to Shuuto’s words, and Amane the tormented son was really grateful for that.\n“But it is great seeing our son get along with such a cute girl.”\n“I was worried that your bad habit will run wild, Shihoko-san.”\n“Oh, are you stopping me now, Shuuto-san?”\n“I think it is good for you to change when you have some self-awareness, but I can’t help you when this is another thing I like about you.”\n“Why…Shuuto-san.”\nWhile he did stop her, the parents started veering into their own world, for some strange reason, and Amane blatantly sighed.\nShuuto was usually one of common sense, but he would instinctively dote on his wife, resulting in an unapproachable vibe around him from time to time.\nLuckily, he would only do so in front of family, and would not be so brazen outdoors. Perhaps he was sufficiently relaxed, for they were in Amane’s house.\nThe son was fine with his parents being lovey-dovey after so many years, but he wished for them to at least be aware of where they were at, to be considerate to others who were watching.\nAmane did not want to interfere the moment he saw them end up that one, so he just slumped into the chair he took from the dining room, and sighed hard again.\nMahiru too prepared a chair next to him, and quietly watched him.\n“…Your parents really are on good terms.”\n“I guess. They aren’t like this outside, but that’s how it feels at home.”\n“I see.”\nHe answered with a wry smile, and Mahiru narrowed her eyes at Shihoko and Shuuto.\nShe was not looking displeased; rather, it appeared she was looking at something dazzling.\nHer eyes were full of admiration and jealousy, as though she was looking at something precious.\nAs she watched them with a faint smile that could only be described as fleeting, he reached his hand towards her without thinking—\n“Oh Amane, what’s the matter?”\nShihoko seemed to have returned to reality, and Amane retracted his hand upon hearing her voice.\n“What do you mean what? It’s because you two are in your own world that we’re really restless, mom.”\n“Oh, you jealous?”\n“Not, jealous, at, all. Just, do that sort of thing at home.”\nIt seemed they never noticed Amane nearly holding Mahiru by the hand, and neither did the latter, so she could only give a wry smile at his words.\nHe did not know why he reached the hand out.\nBut it seemed that…he did not want that Mahiru to feel alone.\nHe was relieved to see Mahiru revert back to normal, and maintained a usual scowl so as not to be noticed.\n“So, are you two happy to see your own son now?”\n“Rather than you, Amane, we’re happy to see Mahiru-chan …”\n“Oy.”\n“Just half joking. We are not done with our objective here.”\n“Objective?”\nHe thought Shihiko’s objective was just to make a New Year visit, and to say hello to Mahiru, but it appeared Shihoko had some other plan in mind.\n“Amane, you two haven’t done Hatsumōde, right?”\n“We’ll go when there’re fewer people around.”\n“I guessed so. You haven’t gone too, Mahiru-chan? That’s what you wrote in the message.”\n“Yes.”\n“Since I expected this, I brought kimonos~”\nIt appeared Shihoko wanted to attend Hatsumōde with Mahiru.\nAmane realized at this point why she was grinning away and carrying such a large bag. Once again, he sighed for the umpteenth time.\nShihoko liked cute things, and liked to dress people up. Surely she would not miss out on this chance.\nAmane knew there were a few kimonos back home, and it appeared she brought them all.\n“I dreamed of having a daughter dressed in kimono for Hatsumōde…I think it will fit Mahiru-chan well.”\n“Mom, you just want a doll to play dress up on…”\n“Not true though? A big reason is that I want Mahiru-chan to wear it.”\nIt’ll really fit her after all,\nShihoko was utterly confident in thinking she was correct.\nThough it appeared there was no clothing that would not fit Mahiru well.\nAs far as Amane knew, she had worn boyish clothing, princess-like clothing, girlish clothing with frills and lace a few times, and they all fit her well. It seemed a pretty girl could fit any clothing onto her.\nSo would the kimono, it seemed.\nThe Fujimiyas had only one son, and Shihoko would never let the chance to dress up a daughter slip by.\n“…Well, if Mahiru’s fine with that, you can dress her up.”\n“Why are you making it sound like you’re not going?”\n“Well, it’ll be troublesome if the guys at school see me with her.”\nIf his parents went with Mahiru to Hatsumōde, they might look like family, so that should be fine.\nBut it would be problematic if Amane himself was to join in.\nIf those in the same year were to see the unimpressive looking Amane together with Mahiru during the shrine visit, he could imagine a hellish scene of agonizing wails after winter break ends.\nAfter all, he did not want to go for Hatsumōde while bearing such risk.\n“It’s fine if you’re not noticed, right?”\n“If we aren’t, but normally, we’ll…say mom, are you actually?”\n“Fufu, this situation is why I prepared so much stuff here, you know?”\n“What do you mean, this situation!?”\nThere were kimono, juban, and little props. Amane felt she would not have brought that much luggage if it was all related to kimono, so it appeared she brought more just to mess with him.\n“Shuuto-san was enthusiastic about this too.”\n“Dad…”\n“It’s a rare chance, so why not? I think that since it’s an annual thing, we should go together.”\nIt was hard to refuse now that he had spoken.\nShihoko’s suggestion involved Shuuto’s heavy emphasis on family, and Amane would feel bad if he were to refuse.\n“But then.”\n“It’s fine. Trust mom here. I’ll definitely dress you up as a handsome guy unlike before, Amane!”\n“So you’re saying I look ugly now?”\n“Of course not, your face resemble Shuuto-san’s. But the hairstyle and the mood around you feels so bland. It’s so boorish, as they say.”\n“Shut up.”\nHe knew he looked boorish, but he willingly dressed so because he felt like it…and did not want to be pointed out.\n“You could have been more handsome if you dress up a little, Amane. Just that you find it too much of a hassle…”\n“Stop being a busybody.”\n“What a pity…say Mahiru-chan, you want to see Amane dressed up a little better too, right?”\n“Eh?”\nWith the ball suddenly on Mahiru’s court, the latter widened her eyes, and clearly looked flustered.\nAmane hoped that Shihoko would not pressurize Mahiru that much, but Shihoko continued to press on without a care.\n“If Amane dresses better, I think you’ll have a different opinion of him, Mahiru-chan. He actually looks decent there, you know? You aren’t honest with yourself, but he has Shuuto-san’s gentlemanliness. A little dress up and he’ll look like a good man.”\n“E-erm…is-is that so…?”\n“You don’t want to go to Hatsumōde together?”\n“A-actually, I wa-want to, but,”\n“Oy don’t sell me out here.”\nAmane hoped Mahiru would refuse in fear of the really unlikely situation, and she glanced aside after he retort.\n“…It is fine if you do not want to, Amane-kun.”\nShuu.\nShe sounded a little deflated as she lowered her eyebrows, and he found himself struggling to breathe.\nWhile she intended to keep her feelings to herself, she obviously found it a pity. It was not shown deliberately, but naturally.\nShe silently lowered her long eyelashes, causing a strong sense of guilt to arise within him.\nYou made Mahiru-chan sad\n. Shihoko in turn gave Amane a reproaching look,\nJust hurry up and give up.\nShuuto in turn gave such a look,\ngrrr,\nand Amane let out a little groan.\nSurely it appeared he was bullying Mahiru here, no?\n“…Alright.”\nFaced with such looks, he could only surrender.",

      "content": "“Okay, we’re done.”\nShihoko combed his hair here and there, pinched his face, and matched clothing on him, and he felt a little fatigued once he was released.\nAmane himself did not have much interest in clothing, and this time was one of suffering. He looked into the mirror however, and found the hard work had paid off; the mirror showed a handsome face incomparable to before.\nShihoko chose a dark grey Chester coat over a white turtleneck and black slacks, a simple, but not too casual outfit.\nShe made sure he did not dress too casually, as they were to partake in a celebratory New year event. His current attire looked a little formal.\nAmane did not like clothing that was too colorful; the monotone, dull colors fit his tastes better.\nHe then checked his hairstyle; his slightly long bangs were ironed and waxed, combed to the side thanks to Shihoko’s skills, showing the eyes that were usually hidden behind.\nOnce his eyes were exposed, the impression he gave looked a lot brighter, and furthermore, his hair looked more solidified, giving a sophisticated vibe.\nThe boorish look his mother and Itsuki ridiculed him for was no longer to be seen, and standing before the mirror was a completely different, refreshed dashing boy.\n“You could have looked a decent lad if you tidied up a little. Why wouldn’t you.”\n“I don’t have interest in it.”\n“You’re always like this, Amane. You can’t look refreshed when you’re always scowling away.”\nHe scowled, berating her for these unnecessary words, but he could not deny the fact.\n“Now then, I’ll tidy up Mahiru-chan, so wait in the living room now.”\nAmane was in his room when this was done, and he did not know how Mahiru looked, for she had returned home to change.\nMahiru returned home to put on the clothes, for she could do it on her own. Given that fact, one could understand how capable she was.\nHe saw Shihoko leave the room, and looked into the mirror once again.\nIt had been a while since he dressed up like this, and he appeared a different person.\n“……Well, this isn’t so bad.”\nHe might look unsightly standing next to Mahiru, but it was a lot better than his usual self.\nAin’t bad to do this once in a while,\nso he fiddled with his hair that were unblocked by his bangs, muttering away.\nDozens of minutes passed as he waited with Shuuto in the living room, and heard the door open.\nHe was not displeased about having to wait, as he had heard that women needed lots of time and effort to dress up. However, he was worried if Mahiru was sexually harassed by Shihoko.\nHe anxiously stood up from the sofa, looked towards the entrance, and Mahiru silently entered the living room.\nHe was mesmerized upon first sight.\nMahiru would not usually wear Japanese clothing, and he did not get the chance to see her in it. Thus, he felt that it would fit her well—but not this well.\nShihoko said that it was not easy to move through the crowds in a furisode, so she chose a komon instead. The faint pink base was matched with little plum patterns, and fitted Mahiru so well, one had to wonder if the clothing was Mahiru’s to begin with.\nMahiru usually would not wear pink, and at this point, she looked really posh and feminine.\nThe sides of the faint colored long hair remained, and the rest were held up by hairsticks. The pure white neck and dangling accessories emphasized her femininity, making her alluring.\nThe beautiful makeup matched her already beautiful appearance, and her vibe as an innocent beauty was emphasized thoroughly.\n“How about it? I find it rather cute. My effort in dressing Mahiru-chan up hasn’t gone to waste since she’s so pretty to begin with.”\n“Yep, it suits her alright.”\nShuuto praised with a smile, and Mahiru lowered her eyes gaudily. This gesture made her so alluring; beauties were really terrifying after all.\n“Come on, Amane, you have to say what you think here.”\n“Well, it suits you.”\nAmane could not bring himself to lavish praise on her before his parents, so he just made a painless appraisal, but Shihoko was really displeased.\n“…You can’t do that here, you know?”\n“Shut up.”\nShihoko reproached his uselessness, but Amane did not want to praise her more before his parents, so he turned his face aside.\nDumbfounded by Amane, Shihoko merely sighed and let him off the hook, for she understood his personality well.\n“Goodness…anyway Mahiru-chan, what do you think? Amane looks completely different now, right?”\n“Y-yes. Completely different from usual …”\n“He could have been popular if he usually dressed up like this, but he just wouldn’t. It’s a pity.”\nAmane felt Shihoko was saying unnecessary things again, but the latter merely sighed, as though it really was a pity.\n“Amane really resembles Shuuto-san, but it’s disappointing how he doesn’t use it well. Too bad~”\n“That’s enough Shihoko-san. Amane’s of this age too, you know?”\n“Shouldn’t he think of being more popular?”\n“Amane’s the type to be fine with just one. He might find it a hassle to have too many.”\n“Oh my.”\nShuuto wanted to coax Shihoko, but her delusions were further fueled.\nWell, it was true that Amane would rather have a single person next to him than to be popular amongst many…so Shuuto said, and Amane himself agreed with this sentiment. But would it not seem that Mahiru was that special someone at this point?\nHe could only turn his cringing face aside, away from Shihoko’s radiant smile.\nWhy does she have to let her thoughts run wild?\nHe wondered, but he was aware others would view them in the same vein.\nAt the very least, Mahiru was special to Amane, or so he could admit.\nBut while that was fact—\nHe glanced aside at Mahiru, making sure she did not notice him, and sighed.\nWell, I can say I like her.\nHe felt he was fond of her.\nBut he felt there was a distinction from it being outright love.\n“Mom, what you think of doesn’t exist. Enough nonsense and get the car ready.”\n“Such an unpleasant kid…well, that’s fine, Shuuto-san, shall we get going?”\n“Of course.”\nIt appeared Amane successfully diverted the topic, for the duo began preparations to move out.\nHe left the choice of shrine to his parents, and watched their backs depart for the parking lots right outside the apartments.\n“…I got all my stuff in my bag, so I don’t have to prepare much. What about you, Mahiru?”\n“Eh, they are all in this bag.”\n“I see.”\nSuddenly, there was the two of them, and he felt a little restless. Filled with such emotions, he checked if the windows were locked, and unplugged the unnecessary appliances.\nHe switched off the living room lights, and looked towards Mahiru again.\nAs expected, she was really a beauty, even if he did not look at her too intently.Though he never managed to praise her before his parents, there was no doubt to anyone that Mahiru was a real healing sight as a kimono beauty.\n“What is it, Amane-kun?”\n“Nn, well, it really does suit you. Like an innocent beauty in kimono. Really cute, really pretty, I think.”\nHe learned from Shuuto to lavish women with praise when it came to fashion, and he should have done so the moment he saw her, but it was too awkward for him to do so before his parents.\nSo once he stated his honest thoughts, Mahiru blinked a few times, her face gradually flushed as she pursed her lips.\nAmane recalled that Mahiru made the same reaction moments ago, and made a wry smile.\n“Ahh, you don’t want to be praised? Sorry.”\n“Th-that is not the case, but…Amane-kun, you are rather,”\n“Rather?”\n“…Nothing.”\nShe turned her face aside, and though Amane was confused, it appeared she had no intention to talk more, so he just gave up and went to the corridor alongside her.\nHaving considered that they would be walking, she was not wearing geta, but boots, a Japanese-Western style. Despite that, he could see how cute she was.\nShalan shalan,\nthe hairstick ornament shook as she put on the boots, and then she silently moved towards Amane, who went ahead to hold the door.\nThey were being closer than they thought. It was rare for Mahiru to take the initiative to approach, and she gently tiptoed.\nShe wants me to listen?\nSo he wondered as he bent down at the door. Mahiru cupped her hand before her mouth in a ring, and approached his ear.\n“Amane-kun.”\n“Nn?”\n“Erm…Amane-kun, you look dashing too, I guess?”\nAfter the little whisper, Mahiru darted past Amane, and hurried into the elevator hall. Bam, and Amane slammed his forehead into the door.\n“…That was sneaky of her.”\nThat was retaliation, and Amane’s heart was pounding wildly.\nThanks to her, Amane took quite a while to cool his sizzling face down, and was met with his parents’ skeptical looks at the parking lots.",

      "content": "They took an hour car ride or so from where Amane stayed, and arrived at a rather famous shrine in this area. As expected, there were much fewer crowds compared to what they saw on TV, but there were still quite a few people around.\n“There’s a lot fewer people, but there’s still quite a few of them ”\n“Yep.”\n“Mahiru-chan, don’t get lost here. We’ll keep an eye on you, and you have your phone. It won’t be too difficult to keep in contact, but it’s better to go to the shrine together.”\n“Yes.”\nThe kimono-clad Mahiru had the most inconvenience moving about, and was moving slowly despite wearing boots; the kimono would slow her greatly, and it was natural for her to move slowly.\nIt was not to the point where they had to squeeze their way in, but people were bumping shoulders, and they had to keep an eye on each other.\n“Shall we go then?”\nShihoko led them into the crowd, first to the Chōzuya to rinse their hands and mouth. As expected, Mahiru was garnering lots of stares.\nThere were quite a few dressed in kimonos, and logically, Mahiru should not stand out too much even in kimono…but this did not seem to be the case.\nTo be honest, even in school uniform, and without ornament, she was attracting lots of attention. It was impossible for a traditional innocent looking girl to not attract attention while in Japanese clothing.\nEven the manner she rinsed her mouth was so beautiful, and stares were gathered upon her.\n“…Is anything the matter?”\n“Not really.”\nHe was displeased about others eyeing Mahiru, but he did not voice it out. He rinsed his hands and mouth as his parents did, and followed them.\nHe wanted to slow down and wait for Mahiru, but she was dressed in a kimono, not her usual clothing, and she had difficulty dealing with the hem, it seemed. There were many people present, and she was walking slower than usual.\n“Mahiru, you alright?”\n“This, this much is…hya!”\nShe lost her balance as she bumped into someone else on the shoulder, and was about to fall over, so Amane grabbed her arm.\n“Doesn’t look like it.”\n“…Sorry.”\n“Okay, lend me your hand.”\nIt was necessary to take care of her, especially when she was walking around while unused to such clothing.\nHe reached his hand to the little palm extending from the sleeve, and she looked up towards him.\nSeeing her in such a state, Amane was about to reel his hand in, thinking she might be unwilling, but she hastily placed her hand onto his, looking up at him once again. He was left confused, and looked back at her.\nJiii,\nthey stared at each other for quite a bit, and Mahiru was first to avert her eyes, grabbing Amane’s palm firmly.\nThere was no time for Amane to show any doubt, and they soon arrived before the Saisen box. While experiencing the touch felt from the hand, he buried the little doubt into his chest.\n“You took quite a long while. What did you wish for?”\nThey left the crowd after making their prayers, and Amane asked Mahiru who had quietly prayed.\nMahiru prayed with an ideal beautiful action, her eyes closed and hands together for about twice as long as Amane did. He was nearly mesmerized by the elegant gesture after she moved her hands aside, and only then did he remember to ask what she prayed for.\n“Just no illness or calamity.”\n“That’s rather ordinary.”\nBut well, it certainly was just like Mahiru to wish for this.\nHe was thinking that she did not have much desire, and wondered what else she could have prayed for. It was as expected, and he was a little disappointed.\n“And also.”\n“Also?”\n“…I want to live some peaceful days like this.”\nThis really was just like Mahiru.\nIt was something she would wish for, given that she disliked drastic changes, and liked peace and tranquility.\n“That’s not going to happen with my mom around.”\n“But that is fun in its own way.”\nIs that so…?\nSo he wondered, but he kept quiet after seeing how happy she was, and held her hand with a gentle look.\nAfter all, they were still passing through a crowded place, and his parents were awaiting afar after finishing their visit. It would be troublesome if she was to trip over at this point.\nAmane held her hand while thinking so, but she blinked slightly, lowering her eyes bashfully as she held his hand back.\n“You two, over here~”\nShihoko’s voice was loud and lively, easily distinguishable.\nBoth of them approached the parents as though prompted, and Shihoko widened her eyes, her hand on her smiling mouth as she stared at them.\n“Ara ara.”\n“What.”\n“You naturally held hands there, didn’t you?”\nUpon hearing those words, he realized his mistake in holding hands before Shihoko.\nWould this mean Mahiru was a special someone to Amane?\nShihoko implied with a smirk, but it was not a joke to Amane.\n“…I just don’t want her to get lost there. It’s easy to trip over in a kimono.”\n“Of course. It is difficult to move around in kimono, and she needs an escort. I did the same with Shihoko-san.”\nShuuto was understanding, and did not find anything amiss about him holding Mahiru’s holding. Like Amane, he gently held Shihoko’s hand.\nIt would not be tiring if he could hold the hand as nimbly as his father did, but he could not do so because of his personality, so he was grateful that Mahiru held his hand obediently.\nUpon seeing that Shihoko diverted her attention to Shuuto, Amane heaved a sigh of relief, but Mahiru did not release the strength in her hand.\nKyuu\n, it was controlled, but he understood that she was unwilling to let go, he whispered to her, asking what it was about, but she did not answer, her slender fingers still holding onto Amane’s.\n“Mahiru-chan Mahiru-chan, I’m getting some hot drinks. Which do you prefer, Oshiruko or Amazake?”\n“I shall have Oshiruko.”\nShihoko interrupted him from asking and letting go, so he could only continue to hold Mahiru’s hand.\n“Then what about you?”\n“…Amazake for me.”\n“Yes yes.”\nBut he was fine with Mahiru not hating him at least, so he restrained the slight itchiness arising in his heart as he told Shihoko what he wanted, before holding Mahiru’s hand again.\nSoon after, Shihoko returned from the shop, and handed them their orders. They could not eat without letting go of their hands, so both decided to let go for the time being and rest.\nHis parents savored the Amazake together, beaming away.\nWhile they were not alone in their own world, they were getting all touchy-feely. Amane was not in the mood to talk, and drank the Amazake he had just received.\nIt was drinkable in sips, and nutritious, but what Amane enjoyed was the sweetness and richness of the rice that spread in his mouth, and he could not help but sigh in relief and amazement.\nHe really could not give up on choosing the Oshiruko, but given that it was the New Year, and considering the mood, he chose the other. Given his personal preference, he was correct.\nHe glanced aside at Mahiru, and found her looking poised, sipping the Oshiruko from the paper cup.\nHe saw her enjoy the Oshiruko that much, and was increasingly yearning for it. It was troubling to him.\n“Is the Oshiruko nice?”\n“It is delicious.”\n“I’ll like to have some?”\n“Sure. May I have some too?”\n“Of course.”\nSince they had this chance, they decided to exchange drinks and have a taste. Amane took the cup, and brought the slightly viscous red bean Oshiruko to his lips.\nThere was the distinct scent of red beans, and he took it to his lips. As expected, there was a sweet, rich scent, a little too sweet for him, for he was not the type to like sweets in the first place.\nIt appeared Mahiru liked sweets, and this sweetness was perfect for her.\n“It is delicious.”\nIt seemed Mahiru too was fond of the Amazake, her eyes relaxed as she smiled.\n“…You two just did that so naturally.”\nShihoko muttered, having watched over them.\n“What now?”\n“Don’t mind us…it’s a cold day, you’re lucky.”\n“Obviously it’s better when the weather’s hot.”\n“Might be the case for you two, but for us…huh?”\nShihoko asked Shuuto, who too was watching them. He gave a calm…somewhat wry smile, “Of course.”\nAmane’s shoulders shivered awkward in the face of that incredulous stare, and Mahiru looked mystified as she stared back at Amane.",

      "content": "“Mahiru-chan, you really can cook.”\nIt was evening when they returned from Hatsumōde and rested a little. Mahiru changed clothes and began preparing dinner… but Shihoko wanted to stay over at Amane’s house just to observe Mahiru’s cooking.\nThe hometown’s a few hours car ride away from here, they were already tired, and it seemed they planned on staying over to begin with. Amane wished they would have permission from the head of the house, but that would be Shuuto, so he could not complain about it.\nLuckily, they had an extra futon for guests, and they probably would share it. They slept together back home anyway, so it would not be anything drastically different\n.\n“Thank you very much.”\n“You really are capable for a high school girl. I couldn’t do this when I was in high school.”\n“You’re not as capable as Mahiru now mom.”\n“Did you say anything?”\n“Nothing.”\nAmane heard a monotone from the kitchen, and played dumb as he leaned his back into the sofa.\nNext to him, Shuuto was going “Stop bullying Shihoko-san”, but usually, Amane was the one being bullied, or rather, teased. This little bit of payback should be somewhat acceptable.\n“How rude”, the voice from the kitchen reached the impudent Amane, but she reverted back to her cheerful voice as she spoke to Mahiru.\nMahiru too did not hesitate in talking to Shihoko. It seemed she was used to the latter’s vigor and personality, for she looked really calm.\nFrom afar, he saw them cook amicably, and sighed in relief.\n“Shihoko-san is rather curious about Shiina-san.”\nShuuto smiled as he too stared at their backs.\n“Well, she’s capable, cute, and has a good personality. No wonder mom’s curious about her.”\n“What do you think then, Amane?”\n“…Nothing much, just that she’s a nice person, and cute.”\n“I see.”\nAmane immediately assumed Shuuto was just casually checking, but the latter was never one to pursue the matter, so it seemed he was just interested in what Amane thought.\nAnd he did not inquire further into Amane’s reply.\n“I am looking forward to enjoying the cooking you get to eat every day, Amane.”\n“I can guarantee that it tastes good. As long as mom doesn’t do anything unnecessary.”\n“Don’t worry, Shihoko-san wants to try some of Shiina-san’s cooking too. She’ll just be helping out.”\n“That’s good enough.”\nNot that Shihoko’s cooking was bad or anything, but compared to Mahiru’s delicate control of the flavoring, hers was relatively crude.\nShuuto was usually in charge of controlling the flavors, while Shihoko would prioritize volume and happiness.\nOf course, she was the housewife who had a son with a growing appetite, so that would be expected. Amane however preferred Mahiru’s finely crafted tastes, and it would be great if her cooking charisma was unaffected.\nLuckily, it appeared Shihoko was just helping out Mahiru, and nothing more. He sighed in relief as he watched them cook.\n“Yep, it’s delicious.”\n“Thank you very much.”\nIt was impossible for the dining table for two to fit all four of them, so they moved the larger folding table that was in the storage for dinner.\nMahiru was relieved to hear Shuuto’s heartfelt thoughts, and did not look as tense.\nShe had never shared her cooking to anyone other than Amane, except during cooking class, so she was a little tense…but she was at ease after seeing Shuuto’s kind smile.\n“It really is delicious. Guess you don’t have to worry about staying alone or getting married.”\nShihoko looked over at Amane as she murmured away. The latter’s face nearly cringed, but he sipped at the miso soup with a stoic look.\nHe was already used to the rich taste of the soup.\nHe was completely conditioned to Mahiru’s flavouring, and did not desire for anything else other than her food. This might be a downside to eating Mahiru’s cooking every day.\n“Amane, your thoughts?”\n“It’s delicious of course. I’ve been thanking her all the time.”\nEven without Shihoko prompting, he intended to express his thanks, but it sounded like he was being prompted to do so.\nWhenever they were alone, he never forgot to praise her, but this time, he restrained himself as his parents were around, though he failed.\nHe praised Mahiru as usual, but she appeared a little restless, or rather, uncomfortable “…yes.” She whispered.\nThere was a slight blush on her face, probably because his parents were around.\nEven though she was used to hearing Amane’s thoughts, hearing praises from three people would leave her somewhat bashful.\n“You’re really cute, Mahiru-chan.”\n“Shihoko-san, don’t tease her too much.”\n“I’m not teasing her. Seriously, I just think she’s a pure innocent girl, you know?”\n“Th-that is not the case…”\n“Well, she is. Pure, innocent, you name it.”\n“Amane-kun!?”\nShe was pure. She would blush even when facing a guy who was not handsome, with his shirt undone. Innocent and naïve, maybe.\n“Oh my, did something happen without us knowing?”\n“Nothing in particular.”\n“Nothing at all!”\nMahiru too firmly denied it.\nIt was not demeaning to call her pure, but she seemed to dislike being called so as she firmly denied it, so he did not continue on.\n“Well, I’m fine as long as you don’t hurt Shiina-san, Amane. There is a limit to how much you can tease her though.”\n“Got it.”\n“…See. Are you not teasing me now?”\n“I’m serious about you being innocent though.”\nMahiru was sitting next to him, and she tapped at his leg beneath the table.\nShe looked towards him with slightly red cutes, “Sorry sorry” once he apologized, her pretty face made a pout, which made her rather cute. However, Amane held back the urge to laugh so as to avoid angering her.\n“…How do I put it, see, what we brag about is being bragged before us here.”\n“Isn’t that fine? Amane’s looking a relaxed compared to usual.”\n“Nn, sorry for having you cook for my parents.”\nAfter dinner, they spent two hours or so talking, before turning in for the night. However, his parents would be sleeping in the living room, so Mahiru would be the only one returning home.\nHis parents were off to bathe, so Amane was the only one to see her off. There was no need to see her off, but he did so just in case, and also to apologize for his parents’ recklessness for the day.\n“No, I am fine. I enjoyed myself today.”\n“I see.”\nLuckily, it appeared she was not displeased in the slightest.\nOne might say she was really joyous.\n“And also.”\n“Also?”\n“…I have understood the feeling of happiness, if a little.”\nMahiru showed a faint smile, accompanied by a soft voice as weak as a sigh.\nThe fleeting smile would seemingly vanish with the wind. He could sense some jealousy in her eyes, and had a rough idea of her family situation.\nHe felt he could not leave her be, so he inadvertently placed his palm on her hair, deliberately ruffling it.\nShe did not look annoyed, merely shocked as she looked up at Amane.\n“Wh-what is the matter?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Not nothing…my hair is all messy.”\n“You’ll be taking a bath anyway.”\n“You are right about that.”\n“…I can’t do that?”\n“N-not that you cannot…but you should have told me first.”\n“I already touched.”\n“You are just reporting after it happened.”\n“Sorry.”\nSo you’re willing to let me touch if I told you,\nhe had such a thought, but he did not voice it out. He obediently apologized, and Mahiru let out a little sigh.\n“Goodness…I am fine with that, but you cannot go about touching a girl on the hair.”\n“No, it’s not like I’ll go about touching others…”\nAt the very least, Amane knew well that the only ones of the opposite gender he could touch were those close to him. He could not do any casual skinship like an outgoing person.\nHe treated Mahiru as someone close, so he would be sure she would not dislike him while patting on her head. However, he would not do this to anyone other than Mahiru.\nTo be precise, he had no intention of touching anyone else. The most he would desire was to punish the prankster Chitose.\nOnce he said he would not touch anyone else, Mahiru was quiet, and did not shake off his hand.\n“…Now that I look at you, I do think you really resemble Shuuto-san, Amane-kun. I can tell even though we just met.”\n“In what sense? Our personalities and faces are so different.”\n“…You look similar. Really.”\nShe sighed hard this time, and this time, he rubbed her head with some frustration, but it appeared she did not dislike it.\n…Do we really resemble each other?\nWell, it was true that they would be mistaken for brothers with a large age gap if they stood next to each other, but they had completely different demeanors.\nTheir personalities were not completely contrasting, but they were not similar at all.\nOne would thus have to wonder why she said they resembled each other?\nHe had a few questions on his mind, but it appeared she had no intention to continue talking, her eyes narrowed at Amane as she left it at that.\nAfter he fondled enough, he let go of her head, and she suddenly reeled back, a little taken aback as she looked up at Amane.\n“What, you want me to keep touching?”\nHe asked mischievously, “please stop” and Mahiru answered with a blushing face, so he stopped.\nShe appeared to be a little peeved, looking displeased as she opened the door to her house, and slipped in.\nBefore he could regret going overboard here, she peeped through the door gap.\n“Amane-kun.”\n“What?”\n“…Amane-kun no, baka.”\nMahiru’s cheeks were slightly red, and she appeared to be pouting and yet fawning with sweet words, before closing the door.\n…Who’s the idiot here?\nIt was Mahiru’s fault for causing his heart to suddenly jolt.\nHe let out a little sigh, and leaned on the corridor wall to cool his heated body, before sighing out a breath of white air.",

      "content": "The new semester started, but there was no drastic change.\nEveryone spent the winter vacation as they wished, but the changes were not as drastic as they were during the summer vacation; nobody went for a major change in image, and the faces in the class remained unchanged.\nAmane sat quietly at his seat, observing the class that was noisier than usual, only to be approached.\n“Yo Amane, feeling fine?”\n“Thanks to you.”\nItsuki arrived at the classroom later than Amane did, still the same as usual.\nThey never met since Christmas, but he was still having the usual frivolous smile.\n“Did you have a good New Year?”\n“…Well, sorta.”\n“Why so hesitant? Any progress made?”\n“Seriously, what progress…not that, nothing happened.”\nHe could not say that nothing happened. Neither wanted it, but Mahiru spent the night at Amane’s place. He could not say this however.\nHe could easily imagine Itsuki telling Chitose about this, and both of them leering and teasing him.\nOther than that, his parents dropped by for Hatsumōde; but that probably could count as nothing.\n“…Hmm?”\n“Nothing happened.”\n“Well, I’ll take it as it is then.”\nAmane was annoyed by the leer, but he let it be, finding it a hassle to retort.\nTime to talk about something else…\nso he looked around the classroom with such a thought, but nothing special actually happened.\nThe girls were all gathered around the prince of their batch, Kadowaki. Neither his slightly perturbed look in the middle of them all changed, nor did the plain old jealousy of the boys gathered around them.\n“Looks like nothing changed at all.”\n“Well, that’s Yuuta for you. Same old, same old.”\nAmane was just observing out of boredom alongside Itsuki, who had no interest in other girls as he had a girlfriend, giving a wry smile at Yuuta’s popularity. They then looked around.\n“Speaking of which, I heard that Shiina-san has a boyfriend.”\nA few girls were huddled together, and upon hearing their conversation, Amane stiffened.\n“Ah, Lisa said that. She was holding hands with a boy during Hatsumōde.”\n“She did she did. Maybe Shiina-san isn’t interested in anyone because she has a boyfriend?”\n“I heard that he’s rather good looking, but he never showed up at school. I wonder if he’s from another school.”\nPerhaps it was just him, but it seemed all the stares in class were gathered upon the talking girls. Even that Yuuta appeared to be pricking his ears towards them.\nOnly Itsuki’s stare was directed towards Amane.\n“Say Amane.”\n“I don’t know.”\n“I haven’t said anything.”\n“Nothing to do with me.”\n“Alright now.”\nItsuki gave a wry smile at Amane’s soft denial, and suddenly lifted the latter’s bangs.\n“Well, you keep it hidden, but you have a nice face.”\n“Coming from you, I think you’re just teasing me.”\nWhile Itsuki appeared to be lighthearted and have a frivolous vibe, he might be considered handsome .\nAnd to Amane, a handsome lad telling him that felt sarcastic.\nHe felt his appearance was merely passable, and did not want to hear others’ opinion of his face.\nHe waved aside the hand touching his bangs, and frowned, spotting Itsuki’s wry smile.\n“That’s how you are.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Well, I can say that’s just like you.”\nWhile Amane looked as aloof as before, Itsuki was chuckling instead of looking furious.\n“Looks like rumors have spread in school.”\nAfter dinner, he noted to Mahiru who was seated across the dining table. The latter understood what he meant, her face stiffened.\nMahiru herself would be the most perturbed.\nIt appeared none of the rumors mentioned Amane in person, but it must be exhausting for Mahiru to be asked if she had a boyfriend. Thus on this day, she looked a little rigid when she arrived at Amane’s house, her steps probably heavy because of this.\n“…At least nobody found out it was you, Amane-kun, but it was a lot of effort resolving the misunderstandings.”\n“Does holding hands make me a boyfriend now?”\n“I do not know. Anyway, I denied it, and said he was someone I know. We just have to wait for the rumors to disappear.”\n“Nn, well, that’s to be expected.”\nHe felt apologetic for being assumed as her boyfriend, so he too wanted the rumors to dissipate as soon as possible. It would be really stressful for her to be asked repeatedly if she was his boyfriend.\nThe same applied for Amane, who would be restless whenever he heard these rumors, out of apology and shame. He wanted people to forget the rumors.\nHaa,\nhe let out a sigh, and Mahiru silently lowered her eyes.\n“…Do we look like lovers?”\n“Who knows? Right now, someone like me can’t be your boyfriend, Mahiru. You can choose a more handsome guy out there, and even if you’re with me, I look more like an ordinary acquaintance.\n“You are not just someone.”\n“Eh?”\nAmane looked towards Mahiru once again after hearing this unexpectedly forceful voice; she reverted back to looking gloomy, though for some reason, she looked a little…furious, adamant.\n“You have low self-esteem of yourself, Amane-kun, but that is not true. I do think you are an outstanding person, Amane-kun. You are kind, understanding, gentlemanly, good natured…and really cool when you do dress yourself up.”\nHis cheeks started to blush as he listened to the earnest praise that did not seem to be so.\nHe never expected her to have such a high opinion of him, and she was overly serious with what she said, which left him embarrassed.\nMahiru might have realized how embarrassing her words were, for she started stammering midway through.\nDespite that, she stared at his eyes, indicating that she was being heartfelt; the compliments left him increasingly bashful.\n“I-I see…erm, thanks.”\n“So-so I say, erm, well…please do not look down on yourself.”\n“O-oh…”\nHe could not deny it, now that he was praised by her, for the mood would not allow for him to be humble in any way.\nMahiru’s cheeks were slightly reddened as she lowered her head, quivering in shame. Amane too felt the shame rising up within him, and quietly muttered.\n“…Well, I’ll go wash the dishes.”\n“Y-yes.”\nIn any case, all Amane could do was to escape sheepishly.\nIt might be called a tactical retreat, for it was bad for his heart to see her quivering in embarrassment.\nSuu, haa,\nhe took a deep breath, stood up, and brought the utensils to the sink. Mahiru went to the living room, sat on the sofa, and buried her face into the cushion. It seemed she too was embarrassed, unused to the concept of lavishing praise.\nOnce he saw that, “If you’re embarrassed, don’t say this” Amane murmured, but because of her words, he felt some weight lifted from his chest.\nHe felt quite relieved after receiving approval, probably.\nSo he thought, but he was still embarrassed. It was winter, yet he was listlessly washing the dishes with cold water.",

      "content": "“Hey~hey~Amane, lend me the Angel, will ya?”\nChitose called in after dinner.\nUsually, they would contact each other through app, but for some reason, she called Amane, asking the latter about Mahiru. He had no idea what she was planning.\nShe said to lend her, but Mahiru was not Amane’s belonging. Chitose should have asked her directly.\n“Don’t ask me, ask Shiina.”\n“She’s next to you now, right?”\n“…She is.”\n“Then ask her if she wants to go out with me tomorrow.”\n“Ask her yourself.”\nShe doesn’t have the number?\nHe wondered, but he remembered then that during Christmas, Chitose was fully focused on teasing Mahiru, and did not have time for that.\nAnd also, Amane would surely have Mahiru’s contact, and was often with her. It was to be expected why he was contacted.\nChitose’s thought process was understandable, but he wanted to tell her that he was not a mail pigeon.\nIn any case, it would better for Mahiru to discuss this instead, so he thought as he handed the phone to an incredulous looking Mahiru next to him. “Chitose wants to talk to you.” So he said, and slumped into the sofa.\nMahiru looked a little perturbed, but she obediently brought the phone to her ear.\n“I am taking over…eh, tomorrow? Y-yes, I have no special arrangements…”\nIt seemed Mahiru was taken aback by Chitose’s sudden rapid fire talk, and he could only watch her perturbed look with a wry smile.\nShe did not seem impatient, but was taken aback by the sudden suggestion, hapless, not knowing what to do.\nShe glanced aside to him, “Just see what you want. She wants to go out with you, not me” he answered.\nMahiru would go out with her friends once in a while, but her priority was to return home and prepare dinner hours later.\nHe thought she should have a break once in a while, leaving aside whether she would be getting a break going out with Chitose.\n“Y-yes…erm, I will like to accept this invitation…”\nShe might have made up her mind after hearing Amane’s words. When she answered Chitose, he could hear the latter go “Alrighty!” over the phone, and Mahiru instinctively pulled the phone away from her ear.\nHe chuckled in amazement as how Chitose was being all enthusiastic, and met Mahiru in the eyes\nShe looked a little worried, but her lips still showed a smile of relief and joy.\nOnce Chitose had quieted down somewhat, Mahiru picked up the smartphone, and started talking.\nShe was smiling as she talked, and Amane too smiled as he looked at her.\n“Thank you very much. I shall return this to you.”\nShe ended the call, and carefully returned the smartphone to him.\nIt seemed they had made plans, and she would be dragged somewhere by Chitose.\n“That was sudden, wasn’t it? That’s basically Chitose.”\n“W-well, that shocked me.”\n“She’s not a bad person, just a little too forceful.”\nThough he felt the ‘a little’ might be understating it, he gave her a mild appraisal. She definitely was not a bad person, just a little pushy.\nMahiru might have understood the personality well as she gave a wry smile, but luckily, she did not seem annoyed by that. It was a little tragic that while she was the girlfriend of his own close friend, he just could not get along with her, even though it was common.\n“You don’t have to worry about me tomorrow. Just go enjoy yourself.”\n“Yes.”\n“…Ahh, right.”\n“Yes?”\nWhile he wanted her to enjoy it, he had to remind her of something.\n“If she sexually harasses you, just punch her without worrying about it. That one’s just like my mom; she likes cute, pretty things, so she probably will want to touch you all over since you’re so pretty.”\nThey managed to stop her the last time, but Chitose really liked cute things.\nHe had Chitose’s keen eyesight assist him for Mahiru’s birthday, but he was uneasy about having her remain alone with Mahiru.\nMahiru had the look of an ideal beautiful girl, her cuteness and beauty would garner lots of bystander stares whenever she walked down the streets.\nIt was imperative for Mahiru to be wary of anyone approaching her, and also Chitose’s demonic clutches.\n“Well, you don’t have to do this if you don’t like her, but if you don’t reject her outright, she might just get cocky and harass you, so be careful…what is it?”\n“…Nothing at all.”\nShe pursed her lips, and he found it weird, but she never stated what was on her mind, instead averting her eyes silently.\nOn the day Mahiru went out with Chitose, Amane was alone at home, finally getting some peace after such a long while.\nMahiru had been by his side frequently, and the only other time he got to be alone was his rest days.\nEven then, Mahiru would suggest to cook lunch, and he would accept heartily, so that alone time had decreased further.\nHe did not hate it, of course…he might even feel at ease, but it was good to have some personal time occasionally.\nThough it felt cold next to him.\nFor some reason, it feels like Mahiru has become completely familiar with me.\nHe felt it was a given for her to be next to him, but in fact, only a few months passed since their first encounter.\nDespite that, it felt like they spent many years together, probably because they had so much compatibility.\nThey did not interfere with each other too much, shared the same air, and this bit of gap between them was something Amane was very content with.\nThe troubling thing was that he did not want to let go of this comfort.\nI’m really a simpleton.\nHe felt that while he liked her, there was no such passion between them. As mere neighbors and friends however, he might be too possessive of her.\nHe liked her more than a friend, and at the same time, he was aware that there was only a little spark in thinking she would be a love interest; he felt an unspeakable itch within him.\nIf his fondness of Mahiru tilted any more on the balance, he felt there would be no turning back.\nThus, he kept the ignited heat within his heart, burying it.\nIf he expressed his fondness of her, she would be perturbed, it seemed.\nShe had expressed some level of fondness to him, but he felt it was not borne out of love. After all, there was no way she could fall for a useless boy like him who kept causing her trouble.\nShe had appraised him, but he felt there was no way she could fall for him. If he expressed his fondness in the wrong manner, the relationship between them would only be awkward.\nHe suppressed the throbbing uneasiness in his heart, and silently looked out of the window.\nThe winter nights came earlier, and there was already a dark veil laid around them.\nIt was merely past 6, but one could say it was night.\nAfter all, Chitose would not take her out till so late at night, yet he was uneasy about having two pretty high school girls wander alone outdoors when it was dark.\n“When are you done?”\nHe messaged Chitose, who would always have the smartphone with her,\n“We’re going to say bye bye soon”\nand received this instant reply.\nIt seemed Chitose too did not intend to stay outdoors for too long after school, so Amane asked when they would arrive at the station, stood up from the sofa, and went to the basin.\nI still have some wax from the other day.\nHe was rather unwilling, but he would be meeting Mahiru, and had no choice.\nHe really did not want to do this, but his parents taught him how the tricks to increase his charm. At the very least, he could replicate the hairstyle from back then, somewhat.\nHe looked into the mirror, and saw his usual gloomy self.\nSo he took the wax, and personally changed the usually boorish, gloomy looking self with his own hands.",

      "content": "It was winter, and the nights without sun were really cold.\nHe wore a light grey sweater with a navy blue pea coat for warmth and fashion, along with black skinny pants with inner lining; he was still so cold, so how cold would Mahiru be wearing only a coat over her uniform?\nMahiru wore thicker tights for winter, but her skirt was barely short enough for a high school girl to not break the rules or look crude, and one would feel really cold just looking at it. He thought she should wear some pants.\nThe few high school girls he brushed by were swaying their meaninglessly short skirts, and he was painfully aware how much hard work they put into beauty.\nSo he thought as he covered his lips with the muffler Mahiru gave him, and hurried towards the nearest station.\nIt seemed they went to a large shopping facility, and took the train there. The nearest station from the apartments was within walking distance, and Chitose said that the train was about to arrive, so he should be right on time.\nThe hair gently blew at his waxed hair as he walked, but not ruining it.\nHe would have to tidy up his hair if it got messy, and that would be troublesome. He felt that those who usually dolled themselves up were worthy of respect.\nSo he thought as he moved on silently, and spotted the station.\nShe might appear at this entrance, considering the direction of the apartments. If he waited near here, he should surely meet her.\nHe leaned his back on the entrance wall, looking at the time as he waited for Mahiru; soon after, the girl with the familiar flax-colored straight hair exited the station.\n“Mahiru.”\nHe called out to her, and she turned around after hearing the familiar voice…only to freeze once Amane appeared in her sights.\n“Eh, …yes? Wh-why?”\nThe why probably referred to this getup.\nShe probably knew from Chitose that he would be picking her up, but she probably never expected him to welcome her with the Hatsumōde appearance.\nAmane could not show up in his usual attire and hairstyle after all.\nIt would be troublesome if anyone around them spotted him and connected the dots. Furthermore, even Mahiru would look down on him if he was to walk alongside her in his usual getup.\nHe was intending to disguise himself, but at the very least, he could appear passable standing next to Mahiru.\n“You’re thinking I can’t do that? I can’t meet you in my usual style after all.”\n“…That is correct.”\n“It doesn’t suit me? I did check the mirror. Weird?”\nWhile he was dressed normally, his hairstyle was exactly the same as during Hatsumōde. He did not think it was anything, but it might be different to those who had an outstanding sense of beauty.\nHe had some stares directed at him, and there was a possibility that he looked weird.\nHe dressed up quite a bit, but it seemed he still looked plain, and he shook him a little. Mahiru however shook her head “it suits you.” He was relieved at her affirmation.\n“That’s good then. Look, it’s dark out here. It’ll be dangerous for you to walk alone.”\n“…I-I know that, at least.”\n“Or you don’t want me to pick you up? If you aren’t willing, you can follow me from behind. I’ll walk ahead of you.”\n“I-I do not dislike that. Erm…thank you, very much.”\n“Nn.”\nHe was relieved as she did not appear to dislike this, so he withdrew his hand from his pocket. She tentatively placed hers onto his.\nPerhaps due to the cold, her hand was somewhat colder than he expected.\n“It’s cold. Where’s your glove?”\n“I washed it today. What about your hand, Amane-kun?”\n“I put my hands in the pocket.”\nHe arrived with both hands in his pocket, and no good child should imitate him; it was nothing particularly noteworthy.\nHe did not say anything more, just wrapping his hand the fine, cold hand.\nMahiru’s hand was really slender, delicate, unreliable, easily wrapped in Amane’s hand.\n“…So warm.”\nShe muttered, narrowing her eyes as she seemingly beamed.\nThe earnest emotions had his heart pounding, but he focused on the hand, and did not showcase how shaken he was.\nHe held her hand, taking the bag from her shopping trip with Chitose before walking off..\nChira,\nshe glanced up at him, “What?” and he answered,\nMahiru stared at Amane, before she finally looked aside.\nHer ears and cheeks were slightly red, either from the cold, or from staring at him for too long.\n“Alright, shall we get something from the convenience store on the way back? The meat buns are really delicious in this season.”\n“…I like red bean fillings.”\n“You really like sweets…what about dinner?”\n“I have prepared some seasoned eggs, char siu and menma, so ramen.”\n“Ramen for these cold days sound nice.”\n“It does.”\nHe did not know as he never checked the fridge, but it seemed she bought those days ago.\nThey had to buy the soup and noodles, but the ingredients were all hand made. His throat croaked as imagining the thick char siu and the robust taste of the half-boiled eggs.\nThat taste would surely fill the cold bodies.\n“…I do not know if I can eat the red bean bun.”\n“We’ll share half of it. You can eat dinner then.”\n“…Yes.”\nShe bashfully accepted his suggestion, and he smiled, exerted a little more strength in the grip holding her hand.\n“I think Shiina-san was spotted walking with the same boy again.”\nAnd the next day, Itsuki shot Amane a reproaching look for adding fuel to the fire once again. Amane played dumb as he looked aside.",

      "content": "Entering February, rumors of the ‘mysterious boy suspected to be Mahiru’s boyfriend’ seemed to have quelled.\nOne major reason was that Amane did not meet Mahiru outside again. Amane was spotted picking her up, kicking off the rumors, but no other news happened thereafter, so it seemed the flames were extinguished for the time being.\nDespite that, there seemed to be common understanding that ‘the boy was not Mahiru’s boyfriend, but someone close to her’. There were also baseless rumors spreading that Mahiru had interest in that boy…which she denied with a smile that would not allow them to probe further, and that somehow calmed down.\nChitose seemed to have witnessed that scene on the corridor, and according to her, Mahiru was giving off an ‘unspeakable intimidating aura’, so it seemed the latter really hated it.\nThat was to be expected, but he was a little sad to know that she was vehemently denying it. At the same time, he felt it was to be expected.\nThere was no love between them, and their relationship was in question just because they were acting a little familiar; surely she would be furious.\nAmane himself could only show a wry smile.\n“Speaking of February?”\n“End of year exams.”\n“Hey, why is a high school boy in his blooming stage having such boring thoughts?”\nIt was after school, and Chitose popped by at Amane’s house, uninvited actually; she could not hide how dumbfounded she was to hear that answer.\nHe heard that she wanted to discuss something; perhaps it was just him, but it seemed she wanted to play with Mahiru.\nIn any case, Mahiru was brewing tea in the kitchen. Amane and Chitose were the only ones in the living room.\n“I don’t know if any high school boy has a blooming stage, but I think it’s an obvious thought for students…”\n“Any high school boy enjoying his youth should be talking about Valentine’s, right?”\n“I don’t know. I’m not enjoying my youth.”\n“Don’t kid around~”\nShe knew the rumors were not true, but she leered away at him, so he glared back.\nNevertheless, she did not stop smiling, so he could only give up.\n“So, what are we discussing?”\nChitose said that she came to Amane’s house to discuss with Amane and Mahiru, leaving out Itsuki.\n“Nn. I’m wondering what chocolates to give to Ikkun. In middle school, I just melted the chocolate and hardened it again, but I think as a high schooler, I should look to do something a little trendy.”\n“Then Shiina’s suggestion should be enough for you.”\nAmane could not cook, and if anyone was to ask him about chocolates, he could only say that he did not know, just Itsuki’s likes at most. However, she spent more time with Itsuki than he did, and already knew about these things, it seemed.\n“I can ask Mahirun, but you are somewhat a guy anyway, Amane~ I want to hear what a boy has to say.”\n“What’d you mean somewhat I’m a real guy here.”\n“I do think a boy will act on a girl when two of them are alone.”\n“Say, that only happens when the other side agrees to it, and we aren’t in that sort of relationship.”\n“You really are well raised there, Amane. Some healthy thoughts you have.”\nHe was appraised to have healthy thoughts, but Amane himself assumed it was common sense.\nIt was true that boys could do such things to girls they do not like, but the concepts of being able to do was a little different from actually doing it. After all, he had to be concerned about what she thought.\nHe would be lying if he said that he did not have such desires on Mahiru. He felt that it was to be expected for a boy to have some desires from a female who was charismatic inside and outside.\nBut despite that, he would not want to think of any folly.\nHe did not want to make her cry, to be hated by her, and wanted to dote on her…such were the feelings he first had for her.\nAlso, she had declared that she would harm him greatly, both socially and critically, and he was not foolish to actually do anything out of his lust. It was likely she would actually follow through with the threat.\n“Well that’s another good point of you, Amane, or rather why you got Mahirun’s trust there.”\nChitose had given Mahiru the cute nickname Mahirun instead. Mahiru did not deny it even though she heard it in the kitchen, so while he did not know if she was willing, she was at least accepting of this given nickname.\nWell, for her, it might be better than being called the Angel.\n“Sometimes I wonder if you’re a guy.”\n“I said I’m a guy. Is there a girl out there who’s rugged and bony all over?”\n“So an herbivore…you know, I think you can be a little more greedy, Amane?”\n“Won’t it be disgusting for me to be greedy in this appearance?”\n“Just use that manly style the last time. I want to see.”\nItsuki and Chitose already knew that the rumored person was Amane, and he admitted it days ago, so there was no point hiding it at this point.\nHowever, he did not want to show them that style, and he found it a hassle.\n“Don’t say that. I hate that getup of mine.”\n“It’s not like you’ll lose anything—”\n“My sanity and wax will.”\n“You cheapskate!”\nMiser!\nChitose puffed her cheeks, and he ignored her. Mahiru returned from the kitchen with a wry smile on her face.\nOn the tray were the cups of milk tea, which Chitose wanted.\nAfter three cups were served onto the table before the sofa, Amane stood from the sofa, and sat on the cushion nearest to it.\n“Sit down.” He prompted Mahiru with this look, and the latter felt a little awkward as she cautiously sat where he once sat.\n“There are such rumors going on; you can be rather popular at school if you make that hairstyle.”\n“I don’t want to. It’s definitely going to be a hassle, and I never wanted to be popular.”\n“Ehh~ Valentine’s going to be a big turning point. You sure you don’t want any Valentine’s chocolate, Amane? Look at the popular Yuu-chan for example, he’ll receive quite a lot, you know? Aren’t you jealous?”\n“Eh, no, that’ll cause diabetes.”\nIt was likely the prince Kadowaki would receive lots of chocolate, but he would gain lots of excess fat if he ate them all.\n“Besides, it’s a hassle to repay all these gifts. Including the obligatory chocolate and the heartfelt chocolate, Kadowaki’s probably have to deal with dozens of them, and he has to repay them three times worth. Isn’t that too much for a high schooler’s wallet?”\n“So you’re taking it that you have to repay three times worth? Great. Well, you don’t have to worry about repaying me, I’ll give you chocolates. How do you like it?”\n“I don0’t really hate or like sweet stuff…something not too sweet, I guess.”\n“Got it. I’ll add different things inside.”\n“Don’t add anything strange in.”\n“Don’t worry, it’s edible.”\n“Say.”\nHe did not know what she was going to add, but it seemed Chitose had no intention of delivering a normal delicious chocolate.\n“Mahirun, who are you giving yours to?”\n“All the girls I interact with in class.”\n“You’re not giving to any boy?”\n“…If I do give obligatory chocolates, there will be a commotion…”\n“Ah~”\nOne could easily imagine the boys getting all fired up, and after that, a meaningless melee between them.\nTo the ordinary boys, chocolates from the Angel would be a god’s present to them. If she gave them any, there would be quite the uproar going on. One had to wonder which was the terrifying one; Mahiru’s popularity, or the imagination of the boys.\nHe understood with a wry smile that there would be no trouble if she did not give any.\n“I will give to you, Chitose-san.”\n“Yay, I love you, Mahirun. I’ll give you some too~ the best chocolate for you unlike what I’ll give Amane.”\n“Oy you.”\nChitose grinned away as she latched onto Mahiru.\nAt the very least, he was relieved that she was not sexually harassing Mahiru, but he could not let those words past him. He glared at Chitose fiercely, and the latter showed a dumb face on her face.\n“Just kidding~ I’ll make sure yours is edible too, Amane.”\n“Feels like this edible is completely different from being delicious…”\nHe saw that Chitose was clearly planning some mischief, and felt a migraine as he held down his forehead. Chitose clearly showed her joy “Look forward to it.” as she giggled at him.",

      "content": "As expected, the school was in a ruckus on Valentine’s Day, and everyone was in a restless mood.\nMany boys were eagerly looking forward to something while pretending not to have any interest.\nMany boys felt that being able to receive chocolates on this day would determine their manliness level, and thus their attitudes.\n“Everyone’s getting restless.”\nAmane, never one to pay heed to this, felt it was really troublesome, and turned towards Itsuki who had no interest due a different reason.\nItsuki himself was leisurely watching the commotion in class “Yep” and answered back at Amane.\n“So Itsuki-san, who’s being carefree because he has a girlfriend, please state your understanding of this year’s Valentine.”\n“I guess all the boys are feeling really desperate; whether they can get chocolate today, that will determine their futures. Also, there’s about 60% of them being restless, hoping to receive chocolates from Shiina-san.”\n“Looks like she’s not giving any obligatory chocolates to the guys, or else it’ll be a mess.”\n“I guess…anyway Amane-kun, are you expecting to receive any from her?”\n“Who knows? I can’t tell at all.”\nMahiru would give to the girls, but not to the boys, so he was not expecting to receive chocolates. Even if he did not, he was fine with that.\nOf course, if he received it, he would be grateful, but it really did not matter.\nTo be honest, Amane felt Valentine’s Day was merely a promotion from a sweets company, and not some very important event.\n“How boring.” Itsuki gave a wry smile once he noticed that Amane clearly had no interest, and turned away to look at where the biggest commotion in class was.\n“…But well, that’s really amazing.”\nThe ‘that’ Itsuki was referring t was the person popular with almost all the girls in class.\nThe prince was gathered in the middle, showing an innocent, adorable smile, girls flocking to him and giving him wrapped chocolates.\nClass had not started, but the bag he had prepared was already full of gifts, his popularity clear to see.\n“Well, that’s really amazing.”\n“Same goes for the guys gritting their teeth around him.”\nSome boys probably never received chocolates, and they merely stared into the distance, or looking at Kadowaki with envy.\nThe difference in popularity was right before them, before they could even be rated, and they could only watch and lament.\nBut Amane was concerned that it might be tough for Kadowaki to bring that many chocolates back, and he wondered how the latter would handle them.\n“The popular guy sure has it tough. It’ll take lots of effort to bring them back and eat them.”\n“I guess, but it’s amazing how he’s still not fat. Feels like he’s been like that since middle school. The body shape hasn’t changed at all.”\n“Guess that’s to be expected of the track team. But I can’t say I won’t get fat eating chocolate.”\n“Chii made your chocolate. Be prepared.”\n“What do you mean, prepared?”\n“Russian roulette.”\n“No wait, what did she add inside?”\nHe sensed from the conversation days ago that she was not going to make ordinary sweets, so it seemed she added something unnecessary.\n“Let’s see, a chocolate with habanero, wasabi, Japanese pepper, one with umeboshi extract energy jelly, and the rest are all normal.”\n“What the hell did she make!?”\n“Looks like she wants to surprise you, Amane.”\nHe might be shocked in a certain way, near outright agony it seemed.\n“…I’m scared to eat.”\n“Just give up. I experienced this when I taste tested.”\n“Did you eat it for fun or something?”\n“Well sorta. I’ll eat anything Chii makes.”\n“Damn you bakauple.”\nItsuki would eat anything Chitose would make for him.\nIn fact, Chitose’s cooking was not bad in any sense; the problem was that she was overly adventurous. She could make it as normal as possible if she put her mind to it, but she had the tendency of adding some bothersome steps.\nThe usual sacrifice was Itsuki, but he never expected himself to be the sacrifice this time around.\nLooking at Itsuki’s reaction, the chocolate should be somewhat edible, not something to be overly terrified of, but he would still worry about worrying things after all.\nWhile Amane looked a little downhearted, Itsuki gave him a warm look of one who had survived the experiences, the just give up look.\n“Come on Amane, here!”\n“Thanks.”\nAfter school, Chitose came to pick up Itsuki, and delivered chocolates to Amane, the latter answered her with little enthusiasm.\nHe was grateful to receive them, yes.\nGrateful, but there was dangerous stuff inside; he could not be as happy as he would like.\nHe intended to finish all of them, so he would surely encounter the super-hot and super tangy flavors, so he would be worriedly eating the chocolates over the following days.\n“You heard from Ikkun, so look forward to seeing what’s inside!”\n“I really don’t like spicy stuff…”\n“It’s still edible at least, you know? I tried it before, it’s rather nice!”\n“That’s because you like spicy stuff…goodness.”\nAmane could not pique his interest as he did not like spicy stuff that much. He also did not like sour stuff, so the chocolates contained flavors he disliked.\nThe good news however that was others were probably delicious.\n“Ahh, there’s some super sweet and super bitter.”\n“Thanks for telling me beforehand.”\nChitose heartily added another bomb to him, and he was so frustrated, he wanted to cup his own head.\nThe super sweet chocolate probably contained condensed milk, and the super bitter contained 99% cacao.\nHe could however handle that much. He did not dislike bitter stuff.\nIt seemed this was the first time Itsuki heard of it, “Chii…you…” his cheeks twitched slightly, but Chitose maintained her smiling face.\n“It’s fine. There are some that fit his taste buds.”\n“Fit?”\n“We’ll be going off then~ bye bye~”\nShe grabbed Itsuki’s hands and ran off without answering Amane’s question. They appeared to be on their Valentine date.\n“I pray for your safety”, he received these consoling words of encouragement from Itsuki, and waved with a sigh as he watched them leave.\nOnce he saw them disappear, he felt it was time to head back, so he put on his coat, and took the bag from the hook on the side of the table.\nHe was not displeased about being alone, but he intended to leave early, for if he stayed around for too long, the riajuu boys and girls would be too overwhelming for him.\nHe was about to leave with the bag on his back, only to look at the most popular boy in the year.\nIt seemed the bombardment of presents had stopped as Kadowaki stared at the items all the boys thirsted for, looking into the distance. The bag next to his table was also filled with treasures.\nAmane immediately realized what he was thinking, and with some pity, he went over.\n“Kadowaki.”\n“Nn, ahh, Fujimiya? What is it?”\nThey had been classmates for almost a year, so even though Amane did not have much presence, his name was remembered.\nKadowaki was surprised to be approached by an unexpected person, because apart from duty matters, Amane would never approach him to talk.\nAmane could only give a wry smile at that attitude, and unzipped a little pocket at the front of his bag.\n“Nothing much, here.”\nHe took out a few supermarket bags that were compacted into triangles, and tossed them at Kadowaki.\n“Do prepare a few inside just in case. It will be useful later on.” Mahiru said when she put them in. When he received them, he thought he would be using them as barf bags or trash bags, but he never expected to use this to help others in a page of youth.\nWhat is this,\nso Kadowaki wondered as he opened the triangular blocks, and they were plastic bags much larger than he expected.\nThey were not particularly thick, so they might tear, but Amane was not going to help him out that much, so he would leave it to the actual party involved.\n“Am I wrong?”\n“N-no…you’re right.”\n“I see. Looks tough, hang in there.”\nSomeone might see Kadowaki carrying large bags in school.\nBeing a popular guy sure is tough,\nso Amane thought as he waved his hand and left the classroom.",

      "content": "It was Valentine’s Day, but there was no such mood at home, and like usual, he returned home to rest.\nIt was not time to make dinner yet, so Mahiru was next to him. However, she never looked anxious, and did not show signs of wanting to do anything to Amane.\nHe never looked forward to receiving chocolates, so that was fine with him. The little sadness he had however was merely a result of his pride as a man.\n“There’s a sweet smell in school today.”\n“It is Valentine’s Day after all.”\nIt seemed the Angel had given chocolates to the girls she was acquainted with, but did not give any to the boys, not even obligatory ones. He could hear devastated voices from the boys who were infatuated with her.\nWhy do they think they can receive any from her when they don’t even interact?\n…he wondered, but the boys were ultimately being hopeful.\n“Well, Valentine’s Day is just an event for the popular guys. It doesn’t have anything to do with unattractive guys like us.”\n“You seem mentally prepared.”\n“Not that I’m proud of it, but I never received heartfelt ones. I only received Russian obligatory chocolates from Chitose.”\n“Russian Obligatory chocolate?”\n“Some chocolates with stimulating stuff mixed among normal chocolates.”\nIt appeared the chocolates Chitose gave contained some really spicy, sour, sweet, bitter, and various kinds, filled with the kinds to destroy his taste buds. He was terrified of eating them.\n“She made something really amazing again…”\n“I’ll eat it, so if it looks like I’m suffering, please forgive me.”\n“You will eat them all, I suppose.”\n“Of course. She prepared it for me anyway, so I’ll eat it. It’s not poison.”\nWhile there were stimulants inside, they were not harmful to the body, so he intended to eat those chocolates gratefully, since she made them for him.\nSince she spent the time making them, the recipient should finish it. However, he was really unenthusiastic about eating stimulating stuff.\n“…I see.”\n“Well, I didn’t receive anything else. I’m not a riajuu; Valentine’s Day isn’t something I can talk about.”\nHe was fine just receiving one obligatory chocolate.\nHe brooded, wondering how to repay her a month later as his eyebrows dropping. Mahiru in turn silently stared at him.\nAfter dinner, he ate Chitose’s chocolate, and fell prone on the table.\nHe received 12 truffle chocolates from Chitose, divided into time intervals.\nThere were four types of jackpot, a one in three chance of striking.\nThe grand prize was the really spicy one, so Amane though he could eat the others normally—only to end up like this.\n“You hit the jackpot.”\n“…I want to eat it over a few days, and this happens…”\nMahiru was in the kitchen making drinks when she noticed Amane, and approached him with a voice of pity.\nHe barely managed to swallow it; his mouth no longer feeling spicy, but pain. He knew spiciness was not really a flavor, but that was not the problem.\nShould he be considered lucky? This really was not something edible, it was bearable, but absolute suffering.\nThe wasabi’s unique sting agitated his nostrils, and he was impressed that Chitose really mixed all these flavors in, bemoaning with natural tears in his eyes that she should not have put in that much effort.\nHis nose and eyes were attacked by the wasabi, the habanero and pepper burned his tongue. It was an intense taste…painful even; one piece by itself left him battered all over.\n“It is unfortunate. But you may think of it as encountering hell first; all that is left is heaven.”\nDespite that, she was powerless to do anything about this pain.\nAmane really yearned for this pain to quickly vanish as he heard a soft sigh, and from the side, there was a thud.\n“Here, use this to wash it off.”\nHe lifted his head, and found a steaming mug next to him, giving off a sweet smell.\nIt contained some thick brown liquid.\n“Cocoa?”\n“Similar. This is chocolat chaud…well basically, hot chocolate. It is not that sweet, but should be sufficient in clearing your tongue.”\n“You saved me…”\nFor the time being, Amane’s urge was to wash off this this pain.\nHe poured the hot chocolate from the mug into his mouth, and the warm, rich flavor spread.\nIt had the sweet scent of chocolate, but the flavor was not too sweet, bittersweet rather, easy to drink, and comforting.\n“Delicious.”\n“That is good.”\nShe answered flatly, but he did not mind as he tried to conceal the pain in his mouth by slowly savoring the hot chocolate.\nThe chocolate itself did not contain much stimulant, and instead, they were mixed into ganache, hardened, and a coating of sugar was added. It was really impactful at first, but it eased up after some time.\nOnce he was done drinking, his tongue was back to normal, though a little numb.\n“Haa…she really mixed everything in…”\n“Was it that spicy?”\n“Well she added pepper, wasabi and habanero. Goodness…good thing there’s something to clean my mouth up. I would have died if I ate it out there.”\n“A silver lining in this misfortune, it seems.”\n“Too right.”\nDamn you Chitose,\nso he cursed, but he could not blame Chitose and she probably wanted to give him a surprise.\nBesides the jackpot, the others should be relatively normal, and she was not being malicious. She did make it for others, and tried it herself, so Amane could only give a wry smile at that.\n“Speaking of which, it’s rare to see hot cocoa now. Isn’t it usually hot milk?”\n“…Ehh, well.”\n“Wait, you’re making this for Valentine’s?”\nMahiru would usually drink hot milk or milk tea rather than hot cocoa; it was rare for her to make such a drink, so he asked, feeling a little hopeful.\n“…Well.”\n“Nn, thanks. You saved me.”\nShe nodded slightly, and Amane heaved a sigh of relief.\nIf she denied it at this point, he would be embarrassed by how sensitive he was being; it seemed he got it right this time.\nMahiru probably used Valentine’s Day as a roundabout way of doing this, but he was really grateful for this.\nOnce he told her “it was delicious”, she shivered a little uncomfortably.\n“What is it?”\n“…Erm, that.”\n“Hm?”\nHe sat next to her, but he assumed that she would stammer if he prompted her, so he made sure to sound kind, asking again,\nAfter prompting, Mahiru buried half her face into the cushion she tightly embraced, and looked up at him. Her body shriveled slightly as she looked up, and she looked so adorable, Amane had the urge to pat her head.\nShe was acting like a little animal, strangely adorable, capable of coaxing anyone to smile. Amane waited silently, but she shivered, not continuing on.\n“…I-I shall head back.”\nAnd for some reason, she suddenly stood up, and took her belongings.\nHeh?\nAmane blurted out, and she teetered away from the living room.\nAmane remained rooted as the entrance door opened and shut, followed by the sound of the lock. In the blink of an eye, Mahiru was gone.\nIt happened too quickly, “Ehhh…?” and he blurted out\nDid I do anything …?\nHe was half confused as he never expected her to run away, half worried that he did anything to ruin her mood…such was the anxiety filling his heart.\nWhat do I say to her if she’s still in a bad mood tomorrow?\nHe wanted to check on the entrance door she left by, only to notice a little paper bag hanging on the doorknob of his room.\nIt was the pink paper bag she brought along when she left, with a message card pasted outside the seal.\nThis is my daily thanksgiving to you for being in your care all this while.\nTypical of Mahiru, the card contained her polite, cursive handwriting. He looked into the bag, and found a chocolate-colored ribbon wrapped around a pastel pink box.\nWhy here?\nSo he wondered, but he immediately realized she hung it there.\nIt seemed she found it too shameful to give it to him directly. She said she would not give to the boys, and this left her hesitant.\nCouldn’t she just give it to me normally?\nHe gave a wry smile, thinking how she was rather reserved at such a moment, before removing the contents.\nThe box had a cute wrapping just like Mahiru, showcasing her feminine side.\nHe felt a little uneasy about whether he should receive her present, and slowly removed the wrapping, opening the box.\nInside it was chocolate coated sugar preserved oranges, each wrapped individually in vinyl. In other words, Orangettes.\nThe bright orange colors and the glossy dark chocolates looked really dazzling, and they looked really delicious.\nThere were normal chocolates and white chocolates coatings, and lemons too, ensuring that he would not get sick of them.\nAttached to the Orangettes was another message.\n『It seems you dislike sweets, so I made something easy to eat. It will be great if they suit your tastes』\nSuch was the message written, and he recalled the event ten days ago or so.\n“How do you like it? ”\n“I don’t really hate or like sweet stuff…something not too sweet, I guess. ”\nShe remembered his conversation with Chitose, and took note of his preferences.\nIt was just like Mahiru to notice the details, and to remember his likes. This was her gift to her, and these factors combined together left him embarrassed, his face a little hot.\nHe stared at the normal Orangettes that were individually wrapped for easy eating, and took one.\nThe bright glossy chocolates formed a beautiful contrast with the oranges. He took a bite\nSpreading in his mouth was the sour sweetness of the sugar preserved orange, and the slight bitterness of the dark chocolate.\nThe two flavors meshed perfectly, creating an impressive harmony.\n…It’s delicious.\nHe found them tastier than those sold in the shops, probably because it was made by Mahiru.\nSo he thought as he took another bite.\nMahiru’s Orangettes were sweet, sour, and a little bitter—but for some reason, it was incomparably sweet.",

      "content": "“Fujimiya, you helped me out yesterday.”\nAmane arrived at school the next day, and froze as Kadowaki suddenly spoke to him a little too naturally.\nThough they had some interaction yesterday, he never expected Kadowaki to thank him just for that little thing.\nUnlike when he was surrounded by the girls, Kadowaki was smiling as heartily as he could. Amane, being approached by Kadowaki, could feel some stares around him, and felt really unbearable.\nHe hated the attention, and was a little intimidated to be faced with such curious stares.\n“Ahh, you don’t have to worry about that. Looks like you had it tough too.”\n“Sort of…”\nKadowaki looked into the distance, and Amane answered with sympathy, “Well, a popular guy sure has it tough.”\nKadowaki himself knew he was popular, but was not proud of it. He was popular with the people around him, and the boys jealous of him did not really despise him.\nPerhaps one reason why he was so popular was because of his courtesy to thank others, even for the little things.\n“Anyway, you helped me out. Just want to thank you.”\n“It’s fine. We should help each other out when we’re in trouble.”\nHe did not help Kadowaki out just for a favor, and he did not think he did anything worthy of being thanked.\nDon’t fret,\nhe chuckled, and Kadowaki then smiled with some relief.\nThe surrounding girls started a ruckus upon seeing that earnest smile, and Amane could only show a wry smile, thinking that that smile should be directed at the girls.\n“Did anything happen between you and Yuuta?”\nAfter Kadowaki left, Itsuki, who seemed to have noticed, approached Amane.\n‘Yuuta’ here was Kadowaki’s given name. Itsuki was on better terms with everyone, was amicable, and could cook up the mood. Obviously he got along with Kadowaki.\nAmane sometimes was amazed and troubled by how Itsuki of all people was willing to be his friend\n“Eh, he received too many chocolates, and was at a loss of what to do. I just handed over my shopping bags to him…”\n“Ahh, guess he received more than expected. Managed to deal with them, somehow.”\nItsuki too had seen the masses of chocolates and the goodwill of the girls, so he understood after hearing Amane’s explanation, and gave a wry look with some pity mixed in.\nBack then, both of them felt that it would be tough for Kadowaki to bring so many back. It was not surprising for Amane to lend him a hand.\nAmane felt that he merely helped a little, and there was nothing to thank for.\n“That’s all. Nothing too impressive.”\n“I guess that’s just like you…but well, you got shopping bags prepared…why does it look like you’re raising a household? Feels like you’re a housewife when you’re looking at the supermarket ads on your phone.”\n“Well I’m a guy. But, I guess I was affected by something…”\nOne had to wonder if he should call it Mahiru’s fault, or that it was thanks to her.\nThey had to share the ingredients costs, so Amane would sometimes surf the web for ads to save as much as possible. Sometimes, he would suggest to Mahiru to make cheap things like those seen on the ads. To Itsuki, he was basically a slave to the household.\nPerhaps what he was doing was more akin to a housewife than a master of the household. However, the cooking was still left to Mahiru.\n“Sure is great to have a partner who can take care of the house.”\n“She’s not a partner…what about Chitose?”\n“Chii? Well, she, if she doesn’t act on any strange impulses, yeah…she probably still can’t do it.”\n“You’re saying that she capable of not doing anything crazy?”\n“…That makes her cute too, right?”\n“Oy don’t look away.”\nFor good or bad, Chitose was the haphazard thrill-seeker.\nIf she did things normally, she was capable to doing housework at the level of a typical high school girl; if she suddenly had a sense of mischief or a change in mood, she was capable of many things.\n“Well, seems like she’ll be a little more obedient when we get married.”\n“How long until your dad agrees…”\nItsuki’s father was rather strict about dating, a rarity at this time. He would not meet Chitose, and was displeased about them dating with the plan to get married in the future.\nIn contrast, Chitose’s parents were really welcoming of Itsuki. Isn’t it usually the opposite? …Amane was dumbfounded when he knew of it.\n“Well, I’ll try to convince him when I’m an adult. Like, does he want to see a grandchild?”\nHe was not going to listen to his father regarding this, and merely shrugged at it, but his eyes were full of seriousness, and he was indicating that he would fight until the very end.\nHe showed thus far how much he loved Chitose. Amane felt it was impressive for Itsuki to consider marriage in high school, and was supporting them.\n“…Well, you’re not going to give up until he gives up. Do your best.”\n“Oh. You too.”\n“For what?”\n“You and her…right?”\n“…She and I don’t have that sort of relationship.”\nDon’t guess randomly,\nhe said as he turned his face aside, only to hear Itsuki’s elated giggle next to him.",

      "content": "Amane returned from the supermarket with the requested ingredients, and found Mahiru already waiting for him on his sofa.\nIt was a usual scene, but the only difference was that Mahiru was hugging the cushion, her arms wrapped around her knees as she sat on the sofa.\nShe was pouting like a child in this posture, but she seemed more embarrassed instead, and wasso adorable that he did not know where to look.\nThank goodness for the long skirt,\nAmane averted his eyes awkwardly, went to the fridge and put the ingredients in. He returned to the living room, and found Mahiru peeking at him.\nHe sat next to Mahiru, and saw her stare averting elsewhere.\n“Mahiru, thanks for yesterday. It’s delicious.”\n“…Thank goodness.”\nHe knew she was still concerned about the previous day, but he thanked her as he was really grateful. Upon hearing that, her eyes looked towards Amane, her face still half buried in the cushion.\n“What do you want as a return gift?”\n“I did not give you that just for a return gift.”\n“I get that, but I should at least respond to your earnest thoughts with my own, right? It’s embarrassing for a guy to accept without giving back.”\nAmane firmly believed in the concept of returning what he received, and to him, since she had made such a delicious thing for him, he had to repay her in some way, and he was not going to compromise on that.\nAfter all, it appeared she never once did so to the others, but she made some for Amane’s personal tastes, and that would have taken some effort.\n“…I have received lots from you, Amane-kun.”\n“Actually, you’ve been offering so much for me. You’ve been cooking for me, and I’ve been causing you trouble.”\n“I am doing this because I like it…you may not have noticed, Amane-kun, but you have given me lots. That is sufficient.”\nAmane felt he never gave anything to Mahiru, and that he was the receiving side, so he wanted to repay Mahiru, but the latter did not seem to think so.\n“But that’s different…well, I’ll think of something you’ll like.”\nEven if Amane had unwittingly given her something, it was different from a White Day’s gift.\nSince he received chocolates on Valentine’s Day, he should repay her on White Day. It was a form of basic courtesy.\nI am not going to compromise,\nhe gave her such a look, “…Yes” and once Mahiru saw it, her eyes faltered strangely as she nodded.\n“Anyway, there’s still about a month or so to think of something. Will be great if I can think of something you’ll like.”\n“…Do you have that much free time? We are starting our end of year exams next week. After that will be the closing ceremony.”\nMahiru pointed out in surprise. It was true that their end of year exams would begin the following week.\nOn this day, the school still had some aftertaste of Valentine’s Day, but it would quickly shift to a tense mood right before the exams.\nIt was not something Amane had to worry about in particular.\n“Well, I just need to perform during the exams like usual. Not like I’ll be retained, no need to worry. Same goes for you right, Mahiru?”\n“I suppose. It is easy if we have put in the effort.”\nAmane was serious with his studies, and usually did his preparations and revision, so he was not one to be troubled by the exams.\nEven without cramming at the last moment, he felt he could maintain his usual level of grades, and that was how he made it this far. At most, he would spend a little more time studying at the desk before the tests.\nMahiru in turn had grasped the lesson material beforehand, and like Amane, she was not one to skimp on her revision, so she did not look anxious. She might prefer the exams to the actual lessons, since her schedule for the day would end earlier.\n“Well, just wait for it, but don’t hope too much.”\n“…Yes. I shall treasure everything you give me, Amane-kun.”\n“That’s quite exaggerated.”\n“I have treated Kuma-san well too.”\nIt seemed she had treasured the doll he gave her for her birthday.\nHe saw the key case, and knew she was using it, but he was a little worried about the teddy bear…looking at Mahiru, it seemed she really liked it.\nHe nearly burst out laughing upon hearing Mahiru give such a cute name like Kuma-san, but if he did, he might get glared, so he held it in.\nIf he could remain with Mahiru like this, what should he give for her birthday this year…Amane was looking forward to it.\n“That’s good.” He answered Mahiru with a chuckle, and found her staring at him.\n“…Speaking of which, I do not know of your birthday, Amane-kun.”\n“Ahh me? November 8th.”\nHe realized he did not tell her that, so he told her of her birthday,\nssuuuu…\nand her eyes narrowed.\nThey had been together for months, so he understood that expression was her being a little furious.\n“…Say, Amane-kun.”\n“Nn?”\n“We already knew each other back then, no?”\n“Yep.”\n“Why did you not mention it back then?”\n“You never asked. You never mentioned your own birthday. I only knew when I saw your student ID.”\n“Uu.”\n“And anyway, our relationship wasn’t as good as it is now. If I mentioned my birthday, you would be wondering what I’m talking about.”\nIt’s my birthday,\neven if he said that to Mahiru, she would have answered “I see” and left it at that.\nFor Amane, that would be akin to begging for a present, which he hated, and he did not have such shame.\nThere was no need to mention, and they were not so trusting of each other, which was simply why he did not mention it.\n“…But.”\n“You don’t have to worry about that, you know?”\n“…Then, I shall celebrate your birthday this year.”\nIt seemed Mahiru was still not satisfied as she turned towards Amane, tugging firmly at his sleeve as she declared this.\nWell, she probably was displeased that only she got to celebrate. Her eyes were implying that she would celebrate his more seriously than her own, so Amane gave a wry smile at that.\nFor some reason, he was delighted to hear her say that…a smile of ordinary joy unwittingly appeared on his face.\nThus, Mahiru and Amane had the same thoughts…she wanted to be next to him, and that thought made him happier than anything else.\n“So we’re promising to stay together until then?”\nHe nonchalantly quipped, and Mahiru widened her clear caramel-colored eyes—her cheeks instantly blushing as she moved her hand away from his sleeve, slapping the cushion.\nIt seemed she was embarrassed to have this pointed out to her.\nAnxious to hide her embarrassment, she vented her tantrum on Amane, who nearly smiled again after seeing such an adorable scene.\n“…I do not, dislike you, Amane-kun …I feel calm, being with you. That is fine.”\n“I see. Thanks.”\n“I do not, mean anything else though.”\n“I know that at least.”\nShe hastily added, and he nodded understandingly, but for some reason, she looked a little displeased.",

      "content": "Amane was usually studious to begin with, and attentive in class, so he passed the exams without much effort.\nHe checked his answers with Mahiru, and found his score to be around the usual. Well, he had a good attitude at school, so he did not have to worry about retaining.\nItsuki too scored decent marks, and Chitose managed to avoid failing, so it seemed those Amane was well acquainted with were in no risk of repeating the year.\nAfter their exams, they would be sending off the third years during their graduation, which he had nothing to do with. After that would be the closing ceremony…but before then, there was an event, a problem.\n“…What do I repay her with?”\nYes, the returning gifts all the victors of Valentine’s Day would have to repay.\nLeaving aside whether Amane was a winner, he naturally intended to repay Mahiru and Chitose after receiving gifts from them.\nHowever, he was troubled as to what he should be giving.\nFor Chitose, he planned to buy the White Day package from the cake shop they bought from on Christmas, along with some collectable character goods.\nThe problem was Mahiru.\nHe felt Mahiru would be glad to receive anything from him.\nShe would gladly accept anything from Amane, and seemed to be more concerned about his feelings, not particularly fussy about what he would give.\nEven if he did pick from her likes, he only knew she liked sweets and cute things, which most girls would. Thus, he was frustrated about what he should be giving her.\nAfter all, the whetstone she mentioned the last time was out of the question as it would be pointless, and tight on his budget, but he was still wondering what to give. He would prefer to give her something to enjoy, rather than something practical to her.\nSo he thought as he wanted to the general store, looking at the White Day corner. Nevertheless, he could not figure out what she would really be happy with.\nIt would be great if the gift he gave this time would garner a similar reaction to the teddy bear the last time.\nNo point giving a doll twice.\nThere were lots of cute dolls, but there was a lack of variety giving two of the same items.\nHowever, Amane’s poor imagination could only think of cosmetics and accessories as things girls would like.\nHe was unsure if they were close enough for him to choose an appropriately designed accessory for her.\nAt the very least, she would accept it, but he wondered if she would be delighted with it.\nOf course, he felt that as boy and girl, they were on good terms…but he wondered if an accessory would make her happy.\nIt would be fine for Itsuki to give to Chitose, but a question mark Amane was to give it to Mahiru.\nSo he wandered around the special sales corner with a frustrated look, and might appear to be a suspicious fellow.\nWhile he had changed into his outdoor clothing, it would be weird for a boy to be wandering around the cute goods.\nHe grumbled that nothing would fit, only to be approached from behind, “Is there something you are looking for?”\nHe turned back to find a lady of vague age wearing the shop’s apron, smiling and standing behind him.\nShe probably came to assist, seeing how Amane was being bothered. There was no other reason why she would approach such a suspicious looking person that was wandering around.\n“Ahh, erm…I’m wondering what I should give for White Day.”\n“Is there nothing that catches your fancy? People have chosen items from other areas here. I shall look for some.”\n“Ah I don’t mean that…it’s just that I don’t know how to describe our relationship. I don’t know what I can give to not be hated.”\n“In what sense?”\n“She’s not a girlfriend, but rather close…like for example, I don’t know if she’ll be happy about receiving accessories from someone she might not like.”\nHis explanation was vague as it was embarrassing to do so, but the female clerk smiled upon hearing that, probably bemused by his worry.\n“It’s common for males to worry about such things.”\n“Then how did they decide?”\n“Well, most of them were bothered, but they made up their mind to buy. If you are close enough, you can give one, and she won’t hate you, usually.”\nShe won’t hate you,\nonce he heard those words, he felt relieved. Nevertheless, he was a little panicky about giving her an accessory.\nShe usually dressed herself well, but usually would not put on any accessory. The few times she wore them, they were all posh.\nShe had a keen fashion sense, and he had no confidence that whatever he chose would be to her liking.\n“If you want, shall I recommend you a few popular items among the females? Over there.”\n“…Please.”\nGrateful for this assistance, Amane straightened his posture without thinking, and nodded.\n“Nn, and you bought it.”\nAfter explaining to Itsuki, he was laughed at, giving a look similar to the clerk the other day.\nThey were eating the daily set meals in a corner of the cafeteria, and Amane accidently blurted it out when they were talking about White Day.\n“Shut up. But well, I’m giving her an accessory even though we aren’t dating. Isn’t that a little weird?”\n“Stop being lame. You’re a guy, hold your head up high. Besides, she’s happy to receive anything as long as it’s from you, right?”\n“…Since you mention it, yeah.”\nGiven Mahiru’s personality, she would be happy to receive anything from him.\nAmane however hoped to give her something that would really delight her, something she would use, and was worried if it would meet her requirement.\n“So, what you bought?”\n“…A pink and gold flower motif bracelet.”\nHe felt that rather than the cool looking silver and the impressionable, glamorous gold, the cute pink and gold would be more fitting of Mahiru.\nAs a student, he could not possibly buy precious metals, so he chose something similar in appearance. Of all the accessories of the same color, he felt he chose one with a fine design most suitable for Mahiru.\n“What? That sounds like it’ll make her happy, you know? ”\n“…Don’t you find it unattractive?”\n“No, aren’t you worrying too much? Why are you so pessimistic here…?”\n“She’s the first girl I’m actually giving a present to.”\nHis mother would not count as such, and neither would Chitose. He would be giving Chitose sweets, which she wanted, and he did not think that was a gift.\n“You really lack confidence in such things…”\n“Like, how can I possibly have confidence here…it’s to her, you know?”\n“She was happy with the teddy bear though.”\n“Well, that’s right.”\n“Amane, look at your feelings. You spent money, you bought the item, so now you just have to put your feelings into it.”\nItsuki said so frivolously, “Will be great if the work pays off”, Amane muttered as he put his hands on his forehead.\nIt seemed until White Day arrives, he would have to worry if he made the right decision.",

      "content": "On White Day itself, Amane looked a little nervous as he waited for Mahiru to arrive.\nThe mood at school was not as rowdy as Valentine’s, but one could sense the victors looking nervous as they planned to return their gifts, and the girls were all looking forward to it.\nJust to note, Kadowaki returned all the girls’ gifts with proper etiquette, and the sweets in total probably cost him tens of thousands of yen, which left Amane flabbergasted.\nAmane did not wait to gift Mahiru after school, and was at home instead.\nHe returned earlier, and was preparing himself mentally, but he was unused to giving a gift, and was tense.\nHe was not wearing his usual sweater or jersey shorts, but in layers, a grey V neck knitted coat over his white shirt, and chino pants.\nHe probably would not look as shabby as he usually was, but he was not sure what Mahiru would think, looking at his attire.\nWhile he was restlessly waiting for Mahiru’s arrival, he heard the unlocking of the door from the entrance.\nHe instinctively straightened his posture, probably out of nervousness.\nLike usual, Mahiru unlocked the door with her key, appearing at the living room, and froze once she saw Amane.\n“Eh, wh-why that hairstyle?”\n“Well, it’s White Day, so I thought I should dress a little formal…I can change it out if you find it weird.”\nHe managed to shock Mahiru, but it appeared she was not too fond of this getup—so he thought as he got ready to stand up, only to find Mahiru waving her hands, seemingly denying it.\n“Th-that is not true. I was just, shocked.”\n“I see.”\nMahiru herself looked a little restless, so it seemed the usual hairstyle would have been better off.\nShe sat down next to him, look very uneasy.\n“…I guess I shall change back if you can’t calm down?”\n“N-no, that is fine, but…you are just being cool for no reason.”\n“What do you mean, no reason?”\n“Th-the usual calm mood makes me more relieved…I cannot calm down, like this.”\n“I’ll change back then.”\n“…That is fine.”\nShe tugged at his sleeve, and looked up at him.\nHer cheeks were slightly red, probably out of shame, and her moist eyes were looking up at him, causing his heart to jump.\nShe might not have intended it, but she looked really uptight tugging at him while looking up. From up close, a sweet scent could be detected, and it was really tough in various ways.\nHe was unavoidably aware of this, but Mahiru seemed to have some interest in his attire, wanting him to stay despite fidgeting about. Both of them blushed, feeling extremely awkward.\nLooking aside, “O-oh.” He clumsily answered, and then tried to pass it off as he took the paper bag next to him, shoving it onto her.\n“Here, the return gift. Don’t be too hopeful about what’s inside.”\n“…Thank you very much. May I open it?”\n“Yeah.”\nHe was embarrassed to have his present opened before her, but he did not stop her.\nHe bought a velvet box to make it look presentable, and put the gift inside. However, he did not think the box matched the contents, and it seemed he might have overdone it this time.\nWith her white fingertips, Mahiru opened the dark blue box, and inside it was the pink gold bracelet he bought days ago, along with a folded piece of paper.\nMahiru did not like anything ostentatious, so he chose something simplistic, the flower motif bracelet.\nThe bracelet had crystal glass draped at various places, and it was a cute, elegant design.\nHer caramel-colored eyes stared at the pink gold glitter upon the bracelet in the box.\n“Erm, is it not to your liking?”\n“No, it is cute.”\n“That’s good. I think it’ll suit you, Mahiru. That’s why I bought it.”\n“…Thank you very much.”\nIt’ll suit you,\nonce she heard those words, she lowered her eyes bashfully.\nSuch a sight was really doable, and he was left breathless.\n“…And, what is this?”\nAmane wanted to look aside, but he found his eyes staring at Mahiru. It seemed she noticed the extra gift inside, and he scratched his cheek.\n“Ahh, that? No, erm, I thought it wouldn’t be enough, so. I’ve been in your care all this while, so I thought I should grant your wish or something.”\nPlaced inside was a handmade coupon with the words ‘I’ll do anything you say coupon’, as though he was fooling a child. The coupon could only be used thrice and contained an illustration of a bear Amane drew. He felt he did well with the illustration, at least.\nHe was usually in her care, so he hoped to grant her little wishes within his capabilities, and gave this coupon as a bonus. He never expected her to focus on the bear he drew, and his shoulders were shaking.\n“Fu-fufu, did you draw this, Amane-kun?”\n“Shut up, I’m bad at this, okay?”\n“No, it is typical of you.”\nHe frowned as he sensed that she was hinting how bad his drawing was, but once he saw Mahiru’s innocent smile, he had nothing to grumble about.\n“…May I use it now?”\n“What?”\nHe never expected her to use it out of a sudden, but if there was a wish, he hoped to help her fulfill it as long as it was within his capabilities.\nSo Amane thought as he looked on, and Mahiru looked back at him, holding the bracelet box.\n“…Amane-kun, please put this on.”\n“You don’t need to use the coupon for this…leave it to me.”\nThe wish she spoke of was really minor, and Amane gave a wry smile, noting that he would have done so without the coupon.\nYou could have used it on something more important,\nMahiru stated her cute wish so earnestly and adorably, and his face naturally relaxed too.\nShe reached her hand out, and Amane took the box, put it on his knees, and removed the bracelet.\nHe heard the soft rubbing of the fine bracelet as he cautiously unlocked it, making sure not to break it, and wrapped it around her wrist.\nHe carefully locked the jewelry, and the mild colored bracelet glowed slight, seemingly adding colors to Mahiru’s fine wrist.\nAs expected, this was more appropriate for Mahiru’s white skin.\nHe felt a reticent, classy item would suit Mahiru’s innocent beauty more than the fancy ornaments, and could proudly say that he chose the right item.\n“Yep, it suits you.”\n“…Thank you very much”\nThinking that it was not good to keep touching it, Amane let go. Mahiru then brought the bracelet on her wrist to her chest, as though embracing it, showing a gentle smile on her face.\nHer face was showing a faint red, her lips curled into a smile. Amane wanted to look away, but was charmed by her and unable to look away.\nThe sweet innocent smile, different from a full smile, was etched in his mind.\nIt was a little different from the stunned smile she usually showed, or the pure delight. The beautiful smile was a little tender, but feminine, pretty, and alluring; Amane’s eyes could look nowhere else.\n…This is unbearable.\nShe showed such a smile, this smile alone for him, and he felt unbearable about this fact.\nHe tried averting his eyes to control his pounding heart, but was unable to do so. Finally, he ended up staring at Mahiru until the latter noticed she was being stared at, and buried her face into the cushion out of embarrassment.",

      "content": "“So, how did White Day go?”\nThe next day, Itsuki asked Amane about the latter’s thoughts, who then frowned hard.\nItsuki was considerate enough not to ask Amane at school. They dropped by at a fast food restaurant after school, and Itsuki asked with a smile the moment they sat down.\nAmane only showed up because he wanted to eat something salty stuff like fries once in a while, but he thought he should not have come if he knew this question would be asked.\n“How, you ask…I just gave it to her, as normal.”\n“Was she happy?”\n“…Sorta.”\nWhether she was happy, the answer would be yes, she was.\nShe did not smile as innocently as a child, but her smile to Amane was apprehensive and sweet, unspeakably alluring. He felt she should be rather happy.\nHe felt restless just recalling that beautiful smile.\nHe tried to answer as calmly as possible while he suppressed the heat rising up from within to his cheeks. Ituski then folded his arms “Yep yep”, nodding away in understanding.\n“So, looking at you, it seems to have gone well. I guess you caught her fancy to see her adorable smile.”\n“Wha!?”\n“See, you two are on better terms now?”\nAmane bit his lips after hearing this voice that was more impressed than teasing.\nItsuki would never probe into anything Amane did not want others to know of, but as a close friend, he would accurately pinpoint what the latter was thinking, which made him difficult to deal with. Even if Amane wanted to retaliate, Itsuki was on such good terms with Chitose to begin with, so it was pointless.\nGrrr,\nAmane gritted speechlessly. Itsuki showed a calm smile, the ambiguous calm expression infuriating the former.\nLeft with no choice, he turned his face aside as he ate the fries, and Itsuki shot him a wry smile.\n“You look rather happy to me though? Seems like spring has come for you, Amane”\n“That’s not it.”\n“You don’t know what you feel about her?”\n“…Nope, that’s impossible.”\nIt was true that Amane personally knew how Mahiru really trusted him. In that case, he intended to be close enough such that he would be the most trustworthy to her. Amongst all she was acquainted with, Amane might be the one she could open up most to.\nHowever, it would be wrong to say it was love.\nSometimes, he would be embarrassed as he treated her as a girl, but that was common between those of different genders. He had received her goodwill, but he did not think that involved any love.\nRecently, he had started to tidy his appearance a little bit, but the fact remained that he was a lowlife, and he did not she would like someone like him.\n“Seriously, you’re having low self-esteem here. You’re always thinking that you’re not the type to be liked.”\n“It’s like she’s been given everything from the heavens…ah no, she did work hard for them at least. She’s hardworking, cute, an amazing kid, and I got nothing. You think she’ll like me?”\n“If all the pretty girls are to fall for all the capable handsome guys, those unpopular guys will launch terrorist attacks, you know.”\nHe felt that the handsome lad Itsuki should not be saying such things.\n“Well, if you want to take it as that, so be it…but as a friend, I’ll give a prediction.”\n“What?”\n“You’ll change someday. Actually, you’re showing signs of change now; all that’s left is for you to take the next step.”\n“…You’re saying like you know me.”\n“Ha ha ha, how many years have I been your friend?”\n“Not even a year.”\nAmane coldly retorted “Seems that way” and Itsuki burst out laughing.\nWhile the conversation seemed foolish and unhelpful, but Itsuki, who was his friend in high school, seemed to be more understanding and helpful to Amane, compared to the other male friends back at Amane’s hometown during elementary and middle schools.\n“Speaking of which.”\n“Hm?”\n“You say you’re not a match for her, but what you say, that attitude of yours, basically admits that you have some feelings for her.”\n“I’ll stab some fries into your nose.”\n“Sorry.”\nHe was a little moved, only to have some unnecessary words directed at him, and took some fries in response. Itsuki immediately apologized, but that was just like him.\n“You are rather late.”\nHe returned home an hour later than usual, and welcoming him was Mahiru wearing the apron.\nAre you some newlywed wife?\nSo he wondered, but it might be because of the conversation with Itsuki. She did not have such feelings, but he started deluding himself. He felt sorry to her because of this, and hastily rid himself of such notions.\n“Nn, went to eat fries with Itsuki.”\n“…Right before dinner though.”\n“Don’t worry, I’ll finish everything.”\nHe was capable of downing Mahiru’s cooking, and he did order small sized fries just now, so he not particularly bloated.\nHe was confident about finishing the usual amount of food Mahiru would serve.\n“I wonder…if you will grow fat, but it might be better for you to gain flesh, since you are so skinny, Amane-kun.”\n“You should be the one gaining some flesh. You’re so terrifyingly thin, it feels like you’ll snap.”\n“I am not that skinny to the point of breaking.”\n“Really? See, that’s how thin you are.”\nMahiru’s delicate body was befitting a girl. She was adept at sports, and thin might not be the only term to describe her; one could call her tender too.\nShe might appear fragile on first glance. He grabbed her fine wrist, and found his fingers easily wrapping around hers, so much so that he could have snapped her wrist if he exerted strength. “Do treat girls kindly and carefully” his father once taught him that.\nWhen he held her hand, Amane worried that Mahiru was way too thin, that she might get injured if he was not around.\nSame for the fine fingers, they might snap if he got careless. He wondered if it was fine for her to be so thin.\nHe seemed to be tracing his finger on her as he checked, and found her fidgeting.\nShe looked down, but towards Amame’s hand that was holding hers.\nHe noticed her faint colored cheeks, and realized he did something without her permission, hastily removing his hand.\n“…Erm, sorry. I think you don’t like others touching you, right?”\n“N-no…I do not dislike it if it is you, Amane-kun.”\nThese words had him doubting his ears momentarily as he stared at Mahiru, and she might have realized what she was saying as she suddenly lifted her face.\nShe was blushing more than before, her eyes moist due to shame as she looked at Amane, who himself was becoming restless.\n“No-not that I want you to touch me. I just do not want other boys to touch me.”\n“O-oh.”\nEven though she said so, he could not stop his heart from shrieking.\nMahiru viewed Amane as someone close to him, and treated him specially, which he understood. Nevertheless, this would still cause his mind to wander. He hoped she would not explain it in this manner again.\n“…Y-yeah. You aren’t wearing that thing yesterday. Ah no, I’m not demanding that you do.”\nHe asked, trying to cover up his pounding heart; Mahiru looked towards her write, and gently stroked the part Amane just touched.\n“…It is a hindrance to wear it while doing housework, and will spoil easily…I wish to treasure it, and will wear it only on rest days.”\n“…I see.”\nOnce she mentioned such an adorable reason, he nearly tumbled over in shock.\nNo boy would remain still when faced with such a cute declaration.\nShe treasured his gift, and intended to wear it well. Once he knew it, Amane felt various emotions rising up his chest, and he felt a fluffy pain within.\nDoo, doo,\nhe sensed his heart pounding wildly, his mind in a daze. He took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself down.\n“…If you like it, I’m glad.”\n“I really do, and I will really treasure it. Kuma-san, the key case, the bracelet.”\nBut I have been using the hand cream lots,\nshe showed a little bashful smile. Amane had enough, and as he had not removed his shoes as he stood, he hastily removed them, and went to the corridor.\n“…I’ll get changed.”\n“Y-yes. Be seeing you, Amane-kun.”\nIt was his own house, but he felt as though he was being sent off by a new wife, and his heart palpitated. He hurried into his own room, and crouched down.",

      "content": "It is unexpectedly pointless,\nAmane stifled a yawn as he saw the principal standing on the podium afar, giving his speech with a grim look.\nIt was the closing ceremony, but Amane had no special feelings about this day. At this point, he was listening to the principal’s speech, and truth be told, he was so bored, he wanted to sleep.\nThe surrounding students seemed to have felt the same, and only a few students were actually listening attentive. Most were just ignoring it, or staring at the podium sleepily.\nHowever, he could not look completely bored, so he maintained a serious look on his face. He really hoped for it to end quickly though, and the speech just went fell on deaf ears to him.\nHe might be a little moved if this was his graduation ceremony, but he could not muster the emotions given that it was just the closing ceremony.\nIt was bad to say so bluntly, but he felt it was pointless. He acted like a model student as he waited for the boring time to pass.\n“…Ahh my shoulders hurt.”\n“The principal spoke too long.”\nSuch was the chatter once the closing ceremony ended.\nHowever, there was some life back in their voices, probably because they just needed to wait for their homeroom periods to end, and they would have approximately two weeks of free time.\nFrom his seat, Amane saw his classmates show smiles as they were finally going to be released from their boring lessons, and he sighed.\nHis spring break would start the next day, so how would be spend it?\nHe had met his parents once, and he felt he did not need to go back, considering the transport costs. However, he really had nothing to do. Even if he took the time to study for his second year, he had lots of time left.\nHe did not look for a temporary part-time job, since there were insufficient days for him to do so. Itsuki and Chitose were the only friends he could hang out with.\n“Say say, Amane-kun.”\nSpeak of the devil, Itsuki spoke behind him.\nHe turned back to find a hearty smile…but the smile was so suspicious to Amane, he had a bad feeling about it. Whenever Itsuki showed such a smile, he would ask Amane to do something, or involve the latter in something calamitous.\n“What?”\n“You free starting tomorrow?”\n“Sorta, I guess.”\n“Yep yep, just as I thought. That’s good that’s good.”\n“…What?”\nWith a beaming smile, Itsuki patted the bag hanging beneath, to the side of his seat.\nHe probably brought back lots of stuff from the locker and beneath his table, yet the bag was completely packed. He had no need to attend lessons, and logically, he had nothing else to bring back, some pencil case, files, wallets, and nothing much else. It was unnatural to have his bag this packed.\n“…Those are?”\n“Clothes.”\n“Why bring them?”\n“Let me stay over~”\nHe seemed to have said it with a heart shape at the end, basically begging demurely. Obviously, Amane ended up frowning at that.\n“Say, you know what ho-ren-so means?”\n“I know I know, it means visit, overnight, make noise, right?”\n“That’s just causing trouble for the neighbors, you idiot bastard. You want to cause noise for them?”\n“Just joking. Though really I want to stay over.”\nUsually, Itsuki would inform Amane of anything he would do beforehand.\nThus, it appeared he encountered a situation that required him to hole out outside, but Amane could not figure out what it was.\n“I had an argument against my dad this morning.”\nHe easily admitted to the situation, as though that would answer Amane’s doubt.\n“…About Chitose?”\n“Nn. Once my dad gets mad, he’s not going to listen for days. I can’t just stay at Chitose’s place. Even though her parents are willing to take me in, well,”\n“And it’s fine staying at my place?”\n“Feels like you’ll take me in.”\nPerhaps his thought process was, since he had stayed over a few times even when Amane’s house was so messy, it should be fine.\nAmane himself was not unwilling to take Itsuki in.\nHowever, the problem was whether Mahiru, who would be making dinner, would dislike this.\nIf Mahiru was to go into Angel mode at her usual respite, it might be too overbearing for her.\nAfter all, she only showed her true personality to Amane, and would keep it hidden from Itsuki.\nAnother problem was that recently, Mahiru had been acting strangely adorable recently, sometimes bashful, and he had to wonder if she was being aware of him as someone of the other gender. Amane was fearful that if Itsuki saw this, the latter would have some baseless misunderstanding again.\n“…I’ll call her in a bit.”\nHe had to ask Mahiru for her opinion, so he sent her a message. She would send a shopping list before she returned home, so she would see this message.\nAmane messaged in a fluid manner, and Itsuki looked a little dumbfounded as he sighed.\n“What, are you living together now?”\n“Do you want me to make you sleep on the floor without heating and futon?”\n“Should I thank you for your kind grace in taking me in, or bemoan that you’re so ruthless to let me freeze to death?”\n“I want to bemoan that delusion of yours.”\nWhat’s this guy saying now?\nHe shot Itsuki such a look, and the latter shrugged.\nFeeling that he should be the one shrugging instead, he did not want Mahiru to be troubled just because of some strange misunderstanding.\nItsuki himself was one to read the mood, and probably would not tease Mahiru, but he sensed that the latter would tease him when she was not around, and that depressed him.\nHe sighed at Itsuki’s grin. At this moment, it seemed Mahiru was using her smartphone as she replied,\nI shall cook as normal if\nyou buy three people’s worth of food\n“.\n“She said okay.”\n“Great, I get to eat her cooking.”\n“That isn’t your aim, right?”\n“Just a little one. I want to taste that cooking you keep praising, Amane.”\n“…Don’t cause her trouble.”\n“I’ll cause you trouble, but not her.”\n“And don’t cause me trouble.”\nAmane rewarded the leering Itsuki with a flicker on his forehead, “Oww!!” The latter yelled as he grinned away, and Amane let out a pretentious, deep sigh.",

      "content": "“So, how long are you going to stay over?”\nAfter school, they went shopping, and returned home. They relaxed a little, and Amane looked towards Itsuki who was treating the place like his own house.\nItsuki hardly came by recently as Mahiru had been around. He however had been here a few times, and seemed so familiar with the place.\nItsuki sat cross legged as he drank the coffee, and looked rather decent because of his good looks. He seemed to be thinking of something, for his eyes wandering around.\n“Nn, first off, I want to stay for 3 days. That’s troublesome, don’t you say.”\n“Your dad isn’t a bad guy or something, just inflexible in accepting other people’s opinions.”\n“You can just say outright that he’s a stubborn, bullish shitty dad who’s born in the wrong era here.”\n“Hey you.”\n“How can I allow my parent to tell off my partner to be?”\nI’ll leave the house when I grow older anyway,\nItsuki once spat, but he really did not dislike his father.\nHis father was a man of reason, and once pleased, he would treat others earnestly. The father was acting like this because Chitose displeased him, but he seemed a decent man to Amane.\nHe did not approve of Itsuki’s relationship with Chitose because they were of a somewhat prestigious family, and he hoped his son would choose a female of appropriate standing.\nAlso, another reason was that the father was bad at dealing with Chitose.\nHowever, Itsuki was flatly denied by his father, and because of this, it seemed he chose to run away from home.\n“You have it good here, Amane. You can do whatever you want.”\n“My parents love each other too much, and they want me to choose someone I like.”\n“I’m jealous of you.”\nItsuki at this point was a result of his strict upbringing, and Amane could not overly deny that.\nAccording to him, dyeing his hair bright and dressing frivolously was him acting in protest.\n“You say that, you really respect your dad, right?”\n“I respect him as a person, but he’s hopeless as a parent, right? Oppressing me isn’t going to solve everything…he could have given me a little leeway, but he’s just giving me the whip all the time, of course I’ll bite back.”\n“Is it good for the one given leeway to understand this?”\n“I can take it if he just let me free, but he caged me and put a collar over me. That’s why I’m protesting, that’s all.”\nHe doesn’t even understand this even after these decades,\nItsuki shrugged, and finished the rest of the coffee.\n“Well, you can relax a few days. Luckily we got a few days of break.”\n“How nice to have a friend …!”\n“Stay away, you disgust me.”\n“I’m hurt!I want Shiina-san’s cooking as compensation!”\n“You’re going to eat it even if you’re hurt, right?”\n“Tehee.”\n“Stop acting cute. It’s disgusting.”\n“This scolding is so cruel…oyoyo.”\nHe pretended to cry, but Itsuki was still smiling, and Amane was stunned yet a little relieved.\nItsuki often had disputes against his father, but it seemed it was a little worse than usual this morning. Amane might be imagining things, but he sensed Itsuki was mentally down. It seemed he had recovered somewhat.\nWell, he could not say this to Itsuki, so he pretended to look aloof as he exhaled slightly.\nThe sun set, and Mahiru arrived at Amane’s house.\nHer hands were empty, for Amane had already prepared her ingredients.\nHe told Mahiru that Itsuki would be staying over, and she did not falter even though Itsuki was spreading himself wide. Instead, it was Itsuki who was a little frantic.\n“It has been a while, Akazawa-san.”\n“Yep, same to you. Sorry for dropping by at your love nest…owowowow, I know, I’m just joking. Sorry for disturbing you. It’s bothersome having someone you’re unfamiliar with here, right?”\nAmane silently stomped on Itsuki’s foot, and the latter cried out, grinning away and making a popular looking smile.\n“No, that is not the case. It is better to be livelier.”\n“It’ll just be noisy with him around.”\n“You should not be saying that.”\nReproached into silence, Amane saw Itsuki leering away, so he pinched the latter in the flank, at a position Mahiru could not see.\nHowever, Itsuki had the ideal male body type, and there was nowhere to pinch in particular.\n“I shall prepare dinner now then. Please continue.”\nWhile the duo continued their little skirmish, Mahiru showed an angelic smile, put on the apron, and went to the kitchen.\nIt seemed she probably did not know what to say, so she decided to leave Itsuki to Amane.\nAfter staring at Mahiru’s back, Itsuki sheathed the leer on his face.\n“…You’re on such good terms, you gave her your key?”\n“Shut up.”\nShe would enter using the key given to her, because they were already used to it. She entered without pressing the doorbell, and Itsuki noticed this.\n“Please continue, so Shiina-san says because she thinks this is a safe space for her? She’s already acting like your wife here.”\n“Want me to chase you out?”\n“I want to say…that I’m joking here, but this is an objective view of the situation, you know?”\nAmane wanted to grab Itsuki on the neck, only for the latter to escape as he was on the carpet, starting the game. Amane got off the sofa, bumping him lightly with the kneecap, and sat next to him to play games and kill time.\nAfter a while, he heard the plates being removed. He wondered if he should let Mahiru handle everything, so he stood up and went to the kitchen.\n“I’ll help you out. Do I bring the plates with the food on?”\n“Thank you very much.”\nHe served the dishes on the table as usual, and saw Itsuki looking dumbfounded.\n“…You know…”\n“What?”\n“No, I’m not saying it.”\nItsuki did not finish his words as he went off to keep the game console. “What in the world?” Amane asked, sounding a little confused.",

      "content": "It was dinner time, and the trio gathered around Mahiru’s homemade dishes. Itsuki was looking really delighted.\n“It’s delicious…”\n“Thank you very much.”\nMahiru was seated upright as she enjoyed her food, showing a genial face. While she still had the angelic smile on, Itsuki knew of the secret, so her smile was a little more of her usual self.\nItsuki devoured the food in a trance.\nMahiru was told that Itsuki ate more than Amane, so Itsuki’s plate contained more food, but it seemed he was capable of finishing it all.\n“Yaa, you’re really a lucky one, Amane, getting to eat such cooking every day…”\n“I know that. Today’s food is delicious too.”\n“……Thank you very much.”\nAmane stated his thoughts as he drank the miso soup.\nThe dashi and miso soup really whetted one’s appetite, and would naturally relax the cheeks. It was really impressive that they could drink every day without getting sick of it, but the cook herself did not seem to realize this, so it was a daily duty to praise her.\nThe tender taste of the cooking seemed to showcase her personality, and soothed both the tongue and the heart. It was understandable why Itsuki was so entranced.\n“Haa, it’s delicious.”\nOn this day, she cooked the dashimaki omelette Amane liked, the latter’s appetite increased by 20%. Of course, the usual cooking was delicious enough for him to ask for an additional portion, but that would increase further with an egg dish.\nSo delicious,\nAmane licked his lips as he ate the tasty food, only to find Itsuki staring at him and Mahiru.\n“…Lovebirds.”\n“What did you say?”\n“No~thing.”\nItsuki shook his head and pretentiously gouged through the food, so Amane did not press on, instead shrugging towards Mahiru who was watching calmly.\nAfter dinner, Mahiru hurried home.\nNormally, she would be at Amane’s place before the latter would go to bathe, before 10pm, but she returned earlier because Itsuki was around. Mahiru appeared to be talking to Itsuki while Amane washed the dishes, and looked a little awkward. That might be the reason why she returned home earlier.\nHe asked Itsuki what they talked about, “Just some questions about Chii” the latter answered, and Amane did not ask further, despite sensing that they talked about other things.\n“Say Amane.”\nBefore they slept, Itsuki laid out the futon on the floor of Amane’s floor, looking up at Amane on the bed.\n“What?”\n“Seriously, you’re showing Shiina-san such a gentle look, and you say you don’t like her?”\n“Shut up.”\n“To a bystander, you’re completely head over heels for her.”\n“Want me to chase you out?”\n“Nada~”\nYou’re still saying that,\nsuch was the look Amane shot back, but Itsuki showed no signs of repentance.\nItsuki was not leering away like before. He was looking delighted, approving even.\n“Well, it’s expected of you to not be honest with yourself, but I’m glad. Someone knows about your good points, Amane.”\n“Huh?”\n“Why do you sound so impulsive….most of the guys in class think of you as a gloomy, brash mouth plain boy with not much presence.”\n“I know that.”\nAmane’s position is class might be a boring, aloof, unimpressive boy with no defining traits. If others saw the exam rankings pasted on, they might add that he was relatively smart.\nHis class had the pretty and carefree boy Itsuki and the refreshing looking prince charming Yuuta, Amane might be considered devoid of personality if he was compared to these outstanding people.\nOne reason was that Amane deliberately intended not to stand out, but opinions of him were definitely not high.\n“But that’s just what people see of you, not what they see inside you. I want others to see what’s inside you, but it’s hard to pinpoint that without understanding you to some extent.”\nJiii,\nItsuki stared at Amane.\nThe latter felt uncomfortable, for Itsuki’s eyes were serious. The eyes showed no tinge of any attempt joke, or to tease.\n“It’s too bad nobody knows that you’re really a great guy. I’m happy that Shiina-san can see what’s inside you and get along well with you.”\n“Itsuki…”\n“So hurry up, woo her, and we can go for a double date.”\n“That’s all you want to say?”\nHe felt the exhilaration was wasted, but this might not be a bad thing.\nBut Itsuki might find it unbearable not to joke, for he averted his eyes, and Amane guessed the words before were to hide Itsuki’s own embarrassment.\n“Chii will be happy too.”\n“You can go alone…no wait, you two can go yourselves. Don’t involve me. Anyway, even if we do get into that sort of relationship, how about I going to go out with this face of mine?”\n“Can’t you just use that style of yours? By the way, I want to look.”\n“Don’t wanna.”\n“Soooo, is it your guy heart that wants to show that to Shiina-san only?”\n“Itsuki, choose, sleep forever under the cold skies, or shut up and enjoy the warmth.”\n“I’m sorry.”\nItsuki sat on the futon in a seiza,\nGoodness.\nAmane muttered dumbfoundedly.\nItsuki probably thought that if Amane had a girlfriend, he would have a happier life.\n…I guess it’s impossible, for me to be in a relationship with Mahiru.\nHe was always in her care, and caused her much trouble. If they were to date, he felt he would be relying on her all the time, so he was scared. He was already a lowlife, and if they dated, he would fall vertically into degeneracy.\nFurthermore, it seemed Mahiru was intending to avoid contact with the opposite gender.\nShe did not seem repulsed by Amane, Shuuto, and Itsuki whom Amane trusted. Based on the occasional sight of her at school however, it seemed Mahiru was much more guarded against the other gender compared to girls. She maintained the Angelic facade at school while keeping her distance naturally.\nEven after being confessed to for so long, she had no dating experience, so it seemed she was avoiding all the boys.\nAmane himself could only see himself being rejected.\nUltimately, he felt that confessing to her half-heartedly would be really rude to her, so he felt he should just keep the status quo with Mahiru.\nHe felt Mahiru too had no such thoughts, and it would be foolish, delusional, to go dating.\n“…But well, Shiina-san trusts you that much. Before you deny it all, have a good look.”\nItsuki seemed to have read Amane’s heart thoroughly as he noted this. “…Is that so?” Amane muttered as he snuggled into the futon.",

      "content": "“You’re despicable for only inviting Ikkun! I want to eat Mahirun’s cooking too~!”\nAmane received such a phone call from Chitose early in the next morning.\nIt seemed Itsuki contacted Chitose the previous day. He was taking photos when they were eating, acting like a girl, so it seemed he was sending them to Chitose.\n“Don’t ask me. Ask Shiina.”\n“Then if Mahirun agrees, can I go play at your place too?”\n“Well, whatever.”\n“Got it! I’ll ask Mahirun then!”\nAnd after saying that vigorously, she hung up.\nAmane had moved the phone a little away from his ear as he found her too noisy. He did not know what face to make in regards to the dynamic Chitose, impressed, or dumbfounded.\nAnd Itsuki watched him with a smile on the face.\n“Chii’s really lively.”\n“Can’t you do something about your girlfriend’s tendency to go bonkers?”\n“That’s impossible. Chii’s the type to show what she likes through her body. That love runs deep, huh?”\nYep yep\n, Itsuki nodded away, and while Amane felt he was head over heels for Chitose, he kept his thoughts to himself.\nThe good points about Chitose were the abundance of her vitality and the ability to get along well with anyone, and Amane was a little envious of that because he did not have such natures. At the same time, he felt Mahiru had it tough to receive such a love call.\nHe quietly prayed for Mahiru, while deciding to heat yesterday’s leftovers as their breakfast.\n“So I dropped by~!”\nChitose dropped by quickly, right before noon. She appeared to be carrying a haversack, and shopping bag full of goodies; next to her, Mahiru was smiling wryly as she too held bags.\nIt seemed they met outdoors. Chitose probably was asked to accompany Mahiru for shopping, and arrived here together. Otherwise, both of them would not be holding bags, and Chitose would be stuck at the entrance.\n“That was fast…”\n“I’m staying overnight at Mahirun’s place. I’m looking forward to it!”\n“…Overnight?”\n“We get a rare spring break after all. And Mahirun agreed to it!”\nRight?\nChitose looked towards Mahiru with a beaming face, the latter merely nodding with a wry smile.\nShe was forced to agree, huh?\nIt appeared Mahiru lost to Chitose’s vigor.\nHowever, it seemed Mahiru did not really dislike it, just a little perturbed by this sudden development of events.\n“Do not worry. I did agree to it.”\nMahiru walked towards the fridge with ingredients in hand, and whispered with a voice for Amane to hear as she passed him.\nIt seemed she saw the little uneasiness Amane had. The latter showed a wry smile as he watched her back while she stuffed the dinner ingredients into the fridge.\n“I’m looking forward to Mahirun’s cooking~” Chitose grinned away as she sat next to Itsuki, clinging onto him. Having lost a place to sit, Amane went to the kitchen.\n“Need me to help with anything?”\n“…Amane-kun, you cannot cook, no?”\nShe called his name with a soft voice that could not be heard from the living room, and he showed a wry smile.\n“I can at least chop some vegetables, you know? Actually, I can do some simple things if I have the instructions. I did do it before you once.”\n“…Please assist me then. You will feel unbearable being over there, no?”\n“You really understand me. Those two are too lovey-dovey.”\nHe shrugged, and washed his hands at the basin.\nHe could not provide Mahiru with much assistance, but it did not mean he knew nothing about cooking. At the very least, he could help her weigh, or prepare other things, and for the time being , there was a lover forcefield behind him, so he might as well assist Mahiru.\n“Anyway, what’s for lunch?”\n“Omelette rice, green potage, and some salad. Chitose-san says she wants the omelette half cooked, so that she can cut it with a knife and let it flow out.”\n“Great.”\n“You really like egg dishes.”\n“Eggs are great. The egg dishes you make are the best, I’m looking forward to it.”\nNone of Mahiru’s cooking were bad in any way, no exceptions, and Amane especially enjoyed her egg dishes, which he really loved. The beef stew omelette rice he had the large time was a masterpiece, and he believed that he would not get sick of it even if he ate it every day.\nNice request Chitose,\nhe thought as he quietly motioned a thumbs up in his heart, happily weighedfour persons’ worth of rice, only to see Mahiru rooted before the freezer.\n“What now?”\n“…I am glad to hear you say that, but do not attack so suddenly.”\n“What’s going on?”\n“You do not need to know.”\nHmph,\nshe suddenly turned her head aside, and began chopping the ingredients for the soup. Amane tilted his head in confusion.\n“They aren’t dating when they’re already like that? I don’t get them.”\n“Seriously~”",

      "content": "“The~rice’s~delicious~!”\nChitose finished her lunch, and heartily rubbed her belly.\nShe looked really overjoyed, given her expression, and Mahiru too smiled happily. The latter loved to serve others, so the sudden attack on this day might not be a bad thing to her.\n“Well~ Shiina-san, you can really cook anything. I never thought you could make a half cooked omelette with the inside runny and the outside like an omelette.”\n“It is thanks to the teacher who taught me how to cook.”\n“You learned how to cook?”\n“Well, I guess. She said that if I can cook for myself without trouble, I can proudly cook for anyone without shame.”\n“Heh~! If you’re so good at cooking, I think your teacher’s really amazing!”\nMahiru was probably referring to the caretaker she was mentioned about.\nSurely that caretaker was the only one at Mahiru’s old home who actually treated her well.\n“I wonder if I can have such skills if that person teaches me.”\n“Just control your curiosity and you should be able to cook something decent if you don’t be too adventurous.”\n“Eh, but I can’t start if I’m not being adventurous?”\n“If you don’t do that, you should be able to do anything… your curiosity and mischief ruins everything…you just needed to follow the recipe…”\nChitose should be able to do better than average as long as she played it safe. Given her lively personality and bad habits, the actual result would drop by a rank.\nShe was free and lax like a cat, but not as obedient as one, and such was her problem. She could be obedient if she wanted to, but it seemed to be tiring to her.\nShe could be a wise woman if she instinctively knew when to calm down, but her personality just would not allow her to do so.\n“Even including cooking, you should watch how you talk at least. There’s a perfect example before you, see?”\n“Ehhhn, but I can’t become like Mahirun here. It’s too restraining.”\n“Aren’t you being rude to Shiina?”\n“Nn, but Mahirun seems very restrained too, or a little suffocated.”\nFrom time to time, Chitose would read a person’s true personality to a shocking precise level.\n“Mahirun at school just feel lifeless.”\n“…You think so?”\n“Nn, we’re in different classes, so I can’t say, but it feels like instead of you acting boring, it feels like you are taking a few steps back and looking at everyone from far away. It’s like you’re kind to anyone, Mahirun, but you never open your heart to anyone else.”\nIt was likely, no, Chitose was definitely correct.\nMahiru appeared a good child who was kind to everyone, but in fact, only a rare few could see beyond her façade.\nMahiru wanted to be a good child, and did her best to avoid showing her true personality.\nShe herself knew this best, and looked a little gloomy. However, Chitose grinned away as she reached towards Mahiru, seated next to her.\n“You’re being super duper cute at such a private setting here, Mahirun. That’s why I know this is your real self,. I prefer this side of Mahirun~”\nEhehe~\nshe giggled as she latched firmly onto Mahiru. The latter looked aside for a moment, seemingly a little perturbed, but she did not seem to refuse as she made some limited contact with Chitose.\n“Say Mahirun, I think you can act a little more honest~ see, Amane’s been pampering you, you know? He’s always pampering those he’s familiar with; you can seal the deal immediately if you ask to be spoiled by him, Mahirun?”\n“I will not!”\n“Eh~?”\n“…It is not what you are expecting, Chitose-san.”\nMahiru turned her head abruptly, “Real~ly?” and Chitose smiled, looking towards Amane for some reason.\nAmane probably could not do anything even though she was looking at him. If Mahiru did not ask, there was nothing for him to think about, and he could not pamper her. Mahiru hoped to be independent, and it was best to respect her wishes.\nBut, just if…if she said she wanted to be pampered…he could not say he would be unwilling.\nHe did not have any reason to hesitate. If Mahiru was willing to express all her troubles in her heart to him, and ask him to help her, he had confidence that he could hold up her little back, as though everything was to be expected.\nOnce again, he realized how close their relationship had become, and felt awkward about it, but he did not express it as he looked towards Chitose and Mahiru making contact with each other.\n“Well, pretty girls on such good terms are really good for the eyes.”\n“What are you saying?”\nHe ignored Itsuki’s perverted words as he saw the two of them getting along well. Mahiru finally had a friend of the same gender she could show her true personality to, and he was a little relieved.\nNaturally, Chitose’s stayover place was at Mahiru’s house.\nAmane thought she would prefer to be with Itsuki, “But I’ve been living with Ikkun often, so I want to be with Mahirun this time”, so after dinner, she went to Mahiru’s place happily.\nHe knew they were close to each other, and that Itsuki often stayed over at Chitose’s place, so there was nothing strange about those words…but for some reason, he felt a little awkward knowing the fact that they had been staying over often.\nWhat are you imagining, you silent pervert?\nItsuki shot Amane such a look, and the latter stomped on the foot again, being merciful enough not to stomp on the pinky.\n“Say, you don’t have to hide your embarrassment by stomping on others, right?”\n“Your fault for guessing randomly.”\nAmane was grumbled at right when they were about to sleep, and turned his head aside.\nHe did not stomp for real, and the pain would soon subside, so Itsuki did not appear to be blaming him. One might say it was a minor scuffle between boys, and neither would actually bicker over this. Amane too was often slapped by Itsuki; it was common.\n“At this age, it’s common to be staying at another place. It’s normal, normal.”\n“Who knows? Can we stop with this topic now?”\n“Logically, guys should be talking about this, right?”\n“There’s no such logic, so stop it.”\nHe did not want to hear his friend yap about stories between couples, and glared to end this topic, only for Itsuki to show him a delighted smile.\n“Seriously, you’re either a herbivore, or too innocent.”\n“You want me to beat you up?”\n“Well, that’s why Shiina-san opened her heart to you. If you’re greedy, she’s not going to approach you.”\nGood job!\nItsuki grinned as he gave a thumbs up, and Amane showed a bitter look he would never ever show to Mahiru.\nBut that face was completely ineffectual against Itsuki.\nHe clicked his tongue, and glared at Itsuki. There was a light sounding electronic sound from the smartphone.\nIt appeared to be a message received, and Amane stopped glaring at Itsuki as he looked at the smartphone screen. It appeared to be a message from Chitose.\nHe opened the app, thinking it was about their next day plans. What he saw was a message sent along with a photo.\n“Looky look Mahirun’s so cute! ※I took it with her permission.”\nThere was a photo attached with that one line.\nThe photo showed Mahiru just sitting on the bed. Behind her appeared to be the bedroom.\nHe would not have any thoughts if that was it, but the problem was her attire and her expression.\nShe was wearing her night gown.\nThat alone would be normal, but she was wearing a loose one piece night gown with long sleeves, or in other words, a negligee. The faint pink color further showcased her femininity, making her really adorable.\nShe might have just taken a bath, for her sleeves and collar were showing skin, a little tinge of fiery red showing from the inside, as though her entire body was on fire.\nThanks to that, while she was not exposed in any way, she looked strangely alluring, and yet at the same time, looked innocent, a stark contrast.\nAnd what caught his attention more than anything else—was Mahiru’s expression.\nShe had Amane’s teddy bear on her knees, looking down a little, not at the camera.\nBut she was not looking down much, her face was not completely concealed, and even on the photo, she looked embarrassed.\nA rose color appeared on her cheeks, and it probably was not due to the bath from before.\nShe looked embarrassed and troubled, much more alluring than usual.\nAt the same time, there was an added adorable to her as she placed her hands on the teddy bear upon her knees. Even though it was a photo, Amane felt his cheeks starting to heat up from inside.\n…That, idiot.\nWhat was Chitose planning, sending such a photo?\nWhy show it to Amane before he slept? How could he sleep as though nothing had happened?\n“Why are you blushing looking at your phone? Some ero pic?”\n“Like hell it is!”\n“Then what are you looking?”\nItsuki dropped by to have a look, and before Amane could hide it, the message on the screen entered Itsuki’s eyes, and the latter showed a proud smile.\n“I see I see, you’re really innocent, Amane-kun.”\n“Do you want to sleep forever?”\n“Are you hinting that I should die?”\n“Do you want me to make it direct?”\n“Don’t be so heartless. No no, but any boy would be amazed seeing that Angel like this. Ahh, no, Chii’s the best.”\n“Slow down, you bastard.”\nGoodness,\nhe combed his hair with his palm as he sighed, only to hear a shutter noise.\n“…Itsuki.”\n“No well, Chii asked me to take a photo of you for commemorative purpose, Amane. It’s just a little phot. That’s not okay?”\n“Whatever, it’s just that, what’s the point of taking a photo of me…”\n“I’m not going to send it to anyone else, relax. There’s a purpose to that.”\nAmane did not know what purpose that was, and stared at Itsuki dumbfoundedly, but the latter merely smiled with satisfaction.\nWhat’s he going to do with that photo of me?\nHe sighed hard, and Itsuki muttered with a voice softer than Amane, “Why’s he so oblivious about himself?”",

      "content": "“…I’m tired…”\nItsuki and Chitose ended their stayover; Amane and Mahiru were seated on the sofa.\nIt was the third day, and the stayover at Amane’s place ended. It seemed Itsuki would be staying at Chitose’s place for another day or two. Chitose’s parents would welcome him for a few days (it seemed they wanted him to stay for longer, but he refused after all）.\nAfter eating Mahiru’s lunch, “sorry for intruding, hope you two get along well” he grinned before leaving. Amane felt Itsuki was having some baseless delusion again, but he ignored it, being too lazy to retort.\n“You’re not tired, Mahiru?”\n“…I am, it has been tough. But enjoyable.”\n“I see.”\nAt the very least, Amane knew that Mahiru had never invited her friends. He thought Chitose would be a nice start to get her to open up.\nIt seemed Chitose would go out to meet Chitose without Amane knowing. Surely it was a good thing for her to have a close friend.\n“…Well, erm, she started taking photos out of a sudden, and it shocked me a little…”\n“Ah, ahhh, that?”\nOnce he heard the term photo, he remembered the alluring sight from before, and his cheeks naturally turned red.\nNot much was exposed, but the negligee was still rather thin, and showed Mahiru’s soft curves, which agitated his eyes. One might say that the low exposure instead made her more alluring.\nDue to his male instincts, he accidentally saved the photo in the folder, and had a strong sense of guilt as a result.\n“Chitose-san went going 『So cute~!』and started taking lots of photos, but she never told me what she sent. What kind of photos did she send? I agreed at the end since she insisted, but I will feel awkward if it is too embarrassing…”\nIt seemed Chitose did not show Mahiru the photo she sent.\nShe probably chose the best shot of them all, and sent it over. Mahiru herself might not have noticed her own expression when the photos were taken.\nOf course, if Mahiru herself was to see that photo, one could easily imagine her reaction.\nShe was not in a shameful position, and her clothes were not ruffled, but for some reason, the image was really destructive.\n“E-erm, well, the photo of the bear on your knees.”\n“…Ku-Kuma-san…?”\n“It seems you really treasure it greatly.”\nAmane was not lying.\nBut due to the great guilt he had, he intended to bury the photo deep within his folder. He did not delete it, due to the strange tendencies of a male’s heart.\nBear\n, once Mahiru heard that, she smiled as though she remembered something.\n“…I said I will treasure it dearly. It is something important after all.”\nAs he saw her adorable, somewhat nostalgic, and gentle expression and smile, Amane gasped.\nUnlike her usual angelic smile, this faint smile was filled with innocence and affection, so delicate and beautiful, one would be unintentionally mesmerized.\nThat was beyond beauty. It contained an element of endearing, and anyone would unwittingly have the urge to embrace her.\n“…Ah, hmm, erm, looks like you like it.”\n“Of course, it is what you chose for me, Amane-kun.”\nAmane stumbled over his words, and Mahiru smiled as she gave such a comforting reply.\n“Do not worry, I shall treasure it dearly. I will pat it after washing it, and I will hug it to sleep…please ignore what I have just said.”\nWashing it, petting it, fine.\nBut what she said next, that adorable action, had him doubting his ears.\nShe hugged it to sleep.\nThat Mahiru hugged the teddy bear to sleep.\nHe did see Mahiru’s sleeping face, the angelic-looking sleeping face.\nAnd with that sleeping face, she hugged the teddy bear. A pretty girl, sleeping together with a teddy bear.\nHe imagined the sight, and an idol image immediately filled his mind, causing him to blush.\nMahiru too was blushing at what she said, looking teary as she latched onto his arms.\n“P-please forget about that.”\n“N-no, that’s impossible.”\n“I will be bothered.”\nIt seemed she was really embarrassed to let this fact be known to him, for her ears were completely red, her eyes teary as she looked up at Amane.\nThat expression was really destructive, but she probably would not know.\n“I-is it really that embarrassing? It’s not something to be worried about, right?”\n“Do-does it not make me look like a child? Hugging a teddy bear to sleep.”\n“N-no, I imagined it, and it seems cute. It’s absolutely fine.”\n“…Please do not imagine it.”\nThis time, it was Mahiru who was so embarrassed that she dared not to look at Amane directly, and leaned into her favorite cushion, remaining silent.\nHe found her to be really adorable in this state. It was bad to him in more ways than one, but he found himself wanting to dote on her.\nIt would be fine if he could reach his hand out and pat her head, but this might create an opposite reaction, and she would not allow it.\nHe suppressed the impulsive hand as he stared at Mahiru, the latter peeking from the cushion after a while.\nHer eyes were still teary from embarrassment, her face was red, but she seemed a little lively, giving him a somewhat vengeful look.\n“…Amane-kun, you are to share something embarrassing too. It is unfair for me to do so alone.”\n“Ehh…?”\nHe felt Mahiru basically self-destructed there, but Amane could not be absolved of blame.\nBut even if he wanted to expose something shameful about himself, he could not think of anything.\n“I shall message Akazawa-kun and ask.”\n“When did you get Itsuki’s contact…”\n“Actually, I heard from Chitose-san, so I chatted with him. Did he not send a pho…no, nothing…that is fine…”\nSaying that midway through, she buried her face into the cushion again.\nIt seemed Mahiru had just self-destructed once again, but Amane merely felt confused.",

      "content": "To those who had no particular interests, spring break was a rather boring period.\nAmane himself did not have many interests, just reading and strolling about; his classmates had given him wry smiles, wondering why he had such hobbies.\nHe would not take the initiative to do any outdoor activities as he had these hobbies, or attend any leisure facilities. If he was not invited out, he would go jogging, strolling, or buy ingredients and so on.\nA dumbfounded Itsuki once asked if it was fine for Amane to not enjoy his youth even though he was a high schooler. The latter felt that he did pay some attention to his health, and exercising, so he should be fine.\nMahiru too showed no signs of going anywhere.\nOf course, he would occasionally see her exercising, or shopping for necessities. However, she hardly went anywhere to play.\n“Is there anywhere you want to go to play?”\nHe himself had no right to criticize, but he wondered if it was fine for a high school girl in her prime to be like this…so after dinner, he asked Mahiru, and after some deliberation, she showed a wry smile.\n“Go to play…well, I have not thought of anything. I do prefer staying at home.”\n“Well I’m the same. Don’t feel like there’s anything much outdoors.”\n“…Like going back to Shihoko-san’s?”\n“We just met in New Year, so that’s fine. We’ll be going back during summer break. That means I won’t get to eat your cooking, Mahiru, and it’s boring.”\n“…I-Is that so?”\nHe was already used to Mahiru’s cooking, to the point where he would suffer if he did not get to eat it; the desire to eat her cooking intensified with every passing day. At the same time, he got used to her presence next to him, and her existence was to be expected, which was another reason why he did not want to return to his hometown.\nHe already realized she was cute and adorable, but her presence calmed him. It probably was because her demeanor meshed well with his personality.\n“Well, if I go back, they’ll drag me here and there, and that seems tiring.”\n“…Here and there?”\n“Like, tourist attractions, shopping, and so on. If I don’t make plans, they’ll drag me off to a certain place. I remembered going to a hot spring trip during my winter break in middle school.”\nShihoko liked staying at home, and also liked to go out. One would say she was such an energetic person, happy to do anything.\nShe really treasured family time. She would drag Amane anywhere as long as she did not have a prior appointment, or if Amane really hated it. She did have a shred of conscience to give Amane some semblance of choice, but once he answered, she would whisk him off.\nHe was fine with stuff like theme parks and shopping malls, but if they were to go do sawanobori or survival games, she would suggest that they should challenge everything, and he would be forced to participate, which was tough on him. He wondered how that delicate body contained so much energy.\nThanks to that, he learned lots of things, and his body was trained to some extent. He could not deny however that because of the downsides, his hobbies were more individualistic and mild.\n“…It sounds like you have fun.”\n“It’s tiring to do that over a few consecutive days. The enthusiasm leaves me really tired, and I have to start the new semester like that.”\n“Fufu, I can imagine that.”\n“You can tell if you visit my family. Though her attention will be on you instead.”\n“Th-that is true…”\nIf Mahiru really came along, Shihoko would happily drag her out.\nShe probably would not let Mahiru do anything dangerous, but she would surely drag the latter off for shopping or other leisure places. His mother always wanted a daughter, so she would be more than happy to raise a girl of this age, Mahiru of all people.\n“You’ll know in the summer. She’ll probably bring you out and make you wear all kinds of clothing like a doll.”\n“…Summer.”\n“She’ll make sure I’ll bring you along anyway.”\nIt appeared that during summer break, Mahiru would receive a personal invitation from Shihoko.\n“Ah, I can refuse if you don’t want to.”\n“I-I do not dislike it! I am happy about it.”\nShe shook her head vigorously, her hair ruffling like the waves, the shampoo scent stinging at his nose.\n“Nn, I’ll go ask my mom, though she’s probably more than happy to welcome you.”\n“…Thank you very much.”\n“I should be thanking you for bearing some of my suffering.”\n“Goodness.”\nAmane was slapped lightly on the elbow.\nOf course, it was a mere prick, and not painful, but that gesture was a little bad for his heart.\nHis heart started pounding wildly, for Mahiru had started a little skinship on him.\n“…Amane-kun?”\n“N-no, it-it’s nothing.”\n“You say that, but your eyes are looking around…”\n“Nothing at all. Ah look, you got a message.”\nHe tried to change the topic, not wanting to look rattled, and pointed at the vibrating, flashing smartphone.\nWhat is it?\nMahiru looked incredulous as she directed her attention elsewhere, and opened the smartphone app.\nHe thought it would be rude to see the message, and he really did not want to look at her in the eyes, so he looked elsewhere…he then heard a thud, and turned his eyes back towards Mahiru.\nHe wondered what it was about, and looked over to her, only to be stunned.\nMahiru dropped the smartphone onto the cushion beneath her knees, giving the teary look of a lost child.\nShe did not shed any tears, nor did she twist her lips…but it appeared that she would shatter upon contact.\nWhen was it when he last saw such a face?\nYes, it was similar to when they first spoke to each other……\n“…Mahiru?”\n“No, it is nothing. Please do not mind me.”\nMahiru responded with a stiff voice before Amane could ask anything.\n“Sorry, I should be returning for now. I have something tomorrow, and I will not be able to make dinner. My apologies.”\nMahiru replied before Amane could interrupt, quickly packed her belongings, and left.\nAmane’s hand was outstretched, but one had to wonder if she noticed it, or pretended not to…for his outstretched palm merely grabbed air.\n…Why out of a sudden?\nSurely the trigger was the message.\nAmane knew there was only one possibility as to why Mahiru would make such an expression.\n“…Mahiru’s parents.”\nMahiru hardly informed others of how to contact her, and only a rare few knew of her ID.\nHe knew there were him, Shihoko, Chitose, Itsuki, and a few tightly-lipped girls. The only others would be her parents.\nOne would have to assume that her parents had contacted her.\nShe said nothing all this while, even till yesterday. She suddenly said she had something urgent, and ran off. Perhaps she wanted to meet her parents.\nHe knew she was on bad terms with her parents, and could only deduce that they were the reason for her expression just now.\nHe could deduce, but he could not do anything.\n“…Mahiru.”\nHe saw her leave, and spotted the contorted frowning face. Despite that, he could not say anything.\nHe could only murmur helplessly the name of a girl who was not present, and slammed a fist onto the cushion that once held up her knees.",

      "content": "The weather was bad.\nDark clouds covered the skies outside the window, nary any sunlight to be seen. Raindrops were more likely to fall than sunlight.\nThus, even though they were in the latter half of March, he felt a little cold.\nHe switched on the heater, and sat on the sofa, but was just so restless. His eyes would look towards Mahiru’s apartment from time to time.\nIt was likely that Mahiru’s parents had plans to meet her.\nShe said she would not be around to make dinner, for she did not want to show her emotions after the meeting, it seemed.\nHe felt unpleasant thinking about how Mahiru would look hurt, as though something was stuck within him.\nHe was really worried, and even sent her a message,\nif there’s anything, contact me\n.\nHe could not remain as restless as he was, so for the time being, he went to the supermarket to secure his dinner.\nBut even while shopping, Mahiru’s expression remained on his mind. It would be rather painful for her to show such a face to her parents.\nHe instinctively bit his lips as he recalled her looking afraid of something.\nHe reverted his expression to normal so as not to look suspicious, but his mood did not improve.\nHe was aggressively stuffing the side dishes into the shopping basket, and regretted mangling them a little.\nHaa,\nhe sighed, finished payment for the goods, and slowly returned home under the cloudy skies. Then, as he took the elevator back him, he noticed something amiss.\nHe moved away from the corridor leading to his apartment, and hid himself in a corner.\nThere were two people standing outside Mahiru’s apartment.\nOne of them was the girl with the flax-colored hair he was used to seeing, Mahiru.\nThe other was an unfamiliar woman.\nThough he was looking from slightly afar, the lady could be said to be rather pretty.\nThe woman was facing the petite Mahiru, and looked rather tall. Considering the height difference against Mahiru, it seemed she was as tall as an ordinary male.\nDespite that, the woman did not seem to be tall or burly, probably due to her body proportions. Her form fitting business suit showed the balanced, curvy body that could be called an ideal woman’s body type.\nThe bright semi-long brown hair was upon her shoulders, and she looked a little grim.\nEven without her makeup, the eyes covered with eyeliners highlighted her strong personality. Her sharp gaze never showed signs of easing even as she faced Mahiru.\nShe was rather pretty, but her appearance and disposition were obviously standoffish, the vibe of a career-woman.\nIf Mahiru could be said to be an innocent lily, she was a vibrant, glamorous rose. The woman’s disposition and appearance were completely different.\n“You really aren’t cute at all. Just like that man. There’s nothing more infuriating than that.”\nAmane widened his eyes once he heard such a voice from the lipstick red lips.\nGiven how she was talking to Mahiru, it appeared she was the mother, but he was stunned to hear the mother actually humiliate her own daughter.\nThe face and words were not what a parent should be saying to the daughter.\nAnyone would have been hurt seeing such an attitude from a parent. Did Mahiru endure such a thing for so long?\n“It would be one thing if you resemble me…but you just had to resemble that man. Whatever, we won’t be related once you graduate from university, no point nitpicking. Just mail over the necessary documents like usual.”\n“…Yes.”\n“That’s all. Don’t bother me with anything unnecessary.”\nMahiru answered softly, and the lady snorted before turning to leave.\nShe was walking to the elevator hall, and Amane went to the corridor with some awkwardness.\nAs they passed, she glanced aside at him, and left without saying anything.\nMahiru stood there, spotted Amane, and winced.\n“…You heard that?”\n“Sorry.”\nHe did not lie, and apologized earnestly.\nHe did not intend to eavesdrop, but he could not have left at that moment.\nAnd he could not leave Mahiru in that state.\n“Erm, who’s that?”\n“…Sayo Shiina. My actual mother.”\nRecently, she would show a tender expression more frequently, but she seemed more reticent than their first encounter. Her voice seemed to creak with every word she said.\n“I knew my mother hated me all this while. There is no point worrying about it now.”\nHer voice was flat and monotonous.\nAmane concluded that she was acting tough, given that he spent much time with her, watching over her.\nIt was obvious that she was suppressing such emotions…the suffering, the pain, the sorrow.\nShe was about to silently retreat to her room, and Amane instinctively grabbed her hand.\nBut that instinct might be the correct choice.\nIf he let Mahiru be, her thoughts might take a turn for the worst.\nMahiru was dumbfounded, and showed a faint, feeble smile, wanting to shake his hand off. Amane held firm though, not wanting to let go at all.\nHe held her shockingly weak and helpless wrist firmly, yet not forcibly. That wrist was so shockingly feeble.\n“Come with me.”\nAmane said to Mahiru with a forceful tone, one he usually would not use, and she showed an awkward smile on her contorted face.\n“…I, am fine, you know? You do not have to worry, Amane-kun.”\n“I’m saying this because I want to be with you.”\nEven he felt that he was being too arrogant, but he had no intention of retracting his words.\nHe stared at Mahiru intently, and her face showed an utterly feeble smile, before she stopped resisting.\nHe impudently took that as an agreement, grabbed her hand, and dragged her to his place.",

      "content": "He invited Mahiru into his house, and sat her down on the sofa.\nShe showed a feeble smile, and was on the verge of falling over. He held her hand, sat down, and moved his hand from her wrist to her palm, wanting to wrap it, it seemed.\nOnce he gently wrapped her hand, and her eyebrows drooped.\n“…May you hear some pointless words from me?”\nTen minutes or so passed since they arrived in Amane’s apartment, before Mahiru started to confess.\n“My parents did not marry out of love. I shall not mention the details, but they got married simply because of family matters, and mutual interests.”\nMahiru flatly noted, but such a marriage reason was increasingly rare in modern Japan.\nTypically, people would marry out of love. It was not impossible to marry out of mutual interests, but it felt so archaic to mention it.\nIt seemed she was someone of the upper class, and one could assume her parents were the same. Amane could not say it was completely impossible for them to marry because of such reasons…but he found it unbelievable.\n“So…actually, they did not want to have a child, but a night stand happened. They gave birth to me, and they had no choice but to offer money. They never had any intention to raise me.”\n“They didn’t want to raise a child….”\n“…They usually do not come home. Even if they do, they just treat it as a hotel.”\nI never saw much of my parents’ faces since I was young,\nMahiru lamented softly, looking so frail.\n“I do not remember them doing anything typical of a parent. The parent who raised me was in fact the housemaker. They have affairs, and usually focus on their sides. All they do is to give me money and discard me, saying that I am not needed. No matter how I work hard, or try to be a good child, they just would not look at me.”\nAt that point, he finally understood why Mahiru projected herself as an angelic child.\nMahiru yearned for her parents to look at her, even a little.\nIf she acted as a good child, they might show concern for her, and praise her…she maintained such behavior even with the faintest of hope, and missed the opportunity to stop even at this point.\nShe continued as she was still clinging to that little possibility, or perhaps it was a facade she had to maintain, so that that nobody could see her inner self.\nHe did not know the reason why, but he understood that Mahiru really did not wish for it.\n“But they never showed concern for me. No matter how pretty I have become, how good I am at studies, capable of sports and housework, those people never once looked at me…my hard work has been for naught, but I am still working hard. It is foolish of me, no?”\nEven though I knew I will not be repaid.\nThis despondent lament suffocated his heart.\n“Those two cannot divorce with me around. They are not willing to be my guardians, for that will cause trouble for their affairs and their work. I cannot look to my grandparents for assistance either. I have been waiting until I graduate from university, and once I am capable of being independent, I will not have any relation to them.”\n“That…”\n“…I was shocked to be told directly… that I am not wanted. I gave up, and just went to the swing in the rain.”\nUpon hearing those words, Amane finally understood why she was in the rain at the park several months ago.\nBack then, she was shaken by her parent’s words, wandering sadly, and arrived there.\nShe felt she had nowhere to go, and showed the expression…of a lost child, immature and uneasy.\nShe had no one to turn to for help, and could not accept such depressing words. She was at a loss, so she just went and remained there.\nHe imagined her thoughts back then, and the taste of blood spreading in his mouth.\nIt seemed he had unwittingly bit through his lips, for the slight pain and unique scent spread in the mouth. The unreasonable truth might have inadvertently caused rage to arise within his heart.\n“…If they found it inconvenient, they should not have given birth to me.”\nThe really feeble mutter seemed as painful as a stake being hammered into his chest, leaving him unable to move at all.\nAt this point, his heart was incensed, his mind turned blank as he directed his rage towards the actual parents Mahiru spoke of.\nShe became so delicate because she never received love from her parents, unable to show how fragile she was. She was acting tough, but deep inside, she was crying, and she was unable to turn to anyone for help.\nShe removed her façade as a good child, and looked so utterly fragile and fleeting.\nHow could they push her this far?\nHe wanted to question out loud, but the two people who abandoned Mahiru were not present.\nFurthermore, he did not know what to do.\nHe was furious at the harsh family environment Mahiru suffered through, but he was not family to her.\nIt was bad for him to interfere with Mahiru’s family situation, and the situation might worsen if he did. He could not do anything, for he considered that anything he said could potentially hurt her.\nBut if he was to leave Mahiru as she was, it seemed that she would sublimate into the air…he laid the blanket next to him over her head.\nHe covered her, her face hidden in the shadows. While she remained confused, he brought her into him arms.\nIt was the first time he took the initiative to embrace, her petite, helpless body seemed prone to snap if he exerted too much strength.\nAmane embraced Mahiru in his clutches, for the latter never able to rely on anyone, and always endured in silence alone.\n“Eh, A-Amane-kun…?”\n“…I think I’m starting to understand why your personality is like this.”\n“The part about me not being cute?”\n“Not that…more like, how patient you are, yet so stubborn.”\nShe had to endure, for if she once showed weakness, she would surely collapse.\nThe housemaker appeared to really care for Mahiru, but was merely a hired outsider, unable to help Mahiru.\nAnd so she could only endure this silently, without being able to ask anyone for help, and for that reason, she ended up faking herself.\n“…I can’t interfere with your family, so I’m not going to lecture them here and there.”\nAs an outsider, Amane should not be talking about something as sensitive as family matters.\nBut it did not mean he could not help and support Mahiru.\n“…I’ll pretend not to see, so just cry all you want. You’ll just feel suffocated holding it all in with that face of yours.”\nTo be honest, he really did not want her to cry.\nBut if this continued to pile up, she would crumble apart one day.\nThus, he hoped she would cry; that she would release all the stress she had endured silently.\nIf she was suffering, he wanted her to talk it out; if she felt lonely, he wanted her to express her loneliness. Only then would Amane be able to stay by her side, listening to her.\nHe was powerless in the face of her plight, but at the very least, he could share some of her burden.\nAt one point, he thought he was getting too ahead of himself, but she started moving in his clutches, buried her face into his chest, and dissipated all his worries.\n“…You swear you will keep it a secret?”\n“I’m not looking. I don’t know.”\n“…Then, lend me…a moment.”\nHe did not answer her quivering mutter, and merely put the blanket over her head once again before embracing the helpless back.\nAfter a moment, he could hear faint sobbing.\nNot loud, but it was clearly a sob, from Mahiru.\nShe never bemoaned her fate, and endured it alone. After hearing her plead him for ‘support’, Amane himself had the urge to cry as he embraced her little back.\n“…You were watching after all.”\nShe did not cry for long.\nHe did not look at the time, but it was about ten minutes or so.\nHe felt it was fine for her to let out the 16 years of suffering, but she might be too tired from crying for so long, and her body just stopped tearing. The mental exhaustion might have tacked on to her physical exhaustion, and the brain was probably forced to sleep.\nMahiru lifted her face towards Amane, her eyes still moist, but had regained some semblance of vigor as they looked back at Amane, rejuvenated.\n“Well, you’re on my chest. I made sure not to look before you started crying.”\nHe removed the blanket that had slipped off, and saw the little smile on her face.\n“…Amane-kun.”\n“What?”\n“…Thank you very much.”\n“I don’t know, what for?”\nI wanted to do this, and I don’t remember doing anything to thank me for.\nHe turned his head aside, and once again, Mahiru buried her face into his chest.\n“Please let me do so for a little longer.”\n“…Oh.”\nHe could not leave Mahiru as she was in this state. After all, he wanted to support her.\nHe tried to play it cool as he embraced her firmly, and gently patted her head.\nIf nobody else would praise Mahiru, Amane would do the honors.\nYou really worked hard. You don’t have to force yourself in front of me.\nSo he thought as he gently caressed her head. She seemed to have calmed down, looking up at him with the expression of one with her strength sapped from her.\nBut perhaps she was just a little too worried about various things, for she did not appear to cheer up.\n“…What shall I do in the future?”\nMahiru muttered softly, showing a perturbed smile towards Amane’s eyes.\n“I worked hard, but the two of them never cared about me. The others too call me the Angel, but they never really needed me. What they liked what they need, is the angelic Mahiru Shiina…not the real me. I was the reason for this outcome, but I am suffering because of this. Is it not ironic?”\nI was the one who drove myself to despair,\nshe bitterly noted, and latched onto the fabric on Amane’s chest.\n“The real me is not cute at all, timid and selfish, and unpleasant in personality…I am not attractive in any way.”\n“Well I like that, somewhat.”\nHe unwittingly blurted out his true thoughts.\nMahiru instantly blinked away, and he stared back at her, continuing,\n“Well, you have moments when you aren’t cute, but I often have thoughts that yeah, you’re cute, I want to protect you. Besides, your forthright personality is something I like, and nobody with a bad real personality will actually worry about that.”\nYou’re thinking about it backwards,\nhe flicked Mahiru’s forehead lightly. The latter was somewhat dumbfounded, the negative expression gone from her face.\n.\nMahiru’s self-deprecation was really something Amane could not understand at all.\nEveryone could tell she was a hardworking, kind girl, no matter how they looked at her. She might be a little too blunt in her words, but she was being reasonable, and saying things for the good of others.\nShe said she was timid, but that was not a bad thing. She was merely too hurt, and being defensive so that she would not be hurt again.\nAnd if she was really not cute, Amane would not have become so restless because of her.\nRather, he hoped she realized that she was cuter if she was being her true self.\n“Don’t belittle yourself. There’s one guy in front of you who likes to see your true self. ”\nShe might have lacked self-esteem because she was not loved. However, Amane was not the only one who liked her. There were many others too who felt the same, and he really lamented her grave misunderstanding.\nChitose too felt that the real Mahiru was cute, and kept clinging onto the latter. Clearly, that Chitose would not simply look at appearances after all.\nHe stared into Mahiru’s caramel-colored eyes, implying so, and her eyes began to swim around.\nFurthermore, the little red color at the corners of her eyes instantly covered her face.\nOne might say her face was the color of rose, and by the time he realized her shame might be out of embarrassment, she shriveled up, her eyes just wandering around.\nLooking at Mahiru’s state, Amane realized he might have said something inappropriate, and his face too turned red.\n“N-no, look, Chitose and the others feel the same! I-I don’t mean anything else! It’s not just me! Mom, dad, Chitose and Itsuki like it when you’re not being the Angel! So, actually, I think…your personality is more popular than you think.”\nAmane hastily explained, and Mahiru finally looked at him.\nBut even for a moment, the fact remained that a misunderstanding happened , and she quivered with a blushing face, probably embarrassed by Amane’s words. Amane too would feel embarrassed, but she might be more embarrassed than he was, since she was the one hearing these words.\n“Erm, if you can’t take it, or you had enough of those parents, you can hide in our house. My parents will shelter you once they know of your situation. So well, just think of it as healing.”\n“…Nn.”\n“My parents really like you, and I feel they’ll let you stay with them forever…well, I don’t think they’re going to let you go until you gain happiness. We can’t interfere with your family matters, but we’ll continue to shelter you until you make up your mind, or support you.”\n“Nn…”\nAmane did his best to explain and quell the misunderstanding, and Mahiru once again had tears in her eyes.\n“Wh-why are you crying again?”\n“Because I feel blessed…”\n“Well, you haven’t been fortunate, so you can be a little more selfish.”\nShe was financially well off, but she received nothing else. She did not receive the love she deserved, and it was amazing that she managed to grow up without being twisted.\nHe felt that Mahiru could fawn to anyone as much as she pleased, and be impulsive, after all the hardship she suffered. Since nobody else would hear her sufferings, he decided to make up for it, even by a little.\n“…So, may I request for something?”\n“What?”\nAs long as I can do it,\nhe quipped, but she smiled, “this is something only you can do, Amane-kun,” and muttered,\n“Please look at me some more.”\n“I’m looking at you working hard. I won’t know where you’ll run off to if I look away, so I’ll keep watching you.”\n“…Please catch me well.”\n“I’ll hold your hand then.”\nIs that all?\nHe looked towards Mahiru’s face, who stared back, before giving a bashful look.\n“For today, please catch me with your body.”\nOnce she said that, she wrapped her arms around Amane’s back, burying her face into his chest. His heart raced for a moment, but he thought it would be bad to have malicious thoughts, so he suppressed those thoughts before embracing that delicate body once again.",

      "content": "The following day, Mahiru remained the same.\nIt seemed that she had recovered from the previous day’s incident, and sat next to him with a usual expression. She did not appear to be in agony, but rather extremely calm.\nBut, the little difference was that…the distance between them had reduced.\nIn the past, there was a space of at least two fists even though they were sitting next to each other. On this day, she was close enough to touch his arm.\nHer fragrance was closer than before, and Amane could feel his body warmth.\nBecause of that, he recalled that he did embrace her tightly the previous day, and also the softness and fragrance from her. He was troubled. Back then, she looked really feeble, and he just could not help but embrace her. In hindsight, that act was really bold.\nShe did not dislike it, and instead, sought for an embrace from him.\nHer gesture indicated that Amane received her trust, that she could rely on him…but while he was delighted with this, he felt awkward.\n…I want to seize the opportunity now that I experienced this.\nAmane really welcomed her fawning over him, but he started to wonder if she liked him as a boy.\nIt would be great if that was the case.\nHe could no longer fool himself completely again; he realized he was captivated by Mahiru. He was worried, wondering how he should keep his distance from her.\nPerhaps he could touch her normally? But to what extent? He never expected himself to have such troubles.\nFortunately or not, Mahiru was oblivious to Amane’s worries, and leaned by his side with a peaceful expression.\nAmane wanted to suppress his impulses, and was suffering as a result.\nMahiru had a psychological trauma due to her parents, and probably was against having a boy-girl relationship. He did not want her to know his feelings. Given her personality, he did not think she would despise him, but he was frightened at the thought that she might distance him.\nHe wanted to embrace her up front again, to touch her, to kiss her…but as a girl, the only emotion she might feel was fear if a boy she had yet to date started to have such thoughts.\nHe dared not express such emotions to her as he wanted to treasure her.\n“…What is it, Amane-kun?”\n“Ugh, nothing.”\n“Really?”\nMahiru noticed that something was on Amane’s mind, and tugged at his sleeve. He shook his head, making a poker face.\nAfter all, he could not say that he was thinking of something guilty, and wanted to change topics.\n“Ah, right. We’re going to be in our second year soon.”\n“Yes.”\nHe mentioned this, as there were only a few days left for their spring vacation. Mahiru seemingly forgot her doubts as she went with the flow.\n“We will have to change classes then, no?”\n“Change classes? It’ll be easier for me if I get in the same class as Itsuki and Chitose.”\n“…Yes…I am looking forward to it.”\n“Looking forward?”\n“I wonder if I will be in the same class as you.”\nMahiru gave a little bashful smile, and Amane wanted to bang his head onto the sofa armrest, and also to scratch his chest.\n“…I won’t talk to you, you know?”\n“That may be so, but I will be relieved. And…you will keep an eye out for me, no?”\n“Not to the point of being a stalker, no.”\n“…I will not be angry about you looking at me, Amane-kun.”\nPlease look at me more\n, that was what Mahiru said so innocently, and looked so innocent that a sheepish Amane dared not look at her directly.\nShe meant for him to watch over her, but to him, it seemed to imply more.\nSince she did not intend otherwise, it was pointless for him to second guess.\nHmph hmph,\nhe snorted to purge his own thoughts, and shrugged.\n“If I’m to look at you, everyone else will find that disgusting. I’m like this after all.”\nIt was one thing if they were alone together, but if he were to do the same to Mahiru at school, he might be labelled a disgusting guy in addition to his reputation as a gloomy one.\nHe intended to pretend to be a passer by at school. He was not particularly keen on letting others know his feelings for Mahiru.\nHowever, Mahiru was strangely peeved for some reason.\n“Look, even if you make that face.”\n“…Amane-kun, are you not cutting your hair?”\n“What’s with this out of a sudden? Well, I’ll tidy it up from time to time, but I don’t really cut it short.”\n“It is a pity…”\n“Say.”\n“But your handsome side is a secret only to me. That is fine too.”\nAmane had a feeling that Mahiru was being sweeter to him than usual, as though she was showing affection to him.\nUsually, he could handle it, but since he already realized his feelings for her, this attitude from her might cause him fatal damae.\n“…What’s cool about that?” He muttered to hide how embarrassed he was being. At that moment, Mahiru showed a peeved look, and slapped his thigh.\nHe knew what she wanted to say, but he dared not look at her in the eyes due to the shame.\n“I get it I’m sorry I’m sorry. I look handsome to you, is it?”\n“It is not good of you to think so, but I shall leave it be.”\nMahiru accepted his apology for the time being, and reached out towards his bangs.\nHis clearer vision reflected her serious eeys.\n“Are you not belittling yourself too much, Amane-kun? You are rather handsome after all.”\n“…I’m embarrassed to hear you say that to me directly.”\n“You often say so to me. Perhaps you should try enduring that shame too.”\nI too am embarrassed.\nShe said confidently, and Amane recalled that when he called her cute, her face really was blushing.\nShe would feel embarrassed whenever she was praised, and because she was so adorable, Amane earnestly praised her for being so. Whenever he did so, she would feel embarrassed. Surely it was not a good feeling to her.\n“…You’re the only one who’ll call me handsome.”\n“You should have a little more self-confidence, Amane-kun. The person who consoled me has to have some confidence.”\n“…But.”\n“Amane-kun, you helped me, and gave me confidence. I am really grateful to you…I hope you can muster some confidence. You are a kind, handsome, outstanding.”\n“…Oh, uuhh.”\nAmane unwittingly felt bashful the moment he was praised.\nHe was never praised before, and his heart felt unbearable when the girl he liked praised him.\nOf course, he was elated. The emotion called embarrassment took precedence however.\nOne might say his embarrassment was the majority, and he was restless. He reached out to ruffle Mahiru’s head to divert his attention, and to disguise his emotions.\n“Wait, A-Amane-kun…”\n“Shut up.”\n“…I-I am fine with this, but you will mess my hair up.”\nAmane felt that his actions might be too violent to a girl, so he hastily switched to a different gesture, gently combing her hair. Mahiru then earnestly leaned her head over.\nPlease pat me more.\nHer voice sounded like a background noise, but it was probably a delusion on his part.\nDespite that, Mahiru did not look unwilling, and Amane continued to comb the smooth glossy hair.\n…Is she fawning over me?\nShe never had one to fawn over, and at this point, she finally had someone understand her situation and true thoughts. Perhaps she had the urge to.\nIn that case, he felt that he should dote on her more. He buried his immoral thoughts to touch her back in his heart, and gently patted her head as she wished.\nOnce he was done, Mahiru lowered her completely beetroot face. Amane got too carried away, and he too was blushing once he was done. This was the outcome to be expected after all.",

      "content": "Ping’s note: Continues directly after the events of volume 2.\n“Quite the group we have this year.”\nItsuki leered away as he stared at the class register, commenting so to Itsuki.\nAmane stared at the cluttered namelist, and found himself in the same class as Itsuki, Chitose and Mahiru. Kadowaki too was in their class. This class had both the Prince and the Angel.\n“We’re in the same class as Shiina-san!” “I’m in the same class as the Prince!” He could hear such shrill and deep voices that did not seem to be directed at anyone in particular.\nPerhaps it was because Mahiru and Amane were in the same class, that Itsuki was grinning.\n“This is going to be one noisy class, huh?”\nAmane did not want to be teased by Itsuki, and replied thusly before heading towards the classroom. Itsuki followed with a wry grin.\nAmane felt it was a good thing Itsuki was in class, but he felt certain he would be laughed at, so he kept mum. Itsuki was one who would get too ahead upon being praised, and Amane decided to change the subject by saying a few words.\nThey entered the classroom, and found the Angel and Prince already surrounded by many. Amane could only chuckle at this scene.\nThey’re as popular as usual,\nItsuki too chuckled next to him. Kadowaki seemed to have noticed the two enter the classroom, and showed the usual hearty smile.\n“Yo, guess I’m in the same class as you this year.”\n“Guess we’re in the same class as you this year, Yuuta. Three straight years if we include middle school.”\n“That happened?”\n“Yep. We’re in the same middle school.”\nAmane already felt they were rather close. That would explain why.\n“Please look after me this year too, Fujimiya.”\n“Oh.”\nKadowaki was friendly to anyone, and could smile to Amane, even though they were nothing more than acquaintances.\nIs this the secret to being\npopular…so Amane wondered.\nFeeling speechless and amazed, he answered thusly to Kadowaki, who remained unperturbed despite the crowd around him, and sat at his assigned seat.\nHe did not look towards Mahiru.\nAfter all, he did not want to look guilty. She was surrounded by many boys and girls, and had no time to deal with him.\nSurely Mahiru never noticed Amane, and Amane did not have to do anything much.\n“Morning~! We’re in the same class~!”\nAmane was checking if he missed anything in his submitted documents, and Chitose, who had overslept, showed up.\nHe felt his gut wince, for Chitose and Itsuki were in the same class, and the days ahead would surely be rowdy.\n“Morning. You didn’t show up with Itsuki today?”\n“Nn, I overslept~. Well~ I just forgot about this new semester, so mom woke me up~. Where’s Ikkun?”\n“At the vending machine.”\n“OK~ I’ll get him to buy some milk tea. Ah Mahirun Mahirun! We’re in the same class, please take care of me!”\nThe utterly fearless Chitose waved away at Mahiru, and attacked the latter who was in the middle of the crowd.\nThe nickname Mahirun had everyone stunned, but Mahiru herself naturally accepted it, giving the angelic smile in the process. Once everyone realized that Chitose was allowed to to call her that, they gave envious looks.\n“Let’s hurry and get some crepes when we go home today! The stall at the station has some nice one!”\n“If you do not mind, please allow me to join you.”\nPerhaps it was just Amane overthinking it, but he sensed Mahiru giving him a glance. He felt there was no need for her to seek his permission all the time however, that she should go if she wanted to. After all, Amane had no right or intention to stop her; he hoped she could go along with what she wanted.\nHe could simply drop by at the fast food restaurant or the convenience store for lunch.\nAlso, he was relieved to see that Mahiru was interacting with such good-natured friends.\nHe felt Chitose was really of great help, and hoped Chitose would bring Mahiru out, since the latter never actually had fun with others. He wanted Mahiru to enjoy herself, to go visit places without being worn out.\nPerhaps Mahiru was the one who benefited most from being Chitose’s classmate.\nDespite being pressured by Chitose, Mahiru appeared to be enjoying herself as she smiled, and Amane too showed a little smile.",

      "content": "” I never thought we would be in the same class.”\nIt was after dinner when Amane commented while lazing around on the sofa like usual. “Yes.” Mahiru smiled as she sat next to him.\nThey were being very close to each other, and Amane’s heart raced for some reason. However, Mahiru did not show such a reaction; perhaps she had no thoughts about this.\n“I am happy too. Chitose-san will be with us.”\n“It’ll be noisy with her around.”\n“Yes. It does seem like a fun year.”\n“I think the class will be really noisy though. We’ll have the Angel, the Prince, and the idiot couple that’s Itsuki and Chitose. For good or bad, we have all the attention here.”\nThe Angel and the Prince were very popular with both boys and girls. Those of the same genders were somewhat envious at them, but the popularity arising from their outstanding appearances, abilities and personalities heavily outweighed them.\nThe couple Itsuki and Chitose too were famous throughout the entire school year. It happened because they were often fooling around in school, and also because they had decent appearances, and garnered much attention.\nAlso, they were the moodmakers of their classes, and were extremely popular among the students.\nWith them around, all the attention would be centered upon this class, and the homeroom teacher would have much trouble. The quartet themselves were fine, but there would surely be chaos. That teacher would have to be mentally prepared.\n“…You dislike it, Amane-kun?”\n“Not really. It looks like you guys will be happy.”\n“Are you not thinking about joining in?”\n“Me? I just want to spend my time normally. Probably chit-chat with Itsuki, but if nothing’s going on, I’ll probably talk to you or Kadowaki. I don’t really interact with you outside, so if we suddenly do, there’s going to be lots of suspicions.”\nAs a guy, Amane could possibly have some interaction with Kadowaki. It would be impossible if it was Mahiru however, for she was the prettiest girl in school.\nHe did not want to be deemed a shameless fool chasing after her just because they talked.\nAnd thus, he did not want to talk to her.\nDespite that, Mahiru pursed her lips, looking displeased. Amane showed a wry smile, not knowing what to do.\n“Why are you unhappy?”\n“…Nothing.”\nSurely there was something, but Amane knew she was in a bad mood, so he patted her head.\n“…You are not trying to throw me off by patting my back, no?”\n“…Not at all.”\n“But I am rather happy. I shall let you off for today.”\n“Thanks.”\nIt seemed Mahiru had been sufficiently coaxed.\nShe looked relaxed after Amane patted her on the head, as though she was eating sweet honey. Amane found it difficult to stare at her.\nThe blissful emotions was conveyed through her face, and he felt happy yet ashamed, unable to calm down.\n“You really like headpats, huh?”\nOnly recently did Amane learn that Mahiru really liked to be headpatted by Amane.\n“Amane-kun, you hand is warm. it feels comforting.”\n“Well, I’m warmer.”\n“…I want you to pat me more.”\n“Don’t say such things that’ll cause misunderstandings. Alright, as you wish.”\nAnyone else would have misconstrued it as something dangerous, an invitation for him to touch her elsewhere. He warned her as he patted her head.\nHe could smell a really pleasant scent, perhaps because she had just bathed. Truth be told, he could not hide the throbbing in his heart completely, but he combed her hair carefully, ensuring that she did not notice his heartbeat.\nHis heart throbbed faster when he thought of how he was the only one allowed to pat her. However, he really could not say so to her.\nHe continued to pat her, and she looked really relaxed, sometimes showing a giddy look. She suddenly looked towards his face, as though contemplating something.\n“…What?”\n“I want to pat your head too.”\n“What’s fun about patting a boy’s head?”\n“It looks fun, I suppose. I think it will be fun to pat you on the head.”\n“Am I a toy…well, I’m fine with that, but it’s not fun or anything.”\nAmane’s hair was rather smooth, but it was far from Mahiru’s. There was no denying that his hair would feel rugged compared to her.\nSince she still wanted to pat his head, and Amane would not lose anything, there was no reason for him to refuse. He stopped patting her, and said, “Go ahead.” Mahiru patted her thighs.\n“…Hm?”\n“I think your neck will hurt given the difference in height and posture, Amane-kun…or do you wish to embrace me like the last time?”\n“No, the thighs are fine.”\nIf Mahiru was to embrace Amane, his face would be buried in the motherly place, so he had to refuse.\nWhile he found that proposition to be really attractive, he would be scorned if he said so, and chose to remain silent.\nIn fact, he should be refusing with all his might.\nHe was faced with these choices, and able to experience a posture any boy would have dreamed of. His desire to not miss out on this opportunity overtook his sanity, and he agreed.\nIs that okay?\nHe gave her such a look, but she slapped the thighs beneath her miniskirt, as though prompting him. Amane could only lie on the sofa apprehensively, and put his head on her thighs.\nMahiru’s legs were thin, and soft in the right places.\nHer muscles were rather supple instead of defined. He could feel a feminine softness of the taut legs through the fabric. To put it, it felt really good.\nThere was also a lingering sweet smell. It was magical.\nHe might see something incredible if he looked up, but he would lose all self-control if he did so. He restrained himself by turning away from Mahiru obediently.\nMahiru never noticed how rattled Amane was, and her little palm patted his hair.\nHer fine fingers combed through his hair.\nThe inside of her fingers stroked gently past the skin, and it felt really comfortable. While it was a far cry from the relaxed smile on Mahiru’s face, he did feel like smiling. Truth be told, he felt so comfortable, he had the urge to sleep.\nIn contrast, Mahiru was acting a lot gentler. She continued to pat and comb, and while he did not know what expression she was making, it seemed she was really enjoying it.\n“I heard from Chitose-san that a lap pillow is a man’s romance. What do you think, Amane-kun?”\n“…Chitose’s the one who did this unnecessary stuff?”\n“How is it?”\n“That’s nice.”\nWhile he had the urge to give Chitose a thumbs up, he would feel ashamed, even if he did not express his true thoughts.\nIf she continued to comb, he would surely fall asleep.\nHaving changed classes for the new year, he was mentally worn out from having to do the customary self-introductions and talking with strangers and so on. He was certain that he would fall asleep if he continued to be coddled.\n“I see. I do not know if you will be happy, given that there is no extra service. I think it is fine since you are happy however.”\n“…Extra service?”\n“It will be better if I am to dig your ears. I shall do so next time.”\nWhat in the world did Chitose teach her!?\nSurely Chitose taught her unnecessary.\n“N-no, that’s enough. A lap’s.”\n“You dislike it?”\n“…I’m happy about this though.”\n“Thank goodness.”\nHe could not look behind, but he could sense her smiling.\nThe fingers continued to comb through his hair, seemingly prompting him to sleep.\nWell, whatever\n, Amane was in such a mood, and closed his eyes as he experienced the looming comfort.",

      "content": "Amane woke up to see the fabric of Mahiru’s one-piece dress.\nIt seemed he rolled about when he was sleeping, and turned his face towards Mahiru.\nAnd because of that, he had a fine whiff of the conditioner, along with Mahiru’s natural milky scent, resulting in his face searing as a result.\nHe felt it was unbecoming of him to keep staring at a person’s belly, so he turned his face up tentatively, before seeing her looking down at him with a merciful look.\nUh oh,\nso he thought. It appeared Mahiru was more blessed than he thought, and the curves were more emphasized as he was looking up, which left him awkward.\n“Awake now?”\n“…Yeah.”\n“You slept well.”\nMahiru giggled. She seemed elated rather than mischievous, as happy as a mother watching a lively child sleep.\nAmane was overwhelmed with the urge to roll about while the merciful look Mahiru continued to pat his head.\nThough he was not embarrassed about any unsightly sleeping look, he was sheepish about how Mahiru was patting him with such a doting face. He did not dislike it; on the contrary, he was enjoying it.\n“…How long did I sleep?”\n“About an hour or so.”\n“Sorry.”\n“It is fine. I do enjoy stroking your hear, Amane-kun.”\n“…Really?”\nMahiru continued to enjoy the feeling of Amane’s hair, and the latter dared not look at her, instead averting his eyes.\n“You dislike it, Amane-kun?”\n“…I wouldn’t have slept if I disliked it.”\n“Really? You can enjoy this however you want.”\n“…Don’t say it as and when you want it.”\n“Why?”\n“…Anyway, just don’t.”\nI’ll misunderstand, you know?\nOf course, he could not say that, so he kept quiet. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion, but her hand did not stop.\n“Well, I do like to pat, or be patted by you, Amane-kun.”\nSo don’t say this so openly…\nIt appeared Mahiru had no other intent.\nShe probably was trying to convey that she really yearned for physical contact, due to her family reasons, and that she would feel relief whenever she was patted on the head. One could assume from those words however that Mahiru had feelings for Amane, and that she would feel blessed to be patted.\n“…If you say that, I’ll sexually harass you.”\n“Sexually harass?”\n“I’ll touch your body.”\n“Where?”\n“Wh-where…of course…don’t make me say it.”\nIt was obvious without saying that a male would want to touch certain female parts.\nAmane’s face naturally turned beetroot, and Mahiru blinked a few times. She then seemed to have an idea, “Ahh.” for she nodded away.\n“You want to touch, Amane-kun?”\n“…Only if I’m dating her, and that she agrees.”\n“So you will not do anything, Amane-kun.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Fu-fufu, Amane-kun, you really are gentlemanly.”\n“You’re noisy.”\n“This is what I like about you, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru giggled away, and Amane felt a shortness of breath.\nShe did not mean anything.\nSurely she was saying that she liked him in the sense that he was a good man, not in the romantic sense.\nDespite knowing this, Amane felt his heart ache.\nThe lap pillow alone would have caused much misunderstanding. With her doting on him so much, even he would wonder if Mahiru had feelings for him.\nShe certainly had feelings for him, to some extent, but he did not know what those feelings were, and how deep. He was delighted and yet worried, his heart likely on the verge of annihilation.\n“Thanks for that.”\nHe barely eked out this answer, rolled away, and turned his back on her.",

      "content": "Amane was in the same class as Mahiru, but his life never changed.\nHe continued to pay attention in class, as a decent student would, ate together with Itsuki at the cafeteria, and returned home after school as he never participated in the clubs. That was to be expected however.\n“Say, you fine with that?”\nAmane was having lunch in the cafeteria, just like his first year of high school. Itsuki was seated before him when he suddenly mentioned this, as though he thought of something.\nOn a side note, while Chitose would occasionally pop by to join them, she probably was eating with Mahiru on this day. It would be great for those two to get along openly. Amane felt relieved.\n“What are you saying?”\n“I’m talking about your situation with her.”\n“There’s no reason for me to talk to her, right?”\nIf he did, the surrounding folks would surely give him the ‘what’s wrong with this guy’ look.\nAs a straightforward, honest guy, it would be suicidal for him to openly get involved with Mahiru.\n“I think she’s been trying to talk to you. She’s getting angsty about it.”\n“…I’ll concede that.”\nMahiru would try to look away from Amane as much as possible, but she would occasionally look towards him. Amane did sense her looking a little despondent.\nShe would only do so when nobody else did, which was fine itself. However, Chitose would give Amane that ‘you coward’ look in her stead, and Amane would feel restless for some reason.\n“The only way out is to do that.”\n“I don’t wanna. It’s troublesome. Not like I’ll get any more handsome.”\nWhile the rumors had quelled for the time being, he was witnessed with Mahiru in that state. It would be chaotic if Amane was linked to that person, and his future school life would be heavily affected.\n“Why are you so…you should be rather popular.”\n“How so?”\nAmane did not think he would be suddenly popular with a little hairstyle change, but Itsuki seemed very confident for some reason.\n“Personality-wise, you’re very blunt, but honest, and you know how to care for girls. You’re the type girls like to date.”\n“…Isn’t that normal?”\n“Most guys can’t do that normal of yours. You realize that girls want you to treasure their feelings, and so you’ll do it. You’re not being too ahead of yourself. You act only after you observe carefully.”\n“…How are you so confident about that?”\n“If you aren’t, there’s no way she would be so close to you when she’s always so wary despite how amicable she looks.”\nAmane could not deny that.\nSee, I told you.\nItsuki chuckled once Amane pursed his lips.\n“…Anyway, can I ask you something?”\n“What?”\n“I think that if you wouldn’t treasure her that much if you dislike her, right?”\n“Shut up. Is that bad?”\nItsuki probably understood everything from Amane’s attitude. No way was Amane able to hide his feelings.\nAmane answered with a pout, and slurped the ramen.\nItsuki seemed to have expected this, instead of simply stating that as a joke. He nodded understandingly in seemingly praise.\n“Well, I’m happy for ya. It’s great to have someone you treasure.”\n“Really?”\n“It’ll be great if you succeed.”\n“…I think it’s fine if it doesn’t work out. As long as she’s happy, I’m fine with that, even if it’s not me.”\nOf course, Amane hoped that the ‘it’ would be himself, but if Mahiru would be happy choosing another boy, he should give her his blessings.\nHe hoped to personally grant her happiness, and would willingly bury his emotions if that was what it took. Mahiru really deserved her happiness. She suffered so much, and if she still could not be blessed greatly, it would be a letdown of the hard work she put in.\n“…You coward.”\n“Shut up…even I want her to be happy.”\n“Just say it to her man.”\n“Like I can, you idiot.”\nAmane would never confess without being certain that she liked him as the opposite gender. His was not so shallow-minded.\nMahiru herself seemed rather cautious when it came to dating, and they probably could not go out with a half-hearted, probing mentality.\nThere was no way Mahiru would agree to it, considering what her parents said. Amane felt that they would not end up dating if neither side planned to settle down together. Thus, he would not easily convey his feelings.\n“…Man, you’re really pessimistic.”\n“Shut up. Whatever, I’ll make her fall for me in my own way.”\n“…If only there’s a third party that’ll say everything.”\n“What?”\n“Nothing…well, good luck. I’ll cheer you on.”\nA dumbfounded Itsuki cheered Amane on for some reason. The latter frowned, but he graciously accepted those words.",

      "content": "“Oh Fujimiya? That’s a surprise.”\nAfter school, Amane dropped by at the game center, inserted a note into a coin exchange machine, and heard a voice he was not really familiar with.\nHe slipped the coins into his wallet, turned around, and saw Kadowaki standing there. It appeared the latter came to the game center for some fun too, for his hand was in the wallet as he stood behind Amane.\n“Strange seeing you here, Kadowaki. What about club activities?”\n“It’s a rest day. Will be bad to be burdened every day after all.”\n“I see.”\nHe was the ace of the track team, but he did not devote all his time on it. According to him, he could not not compromise on rest.\nOnce he was done exchanging his money, Amane retreated to the side. Kadowaki too inserted a note into the machine.\n2000 yen went into his wallet, and once he spotted Amane looking, he chuckled.\n“I thought you would be an honor student of sorts. Shocked me to see you here though.”\n“I do visit a game center from time to time, but I don’t really want to waste money, so I won’t really come here unless there’s something.”\n“Hm, then why today?”\n“I’m here to play the crane game. Someone asked me to get a doll.”\nOn the contrary, it was Chitose who showed Amane the game center website, and went all “Looky look, don’t you think Mahirun will like this~?” Having considered how Mahiru had been a little dejected recently, Amane came to the game center, hoping to catch a doll for her.\nLooking at the photo Chitose sent the last time, it appeared Mahiru did not have many decorations in her room. Amane wanted to use the chance to buy Mahiru a cute doll, and provide a few friends to the bear doll.\n“Can you catch one?”\n“Yep. I’m good at this.”\nThe crane in this game center were rather strong, and easy to grab with. Once he figured out the object’s center of gravity, its positioning, and the manner to grab, it was unexpectedly easy.\nIt was due to Shihoko teaching him tricks in elementary school. “See, put the crane here, and it grabs it. Over here, pull the hook into the label, and voila.”\nAmane managed to learn some strange knowledge and tricks due to his mother’s showcase of her meaningless myriad of skills.\nKadowaki looked surprised, and Amane led him to the crane area, saying that they should try everything. He casually slotted a coin into a machine with lots of bunny dolls.\nGiven the arm grip and positioning, it appeared one coin would be enough. There were instances where it was impossible to grab without spending hundreds of yen, but this crane should be fine.\nAmane did not really understand, but it appeared the bunny doll was a character from a certain work. He aimed at the head and the body, and the head was then lodged in the arms. Its body was dangling, but with his head hanging on, the crane managed to hold onto the doll.\nAll he had to do was to move the lever away, and the doll would naturally fall into the exit.\nThud,\nthe bunny fell. Amane took it out, and waved it gently to Kadowaki, “Wow.” who looked impressed.\n“The crane arms of the game center here are rather sturdy, and the shopkeeper will teach anyone how to use it if you got any issue. This shop is a good place for beginners.”\n“So that’s why Itsuki and the others say this is a good place?”\nI see.\nKadowaki nodded understandingly.\n“Just to ask. This for someone?”\n“Yep. That person really took care of me. I intend to give this as thanks.”\nAmane was not lying.\nHe simply never mentioned that it was Mahiru. It was a fact that he was taken care of by her; it was a fact that the gift was an appreciation of her daily help.\n“You’re really hardworking, Amane. I think I understand though.”\n“Understand what?”\n“Well, you’re delicate and gentlemanly, and will casually help others out.”\n“That was just a coincidence.”\n“It was, but you helped me out. That bag the last time, for example.”\nOnce again, Kadowaki showed a hearty smile to express his thanks, and Amane found himself strangely bashful.\nIt was not anything important, yet it appeared Kadowaki remembered. Amane always had a shopping bag, and did not intend for Kadowaki to owe him a favor.\n“…Anyway Kadowaki. You done eating all the valentine chocolates?”\nAmane asked Kadowaki, partially to hide his embarrassment from being thanked so openly, and partly to answer his own doubt. Kadowaki then gave a grim look.\n“Ah…don’t mention it to others, okay? I ate all the ones that were bought.”\n“You didn’t eat the handmade ones?”\n“…The handmade ones? Well…hmm, they did put in effort, but.”\n“They aren’t delicious?”\n“No, some added hair, and some added stuff that obviously should not be inside chocolates.”\n“What sorcery is this…?”\nIt was understandable if they were accidentally mixed in. From Kadowaki’s tone however, it seemed to have happened a few times, clearly deliberately.\nAmane had an impression that certain spells of the past included body parts. If the same idea was applied for chocolates, it might be unbearable to those who were forced to eat them.\n“I do receive some complimentary ones too…this always happens to me, and it’s scary, so I always insisted not to accept handmade stuff. People still give them to me though, so I would accept them before returning. As for those who disguised it as bought stuff though, I’d just have to say sorry…I guess.”\nI can’t accept handmade stuff when so many have weird things mixed in.\nKadowaki muttered away with a sad, hopeless face. Amane too had to sympathize.\n“…Being a popular guy sure is tough huh?”\n“It’s unbearable how I’m still envied because of this…not like I want to be the popular one. I’d rather not be popular than suffer through this.”\n“Man, I agree.”\n“It’s scary right? Smiling girls giving me sweets and food with strange stuff mixed in them?\nAmane nodded as it was really reasonable.\nTypically, a girl’s handmade item was really valuable, but it represented fear to Kadowaki. It was pitiful how many times he experienced what was supposedly a rare event.\n“Maybe the best solution is to get someone, so that nobody will chase after me…but I’m scared that she’ll get bullied.”\n“…Envy sure is scary.”\n“Haaa…”\nKadowaki seemed to be at wits end as he dropped his shoulders. It appeared he was completely worn out.\nHis standing posture really invoked much sympathy, so Amane grabbed a large packet of potato sticks from a nearby crane machine, and gave it to him.\n“Well…you can look for Itsuki and me if you need to talk. Eat up. Cheer yourself up.”\n“Thanks for that…it’s tough…”\nKadowaki clearly looked frustrated, and Amane truly felt that it was not easy being popular, nor was it something to be simply happy about.",

      "content": "On this day, Mahiru was wearing an apron, her hair was tired in a bun as she welcomed him home.\nShe would usually tie her hair when cooking, and as expected of a girl, she would sometimes tie it in a ponytail, or a bun like this. She would seek practicality as much as cuteness.\nIt appeared she was done cooking dinner. When Amane returned home, she gave a look of relief.\nAmane did inform her that he would be a little late, but it seemed Mahiru was still worried. Amane was late as he just had coffee with Kadowaki, and heard that latter’s troubles. It appeared Mahiru was worried about Amane being late.\n“Welcome back, Amane-kun…that bag is?”\n“Went to the game center. Well, here’s my prize.”\nAmane brought out a few things other than the bunny doll, and the large bag was stuffed to the brim. It seemed Mahiru too could tell how packed it was.\n“…That is quite a lot.”\n“Just spent money for two cafeteria set meals.”\n“Erm, what is inside?”\n“I’m hungry. We’ll talk later.”\nHe could give it to Mahiru at this point, but he wanted to enjoy her reaction slowly, so he decided to leave it be.\nAlso, he was really hurry, and wanted to have her dinner early.\n“Do wash your hands and change clothes then. Do not forget to rinse your mouth too. I shall serve dinner in the meantime.”\n“Got it.”\nAmane would usually do so even without her saying that, but he was happy about how worried and concerned she was for him.\nWhile thinking that Mahiru was acting like his mother, he never said it out, and went to the washroom as Mahiru had told him to.\n“…What is with this many items?”\nAfter dinner, Mahiru showed her curiosity as she glanced aside at the prizes next to the sofa, asking Amane.\n“Hm? Dolls.”\nAmane did not intend to hide the spoils from her, so he put the bag on his knees, and tore the tape as he answered.\n“Dolls?”\n“You like them, right?”\n“Y-yes, I do.”\n“There’s quite a lot, I feel you’ll really like them, so I got them. Here.”\nThe biggest prize for the day was probably the bunny doll about the size of the bear.\nIt was rather large, but Amane was rather proud of himself as he only used a coin.\nHe lifted the white fur, round eyed bunny, and put it on Mahiru’s lap.\nHe was unsure what character it was, but he had a feeling Mahiru would like it, so he grabbed it. However, Mahiru merely stared at the bunny on her lap.\n“You dislike bunnies?”\n“…It is cute.”\n“That’s good.”\nMahiru embraced the bunny doll with both hands, and brought it to her face, just as she usually embraced the cushion. For a moment, Amane had the urge to frisk his cellphone, but he decided not to.\nOnce he saw her smile, he captured the sight in his ind as he rummaged for the other dolls inside the bountiful bag.\n“And we have a cat and a dog.”\nThe crane arms were rather powerful, and thus he could capture most of the items cheaply. He caught a lot of things Mahiru might like.\nHe put a beige and white colored kitten doll that had a strange resemblance to Mahiru, along with a shiba dog mascot. Mahiru then clearly showed a perturbed look.\n“E-erm, so many…?”\n“Will that cause you trouble?”\n“Not at all! I have no decorations at home, and they are all cute. I am happy.”\n“That’s good.”\nThe sight of Mahiru being surrounded by various dolls was as cute as Amane had imagined.\nMahiru had yet to put the bunny down as she stared at the cat and dog excitedly, seemingly at a loss of which to choice.\nAmane smiled at her as he found her expression comforting. Mahiru seemed to have noticed Amane’s stare as her face turned red, before covering half her face with the bunny.\nThe bunny’s white, and Mahiru’s reddened face was obvious.\nOne could see her moist eyes through the gap between the bunny ears. Amane continued to stare at Mahiru, as the sight of her was strangely alluring and cute.\nMahiru might have had enough, for she clung her head onto Amane’s elbow, and buried her face. Or rather, she was slamming her head on Amane, ostensibly throwing a tantrum.\nRather than slamming, she was just giving him a little headbutt, and it did not hurt.\n“…Please do not laugh.”\n“I’m not.”\n“You are. You are laughing at how childish I am.”\n“I’m not laughing at that. I just find you cute.”\n“…Are you not laughing at me?”\n“Ah.”\nAh busted.\nAmane tried to pass it off by laughing. Mahiru started slapping Amane’s thighs, and Amane patted her head to coax her.\nFinally, Mahiru calmed down. Amane made sure not to let the cat out of the bag as he laughed.\n“…It feels like you are making fun of me.”\n“You are thinking too much.”\n“…I shall let you off today.”\nMahiru continued to pout unhappily. Amane did not point out how her face and words were completely different.\nHe looked at the kitten on her lap and the bunny in her clutches, and thought,\nsome fusion we have here.\nHe patted her for a while, and then, she lifted her face.\nHer reddened cheeks showed no change, but her eyes looked displeased in a manner different from before.\n“…I have always received things from you.”\nIt appeared she was worried about receiving too much.\n“I’m giving them to you out of my own will. You don’t have you worry.”\n“But I have received many things from you. Gifts, concern, warmth, mood, everything.”\n“It’s just a gift from me. You don’t have to worry.”\nAmane did not hope to be repaid, and only did so to make Mahiru happy.\nIt might sound like Mahiru’s happiness would be his reward, but ultimately, he did so out of his own satisfaction and hopes. There was nothing Mahiru needed to worry about.\nIt appeared Mahiru was still worried about receiving too much from Amane.\nInstead, Amane had received too much care from her, and no amount of gratitude from him would suffice.\n“I wish to give you something back.”\n“You’re really stubborn…well, if you insist, I can accept it.”\n“I can give you anything, as long as it is what I can do.”\nAmane disliked this suggestion, for he felt she could do anything. Naturally however, he could not ask her to do something overboard.\nYet if he did not ask for anything, Mahiru would be devastated.\n“How about pudding?”\nSo Amane happily suggested something she would not be burdened with.\n“…Pudding, is it?”\n“A pudding with lots of eggs. I want to try some from you.”\n“Is it not to save money?”\n“No way. I want it because it’s your pudding.”\nAmane was not particularly fond of sweets, but custard was an exception.\nHe liked pudding, and cream puffs with custard cream. Anything made by Mahiru would surely be delicious.\nOf course, he would desire to eat the handmade cooking of a girl he likes.\nOnce he made this earnest request, Mahiru looked up at him, and nodded.\n“…I shall do so on the next rest day. More eggs, and harder, I suppose?”\n“Yes.”\n“I shall make delicious pudding, definitely.”\n“You don’t have to be so pumped up.”\n“I want to do this.”\n“I see.”\nFor some reason, Mahiru showed some meaningless motivation and determination. Amane did not think she needed to be so determined, but he had nothing to complain about since he could have some delicious pudding.\nHe patted her head again, wanting to cheer her on. Mahiru apprehensively hid her lips behind the bunny head.",

      "content": "Most puddings contained lots of cream that would melt in the mouth, and while they were delicious, Amane preferred the harder ones with lots of eggs, the type to not break even with a scoop.\nThe pudding maintained the original taste of eggs, along with a rich creamy taste, but thanks to the slightly bitter caramel, the slightly excessive sweetness was not overbearing.\nInstead, the taste was refreshing, and tempted him into eating it over and over again.\nAmane did not really have a fondness for sweets, but Mahiru’s homemade pudding completely captivated him. In a blink, the pudding on the plate was gone.\n“Woah, it’s delicious.”\n“Thank you for the compliment. It is my honor.”\nThe pudding was served after dinner. Amane finished it, and it was not enough, so he had another one.\nHe did not really have much appetite for a high school boy, but Mahiru’s homemade pudding was something he could keep eating despite being full.\nHe touched his belly as he felt much more satisfied than the servings of pudding, his delight clearly shown on his face.\n“You really can do anything.”\n“I was taught everything after all.”\nMahiru did not seem proud of it, but she really could cook various dishes, sometimes even making dishes Amane did not know of.\nOf course, they were delicious and not overbearing. It was wonderful that someone like Mahiru could stay beside him and cook for him.\n“But seriously, thanks to you, I’m really blessed.”\n“…Blessed?”\n“Yeah. I get to eat such delicious food every day. How can I not be considered blessed? This is my daily enjoyment.”\nMahiru’s cooking was half of his daily joy, and he could forget most of his unhappiness by rounding off the day with Mahiru’s cooking.\nHe truly was blessed to have her cooking every day, but she did not realize it much. She probably would not have realized the value of her cooking if Amane did not lavish praise on her.\nAlso, it was etiquette to praise delicious food. He should convey his thoughts honestly.\n“…I-I see.”\nMahiru blushed a little when faced with this honest praise, and shriveled back.\n“…I am happy to be praised by you, Amane-kun.”\n“I’ll praise you however much you want if I can. Is my praise for your delicious cooking not enough? I can go into more details if you want.”\nIt was said that disagreements between husband and wife were often because they forgot to thank each other.\nAmane and Mahiru were not husband and wife, but Amane was always the one to receive food, and could never forget to thank her. The taste too was sufficient motivation for him to thank, so if Mahiru wanted to listen, Amane was willing to go into the details.\nHowever, Mahiru shook her head in refusal.\n“N-no need for that…I may die.”\n“You’re overexaggerating.”\n“I am not overexaggerating. This much is enough.”\n“Really? But I will have to rely on your cooking every day, so I better thank you. Thanks for everything till this point.”\nAmane’s food was all due to Mahiru, so he remained grateful, and would never forget to repay her. It was all thanks to her.\nWithout Mahiru, Amane would continue to remain a rotten man. He hoped Mahiru would continue to stay alongside him; if he was any greedier, perhaps forever.\nHe smiled with utter graciousness, and Mahiru shivered like a vibrating smartphone before she stood up.\n“…Amane-kun no baka.”\nFor some reason, Mahiru called him an idiot with a cute voice, took the dishesand went to wash them. Amane followed her, and put his cutlery in the basin.\nIt was too sudden, and Amane was confused, thinking that Mahiru did not have to cover for his washing duty, so he grabbed her elbow. She suddenly turned towards him.\nMahiru was blushing more than before, and it intensified after she saw Amane’s face, which left the latter restless.\n“…I-I’ll handle these. Wait for me at the sofa. Okay?”\nAmane patted Mahiru’s head, and chased her out of the kitchen. Mahiru murmured something, and hurried towards the sofa, burying herself into it.\nSeeing how unusually restless Mahiru was, Amane blinked away.\nHe then recalled her prior blushing face, and began washing the dishes with cold water to cool his head down.",

      "content": "“Itsuki, Fujimiya, let’s eat.”\nIt was noon break at school, and Amane was about to eat with Itsuki as usual, only to hear a familiar voice.\nKadowaki had a hand raised, showing the usual hearty, genial smile.\nIt appeared that Kadowaki took a liking to Amane after the conversation days ago, and would come to talk from time to time. While they merely greeted each other before this, it appeared something was different on this day, for he dropped by with wallet in hand.\n“I’m fine with that…”\n“Itsuki’s fine with that, right?”\n“How are you sure that I won’t refuse you? Well, doesn’t matter now. It’s surprising to see you do this.”\nItsuki might have been surprised by this, since Kadowaki hardly interacted with Amane. The latter might be the most surprised however.\n“Amane, Yuuta’s emotionally attached to you or something?”\n“Emotionally attached…I’m not a dog.”\n“Yuuta’s actually like a dog. Once he trusts you and gets closer, he’ll wag his tail or something. He’s like a golden retriever.”\n“Don’t call me a dog so openly.”\nKadowaki retorted at Itsuki, but Amane certainly agreed that he had the vibe of a golden retriever. Amane started to laugh.\nKadowaki looked a little miffed when he saw Amane’s shoulders shaking. He appeared to be pouting, rather than his mood actually being ruined.\n“Don’t laugh, Fujimiya.”\n“O-oh, sorry.”\n“You think so too huh, Amane?”\n“I just thought that since you mentioned it…”\n“Well, you’re still the way you are, Fujimiya. I just want to get along since I think you’re a good guy.”\n“Yep, it’s good that more people know about Amane’s good points. Come ask me.”\n“Who do you think you are?”\nKadowaki retorted at Itsuki, who slapped his chest proudly. He walked over, exchanged looks with Amane, and showed a dazzling smile.\nAny girl would be conquered by him if he showed that smile. All Amane could do was to show a wry smile.\n“…Can I ask something?”\n“Hm?”\n“Is it really alright for you to be with an ordinary guy like me? It doesn’t benefit you, right?”\nKadowaki might had interest in Amane, and just wanted to be a friend, but Amane did not think there was no benefit to Kadowaki doing this.\nHe had so many friends, so why did he seek out Amane to be a friend, of all people?\nOf course, Amame knew that people did not necessarily make friends by simply weighing pros and cons. He too made friends through instinctual feelings, yet he did not understand why Kadowaki chose him.\nKadowaki was stunned to hear Amane’s words, and gave an incredulous look.\n“You didn’t make friends by weighing pros and cons, right?”\n“You’re right.”\n“Isn’t that alright? I’m talking to you because I want to get along.”\nKadowaki’s smile remained like the clear skies, and narrowed his eyes.\n“…Oh.”\n“Yep. It’s a good thing to build relationships.”\nItsuki grinned away as he said this, and quickly turned his eyes elsewhere.\nOver there was Chitose, who was beaming away, “Mahirun’s really cute after all.” hugging Mahiru, who just let her be.\nIt was normal to see Chitose go for some skinship, and everyone in class might have been used to it, for they were staring at this scene between girls, smiling, or looking jealous.\nAmane saw that they were already used to it, yet Itsuki showed a wry smile at their tomfoolery.\n“What?”\n“Nothing.”\nItsuki smiled away as he tried to misdirect them, leading them towards the cafeteria. Amane and Kadowaki too followed suit.\n“I have decided.”\nThey returned home, had dinner, and Mahiru suddenly said these words. Amane blinked in surprise.\n“What’s with you out of a sudden.”\n“I had enough.”\n“O-okay. I don’t understand, but since you’ve been enduring, I think it’s fine for you not to.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had made up her mind about something, but Amane did not understand what exactly she was referring to.\nDespite that, she did work hard, could endure, and was never stubborn. Since she said she had enough, Amane would accept that, and even take the initiative in praising her.\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n“Make it count.”\n“What are you intending to do…?”\n“…Do you really want to know?”\n“Of course.”\n“You will not be angry?”\n“Are you going to tick me off or something?”\nJudging from the tone, it appeared to be related to Amane, so he had to ask.\nNaturally, Mahiru would never do anything to hurt others, and Amane never had to worry about this. However, what was she intending to do?\nHe stared at her for quite some time, and her face was flushed, probably out of embarrassment, her index fingers stick onto each other as she fidgeted, looking apprehensive.\n“…I want to get along with you at school, Amane-kun.”\nShe probably was referring to them acting as strangers at school.\n“Say.”\n“It feels like I am the abandoned one.”\n“Ugh.”\nAmane’s heart weakened when he saw Mahiru say with a crestfallen look.\nBack then, Amane would chat with Chitose as normal, so he could at least communicate with someone who knew both Amane and Mahiru. He really could not talk with Mahiru directly. Whenever Chitose came to talk to Itsuki, Mahiru would be left behind.\nMahiru had friends in her class, but they never got along with her as much as Chitose did, and surely she would feel lonely. Of course, this loneliness was hidden in the angel’s smile, but Amane was sufficiently acquainted with Mahiru to determine it.\nAmane understood this, and hoped to do something for her, but it was not something he could easily nod and agree.\n“…But honestly, won’t it be unnatural for the Angel to suddenly get friendly with us plain looking people?”\n“I have thought about it, and I have my solution.”\n“You thought about?”\n“Of course…you look down on yourself more than I do. Your self-denial is a huge problem. I shall do my best to ensure you gain confidence.”\n“Seriously, what are you thinking…”\nAmane noticed how Mahiru was scared of being alone, but he never expected Mahiru to enthusiastic involve herself with him.\nThis sense of closeness was something they could not imagine at first, and he did not know whether to be elated or concerned.\n“…Are you not willing to talk to me at school…?”\n“Not that I dislike it, but someone like me…”\n“Amane-kun.”\nMahiru interrupted by calling his name. She sounded stern, as though reproaching.\n“Do not say ‘someone like me’.”\nYou always have a habit of belittling yourself, Amane-kun.\nShe seemed infuriated as she poked her index finger at his nose.\n“If you say that next time…eh, I shall, continue to point.”\n“Point?”\n“I shall point it out, and as punishment, I shall pat your head until I am satisfied.”\n“That’s a reward, right…?”\n“Eh?”\n“Ah.”\nAmane accidentally blurted, and his face twitched.\nIt was a reward to receive Mahiru’s headpat, but he should not have blurted it out.\nFor once Mahiru saw Amane freeze, her face reddened, and she was flustered.\nShe never expected her punishment to be a reward. An overly cute punishment would not be a punishment, yet it was so like Mahiru.\nAmane too stopped talking as he had just stated his true thoughts, or rather, his desire. Silence loomed.\nThey fidgeted hastily, and their eyes wavered. Mahiru then seemed to have made up her mind as she opened her arms towards Amane.\n“…Y-you’re doing this?”\nShe probably wanted him to enter her clutches, to headpat him.\nHis head would overheat if he did so, so he did not. While the proposal piqued his desire greatly, Mahiru herself did not have any guilty thoughts, and had no intention of suspecting Amane of anything. It would be inappropriate for him to remain in close contact with such guilty thoughts.\nHe gulped, but he never followed through, “Please allow me to refuse.” he shook his head, and spoke formally.\nHe really could not enjoy the softness with a nonchalant look.\n“Don’t do that to a guy. If you want, go look for Chitose.”\n“…I do think Chitose-san is more dangerous, you know?”\n“If she sexually harasses you, just beat her. If I’m going to do anything perverted, beat me all you want.”\n“I will not doubt you since you are able to say so. A-anyway, I shall headpat you with all my might the next time you say so.”\nUltimately, it appeared Mahiru had no intention of changing the punishment. Amane noticed that if he was punished, his shame and sanity would be at risk, so he swore to himself never to belittle himself before her.",

      "content": "“Amane~, let’s eat together today~”\nAmane saw Chitose leer away as she brought Mahiru over, and his face twitched when he recalled Mahiru’s words days ago,\nI have my solution.\nIt was true however that Chitose could to bring Mahiru along under the pretext of eating together with Itsuki. There would be some jealousy around them, but that should not be cause for suspicion.\nMahiru was pulled over by the hand, showing her usual angelic self with a smile on her face.\nIt might have been Amane’s imagination, but she seemed delighted to have accomplished her goal, and he had the urge to cup his head.\n“Ah, do I sit here?”\n“Please do not say so. It is my suggestion to sit with you, please do not mind.”\nYou cannot run away.\nMahiru was clearly implying so.\nChitose had agreed to do this with Mahiru…or rather, Amane had the feeling that it was Chitose’s idea. He glared at Chitose, who was grinning, or rather, leering away, yet she tried to whistle elsewhere.\nItsuki might have been informed by Mahiru, or perhaps he was delighted to be able to eat with Chitose, “Why don’t we eat together?” He gave the usual hearty smile.\nWhile Amane had agreed to it days ago, the envious looks around them had him on tenterhooks.\n“Eh, you’re intending to have lunch together, Shirakawa-san and Shiina-san?”\nIt appeared Kadowaki too wanted to join in, and his sudden appearance had Amane’s gut wincing slightly.\n“I do have such intentions.”\n“I see. That makes things interesting, huh?”\nKadowaki noted nonchalantly, but Amane did not think it was an appropriate time for things to get interesting.\nKadowaki did not look opposed to this, and instead, was merely surprised that Mahiru would be joining them for lunch.\nAmane had nowhere to escape.\n“…Just give up Amane. You’re surrounded.”\nItsuki whispered softly such that Kadowaki could not hear, and Amane could only let out a long, lethargic sigh.\n“You brought a bento, Mahiru-san?”\nAmane and Itsuki usually ate at the cafeteria, so Mahiru and Chitose, who usually ate at the classroom, went along.\nThe boys bought their lunch, sat down at their usual seats, and Kadowaki noticed Mahiru brought a bento.\nJust to note, Mahiru was seated directly opposite Amane. Chitose had prompted Mahiru to sit there, giving Amane no chance to escape.\n“Nn, it is dinner leftovers though.”\nPart of the dinner leftovers were used to make Amane’s breakfast, and sometimes, Mahiru would take some for her bento, which she probably did on this day. In fact, the bento box was filled with teriyaki chicken balls from yesterday’s dinner.\n“Eh? You made it?”\n“Yes. It is not something impressive however.”\n“You shouldn’t lie, Mahirun~ Aren’t you good at cooking?”\n“How about you take cooking lessons from Shiina-san, Chii?”\n“You’re cruel, Ikkun.”\n“Shiina-san, you just need to teach Chii how to flavor. She can cook at least…but she’ll always make the flavors weird.”\nChitose was in no way incapable of cooking, but she always had the urge to try out new, fancy flavors, and ended up with a whack sense of taste.\nWill be great if she doesn’t have such a habit\n, even Itsuki too often commented.\n“Mahirun, hold a personal cooking class with me~ I’ll get Amane to taste for poison.”\n“Hey, what do you mean poison!? That’ll cause Shiina trouble out of a sudden, right?”\n“Nn, I do not think it is a hassle. It does sound interesting to cook with Chitose-san.”\n“Wahhh I love you Mahirun! Looking forward to it~! Make sure you have time for this, Amane~!”\nChitose sat next to Mahiru, and clung onto the latter with a beaming face.\nMahiru too smiled as she accepted this outcome. Amane in turn noted how they were on such good terms―only to realize something.\nDid I get invited out for a date in front of everyone?\nAmane looked towards Chitose, who continued to chat happily with Mahiru. He had no idea if it was Chitose’s trap, or just a coincidence.\nHowever, all the peers around them had pricked their eyes, and when Amane met them in the eyes, there was an unspeakable jealousy from them, which caused his face to cringe.\n“Say Itsuki.”\n“Hm?”\n“I feel like I’m going to get slaughtered. Is this really alright?”\n“It’s fine. Sorta.”\nAmane really could not calm down when he was glared at by Mahiru’s fans, the boys who hoped to woo her.\nThey did not unleash any murderous intent towards Amane, since it was Chitose who started it. It would be scary if Mahiru herself said anything after they got along openly. “Why him…” that would be the first thing that would think,\n“Isn’t that fine, Fujimiya?”\n“…I wouldn’t be so envied if I’m like you.”\nIf it had been Kadowaki, a multi-talented handsome chap who was a match for Mahiru, the others would know their place and retreat no matter how jealous they might appear.\n“I’m rather jealous of you though, Fujimiya.”\n“What’s there to be jealous?”\n“Lots of it.”\nKadowaki gave a wry smile as his words hinted at something, but Amane had no idea what it was.\n“Well, I can somewhat understand what Yuuta’s thinking.”\n“Seriously?”\n“People often have treasures they don’t know of, and desire things they can never get. Chii often has things she can’t get.”\n“Like?”\n“Like something Shiina-san has that Chii doesn’t…”\n“You’re thinking something weird there right, Ikkun?”\nIt appeared Chitose heard Itsuki’s words, for her face had a bright smile, but there was no smile in her eyes.\nAmane sensed that Itsuki had just stepped on a landmine, and watched their intimate interaction unfold, before glancing towards Mahiru.\nMahiru looked a little confused when Itsuki and Chitose started their lovers’ spat, but once her eyes met Amane, she smiled.\nShown in those eyes were not the angelic smile, but a smile more akin to the bashful one at home, and Amane too averted his eyes bashfully.",

      "content": "“Were you shocked?”\nAmane saw Mahiru give an impish smile at his own place, and smiled wryly.\n“More than shocked, I want to say, you’re really enthusiastic.”\n“Recently, I am starting to realize that I have to be a little forceful towards you, Amane-kun.”\n“Sorta.”\nMahiru was so enthusiastic. for she knew Amane would try to run away. However, he never could as there was a perimeter around him.\nAmane was shocked as he never expected Mahiru to take the initiative. He was relieved for the time being, for she merely talked to him, and not enact any skinship.\nIf Mahiru did that innocent skinship as she would do at his house without any self-aware, blades of jealousy would be flying at Amane. Mahiru probably relied on Amane as she found him most reliable, but the people around them might not feel this way.\n“I shall work hard without affecting your life, Amane-kun. If anything happens, please tell me.”\nMahiru knew of the effect she had, and it appeared she would try not to approach Amane too suddenly.\nAmane felt that she was being too sudden, but he remained silent.\n“I’m fine for now, though there are some envious looks.”\n“I see. Erm…do you dislike i-it if I talk to you at school…?”\nIt seemed she was still concerned about Amane’s initial unwillingness.\n“Well, not really. I know you’re scared of loneliness. I can’t just leave my friend aside, and you’re tired too, right, Mahiru?”\n“…Friend.”\n“No, nothing.”\nAmane was curious to know why Mahiru’s face changed from uneasiness to displeasure, but it appeared she had no intention to talk.\nMahiru turned her head aside, and Amane, having sensed that her mood was ruined, started to pat her head.\n“…Please do not think that you can solve everything with headpats.”\n“Nope, but I think you will be happy.”\n“It is the case…but please do not try to fool others with this.”\n“I won’t do this to anyone other than you…”\nUltimately, the only girl Amane was on good terms with was Chitose, but there was no way he could do that to her, and he did not think she would be happy.\nAlso, Amane would only do that to Mahiru, and did not want to do so to anyone else. He wanted to dote on Mahiru, and never planned to do so to anyone else.\nWhile he was serious in what he just said, Mahiru had her head lowered as she whacked Amane with the cushion. It appeared those words did not improve her mood.\nAmane thought it might be good to stop, and did so, but Mahiru headbutted his elbow.\nIt did not hurt at all, but he started to feel skeptical, for Mahiru had been aggressive recently.\n“…Amane-kun no baka.”\n“What now?”\n“How hard do I have to work…”\n“I don’t understand what you’re saying, but you’ll be worn out if you work too hard, so keep it in moderation…”\n“This is something I can only achieve by working hard.”\nMahiru lifted her head towards Amane, her vengeful eyes looking beyond his shoulder, yet bashful and somewhat expectant.\nThe moist eyes were up close, and Amane’s eyes started to waver.\n“So, what do you want me to do for now, Mahiru?”\n“…First, continue with the headpats.”\nThe word ‘first’ would imply that she had other things she wanted him to do, but it appeared she had no requests for the time being, so Amane again patted Mahiru on the head, trying his best to coax her.",

      "content": "“It’s going to be Golden Week soon.”\nAmane muttered as he stared at the calendar on the shelf.\nHe was busy with various things during April, as it was the start of their school year. April was ending by the time he realized. Students and working adults alike would look forward to this Golden Week, which was right around the corner.\nAmane did not dislike studying. He did not find it tough, no matter how troublesome it might seem. Thus, he was not particularly happy about Golden Week.\nThe only thought he had was that he had more time to relax.\nUnlike last year’s, Amane would not be too bored, for he had Mahiru next to him.\nOne day was taken away however when Chitose arranged for a “poison taste test with Mahiru’s cooking class”. It would be ridiculously troublesome rather than boring.\n“Another long vacation…”\n“Hm? You dislike it?”\n“Not really. I just don’t know how to spend the time.”\nIt appeared Mahiru was the same.\nNeither of them liked to go out, so they never had any plans.\n“I’m glad to have a break though. Means that I have nothing to do.”\nAmane’s studies were still decent as he never scrimped on his preparations and revisions. He did not want to spend his vacation studying.\nHe had no plan in particular when it came to his hobbies of strolling and reading. He would only do so in the spur of the moment, and never did plan for them. The same for his games. He really had no plans.\n“…Amane-kun, are you free?”\n“I’m rather bored”\nAt this point, his only plans were to taste test for poison, and go for a karaoke session with Itsuki and Kadowaki. He had a lot of free days in this one week vacation.\nLet’s just relax at home.\nHe muttered to himself, only to find Mahiru looking up at him unflinchingly.\n“What is it?”\nIt appeared Mahiru had something to say, and once his eyes met hers, she reached her hand for the cellphone on the table.\nOr rather, the phone cover.\nHer phone cover was a flip case, and it had slots for stuff like cards. She pulled out a little plastic bag with a zipper, which contained several folded pieces of paper. She took one out, and showed it to Amane.\nIt was not something so long ago to be nostalgic about. It was the ‘‘I’ll do anything you say coupon’ Amane gave her more than a month ago.\nShe handed over the coupon, which had the bear illustration Amane felt he drew decently. After that, she looked up at him unflinchingly.\n“May I use it?”\n“Give your command.”\n“…I want to spend one day with you during Golden Week, Amane-kun. I want to go shopping, to play, and so on.”\nIs that fine?\nMahiru asked apprehensively, and Amane gave a wry smile.\n“No seriously, even without that, I’ll go shopping with you if you give me a holler.”\nAmane probably had to accompany Mahiru in that getup, but he was willing to do so as long as she requested. He felt she did not need to use the coupon.\nYou don’t have to use your request on this little thing,\nso he chuckled, but Mahiru shook her head with a serious look.\n“I shall use it…promise that you will do everything I ask of you on that day.”\n“Well, i-f you say so. What do you want me to do though…”\n“…C-carry some bags.”\n“Alright alright I’ll listen to you.”\nHow heavy is the stuff going to be?\nHe felt like retorting, but he nodded since she said so much.\nMahiru disliked going out, but she probably had some occasional urges to go out and enjoy herself. Amane felt that if possible, he would accompany her no matter how unwilling she might be.\nAfter all, he too was bored.\nHe thought it would be a bad thing of rumors of that man showed up again, but it would be stupid of him to not go anywhere if he was scared of this little thing.\n“So, where are we going?”\n“Erm, I-I have not decided.”\n“So you haven’t decided.”\n“…Because, I do not know, what places you do like.”\n“Eh, me?”\n“…We have the opportunity to go out together, and I want to go to a place we can both enjoy.”\nCan we?\nNobody can ever reject her when she tugged at his sleeve and asked while looking up.\nGrr.\nAmane felt suffocated. He looked around, combed his hair up, and sighed.\n“…Well, I intend to go along with you anyway. Hm, in that case, there’s a place I want to go to.”\nIt was an unbearable place to go alone, but Amane wanted to visit it.\n“Where?”\n“Don’t laugh at me.”\n“I will not.”\n“…A cat cafe.”\nYes, a cat cafe with lots of kittens.\nAmane liked animals, but he could not raise any in his apartment, so he could only read the magazines or see others raise them.\nThe surrounding stares would be unbearable if he entered the cafe alone as a boy, so he could not.\nWith Mahiru around, Amane did not have to worry about the stares from others. There would be another kind of stares, but he felt he should be able to relax.\nAlso, the sight of Mahiru playing with the cats would surely be cute, so he thought, but obviously, he could not voice it out.\n“…E-erm, if the two of us, go together, it won’t be that awkward. Can we?”\n“O-of course! Then, erm…let us go together.”\n“…Oh.”\nAmane was grateful and yet embarrassed by Mahiru’s agreement.\nHe felt his cheeks searing, but he managed to endure it. Once he saw Mahiru looking unconfident, he smiled at her.\n“So what are we doing after that?”\n“After that, we will go shopping together…ah, I want to go to a game center. I have never been there before.”\nAs expected, the princess-like Mahiru was interested in a game center, as she had never been there before. In that case, he should bring her there and show her how it was like.\nThe dolls she liked might be in stock again, and she would be happy to catch them together with him.\n“Let’s go there then. Cat cafe, food, shopping, game center. Pretty much.”\n“Yes.”\nAmane heaved a sigh of relief as they had decided on the schedule to a certain extent. Mahiru lifted her head, her face turned towards him.\n“I am really looking forward to it.”\nAmane nearly lost his breath once he saw the shyness borne from her overwhelming happiness.\n“I wish for the holidays to arrive soon.”\nMahiru whispered, sounding as though she was really looking forward to go out. With a sweet smile, she happily embraced the cushion.\nAmane stared blankly at her smile, and then felt his heart pound wildly. “…Yeah.” he answered hoarsely.\nThe Angel’s sudden attack was very bad for the heart.",

      "content": "“Mahirun’s first cooking class~!”\nIt sounded like there was a BGM of some cooking show lasting a few minutes when Chitose declared that, and Amane never concealed his disdain as he looked at her.\nThey had Mahiru’s cooking lesson on the first day of Golden Week, at Amane’s place.\nThe reason was that it was a place convenient for Mahiru and Chitose to gather, and a place Amane could enter.\nChitose had her parents around, and she could not make much noise. Amane himself was unwilling to enter Mahiru’s place. The only choice left was his place.\n“Yay~” Chitose got agitated as she put on the apron. Mahiru smiled wryly as she put on her apron.\n“Please welcome our teacher for the day Mahiru Shiina-san!”\n“Like hell you’re welcomed. You’re the one who got invited here.”\n“And here we have our poison…guest, I invited. The very picky eater Amane Fujimiya-san!”\n“Shut up. This is my house anyway.”\n“You’re ruining the mood.”\nEarly in the morning, Amane was not as lively as Chitose.\nIt was just past 9am.\nEveryone chose this time, so that they could have lunch after the cooking class ended.\nThe timing itself was not an issue, but Amane had difficulty dealing with Chitose’s upbeat mood as he had just woken up.\n“…Sorry. It is early in the morning.”\n“No no it’s fine. I get to eat your cooking after all. More important, watch out for Chitose and make sure she doesn’t add in weird stuff.”\n“You really distrust me, huh?”\n“Did you forget what you did for Valentine’s?”\nAmane could never forget her pranking him with that chocolate.\nOf course, the normal ones were fine, but that the jackpot and the eccentric flavors certainly were so shocking, Amane had vivid memories of them.\nChitose said they were edible, so her taste buds were not too reliable.\n“Ahaha, it’s a prank after all. I should be fine if I cook normally, probably.”\n“That probably at the end makes me worry, okay. Idiot…please make something I can eat.”\n“Okay, got it.”\nLeave it to me~\nChitose rolled her sleeves as she said confidently. Amane was unnerved by her, but he believed that Mahiru should be able to sort her out, so he decided to watch them silently.\nMahiru would never compromise on whatever was to be served for consumption. Since it was a cooking class, she would devote herself to cook normal food. They should be fine.\nShe led Chitose into the kitchen she was well familiar with. The dishes’ names were probably the menu for the day\nJust to note, they were going to make quiche with salad, prawn bisque, and the remainder to be sauteed. It probably was to satisfy how Amane wanted to eat his prawns.\nIt probably would not be weird in any way, but Amane worried that Chitose might add strange stuff into the quiche.\n“…I have a feeling someone has been doubting me…”\nChitose gave a displeased look, for she probably noticed Amane’s skeptical look. Amane then looked away from her, and sat on the sofa.\nTo be honest, Amane had nothing to do. He was invited here as the poison tester…his own house.\nAmane himself could cook if Mahiru was helping, but it was Chitose’s turn to cook. Amane could not move as Mahiru had asked him to to sit.\nThus, Amane was bored.\nHe looked towards the kitchen, as saw the two girls in aprons talk intimately as they began cooking.\nThey had different body sizes, but they were pretty girls, and they were in his house, cooking.\nAny boy will find it a tantalizing proposition,\nso he thought as he listlessly looked over at them.\nWill that prankster of a cat do anything?\nOnce again, he was griped by uneasiness, but as he was really bored, he slowly closed his eyes.\nIt would take a few hours, and he should be fine with a little nap. After all, it was his house, and the only one who would scold him…was Mahiru.\nHaaa.\nAmane yawned, and leaned his body onto the sofa.",

      "content": "By the time he realized it, Amane had a whiff of sweet scent.\nIt was a familiar scent, one unspeakably sweet, like milk and flowers. It was a comforting smell, and Amane unwittingly inhaled lots of it.\nIn his hazy consciousness, he brought his face close to the source of that scent, and felt a warm, soft feeling.\nThe feeling of skin was comfortable to feel. Amane brought his face close to enjoy it, only to feel it shaking.\n“…E-erm, it is very itchy…”\nHe heard a perturbed soft voice next to him, and felt his legs slapped on.\nHis hazy consciousness started to awaken as he opened his heavy eyelids…the silky milky color appeared in his eyes.\nHe looked up timidly, and within inches was Mahiru’s perturbed, bashful face.\n“…Mahiru?”\n“Yes.”\n“…Good morning.”\n“Good morning…but it is now noon.”\nAmane had a look at the digital clock on the shelf. It was past noon.\nHe realized he had slept for a long time, but he had no idea why Mahiru was next to him.\n“I sat next to you, and you leaned over.”\nMahiru answered as though she was answering his question, and her face reddened slightly.\nIt seemed Amane had buried his face near Mahiru’s shoulder. Her collar was a little opened, which exposed some skin.\nThis might have been a case of sexual harassment, so Amane hoped she would scold him if she got angry. She instead lowered her eyes bashfully.\nHe hoped she would be angry, but given her reaction, he was left troubled. He felt like he was forgiven, and it did not feel relieving to him.\n“Erm, sorry for making your uncomfortable.”\n“No-not at all!”\n“I think Mahirun’s seeing it as ‘Amane-kun’s sleepy and fawning over me’.”\n“Chitose-san!”\nChitose appeared to be watching from afar, and she was grinning, or rather, leering as she quipped, leaving Mahiru’s face all the redder.\n“Say, when did you two start calling each other by name?”\n“…Chitose.”\n“Don’t glare at me. You’re the careless one here, right?”\nAmane could only shut up.\nHe had fallen asleep, and let his guard down. He called Mahiru by her given name despite Chitose being around. It was his carelessness.\n“But I heard from Mahirun. I already know you two address each other by name.”\n“Say, you.”\n“So-sorry.”\n“No, I’m not blaming you, Mahiru.”\nMahiru misunderstood that Amane was reproaching her for accidentally blurting this, and hastily shook her head. Chitose grinned away, looking really happy.\n“Well for me, I’m happy that Mahirun and Amane are getting along, you know? It’s not a bad thing.”\n“You’re thinking too much. It’s not what you think.”\n“Hm~?”\n“What?”\n“Nothing nothing~ nothing at all~”\nChitose said it was fine, but actually, she was seemingly hesitant to talk. He did not intend to express herself in words however, and merely shrugged.\nIt was futile to pursue the matter.\nNext to him, Mahiru lowered her eyebrows slightly.\n“…Mahiru?”\n“Ah, no, it is nothing.”\nOnce Amane spoke to her, she seemingly reeled back as she hastily smiled, and shook her head. Amane could not ask any further, and kept quiet.\n“…We are done preparing lunch. You will eat it, I suppose?”\n“Of course I will, but seriously, I slept till noon…?”\n“A long time did pass? We had time to see your sleeping face.”\n“…You didn’t prank me, right?”\n“Of course we didn’t~”\nChitose insisted that they never pranked him, but Amane could not really believe her, probably because of her usual antics.\n“What’s with you, boy?”\n“You did something else?”\n“Nothing~? I did nothing at all~”\n“You serious? Mahiru, this fellow didn’t do anything?”\nHe looked towards Mahiru for confirmation, and the latter lowered her eyebrows, showing a wry smile as the conversation was suddenly directed at her.\n“Chitose-san really did not do anything…”\n“I see. If she did anything, I wanted to twist my fists on her temples.”\n“No violence~!”\nChitose said while laughing away. Amane could only sigh speechlessly.\nIt was finally lunchtime, but as Amane had fallen asleep, it did not feel that much time had passed.\nChitose appeared to have done it properly this time, and there was salad, quiche, bisque and sauteed prawns. The vibrant colors put together resembled a lunch at a cafe.\n“Ahh, looks good…how is the taste, Mahiru.”\n“It is fine. Nothing strange was added. I tasted it.”\n“That’s good.”\n“You’re the overthinking one, seriously~. I did cook them properly together~”\nYou’re being rude,\nChitose noted angrily, but it was no wonder Amane was somewhat suspicious of her when she would say one thing and take him by surprise in another.\nHe could eat with ease however, since Mahiru was supervising.\n“Ah, the quiche is from Mahiru. I made Ikkun’s share.”\n“You’re dumping the whole thing to him…”\n“I made it the size of a palm. It’s fine. Hehe~ I wonder if Ikkun will be happy.”\nChitose grinned happily, and Mahiru smiled at her.\nChitose was a girl who cared for her boyfriend, mischievous streak aside. Amane felt a warmness in his heart as he thought of how Itsuki got a good girlfriend.\nHowever, she had a tendency of overdoing things, and it was still a little dangerous to thoroughly trust her.\nChitose grinned away, and Amane smiled, clapping his hands together as he looked at the dish prepared before him.\n“Then, itadakimasu.”\n“Please do. Enjoy the food~”\nShe’s really a girl after all.\nA bashful Chitose too was quite attractive.",

      "content": "“…Erm, I am really sorry.”\nOnce Chitose left, Mahiru suddenly apologized to Amane.\nAmane had no idea why she had to apologize, and he widened his eyes towards her, who was next to hi. She wriggled and fidgeted, her eyebrows lowered.\n“…About the prank.”\n“Prank?”\n“…Chitose-san never did anything to you, Amane-kun…but I…”\n“Eh? You did?”\nChitose did mention that she never did anything, and Mahiru said that Chitose never did anything. However, Mahiru never said that she never did anything.\nAmane never thought about what Mahiru would have done to her, so he unwittingly absolved her from the possibility. It appeared she did though.\nShe might be feeling guilty when she decided to confess, and she looked a little restless.\n“What did you do?”\n“Erm, I poked your cheek…”\n“…Is that even a prank?”\n“A-and then I ruffled your hair while seeing you sleep, Amane-kun.”\n“You like to do that huh, Mahiru?”\n“…Y-yes.”\n“Is that it?”\n“…Yes.”\nMahiru was looking downhearted, and clearly she was showing remorse, but Amane wanted to retort, saying that it was not really a prank.\nWhat Mahiru did was mere skinship rather than a prank.\nIf that was a prank, then anything he did to her would have been pranks, and he would be troubled by that.\n“Look, I’m not angry. If that makes you happy, that’s fine. I just got careless sleeping in front of others.”\n“Th-thank you…”\n“I think it isn’t fun to see the sleeping face of someone like me though…”\n“…I-it is cute.”\n“You’re the only one who’ll say a boy’s sleeping face is cute.”\n“Of course not. Chitose-san said so too.”\n“She clearly wants to mess with me…”\nChitose definitely said it was cute out of her own bemusement.\nThe cute she spoke of was different from Mahiru’s, and Amane hoped that Mahiru would not trust her that much.\n“…I could not help myself as it was really cute.”\n“Help yourself?”\n“I poked you however I want.”\n“Is poking a guy’s face really something to be happy about?”\n“Very.”\nAmane himself would say his cheeks were harder than a girl’s, and there was no point poking.\nHe had no idea what Mahiru was interested in, but if the act itself was something she would be happey about, he had nothing to complain about.\n“Well, I get how you feel, since your face is fluffy and nice.”\nAmane pulled the same prank Mahiru spoke of, right back at her.\nDespite that, it was a problem if he was too unrestrained. All he did was to poke her fluffy cheek with his finger.\nMahiru’s face was soft like a girl’s, fluffy and nice. She had no excess fat, and her flesh was tender.\nShe did maintain her skin well, and it was moist and smooth, so nice to feel.\nSince you touched me, I’ll touch you back, Mahiru.\nAmane excused himself as he gently pinched Mahiru’s cheek.\nHer face was fluffy and bouncy.\nMahiru looked displeased as she lifted her face towards Amane, so Amane could not go overboard. He poked his finger on her belly to coax her.\nYes, his actions were gentle and cautious, as though he was dealing with a kitten.\n“…Nn.”\nMahiru immediately sheathed aside her displeased look, and showed a lazy smile, as though she had something in her mouth.\nHer mouth was sweet, so perhaps there was lots of honey in her mouth.\n…She really lets her guard down.\nMahiru was showing such a face after a boy touched her, and Amane was worried by how lax she was. However, he found it awkward once he thought of how she would never let a boy touch her in the first place.\nOnce he realized he had some preferential treatment, he had the urge to slam his head into the back of the sofa.\nHe reached his hand for her chin, trying to suppress his uneasiness and impulse. This time, he tickled her chin as though she was a kitten, and she let out a little shriek.\n“…Wh-what is it?”\n“Just some practice for the cat cafe.”\n“What are you thinking, using a human as practice…”\n“You’re like a cat, Mahiru. Well, like a dog and a rabbit too.”\n“What do you mean…”\n“That’s what I mean.”\nIt was recently that Amane realized that Mahiru had elements of all three animals.\nWhen they first met, she was a very wary cat, but once their relationship improved, she would approach him like a dog meeting humans. To those she was familiar with, she would smile and follow.\nShe was like a rabbit, for Amane felt that rabbits appeared terrified of being alone. Thus, he added that.\nWell, you want to be doted.\nAmane stroked her chin before she got sick of it. “The head feels better though.” Mahiru muttered, so he patted her hear anyway.\nHe felt she was like a dog in this sense, but he did not say it.\n“…If I am a cat, dog or rabbit…you are a wolf, Amane-kun.”\n“Do I look the kind to attack females?”\n“No, I do not mean that. Wolves are said to care for their companions, those of their pack. Wolf packs are formed through families, so it might be a little different in this sense, but you really do treasure those you can open your heart to, Amane-kun.”\n“…It might be as you say.”\nAmane’s social circle was really small, and one could use both hands to count the people he was on friendly terms with.\n“E-erm…I wish that is the case.”\n“Wish for what?”\n“…No, it is nothing. Your hair is fluffy like a wolf.”\n“…That’s not unique to a wolf though.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had more to say, but she did not. She ruffled Amane’s hair, and Amane let her be without asking any further.",

      "content": "“Good morning, Amane-kun.”\nThe first thing ordinary people would do when going out together was to meet up. In Amane and Mahiru’s case, this first thing was for Mahiru to go to Amane’s house.\nIt was a logical conclusion; there was no need to meet elsewhere, for Mahiru’s house was next to Amane.\nOn this day, Mahiru’s attire was different from usual.\n“Good morning…you tied your hair, huh?”\n“I tied it so that it will not be distracting when we play with the kittens. Does it look weird?”\nMahiru had her silky hair, usually draped behind her head, tied in a bun. Clearly she put in the effort to doll herself up on this day, unlike when she was cooking.\n“No, it really suits you.”\n“That is good…e-erm…laugh if you want to.”\n“What are you saying out of a sudden?”\n“…You may think I am being too excited, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru put her hand on her chest, and was wearing clothing a little more revealing.\nIt might seem like she was revealing lots, but it was simply because her white décolleté was exposed, for she was wearing an open collar chiffon blouse that could be peeked into from time to time.\nShe had long lantern sleeves, and one could vaguely see the upper arm vaguely hidden under the laces from the side opening, which gave an alluring vibe.\nOf course, Mahiru was wearing undergarments, and the important parts would not be seen from above. Nevertheless, Amane strangely felt some innocence and allure in that feminine look.\nShe was wearing tights, probably because they would be playing with cats. The fine gradients of the legs were emphasized accordingly.\nShe was wearing the floral bracelet Amane bought for her the last time.\nAmane remembered Mahiru once said that she would treasure and wear it, and his heart felt hot.\n“I don’t think so, but I think you’re cuter than usual, Mahiru.”\n“…I think your parents have taught you to say such words so openly.”\n“My dad said that I should praise any girl who dresses up well…I’m not saying this out of courtesy, don’t worry.”\n“…I believe you, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru blushed as she held her bag. Amane gave a wry smile, and had the urge to pat her head, but he did not.\nAfter all, he could not simply ruffle the hair she painstakingly styled.\nMahiru blinked as Amane faltered, but it seemed she understood he was worried about her hair, and she too showed a wry smile.\nShe however looked at Amane’s right hand with pity.\n“…Have you been addicted to patting my head recently, Amane-kun?”\n“Hmm, feels nice to stroke, or rather, touch. I’ll stop if you dislike it though.”\n“I-I do not dislike it…I-I wish to pat you when I want to.”\n“I don’t mind, but I waxed my hair.”\nAmane dressed handsomely as he was going out with Mahiru.\nDespite that, he did not put in as much effort as Mahiru. All he did was to tidy his heart.\nHe wore a white V-neck, a denim jacket, and black slim pants. He did not put much effort into dressing himself, and it was all very casual.\nAmane felt he looked inferior standing next to Mahiru, but given that it was an issue of their facial appearances, that was to be expected.\n“…May I pat?”\n“It’s not like I hate it. Hang on for now though; we’re playing with cats today.”\n“I-I am not thinking of doing so now. It is fine…I see, so I can touch…”\n“I usually pat you. It’s expected that I can be patted back.”\nAmane did not dislike to be patted by Mahiru…he found it comforting, on the contrary. There was no reason for him to refuse.\nIf this little act could satisfy Mahiru, Amane was more than glad to oblige.\nOnce she easily got his permission, Mahiru was initially at a loss, but soon after, she smiled happily.\n“…I shall pat your head next time, Amane-kun. Today, I shall pat the kittens.”\n“Oh.”\n“Let us go then.”\n“Yep.”\nThey left the same place, and Amane felt a little itchy. They left the house, harboring such thoughts.\nAmane walked slowly as he paced himself alongside her. Then, he suddenly thought of something, and reached his hand towards her.\n“Give me your hand.”\nAmane said jokingly, and Mahiru’s face turned red as she smiled and held Amane’s hand.",

      "content": "He did research on it to some extent, but when Amane entered the cat cafe personally, the space before him was more spacious than he imagined.\nThe duo paid, sanitized their hands with alcohol, entered the cafe, and saw cats everyone. Some were strolling around, some were curled, and some were playing with the customers.\n“Woah…it’s bigger than I thought, and prettier.”\nAs the cafe provided food, cleanliness was a must. In spite of that, the cafe was much cleaner than he imagined.\nThe distinct stench of animals could not be detected. It was practically odorless.\nThis shop was very popular, but there were few seats, so that the kittens would not be pressurized.\nThe shop contained a rest area for cats, and the purpose appeared to be for people to share space with the cats, rather than just have fun.\nThe cat cafe charged by hour, and it was rather pricey. Despite that, one would think the price was worth it, given the pretty decorations and the comforting atmospheres.\n“Phaaa…cats…please look, Amane-kun. This little one looks really cute.”\nMahiru whispered as she tugged at Amane’s sleeve, for there were other cats and customers around. However, her voice contained much excitement.\nShe looked around as she stared at the various cats, her eyes sparkling.\nMahiru hardly talked about animals, but it appeared she really loved these cats. Amane too unwittingly smiled as he saw how excited she was.\n“Yeah, they’re really cute.”\n“Nn. Ah, I think that one is called Silk-chan.”\nIt appeared Mahiru did not understand which was the cute one Amane referred to. She had taken the book containing the photos, names and breed, and pointed at Siamese cat.\nThat cat had black fur on its tail and the area around the face. It had white fur all over its thin limbs.\nIt had distinct blue eyes, and carried a regal presence.\nMahiru’s eyes faltered, and she had the urge to touch. However, the shop forbade sudden contact, so Mahiru knelt down to exchange looks with it, before she gently reached her finger to its nose.\nThe twitchy nose sniffed at Mahiru’s hand.\nIt seemed this little gesture had Mahiru muttering “Cute”. She probably was fond of cats.\nOnce Silk had a sniff of Mahiru’s smell, it gracefully walked away.\nAnd immediately, Mahiru looked completely despondent.\n“I don’t think it hates you. It just leaves after greeting you.”\n“Is that so…”\n“Yeah. Just let it get familiar with you. Anyway, let’s find a place to sit.”\nMahiru stood up, and Amane held her hand. They sat at an empty sofa.\nFinally, they could get a full view of the entire room. It contained various cats.\nThey had just seen a Siamese cat. There was also American Shorthairs, Exotic Shorthairs, Russian Blue, Munchkins, Bengals, and various others.\nSlightly far away from them was an American Shorthair, curled as it sat on a table. A lady seated there was gently caressing it.\n“How cute…”\nMahiru was clearly looking envious at the other customers. Amane gave a wry smile as he looked at the menu.\nIt appeared the dishes served in this shop were highly rated.\nThe most popular was probably the latte with a cat latte art. There seemed to be a worker who was really good at it, and it was said people often uploaded photos of the latte onto social media.\nMahiru kept staring at the cats that were walking around. Amane let her be as he called for the attendant, and ordered a signature latte.\n“I’ll order the same for you. Is that alright?”\n“Hm? Ah, yes, that is fine.”\nMahiru’s eyes were completely fixated on the cats, and she never noticed Amane.\nShe was fine with both coffee and black tea. Since he had the opportunity, Amane decided to give her a little surprise, and did not tell her what he ordered.\nAfter a while, the attendant served their drinks with a smile.\nThe attendant slowly put the lattes on the the table without ruining the art, nodded, and left. Mahiru in turn stared intently at the latter on the table.\n“You dislike this?”\n“N-no. It is really cute…!”\n“That’s good then.”\nThe cup before Mahiru had a latte art of a sleeping cat all curled up, and the cocoa formed its patterns and expression. Amane’s had a cat leaning onto the edge of the cup.\nThe latte was finely shaped, and looked cute. It was no wonder it was so popular.\nMahiru looked completely elated, and probably wanted to save that impression she had as she took photos on her smartphone. For some reason, she looked stunned.\n“I cannot bring myself to drink it when it looks so cute…”\nOnce he heard her mutter, Amane burst out laughin.\n“P-please do not laugh at me.”\n“No no, I was thinking that you’re troubled by this cute thing.”\n“B-because…it is a pity to ruin such a cute cat…”\n“It’s a pity not to drink it.”\n“Uu.”\nWhile he understood how Mahiru felt, he had a feeling that the latte art would be ruined if left be. The maker would be happy if she were to drink it before it cooled and was ruined.\nOnce he thoroughly appraised the photo, he casually brought the cup to his lips.\nAhhhh…\nhe heard a sad groan next to him, and did his best not to ruin the art as he drank. The latte tasted good, and the richness of both the coffee and the milk were just right.\nIt was not sweet, but Amane was fine with black coffee. No worries for him here.\n“Yep. It’s good.”\nMahiru mumbled away once she saw Amane sigh and express his comments, but she hesitated to bring the cup to her mouth.\nShe made sure not to ruin the cat on the latte, and cautiously lifted it. it was an amusing and adorable sight that left Amane smiling.\n“Wh-why do I feel I am taken for a fool?”\n“You’re thinking too much. Is it good?”\n“Yes. Of course.”\nMahiru moved the cup away from her lips, and Amane started huffing his shoulders.\n“Wh-why are you laughing?”\n“Well, you have a white beard on your face.”\nThere was a Santa-like white beard near her mouth, as she paid too much attention not to destroy the cat and failed to notice the milk foam.\nShe looked so adorable that Amane instinctively took his smartphone out to take photos.\n“Ah! Y-you just took a photo!?”\n“Sorry. Do I have to delete it?”\n“A-are you keeping that embarrassing photo?”\n“It’s so cute, so I,”\nMahiru bit her lips when she heard his eyes, and her cheeks reddened slightly. “…just one.” she muttered.\nThe white beard remained on her face as she said so. Amane felt his heart warm as he nodded, resisting the urge to laugh.",

      "content": "“…Ah.”\nOnce Amane finished the latte, a cat hopped onto his lap.\nIt was the American Shorthair that was at the table next to them.\nHe had a look at its profile, and the word was ‘Kakao♀’.\nOne had to wonder if she was bold or naive as she innocently hopped onto his lap, which disturbed him.\nAmane understood very well how carefree cats could be, but he was a little restless to have one suddenly approach him.\nThe warmth on his lap was heavier than he thought. She curled up, as thought declaring his lap as her dominion.\n“This one ain’t shy.”\nAmane let Kakao sniff his hand, and saw Mahiru looking envious.\nOnce Kakao was done sniffing, she rubbed her face on his palm. He had a feeling she was asking to be patted or hugged, and like how he practiced on Mahiru, he tickled Kakao’s chin.\nKakao was making a gulping sound with its throat, which was apparent from the way she shook and purred.\nHe felt fuzzy and healed after seeing such cuteness, and continued to pet the cat. He was however concerned by Mahiru’s envious look beside him, and smiled.\n“Mahiru, hand over here.”\n“Eh? Y-yes.”\nOnce she reached her hand out, Amane moved his hand from Kakao, and put Mahiru’s hand near Kakao’s cheek.\nThis cat probably was not shy in the slightest, and found humans approachable. She probably would let others pet it if they greeted her properly.\nKakao had a sniff of Mahiru’s hand, let out a relaxed purr, and rubbed her face onto Mahiru’s palm. Mahiru seemed very moved, and her eyes were sparkling.\n“Amane-kun, it let me touch.”\nAmane smiled at the exhilarated Mahiru, and patted the kitten, combing its fur.\nIt had fluffy, smooth fur, probably because it was better cared for, and did not have an annoying stench. It had a little of its distinct scent.\nThe shop attendants really care for it,\nAmane thought.\nEvery cat appeared to have good fur and health. None of them were too plump or skinny. They were well cared of, and could freely walk anywhere.\n“…So cute.”\n“Yes…I am envious of you, Amane-kun…”\n“Try asking Kakao. Get it to hop onto your lap.”\nDespite a difference in languages, sign language was unexpectedly effective.\nMahiru tried slapping her legs “Over here~” Kakao purred, and slowly walked towards Mahiru’s lap.\nAmane looked delighted when he saw how moved Mahiru looked.\n“Amane-kun, look. She is on my lap now.”\n“That’s good. Try patting her.”\nIt appeared Kakao was more fond of Mahiru’s soft thighs than Amane’s sturdy ones, for she made a shriller purr, and rubbed her face on Mahiru’s palm.\nMahiru beamed as she patted away, and with a wry smile, Amane took out his cellphone to record this sight.\n“Can I take photos now?”\n“…You may.”\nMahiru continued patting Kakao. Amane smiled at Mahiru, and stood up.\nThere were a few magazines and manga on the wall shelf, so Amane wanted to take a few.\nThis was a cat-themed cafe, but it did not mean he had to keep playing with the cats; the objective was to relax in a place with cats. This little relaxation was also a form of enjoyment.\nWhile Mahiru remained mesmerized by Kakao, Amane chose a few books from the shelf, only to notice Silk, who first greeted Mahiru, being at his feet.\nAmane knelt down, brought his index finger to the cat’s nose, and as expected, Silk sniffed at him as a greeting.\nSilk’s gesture too was very cute, and Amane unwittingly relaxed as he looked at it. Once it finished sniffing, its front paw leaned towards Amane’s arm, as though leaping over.\nMeow~\nit made a shriller voice than Kakao as it leaned towards Amane. Amane sat on the floor, cross-legged.\nSilk might appear regal, but it appeared to be rather fond of people. Once Amane got permission to touch, he petted it, and it looked delighted.\nIt continued to purr and lean over, and that probably was the signal indicating that it wanted to be patted more. Using his fingers, Amane gently caressed Silk-sama, fulfilling its desire.\nItsuki had a cat at his place, so Amane had some knowledge on how to deal with them.\nHe knew how to improve a cat’s mood, how to make it fawn; Amane kept changing his actions accordingly.\nSo cute.\nAmane’s lips curled into a smile as he felt its throat throbbing.\nSilk was initially aloof, and Amane never expected it to fawn so much after he was allowed to touch.\nI was wondering who it resembled, but Mahiru?\nMahiru too was initially aloof, and had an unapproachable vibe. Once she opened up however, she would give him a look of trust, and sometimes careless when she fawned over him.\nAmane always felt she had some traits of a cat, but actually, she really resembled one, no?\nHe quietly dubbed Silk Angel number 2, and patted it in ways to make it comfortable. Then, he suddenly heard a camera shutter.\nHe lifted his head, and found Mahiru close to him, with smartphone in hand.\n“I was wondering why you are so slow…when did you become so close with Silk-chan?”\n“I don’t know how, but it just let me touch it.”\n“How sleazy…I too want…”\n“Where’s Kakao?”\n“Cats really are capricious creatures…”\nIt appeared Kakao ran somewhere else.\nAmane looked around the cafe, and found Kakao curled on the second level of the cat rack. Just a moment ago, she let Mahiru pet it, and perhaps she lost interest.\n“Do you like Silk-chan, Amane-kun?”\n“No, I can’t say since I haven’t touched it completely…but well, I think it’s really similar to you in a few ways, so I had the urge to pat it.”\n“Similar?”\n“Yes. You’re standoffish at first, but once we got closer, you want to fawn around.”\nAmane however felt that while Mahiru’s carelessness and urge to fawn were similar to a cat, the desire to gain full trust and seek attention was like a dog. He could not deny that she had a combination of both cat and dog traits.\nMahiru herself had instinctively relied on Amane, and fawned on him, which made him happy and yet embarrassed.\n“…I am not a cat. And I do not simply approach anyone.”\n“Yeah. You’re more wary after all.”\n“…Are you thinking that I am a cat?”\n“No no no.”\nAmane patted the cat as he usually did to Mahiru, “Right?” he asked Silk.\nSilk purred, either out of coincidence or keen observation, and because of this, Mahiru could not ask any further.\nNevertheless, Mahiru looked displeased towards Amane, and Amane used his left hand, which never touched the cat, to pat Mahiru.\n“…You are thinking of me as a cat.”\n“Alright alright. Come on, play with Silk, Mahiru. I think you can borrow toys from the receptionist.”\n“Pl-please do not try to pull a fast one.”\n“You don’t want to play with it?”\nAmane fooled around with Silk as he asked Mahiru, “How sleazy, Amane-kun.” Mahiru muttered, and went to borrow toys.\nAmane had intended for Mahiru to play with the cat while he borrowed, and widened his eyes when he saw Mahiru like that. Then, he saw that slightly pouty look on her face, and was utterly confused.\n“What does she mean, sleazy?”\nIs it about me playing with Silk?\nHe muttered, wondering why Mahiru showed such a face.\nHow would I\nknow, Silk purred, and rubbed its forehead onto Amane’s palm.",

      "content": "Ultimately, Amane did not know the reason why Mahiru pouted, but her mood seemed to improve when she played with the cat, and she finally smiled at Amane.\nMidway through, she ignored Amane and started playing with the cats. Amane gave her a wry smile, but for some reason, the cats started hogging his lap.\nOnce she saw that, Mahiru pouted once again.\nGoodness me,\nSilk however gave such a look as it seat on her lap, which calmed her down.\nWhen Amane doted on the cats, the other cats started gathering around him even though he never provided snacks for them. Perhaps it was because they were fond of him. After such a precious experience, the happy time with the cats ended.\nThe duo cleaned the fur off their hands, and washed them. While Mahiru was washing, Amane went to pay, and then Mahiru gave him a slightly displeased look.\n“Why are you making such a face?”\n“You do not have to care for me this much, Amane-kun.”\n“That’s not it. I’m also doing this for my own pleasure. Don’t worry.”\nAmane said that he would pay, and he did not need Mahiru to worry about this.\n“Well, I’m really grateful that you’re willing to enter a cat cafe with someone like me, a place that I’m embarrassed to enter alone. Right?”\n“…But.”\n“You should be a little more selfish. If you can’t accept this…how about we come back again the next time?”\n“…This will only be to my benefit though?”\n“It benefits me too. it’s a win-win.”\nNo problems right?\nHe chuckled. Mahiru pursed her lips, leaned her head on Amane’s arm, and held his hand once again.\nAfter they had lunch at a highly rated restaurant, they went to a large shopping mall.\nOn a side note, the food was really delicious, and lived up to its rating. Amane had a personal preference towards Mahiru’s cooking however, and once again, he realized that Mahiru’s cooking was the best.\nAs it was Golden Week, there were more customers in the shopping mall than usual. As he held Mahiru’s hand firmly, Amane leaned on the wall, wondering what they should do next.\n“Anyway, what are we going to do in this shopping mall? We say we’re shopping, but do you have anything you want?”\n“N-nothing in particular. I think I will be happy with a little window shopping though…c-can’t we?”\n“No no no, of course we can’t. I don’t dislike the idea of window shopping.”\nBack home, Amane was often dragged along by his mother, and often went shopping with his family. He had some immunity to these acts any male would have suffered over.\nAlso, it might be interesting to bring Mahiru out window shopping.\n“Where do we start? General store? Clothes? Interior design? There’s lots of them.”\nThis large shopping mall had countless shops for clothes, food, general goods, or even amusement. There was a myriad of them, and the mall was so big, one would be unable to finish shopping in a day.\nThey could not see them all, so there was a need to narrow the list to the smallest possible.\n“Then…shall we start from clothes?”\n“Sure. You want to buy new clothes?”\n“If there are good ones. Summer clothes are stocked, and I want to buy some new ones.”\n“Summer huh…that’s fast.”\nThe sweltering season would arrive soon, but at this point, there was only warm sun shining upon them. Amane felt it was too hasty for them to buy summer clothes.\nIt was common sense to purchase items before the season, but Amane could not let go of the spring.\n“This summer…ah, you’re going to my hometown too…right Mahiru?”\n“Ah, y-yes. If Shihoko-san and you do not mind.”\nShe nodded, probably remembering Amane’s suggestion to follow him to his hometown.\n“I asked mom once after that, and she said it’s fine. Well, I expected that.”\nShihoko surely would have agreed to that even if he never checked with her, but he did since they would have to prepare a room. “She’s very welcomed here!” that was the reply. He probably would be returning home with Mahiru this summer.\n“Well, there’s not a lot of things to do at my hometown. A lot of leisure facilities though.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yep, lots of them. There’s no end to the places mom brought me to; shopping malls like this, ridiculously large national parks, ridiculously large water parks.”\nIt was not a big city, but it was no village. It was never boring at his hometown during summer and winter, as it was a suitable geographic location. On the contrary, they might not have the chance to rest. It was a good place to kill time at.\nThe water parks would be opened in the summer, and it would be enjoyable to sit on the slides, or slowly swim about.\n“At school, swimming’s an elective, so there’s no chance of that if don’t chance it. Maybe it’s a good idea to go swimming at the pool there…Mahiru?”\n“I-it is nothing…”\n“Ah, don’t worry. I’m not thinking of anything indecent like seeing you in your swimsuit, you know? I can go alone if you’re unwilling.”\n“I-I have no such misunderstanding. B-but the p-pool.”\n“Is there a problem?”\nAmane felt that it was not strange to naturally think of the pool when it came to summer, but Mahiru shook her head somewhat stiffly.\n“E-erm…well.”\n“Hm?”\n“I-I may consider, erm…going too, if we do not have to swim…”\n“…Wait, you can’t swim?”\nMahiru looked aside.\nIt seemed Amane assumed correctly.\n“…I thought you can do anything.”\n“Th-that is not the case. Since swimming is an elective, I assumed I did not need to tell anyone…”\nHer face reddened increasingly, surely due to shame.\n“But well, that’s surprising…”\n“We-we have talked enough about swimming, no? Come on, let us go.”\nIt appeared Mahiru did not really want to talk about swimming, for her face was flushed as she pulled Amane’s hand. Actually, she leaned her body onto his arm, swinging and seemingly lifting it.\nAmane knew that Mahiru was dragging him off because she wanted to avoid this topic, but it was a bad posture to assume.\nFabrics would thin accordingly while the seasons got hotter.\nMahiru’s chiffon blouse was rather fluffy, and the fabric was thin. One could see her beautiful skin through the open décolleté. The undergarments covered much, but to Amane, the parts closing in were visible, and even touching him.\nBut if he pointed that out, it was likely she would blush and escape. He did not say anything, and gently moved his arm away from her, before holding her hand.\nHe wryly noted to himself that he would not have suffered if he could earnestly enjoy those soft parts. The first thing he felt was guilt however, and he was merely a coward.\n“Okay okay. Don’t run. You’ll fall.”\n“…I am not a child.”\nMahiru turned her head aside, not knowing how rattled Amane was. Amane then seized the chance to look slightly outwards, avoiding her eyes.\nHe desperately purged the soft sensation that lingered on his arm, and sighed so softly that she could not hear him.",

      "content": "Amane was dragged by the hand, and had a thought that Mahiru really attracted much attention.\nUsually dubbed the Angel, she looked innocent and pretty. At this moment, she was fully showing how carefree she was, looking so adorable that others had the urge to protect and pet her.\nWhen in Angel mode, Mahiru would exhibit a painting-like beauty and fragility, looking so unapproachable. However, the overly delicate beauty looked so artificial, and felt a little lacking in life to Amane.\nMahiru, holding his hand like this, gave such a pure smile, and looked really vigorous. Even though she never voiced out, the\nI’m so happy!\nemotion could be felt from her hand holding his, and her strides.\nHer conservative smile was pretty, but this utterly elated smile looked a lot more adorable than the facade she mustered.\n“…What is it?”\n“Nothing. Just that there’s a lot of stares when I’m walking with you.”\nMale and female gazes were looking at them, and once again, Amane realized that Mahiru was a beautiful girl.\n“…I think not all of them are looking at me, you know?”\n“Yeah, guess some are sizing me up as your attendant.”\n“I am not referring to this, goodness.”\nMahiru lifted her head towards Amane unhappily, but she held his hand firmly again, probably not wanting to continue this conversation.\n“It is a bother how Amane-kun has no self-awareness.” she muttered, but Amane knew people would be looking at him walking alongside Mahiru. It was obvious that Amane looked inferior, and not a matter of self-awareness.\n“Well, I shall explain to you slowly until you understand.”\n“Ack, why does that sound scary?”\n“It is rude to say that is scary…it is your fault after all, you know?”\nShe poked her index finger onto his nose, shushing him.\nHowever, she showed an impish smile, and did not seem to have her mood ruined as she continued to tap. She then pulled Amane’s hand after being seemingly satisfied. To be precise, she leaned her body onto Amane’s arm.\n“…This would be easier if you have more self-confidence.”\nMahiru muttered as she leaned her forehead onto Amane’s elbow. Amane had enough, and averted his eyes.\n“Erm, Mahiru-san.”\n“What is it?”\n“You’re doing it on purpose, right?”\n“Purpose?”\n“…Well, your chest’s touching me.”\nWhether she actually meant for it, he hoped she would spare him when he mentioned this, and Mahiru jolted away like a bullet.\nHe tried to suppress his blush as he looked towards Mahiru, and found her completely beetroot.\n“N-not at all.”\n“Hm, I can tell from your reaction. You’ll subconsciously lean onto those you’re familiar with, like just now. Pay attention to that.”\nAs a male, Amane was very sensitive to a female’s body. He had normal desires, and he would have urges to touch breasts if he were allowed to. Thus, he hoped Mahiru would pay attention.\nMahiru surely would loathe such desires, so Amane never expressed it, but the subconscious temptation was arduous.\nMahiru’s face turned completely red once she realized how potently murderous her breasts could be, and kept her lips sealed as she shivered. Amane gave a wry smile, and pulled his distance slightly.\nHe felt that she felt embarrassed or displeased to realize this, and pulled his distance because of her concerns. Mahiru seemed a little hurt however as she looked up at Amane.\n“…Please do not let go.”\n“Eh?”\n“I-may get lost…it is bad, to lose my way.”\nNaturally, Amane could not refuse when she looked up at him, and harbored the shame that never faded completely as he timidly held her hand.\nHe grasped her little palm like before, and her still blushing face showed a relieved smile.\nThey reverted back to their usual distance, their bodies close but not touching.\n“…Erm, I did not intend to…and, if it is you, I am fine with a little, Amane-kun.”\n“I’ll get carried away if you say that, so don’t.”\nThis little whisper had Amane’s heart pounding, but he realized that Mahiru might be saying she would not be angry if it was someone she was familiar with. He quietly exhaled.\nHe felt he would get carried away, and many aspects would go awry if he did not show restraint, like his heart, his sanity, and others.\n“Look, the clothes on that mannequin seem to suit you, Mahiru. Shall we have a look?”\nAmane pointed with his empty hand to conceal his searing face. “Is that what you like?” Mahiru showed interest, and the duo naturally went over to that shop.\n“Is this it?”\n“Un, yes. Everything suits you, Mahiru, but I think this is rather decent.”\nThe mannequin was wearing a white based, thin striped off shoulder one-piece dress atop its white body.\nIt was really suited for a thin female with a wonderful décolleté, and Amane it would surely go well with Mahiru.\nHe stared at Mahiru as she stood next to the mannequin, and imagined her wearing that clothing. He soon imagined a refreshing vibe to her. It would be a really suitable image, especially when paired with a straw hat.\n“I shall try it on.”\nMahiru quickly decided as though she had planned to do so, and took the same clothing hanging next to the mannequin.\nAmane was a little taken aback seeing her being strangely riled up. Mahiru had Amane hold her bag, and hurriedly vanished into the changing room.\nWhy’s she so agitated?\nAmane wondered as he waited for Mahiru to change. The surrounding warm stares had him increasingly confused.\nThe attendants, and even the surrounding customers were smiling at him, and he felt very uncomfortable.\nPlease hurry back.\nHe earnestly thought as he waited. Finally, the changing room curtain was pulled aside, and Mahiru exited.\nHowever, she did not change.\n“Ah, you’re back…you didn’t change?”\n“No, I have checked the sizes. But…erm, I cannot show you because of my undergarments.”\n“So-sorry.”\nHe could see the décolleté even though she was wearing the chiffon blouse, but even then, the exposure was nothing compared to the open shoulder dress.\nIt was said that one had to wear different undergarments under an open shoulder dress. She probably was unable to do so at this point.\n“You say it suits me though, Amane-kun. I have taken a liking to it after trying it on, so I shall buy it.”\nMahiru received her bag from Amane, and took the dress to the cashier. Amane hastily gave chest.\nAmane felt that since he said it suited Mahiru, he should be the one paying. He prepared to frisk his wallet, but Mahiru stopped him from rummaging further.\n“No, I shall buy it and show it off to you, Amane-kun.”\n“O-okay.”\n“But I cannot wear it until it gets hotter. This shall have to wait until summer.”\nPlease look forward to it,\nMahiru said bashfully. Amane kept his lips shut, and barely managed to not end up tumbling onto the floor.\nDamn, why does she sound so cute when she says this?\nAmane had a feeling she was implying that she was wearing it for him, and his heart felt unbearable.\nHe met the eyes of the cashier’s, received a sincere, beaming smile in response, and could only bite his lips and look aside.",

      "content": "“…And this is the game center.”\nAfter their window shopping…or rather, shopping since they bought clothes, Amane accompanied Mahiru to the game center he usually frequented.\nThey had no plans beyond this, other than to return home, and took their time.\n“It is loud.”\n“Ah, that’s most of the game centers.”\nMahiru frowned slightly. The noises here would leave anyone unfamiliar with game centers really frustrated. Amane was fine however as he was used to it.\nIt was noisier at the slot machines and arcade games, so Amane avoided that area as he lazily led Mahiru past there.\n“So, what are we doing?”\n“I want to try the crane game, and catch a doll.”\nIt appeared Mahiru was aiming for the crane game, and once she was led to that area, she clenched and relaxed her fists several times when she saw the machines. She looked really excited.\nIt was Golden Week, and there were more dolls, especially the cute family oriented ones. There were many dolls Mahiru might like.\n“…Amane-kun, I wish to pick that one.”\n“Hm, which one?”\n“That one. Does she not resemble that cat, Silk-chan?”\nMahiru pointed at a white cat doll with some charred tea colored fur near her face. The blue eyes did truly resemble the cat they met at the cafe.\nIt appeared Mahiru was really interested as it really resembled Silk, which Mahiru first encountered.\n“Sure does. You want it?”\n“I want to try. May I?”\n“Sure. The cranes here are easier. If you can’t, leave it to me.”\n“I will try my best not to trouble you.”\nMahiru looked enthused in challenging the crane machine, and Amane chose to watch.\nAmane could nab the doll immediately, but since Mahiru was the one who requested, he felt it was better to acknowledge her independence and competitiveness.\nMahiru inserted the coin, cautiously touched the knob to move the crane horizontally, and affirmed the situation. The cautious Mahiru probably wanted to be sure how long it would take until she could move the crane.\nHowever, such crane arms would automatically move vertically once the user let go.\n“Eh, eh? It cannot move.”\n“Sorry, I forgot to tell you. This machine will move vertically once you let go. You only have one chance.”\n“Ah? In other words…”\n“There’s no way to get the doll.”\nAt this point, the doll was in the middle of an empty area.\nThe crane was positioned slightly away from the drop zone, and would only move vertically thereafter. There was no way to salvage it, or even poke at the doll.\nThere were some that had a joystick allowing it to move around, and some were time limited, but this was a button type, and she could not redo it. It was a common issue to anyone playing this game for the first time, one they had to live with.\n“Well, you wasted 100 yen, but since you can move the crane sideways, use this chance to figure out the speed and the lag in releasing the button, and make use of it next time.”\n“Uuu…I shall do so. It is my fault for being careless.”\nMahiru said, moved the crane arm seriously, and grasped its speed.\nAmane felt responsible for not reminding her, so he discreetly slipped a coin in, and was met with a displeased look from Mahiru. “Alright alright.” Amane said as he patted her on the back, prompting her on, and she returned to the crane game.\nShe managed to align the crane with the doll, for she grasped its speed.\nThough she missed the center of gravity slightly, she could still catch the doll at this position. It was possible for her to catch if she considered the center of gravity, the crane grip, and the timing to let go.\nNot bad for a beginner,\nAmane thought as he watched over her.\nMahiru cautiously moved the crane arms, finally moved it above the doll, and tried to pull it up.\nShe aimed well, but as the item was a little longer, the doll quickly dropped off despite the firm grip of the crane.\n“Muuuu.”\n“Too bad. You should push it sideways using the crane instead of grabbing it. It’ll be easier to use its center of gravity to nudge it off.”\nLuckily, the partition to the drop zone was not that tall. A single nudge should do the trick.\nMahiru blinked, and obediently did as told.\nA virtue Mahiru had was that she was never one to be completely stubborn, and would obediently listen to any advice given to her.\nAfter she considered the position of the crane and the doll’s center of gravity. “Over here…use the head, flip it over…” she continued with her trial and error.\nAmane gave a smirk when he saw Mahiru’s serious face reflected off the mirror.\nShe slotted coins a few times, and after a little while, managed to flip the doll into the drop zone.\nAhh,\nshe muttered, and the doll landed in the receiving box.\nAfter a short silence, Mahiru looked up at Amane blankly.\n“…I did it.”\n“Oh, nice going…that’s proof that you worked hard.”\nAmane took out the doll that was won after a grueling duel, and handed it to Mahiru. She finally felt a sense of success, and an elated look of joy appeared on her pretty face.\n“I-I did it. I did it, Amane-kun.”\n“You did. It’s your first time, but you did great.”\nAmane patted Mahiru’s head, and she narrowed her eyes bashfully, embracing the doll resembling Silk in her clutches.\nShe appeared really delighted that she won the doll, and looked completely overjoyed as her cheek clung onto the doll.\nShe embraced the doll firmly in her clutches with an innocent smile. Amane felt jealous of the doll, and felt his self-control was insufficient.\nOne moment, she was happily hugging the doll, and the next moment, she timidly turned the doll towards Amane.\n“…Erm, Amane, will you like to keep it?”\n“Hm? Me?”\n“I did receive one from you, and I feel you like Silk-chan, Amane-kun…”\nAmane liked Silk because he was fond of cats, but the bigger reason was that it resembled Mahiru, and was adorable. He did not say it out however, as he nodded and scratched his cheek.\n“Do-do men dislike dolls after all…?”\n“No, that’s not it. Are you fine giving me this when you worked so hard?”\n“I worked hard because of you, Amane-kun. No, I am not going to force you to accept, but I thought you might like this doll, just as you like Silk-chan…”\nI can put it in my room if you do not want it.\nMahiru said, and lowered her shoulders, looking slightly devastated, and looked up at him uneasily. Amane could not refuse.\n“I’ll put it in my room then. Though I can’t put it by my pillow like you, Mahiru.”\n“I-I hope you will forget about that matter…”\n“I’ll treasure this well.”\nAmane solemnly received the doll, and took a bag used to contain prizes next to the machine, slotting the doll in.\nMahiru smiled immediately, and once Amane was about to reach out towards her again—\n“Eh, Shiina-san?”\nHe froze once he heard the voice next to them.\nMahiru too froze, and the duo turned towards the voice gingerly. Standing there was the friendly yet dignified boy with a handsome face they encountered often recently…Kadowaki.",

      "content": "“…Kadowaki-san.”\nMahiru immediately switched the angelic smile she showed at school the moment she saw Kadowaki.\nHowever, this smile was a little stiff compared to usual, probably because she was internally rattled.\nAmane knew that there was a huge possibility of them meeting their classmates during Golden Week, but he never expected the one person he interacted with recently to be here.\n“It’s surprising to see you here, Shiina-san…hm, am I disturbing?”\nKadowaki frowned, looking troubled once he saw Amane. It appeared he had yet to recognize the latter, but the gig would be up if Amane spoke. Kadowaki was an observant one, and might actually notice it was Amane.\n“No, erm, actually…”\n“It’s the first time hearing that you have a lover.”\n“That is not our relationship though.”\nMahiru flatly denied it, and Amane felt his heart aching. However, both of them were definitely not dating, so this denial was to be expected. It would be weird for her to confirm it however, and he had nothing to look forward to.\n“B-but clearly, it’s…hm?”\nPerplexed by Mahiru’s stubborness, Kadowaki was about to question her further, only to suddenly look towards Amane.\nThe moment their eyes met, Amane’s face twitched.\nKadowaki stared at Amane, looking completely mystified. It was a horrible situation for Amane.\n“…Fujimiya?”\nAs expected, he recognized Amane.\nThey never interacted with each other for long, but Amane knew Kadowaki was really insightful. They were on better terms, and it appeared even though Amane had tidied his hair and dressed differently, he could not fool Kadowaki.\nNobody would have associated Amane’s current appearance to his usual self, unless they were close enough and observed his face closely. It appeared this was not the case of Kadowaki however.\n“Eh, Fujimiya…right? On a closer look, your height and face…so you two have contact at school because you two know each other?”\n“No, erm…”\nKadowaki seemed confident when Mahiru stammered away. He looked back and forth between Amane and Mahiru, and was a little shocked.\nThere was plausible deniability back then since Amane and Mahiru never talked at school, but that would not work this time.\nAmane sighed, put his hand on his forehead, and looked towards an incredulous and stunned Kadowaki.\n“…How did you figure out it was me?”\n“I guessed so. Well, I can tell it’s you by your face and the vibe you give, Fujimiya.”\n“Am I that recognizable?”\n“Actually, no. I think even our classmates can’t tell. You don’t really make such an expression after all.”\nAmane did not know exactly what was the expression Kadowaki referred to, but he was relieved for the time being since nobody would associate his appearance with that.\n“But it’s surprising that you two are in a relationship.”\n“…It appears we can’t hide it anymore. Well, it’s as you say, Kadowaki. We know each other before our second year. I admit that she and I on good terms, but it’s not the relationship you think of.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru flatly denied it, so Amane did the same. However, he was sad to admit it.\nSurely Mahiru would find it awkward if the misunderstanding continued. While Amane was not particularly worried about this, he too would feel awkward if if Kadowaki had strange thoughts and blurted it out. He had to shush Kadowaki.\nOnce Amane took this firm stance, Mahiru tugged at the hem of his shirt, and looked at up him. she appeared to have something to say, but she never did, so he ignored her for the time being.\nOne had to wonder if Kadowaki was convinced of this explanation after seeing their faces, and merely shrugged.\n“Hmm…I guess so. Just like Itsuki said.”\n“What?”\nAmane naturally narrowed his eyes once he assumed Itsuki blurted something. “It’s not what you’re worried about though.” Kadowaki chuckled.\n“Well, he said that you’re handsome when you put in the effort to dress up, and that your clothes suit you.”\n“it sounds like you’re mocking me here, Kadowaki.”\nKadowaki was the most handsome boy in their year, and could possibly the most handsome in their school. Amane could only smile wryly at that praise.\nKadowaki was a typical handsome chap who did not have to work to maintain his image. Amane had to put in effort to look above average, so naturally, he was envious of people like Kadowaki, though not to the level of outright jealousy. However, he felt that his life might look a little brighter if he were reincarnated into someone like Kadowaki.\n“That’s not what I mean. It’ll be great if you’re usually like this though.”\n“Don’t wanna. It’s troublesome. And also, I’ll stand out if I suddenly show up at school like this.”\n“You say that…but Shiina-san, you know that Fujimiya can look like this, huh?”\n“Well, erm, yes.”\nMahiru affirmed as she nodded gingerly, and Kadowaki then stared at her unflinchingly.\nHe did not appear to be suspicious or sizing her up. It appeared that he wanted to confirm something when he looked at her.\n“Hmm, I think I get it.”\n“Get what?”\n“You really have it tough, Shiina-san.”\nMahiru’s body shivered when she heard that, “You’re unexpectedly easy to understand, Shiina-san.” Kadowaki chuckled.\nHe showed a faint smile, a somewhat warm, yet forlorn and envious look.\n“Erm, Kadowaki-san.”\n“Hm?”\n“Erm…I hope you will not mention this to anyone. About how we are on, good terms…and so on.”\nI will be troubled if you do.\nMahiru wanted to shush Kadowaki, who immediately nodded.\n“Ah, you don’t have to worry about that. I can tell why you two are so hesitant. I don’t have any interest in spreading rumors when you two obviously don’t wish to.”\nAmane had never been so grateful for Kadowaki’s fine personality.\nPerhaps Kadowaki had a similar experience. He was popular with the girls, and was the target of envy from boys. He also mentioned before that if he showed fondness of a girl, she would be targeted by the others. Perhaps his grumbles might be due to his own experiences.\nAnyone would feel weird seeing an unimpressive looking boy like Amane being together with the Angel who was friendly towards anyone, even though they were just friends and not dating.\nAmane was really grateful that Kadowaki kept mum after considering all these.\n“Sorry about that Kadowaki.”\n“It’s fine. I think this is normal. I don’t want our relationship to break just because of this little thing when we’re rather close already, Fujimiya.”\nAmane thoroughly understood why Kadowaki was so popular when the latter showed a hearty smile.\nEven as a boy, Kadowaki was a good man who was honest and easily approachable. He was charismatic to the girls, and had good external and internal qualities. It would be difficult for males to accept this however.\n“Ahh yes, Fujimiya.”\n“Hm?”\n“Be seeing you two days later.”\nKadowaki hinted at the day he, Itsuki and Amane would be going to karaoke.\nHe implied that he would be asking more from Amane on that day.\nKadowaki showed an impish smile once their eyes met. Amane felt a little uneasy, “Oh.” but he replied so as he trusted Kadowaki.\nMahiru looked a little envious as she watched both Amane and Kadowaki.",

      "content": "“For some reason, I feel sorry.”\nOnce they bade Kadowaki farewell, the duo played a little longer at the game center before returning home. After that, Amane apologized to Mahiru, who was on the sofa.\nMahiru undid the hair she tied, and she widened her eyes once she said this.\n“Why do you say so?”\n“Well…Kadowaki knows now.”\n“That was unforeseen. The outcome is fine, since he does understand…”\nShe was right to put it that way, but she probably was frustrated, wondering if others thought she was dating anyone.\nThey were lucky that Kadowaki understood them, and left heartily, but Amane’s heart still ached to hear Mahiru deny so flatly.\n“I did not think this would not be exposed when we went out. I did think it may happen; I am grateful that it so happened to be Kadowaki-san.”\n“Well yeah. Kadowaki really understands us in many ways, and is being considerate to us. he’s really a good guy.”\nThey were lucky it was Kadowaki.\nWhile Kadowaki would be questioning Amane later, perhaps it was the right choice to reveal the situation, and not feel the guilt of hiding this matter.\nAmane might end up teased during karaoke, but Kadowaki and Itsuki knew their limits, and probably would not go overboard.\n“…You really fancy Kadowaki-san.”\n“Hm, ah, sorta. Since we got more chances to talk, I get that he’s a really good guy, why he’s that popular. He’s amazing, both on the inside, and the outside.”\n“You really trust him.”\n“Yep. I think he’s trustworthy.”\nAmane was aware that he was very picky about his friends.\nIf the other person had a bad reputation, Amane would try to stay away, and would never allow the person to approach. He had a habit of being wary of others, yet this alarm never rang near Kadowaki.\nHe instinctively sensed that Kadowaki was a good person. Because of that, Amane was not too anxious about this matter being revealed. He felt it was the right decision.\n“So this is what they mean by birds of a feather flock together.”\n“I don’t know how I’m the same as him…”\n“You are being self-deprecating again, Amane-kun…Kadowaki-san approached you because he thought you are a good person, no? Is it not the same logic as how you view him? You find Kadowaki-san trustworthy, and he recognizes you as a person. You should be more confident.”\nMahiru said confidently as she poked her finger at Amane’s cheek. He smiled wryly.\nHe could never defeat Mahiru; rather, whenever he denied himself, she would voice her confidence in him, and he was really grateful for such an existence.\nPlease be more confident in yourself,\nMahiru went into lecture mode, and Amane’s shoulders were huffing from giggling as he thanked her.\n“You’ve always been thanking me, Mahiru.”\n“This is proper praise. it is your fault for denying yourself, Amane-kun.”\n“That’s a habit.”\n“Why did you have such a habit? Goodness.”\nMahiru muttered dumbfoundedly.\nOnce she asked why, Amane had difficulty answering.\nAmane knew the reason why he became like this, and recognized he had a problem, but certain things were pointless even though he knew.\nIt was a bitter memory.\nIt was the past to him, but he had some lingering aftereffects.\nHe knew it was a bad habit, but he could not change it completely. He felt that he should take notice before Mahiru mentioned it, even though it probably would not be changed that easily.\n“Well, I’ll keep it in mind…say Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“…Thanks.”\nAmane’s biggest happiness was to met someone who would acknowledge him when he denied himself.\nHe merely stated what he thought, but Mahiru gave him a shocked look…and leaned on his shoulder.\n“Amane-kun, you really…”\n“Really?”\n“Nothing at all.”\nBaka\n, Mahiru muttered, pressed her forehead on his shoulder, and turned around. Amane did not understand, but he let Mahiru continue as she pleased.",

      "content": "“So, shall we hear an explanation of what happened two days ago?”\nIt was two days after Amane went out with Mahiru.\nAmane, Itsuki and Kadowaki went out for karaoke, and once they entered the booked suite, Kadowaki immediately smiled at Amane.\nAmane steeled himself for Kadowaki’s questions but he felt awkward after all.\nOn a side note, it appeared Itsuki had known from Kadowaki, and was giving a\nah, busted\n, face, yet clearly not hiding his joy.\nAmane got himself some melon soda from the self-service kiosk, had a sip to quench his throat, and said reluctantly.\n“…It’s not really some big relationship. Mahiru and I are just neighbors, Itsuki and Chitose found out because of an accident. It’s a coincidence that we’re neighbors though. Some things happened thereafter, and our relationship got closer.”\n“So you two got closer, and went out together.”\n“Sorta.”\nObjectively looking, Amane and Mahiru were no mere acquaintances. They were clearly friends, or even lovers.\nAmane felt that he had to deny this with all his might, for the sake of Mahiru’s honor.\n“We don’t have that sort of relationship you’re thinking of, Kadowaki.”\n“I don’t think it’s exactly what you say, Fujimiya.”\n“I say.”\n“They’re not just on friendly terms, seriously. Shiina-san’s been cooking for him every day.”\n“Eh?”\nItsuki threw a bomb, and Amane’s cheeks froze as he glared at the former.\n“Itsuki.”\n“It’s a matter of time until everything gets exposed. Better to say it out quickly.”\nItsuki might be correct here, but Kadowaki would surely be mistaken since he suddenly heard that Amane had been eating Mahiru’s cooking every day.\n“…A commuting wife?”\n“No. I’m living by myself, so we split the costs evenly. It’s just more convenient for her to cook.”\n“You believe it?”\n“It’s not convincing at all…”\n“You too Kadowaki…?”\nAmane and Mahiru were definitely not lovers, but Amane strangely lost confidence when Kadowaki glanced aside at him dumbfoundedly. Well, Amane hardly had confidence to begin with.\n“Normally speaking, girls don’t go to those they dislike, and they don’t enter a boy’s room if they’re not comfortable with it. It’s a different case if the girl wants to be attacked however.”\nFor some strange reason, Amane had a feeling that the last quip was out of personal experience, and started to wonder how tricky the girls Kadowaki knew of were. Kadowaki was right however, and Amane could not deny it completely at all.\nGirls, especially those as wary as Mahiru, would never approach boys on their own volition. It appeared that Amane did become close with Mahiru, but that was miraculous by itself. He knew very well that he had received preferential treatment from her.\nAmane however did not think he had enough charm for a girl to fall for him. He had the nagging feeling that Mahiru got close to him, and trusted him, to the point where she was actually relying on him.\n“…Fujimiya, you’re strangely stubborn and lacking in confidence sometimes.”\n“Yeah.”\nItsuki and Kadowaki gave stunned looked, leaving Amane very uncomfortable.\n“So, do you like Shiina-san or not, Fujimiya?”\nThe moment Amane tried to pass this off by sipping at the melon soda, Kadowaki suddenly delivered a haymaker, resulting in him nearly spitting out the soda.\n“…What’s with that out of a sudden?”\n“Ah, you look very wary, so since you two are basically living together, I think you do like her somewhat. Actually, I can tell from your eyes and mood that you really like her.”\n“…Can’t I like her?”\nKadowaki’s really an observant one,\nAmane bitterly thought as he nodded honestly, and for some reason, Kadowaki gave a wry look.\n“N-not that you can’t…but well, looks like there’s lots of tough issues to tackle.”\n“I haven’t thought about going out with Mahiru.”\n“Uh huh, and you don’t understand, just like the last time. Look, even Itsuki’s giving you that look.”\n“Well yeah. I feel like giving him a kick in the back.”\n“I get what you mean.”\n“Don’t agree with each other on this…”\nAmane was confused as to why Kadowaki agreed with Itsuki’s urge to kick Amane in the back.\n“But see, we’re worried about you. You should take the initiative.”\n“Don’t put me in a spot.”\n“No no, Shiina-san has opened her heart to you. Take the initiative to conquer her.”\n“Mahiru does like me to some extent…I think that it’s not that she likes me outright, but that she mostly relies on me.”\nItsuki’s words might sound easy, but it was never going to be that simple.\nAmane knew that Mahiru did have feelings for him. He would admit that Mahiru treasured him more than any other boy.\nHowever, he did not think it was fondness as a girl.\nInstead of a love between boy and girl, it might be more akin to trust and reliance, for they knew everything about each other.\n“See, you’re saying that with that look?”\n“What’s attractive about me anyway?”\nAmane refuted, and Itsuki immediately slapped him in the back.\n“…Ow.”\n“Sorry, but you realllllllllllllyyyy have no confidence in yourself. You always try to run away when the stakes are highest.”\n“…Even if you say so, I can’t help it. It’s habit.”\n“You should start changing that habit. You really look down on yourself.”\n“…Mahiru always says that.”\n“…Shiina-san sure has it tough, huh…?”\n“We’re having it tough just looking at them. This guy’s really stubborn about such things.”\n“Shut up.”\nAmane was starting to feel he was the one at fault after so many people had criticized him.\nIt was due to his personality, nothing he could do; it was not that simple to correct it. The painful memories would never vanish easily. It was not easy to forget at the drop of a hat when it happened not too long ago.\nHe understood he was cowardly, embarrassingly cowardly, but he was powerless to correct it.\n“I’m not going to force you if you think that’s fine. If you really like Shiina-san though, and you want to date her, put in effort.”\n“…You think I can do that?”\n“Coward.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Alright alright. But I think you can be a little more confident, Fujimiya. Seriously, you’ll be very popular at school if you dress up like you did two days ago. Want some practice?”\n“Practice?’\n“Since you can do it before Shiina-san and me, I guess that means you can do this before those you’re close with. Say, it’s rare that we get to play on vacation, right?”\n“…In other words?”\n“We have wax over here.”\nKadowaki pulled out a male makeup set from his bag.\nAmane met Kadowaki in the eyes, and found the latter giving a very genial smile. Faced with the elegance of this smiling Prince however, he felt a shiver up his spine.\n“Shall we?”\n“No, forget about it.”\n“Come on, don’t worry.”\n“Wait, let’s have karaoke. We’re here for karaoke, right?”\n“Of course. I’ll leave it to you then, Itsuki.”\n“Leave it to me.”\n“You’re joking right…?”\nAmane asked timidly, and was met with a hearty smile.\n“We can stop if you hate it…but it’s time for you to start getting used to stares. Better to give some bitter medicine.”\n“Hey wait…woah!”\nItsuki grinned with comb and wax in hands. Amane tried to backtrack, but there was nowhere for him to escape in a karaoke suite.\nKadowaki prepared to sing with a smile on his face, and Amane looked on as Itsuki messed with his hair.",

      "content": "“…Welcome, back…?”\nAmane returned home, and Mahiru welcomed him with a confused tone.\nHamburger steak was on the menu, and Mahiru probably came to Amane’s house earlier to prepare everything from the sauce.\nDinner is almost ready,\nAmane knew she was at his place as he received this message. Nevertheless, he felt peaceful seeing Mahiru’s face.\n“I’m back…”\n“…You seem tired…?”\n“…Itsuki tortured me.”\nItsuki never saw the hairstyle back then, so he fiddled Amane’s hair into one he felt was cool. Amane however was troubled as he was unused to this attire.\nThey then led Amane into a shop which sold clothes Amane never had. They ended up mixing and matching clothes on Amane.\nAmane did not dislike it, but it was tiring to have these two choosing clothes for him.\n“I-is that so? I suppose you are really tired.”\n“…Those guys treated me like a toy…”\n“It is tough on you.”\nAmane was not as unhappy as he said. Mahiru might have realized this when she smiled and coaxed him.\nAmane felt gaudy about Mahiru seeing through him. At the same time, he tossed the bag of new clothes into his room, and went to wash his hands at the washroom.\nMahiru returned to the kitchen to serve dinner. Amane washed his hands, rinsed his mouth, and returned to the living room. She then served the plate of hamburger on the dining table.\nAmane went to the kitchen to scoop the rice like usual, as he would feel sorry for not doing anything.\nHe liked to have his steak with rice, and smiled when he had a whiff of the sweet fragrance of this freshly cooked rice.\n“I’m really tired…but honestly, I think those two are amazing.”\n“How so?”\nAmane served the salad and the potage on the table, sat down, and muttered so. Opposite him, Mahiru tilted her head.\n“Like, when we were walking many people talked to us. It feels like those popular ones are really different. I see that they’re very experienced and skilled in dealing with these people.”\nA few college girls came to talk during their shopping trip after their karaoke session.\nThey were rather different in build, but Itsuki and Kadowaki were rather handsome, and were often the attention of females. There were people trying to woo them.\nOf course, both of them naturally rejected these advances.\nItsuki had his beloved Chitose, and the Prince really had difficulties dealing with females who took the initiative as he smiled away without letting his guard down, quickly rejecting them.\nHe was polite in his words and attitude, and did not hurt their pride. They managed to escape without much of a dispute. Amane was amazed by their methods.\n“…Did anyone approach you?”\n“There were, but I was just a tag-along.”\nTruth be told, they were aiming for those two, and Amane was just along for the ride. Amane knew his attitude was dour, and strangers would have difficulty talking to him.\nObviously Amane would look inferior next to two handsome chaps. None of them went right for Amane while ignoring the other two.\nAmane shrugged and gave a wry smile, and for some reason, Mahiru made a little pout.\n“What. You’re going to say that I lack confidence?”\n“That too, but it is not the issue I have.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“…You do not have to know.”\nMahiru turned her face aside, “Itadakimasu”, and clapped her hands together. Amane was troubled, but like her, he clapped his hands together, giving thanks for dinner and Mahiru.\nAfter Amane left, the two continued their conversation.\n“Say Yuuta, you fine with that?”\n“What?”\n“About Shiina-san.”\n“Ah, there’s no way I’m winning. They…never admitted that they’re dating, but I knew I had no chance the moment I saw Shiina-san’s face.”\n“You angry about this?”\n“Are you being wary?.”\n“I don’t think you’ll feel that way given your personality, but…I just want to be sure, you know? Just asking if you’re really fine with this.”\n“…Actually, I really admire her. I might say I have some feelings.”\n“…”\n“Rather, I always feel that Shiina-san and I are the same kind of person, troubled by the opposite gender, happy to be loved, yet suffering from being so loved. She’s like me, but she handles it better than me, hides all her pain, and just smiles like it’s nothing. I really admire that strength of hers…so when I saw that she found she likes, someone she’s devoted to, I thought I should cheer them on before I could even interrupt.”\n“And you’re being meaningless cool at this again.”\n“Does that have to do with this? Are you even praising me?’\n“Sorta.”\n“Sorta? Ah whatever…to be honest, I don’t hate Fujimiya. He’s a nice guy, and I find it a pity that he himself doesn’t know that.”\n“Yeah.”\n“It has to be those two together. To put it bluntly from me, I’m fine if it’s not Shiina-san. I like her, but it’s not like I have to have her. It’ll be rude of me to snatch her with this little determination, and she definitely doesn’t have any interest in me.”\n“…I see.”\n“Instead of feeling jealous and devastated about losing her…I’m more worried about them. I hope those two can get their happiness.”\n“You’re really a good guy, Yuuta.”\n“Are you looking down on me?”\n“No no no.”\n“Seriously…do your best too, Itsuki.”\n“Definitely.”",

      "content": "※Affection level’s about close to January-February of their first year. Think of it as a what-if story distinct from the main story.\nRipped from here: https://twitter.com/saeki_narou/status/1245330915946942464\n“Say, Mahiru.”\n“What is it?”\nRecently, he had been used to Mahiru’s meal services.\nHer curt voice remained the same as usual, but there seemed to be something different.\n“…Why are you wearing a cap in the house?\nMahiru was wearing a cap. One could not say that it did not suit her. This boyish style certainly suited her.\nHowever, the strange fact was that she was doing so indoors. She, always one to dress appropriately, could not possibly be wearing a cap indoors. There was no reason for her to do so.\nIt would be one thing to say it was a fashion statement. Given Mahiru’s personality however, Amane felt this was rather unnatural.\n“…There is a reason.”\nAfter a short silence, Mahiru answered as she looked aside. Amane had a feeling she was hiding something, and stared at her.\nMahiru would never wear any headdress as she said it would mess her hair; surely she was hiding something.\nPeople would usually hide visible changes like hair loss. It was not impossible for her to lose hair because Amane had been stressing her out.\n“I see…sorry for stressing you out…”\n“I know what you are thinking, but that is not the case. I do not have any skin showing on my head.”\n“I know. There’s no way it’ll drop off in a single day. What are you hiding.”\n“…You will not laugh at me, no?”\n“I won’t laugh at you if you don’t like it. I’m not going to tease you.”\nHe did not know what she was actually hiding, and it probably was something big enough to make her so secretive. It might be rude of him to laugh at her if it was really troubling her, and he did not want to hurt her.\nOnce he answered seriously, Mahiru muttered something, and hesitantly put her hand on the cap.\nShe removed her cap, and revealed what was hidden beneath―there were triangular pet-like parts that should not possibly grow on a human.\n“Say.”\n“Please be quiet.”\n“I didn’t say anything yet…are those real?”\n“I would not be hiding them like a fool if they are fake. I found them growing on me in the morning.”\nIt was impossible to think that Mahiru would make such a joke, or dress up like this. The ears did not seem artificial. Amane stared at them, found them twitching from time to time, and clearly, they were the real deal.\nThey were of the same color as her hair, and one could see capillaries at the earlobes. They were obviously not artificial.\nSince she had such ears\n, he looked towards Mahiru’s waist, and was glared at.\n“Pervert.”\nAmane did not have such deviant thoughts, but it was fact that he looked from her waist to her buttocks, “Sorry” and he could only apologize immediately.\nTo wit, he could not see a tail as it was covered by knitwear and pants.\nHmph,\nso Mahiru snorted, and Amane apologized as he looked towards the triangular ears on her head in a non-disrespectful manner.\nShe already had a pretty face, and a fleeting presence. The addition of the cat emphasized her innocence and cuteness. Amane was not really interested in the kemomimi commonly seen in manga or games, but he had a strange riveting feeling seeing cat ears atop a pretty girl’s face.\nHis impulse could be described as the urge to pat.\nAs a cat lover, Amane was really interested in these ears, and found them really cute. He would want to pat if he could. However, they were part of her, and she would feel something if he did touch. He could not capitalize on this chance.\nHe merely had the urge to touch, and nothing else, but he knew it was possible as he would be touching her.\nThus, he resisted the urge to, and asked Mahiru who was a little nervous.\n“Got any idea why this happened?”\n“I would not be so troubled if I have. However,”\n“However?”\n“…I have a dream that I will be back to normal if I am doted on.”\n“By who?”\n“I do not know.”\nMahiru sounded a little colder than before, and it appeared she was in a bad mood. Amane realized this, but he wondered what he should do.\nShe said she could return to normal if she was doted, but nobody knew if this stupid condition would actually work. Also, what did it mean for her to be doted?\nWas it fine if she was doted on like a cat?\nHowever, Amane could not simply touch her, and could not try it―he glanced aside at Mahiru, and in a corner of his eyes, he saw the ribbon on the shelf, which his mother gave to tie food up\nIt appeared cats liked things that moved about, and as with this flimsy consideration, he took the ribbon before Mahiru’s eyes, and shook it before her. In that instant, the ribbon was slapped aside.\nHe shook the ribbon again.\nAnd the little hand slapped it aside again.\nAnother ten seconds of silence beckoned. Her white face turned red.\n“…Amane-kun.”\n“N-no, I was just wondering if you will pay attention to it, since you’re a cat now.”\n“P-pay attention…I think my eyes just naturally followed it…”\nIt was truly an adorable sight to see Mahiru stare intently at the ribbon as he shook it and flail her hand at it. Amane had the use to tease her with the ribbon.\nShe was not purring, but she was being attentive while being teased, and her cat ears twitched. She was already similar to a cat, and Amane sensed that she was increasingly similar to one. No, she was already a cat.\nHe knew that she would be angry thereafter, but the adorable sight before him at this point left him unable to resist the urge. From time to time, he shook the ribbon, and Mahiru finally could not resist the urge as she leapt at the ribbon.\nWhile she was acting like a cat, her weight did not change, and Amane tumbled over, lying face up on the sofa.\nHe groaned as he was pushed down by her, though it was due to this unexpected, sudden action than her weight.\nAs he felt this moderate weight on himself, Amane stared at her.\nHer face was redder than before due to excitement, and she was staring at Amane…or actually, the ribbon he was holding, her eyes sparkling. She really was like a cat, and he gave a wry smile.\nBefore he knew it, the tail hidden under her pants poked out, standing straight.\nAh, so she has a tail\n, so he thought. He looked up again, saw that she seemed to have regained her sanity, rooted as she sprawled on him.\n“You alright?”\n“…Uu, nya.”\nIt was the first time she made a cat-like voice, and she shivered as she started to struggle. It would be dangerous if she fell off the sofa suddenly, so Amane hurriedly grabbed her with his hand.\nAmane’s senses were agitated in various ways, whether it was the sweet fragrance or the soft sensation. The most impressionable however was her blushing face and shivering body. She really was adorable.\n“I-I get it. I get it. I know you’re embarrassed, but it’s dangerous for you to fall off, so hang on.”\n“U-uuー”\n“Sorry! It’s my fault! Please calm down or I can’t let you go!”\nMahiru was unable to calm down, and Amane was worried that she might fall if he let go. No matter how athletic she might be, it would be an awkward landing if she fell sideways from the sofa.\nHe looked aside as he patted her back to calm her down. Mahiru gulped, and headbutted onto his chest.\nClearly she was kicking a fuss, but since he was the one who teased her, he could only let her be.\n“…Amane-kun, are you enjoying this?”\n“N-no, that…a little.”\n“So you are!”\n“I-I can’t help it. You’re cute…”\nEven leaving aside the fact that she was a girl, this adorable pretty girl had cat ears. Obviously he had the urge to keep looking and teasing her.\nIt was fact that he might have overdone it. He wanted to apologize as he looked at her, and Mahiru headbutted her head into his chest again.\nIt really hurt this time, “ugh” and he groaned. Mahiru did not lift her face however as she muttered, “…Please dote on me as you like.”\n“Huh, eh?”\n“I-I i need to know if I will return to normal by doing this! I have to pin my hopes on the suspicious voice.”\nOr it will be terrible if this continues.\nMahiru’s voice started to sound teary. Amane too started to panic. He realized that he should not be hesitant to dote her; he should be finding a way to get her back to normal. At that moment, Mahiru reached her head towards him, wordlessly pleading for him to pet her head.\nWill she really be back to normal if I dote on her…?\nAmane was greatly skeptical of this, but he had to try to know. He hugged Mahiru, sat up, and patted her head.\nHer cuticle was smooth and glossing, and felt smoother than expected. Whenever the hair strands slipped through his fingers, Amane could smell a faint sweet smell.\nThe little ears poking through her hair were softer, silky smoother, and very fine.\nThe ears were thinner than he expected, yet full of warmth.\nAs he gently rubbed the fluffy ears with his fingers, her body suddenly shivered. He hurriedly let go, thinking that he had hurt her. However, she shook her head, and it appeared she wanted to continue.\nHe continued to gently caress her head and cat ears as though they were fragile. “Funya.” she let out a sweet cat-like voice.\n…For some reason, this is draining my conscience away.\nEven though he was merely patting her head and cat ears, he felt that he was doing something very bad.\nHe was a little hesitant, wondering if he should continue like this. However, Mahiru did not look disgusted, and there was a chance she would be back to normal if he doted her…he continued to coax her with his fingertips and palm, but Mahiru suddenly grabbed his hand.\nAmane wondered what was going on. He stopped, looked at Mahiru, and saw her hazy eyes staring at him. His heart jolted.\nMahiru did not seem to mind Amane as she reached her tongue out to lick his fingertips.\n“…Ma-Mahiru!?”\nHe felt a scalding sensation on his fingers, and realized then that her tongue was not as rough as a cat.\nAmane’s face was hotter than her tongue though, and his face went red.\nIt was not strange for a cat to lick her master’s fingers, but he felt that her sucking his fingers was an immoral sight.\nHe hurriedly pushed Mahiru’s shoulders away, and looked right into the confused caramel eyes.\nA tad later, Mahiru might have understood what she just did when she saw his face―her face boiled red, she hurriedly stood up, and escaped to the washroom.\n“Uunnnnyyyyaaaaaaaaaa!” The voice she made when she retreated really resembled a cat, so Amane analyzed with his remaining bit of sanity. The other shreds of sanity had him recalling the heat and feeling of the tongue, prompting him to start rolling on the floor.\nThud, thud, his heart was pounding louder than before. He looked towards the washroom she vanished into, and was dumbfounded.\n10 minutes later, Mahiru returned from the washroom. The ears and tail had vanished from her, and in place of those was the wariness of a stray cat meeting a stranger for the first time, along with a thoroughly embarrassed face. She kept her distance from Amane the entire time.\nSeems like her cat-like habits haven’t disappeared completely,\nso Amane quietly thought.",

      "content": "Golden Week ended, and it was time for school again. The moment Amane entered the classroom, he heard a ruckus, and was increasingly perturbed.\nIt was common to see a commotion in the classroom right after a holiday, when people would talk about the souvenirs they bought. The commotion on this day however was different from usual.\nInstead of a discussion of what happened during the vacation, it appeared they were discussing rumors.\nAmane put his bag on his seat, and pricked his ears―It appeared they were talking about Mahiru.\n“I heard Shiina-san went out on a date with a really handsome guy.”\n“Maybe it’s the guy rumored at the start of the year?”\n“She said she’s not dating, but…”\nAmane’s face twitched the moment he heard the word ‘date’.\nThough he had somewhat expected that he would be spotted, he never thought this topic would be a hot one through the entire classroom.\nThe girls chatted rumors as they looked towards Mahiru.\nIt appeared Mahiru had not noticed it, or perhaps she did, but ignored them. She was preparing for the first eriod.\nHer dignified, innocent look remained one of much attention, but the stares towards her on this day were filled with much curiosity.\n“H-hey, Shiina-san.”\nOne of those girls seemed to have resolved herself as she spoke to Mahiru.\n“Erm, Shiina-san, a few days ago, I saw you with a man at the shopping mall.”\n“Yes, that did happen.”\n“Are you dating you?”\nShe’s a warrior to dare ask Mahiru head on,\nAmane thought as he watched. He was worried, and Mahiru merely blinked away.\nIt appeared Mahiru would respond in her usual angelic mode.\nYes. She probably would deny it with an angelic smile, if it was the usual her.\n“I guess it was a date, if we consider the definition of one.”\nOne had to wonder what Mahiru was thinking when she actually admitted it.\nThe definition of a date was basically an appointment between male and female. She was right in this sense…but there was no way the girls would actually follow that strict definition.\nKYAAAAAAA\n, hysterical shrieks followed.\nNo matter the occasion, females always loved to gossip passionately about others. Usually, Amane could watch them from afar and just dismiss it as them being able to talk, but he could not do so this time as he was the party implicated.\n“Shiina-san, you’re dating that man? It’s the first time I heard of it!”\n“We aren’t dating, but he is the person most important to me!”\nAs shrieks and squeals escalated, Amane’s gut started to wince.\nMahiru was not lying at all. Amane knew she really treasured him. However, she was not stating the exact facts, but rather, the situation that could be understood in many ways.\nThe moment Mahiru did so, there would be rumors that she liked that man. Mahiru merely smiled as she saw these excited girls however.\nShe glanced aside at Amane, showing a non-angelic smile. Amane clutched his forehead, looking happy, embarrassed, while suffering from gut pain.\nIt appeared Itsuki too was eavesdropping, for he smirked as he slapped Amane’s shoulder. Amane felt fatigue looming onto him in a single instance.\n“To be honest, I don’t think that could be denied.”\nThe duo dropped by at a fast food restaurant after school, and Itsuki mentioned this after seemingly thought of something.\nDespite having lunch, Amane was hungry after their afternoon gym class. They were chatting while eating fries. itsuki showed a wry smile as he seemingly recalled the commotion in the morning.\nAnd due to the chaotic day, Amane never got to eat with Mahiru. The latter was questioned by everyone all day, and Amane really could not sit with her.\n“Couldn’t be denied?”\nItsuki probably meant that they could not deny it like before, but Amane did not know why.\n“I say, Yuuta already can tell you two are close on first glance. You two definitely held hands when walking, right?”\n“Ugh.”\n“She couldn’t deny it when people saw that. That’s why she could only say that.”\nNow that he mentioned it, Amane could not refute it at all.\nIt was true that objectively speaking, their little trip days ago might appear like an intimate date. From time to time, they did hold hands, lean on each other , and smiled at each other. Clearly they were a couple to those not in the know.\nThus, Mahiru’s response was to be expected…it seemed.\n“And that’s also for show.”\n“For show?”\n“She’s trying to shoo the boys, and show that she has no intention of fighting against the other girls, you know? Yuuta’s the same. Once he got popular, there’s some who got jealous. I guess that applies for that Angel too. If she hints that she has someone she likes and ignores everyone else, nobody will think she’s interested in Yuuta, even if she does interact with someone like him.”\n“…I see.”\nAmane was not one of the popular ones, and did not give such a vibe. No matter how popular he might be, a small minority could not accept it. It was impossible to please everyone.”\nAmane had never seen anyone criticize Mahiru to her face, but surely there were some who were displeased with her.\nOnce anyone was popular, those of the same gender would have bias against that person. It appeared to be a common trend between both male and female.\n“But I guess she has another goal. Just think of it.”\nItsuki mentioned that Mahiru had another objective to this, but Amane could not imagine it.”\nAmane could not think there was anything other than for other boys to give up, and other girls to stop being jealous of her.\n“Say, Amane-kun.”\n“What?”\nItsuki looked stunned when he saw how clueless Amane was, but he merely shrugged and ended this conversation.\n“You don’t stand out the way you are right now, but if you tidy yourself up, nobody will say anything if you walk next to her. Stop denying yourself.”\nItsuki said these words to curb Amane’s habit of self-doubt. The latter nodded begrudingly.\n“…I know.”\n“Sigh, well, your virtue is that you don’t get carried away, but it’s also your fault. Why do you lack such confidence? It’s completely rooted within you.”\n“Why, you ask…it’s because of something that happened in the past.”\n“Is it alright for you to tell me what it is?”\n“It’s not like I’m actively trying to hide it. It’s just not something to talk about.”\nAmane did not have a tragic past, and he was not bullied by anyone.\nIt was simply that the person he once trusted denied him, and said he had no value.\nHe still could not forget this little incident, and was ashamed of it. It continued to torment his heart, and he was still in pain.\nThis pain did not work up like before, but he still would feel some emptiness.\nEver since he met Mahiru, he was no longer tormented by self-loathing, but his self-doubt still lingered.\n“I’ll hear you out when you want to talk then.”\nItsuki did not intend to pursue the matter.\nHe really had good instincts, or rather, he was adept at testing the limits the other party would not want to cross. He was always the moodmaker, for he was able to sense the little changes in mood.\nItsuki backed down easily, and giggled at Amane.\n“Well, you should have a little more self-confidence. You’re no longer your past self. How about you change your image completely?”\n“Forget about it.”\n“How petty. I was looking forward to the ‘before’ and ‘after. Well, that’s fine. Try getting her to look at you more before you deny that possibility. You’re not aggressive enough.”\n“Aggressive, huh?”\n“Push her down aggressively.”\n“Are you an idiot? How can I do that?”\nAmane believed that if he really did so, she would surely despise him.\nIt was completely different from headpatting and holding hands. Mahiru was sensitive to this matter because of her parents. Amane was not dating her, but trusted by her. Surely she would revile him if he did such a thing.\nIt was completely different from a mere skinship.\n“Well, you should hug her at least.”\n“Who do you think I am…?”\n“You’re not confident, you’re dishonest, you’re a coward. You can touch her instinctively, but you never take the initiative to.”\n“Ugh…wait, how are you so sure about that skinship stuff?”\n“Hm? Chii told me.”\nDo you mind not revealing that?\nHow much did Mahiru tell Chitose? Is this the reason why Chitose seems to be leering at me?\n“Look, guys need some guts. You don’t have to confess, but since you can hold hands, you can go a little further. Try closing the distance.”\n“You make it sound easy.”\n“I’m seriously so anxious for you, I feel like kicking you in the back. She opened her heart to you, and some skinship is fine as long as it’s not sexual harassment. I heard from Chii that you’ve been giving her heatpats, right? What’s wrong with a hug then?”\n“Don’t say the impossible.”\nI did actually hug her before.\nHowever, Amane could not say that.\nHe did so back then to support Mahiru, who was on the verge of breaking down, and it was not for the sake of love. Amane felt he could not embrace her lovingly. In the first place, would she agree?\n“How about you try asking her? I think she’ll agree to that easily.”\n“How’s that possible…?”\n“Who knows? She actually allows contact from those she’s very close with. Chii said that when she stayed over, they bathed together and slept in the same futon.”\nMahiru did stay over at Chitose’s place during Golden Week. Amane never expected their relationship to be so good.\nHowever, he had a feeling that it was because Chitose was pestering Mahiru.\n“I’ll feel bad for you if Chii snatches her away.”\n“Say…don’t compare a fellow female friend with someone like me.”\n“Hm, well, no point talking about that. How about you try hugging her? Put some effort into it, will ya?”\nItsuki cackled away, “sure is easy of you to point fault from the side”, Amane muttered as he took the hardened bits of fries left in the box, and poured it into his mouth.",

      "content": "“…Mahiru.”\nAfter dinner, Amane recalled what Itsuki mentioned, and called for her name hesitantly.\nShe was seated next to him, “Hm?” and tilted her head as she looked towards him.\n“Ah-ah…erm, well.”\n“Hm?”\nIt appears you have something to say.\nShe waited patiently for him to continue, while he remained frustrated about what he should say.\nOne reason was that when Amane and Itsuki went their separate ways, the latter give him a nudge saying, “Hug her if you have the guts”. Another reason was that he was curiously interested if Mahiru would forgive him if he hugged her.\nAlso, Mahiru was delicate, tender, and smelled good. Any boy of this age would want to hug her. Any youth would have such an impulse.\nBut he could not simply ask her, “Can I hug you.” Surely she would roll her eyes at him, going “what are you saying?”\nAnd if he suddenly hugged her, she might refuse. It was a dilemma.\n“…We have tests next week.”\nBeing passive, Amane changed the topic.\nMahiru obviously knew this was not the topic he referred to, but it seemed she knew he was unwilling to say it, and gave a wry smile.\n“Yes. But it is easy since we are not tested lots.”\n“Yeah.”\nIt was an abrupt change of topics, but Mahiru continued. Amane felt heavy-hearted, as though his shame and cowardice was bared before him.\nHe ended up saying.\n“…What is it?’\n“Nothing…I’m so hopeless…”\n“Why are you denying yourself again. Did someone say anything to you?”\n“Nope. it’s different this time.”\nAmane merely felt despair at his own weakness.\n“Goodness. I really do not understand, but please buck up.”\nMahiru reached to pat Amane’s head, and he had no intention to refuse as he let her be.\nHer movements were earnest, familial, and kind, easily capable of lulling anyone to sleep. As she patted, Amane felt strength sapped away from him.\nThe tension he had before was gone, and before he knew it, he let her do as she pleased.\n“Ahh…how am I supposed to say this…”\n“What?”\n“Like, can I hug you? Or something like that.”\n“You just did.”\nAmane blinked as he stared at Mahiru, and found her with her head lifted towards him.\n“…Can you pretend not to hear it?”\n“No can do.”\nPlease do not put me on the spot,\nshe narrowed her eyes, and he felt his face cringing.\nHe really did not intend to say it.\nHis sanity told him that it was a bad thing to say so to a girl he was not dating. Also, he was a coward who always put himself in check. Once he mentally let go however, he just blurted it out.\nHe gingerly looked over at her face. However, she did not appear to be uncomfortable with it. She looked stunned, seemingly out of it, shocked, as though she had an out-of-body experience. This in turn left Amane shocked.\n“I will not be angry about this. At most, I am amazed to say that you are a boy after all.”\n“…I don’t like how you’re being accepting of this…”\n“No?”\n“It’s not like I want to touch just anyone.”\nIf the reason was that he was a boy after all, it would be akin to say that he was fine with any girl.\nHe wanted to hug her, embrace her softness, and touch her because she was Mahiru…even though he might sound like a pervert. No matter how pretty and alluring a girl would cling onto him, he was confident that he could reject the girl. Rather, he did not want to interact with any unacquainted female, no matter the intentions.\nMahiru froze once she heard his flat-out denial.\nA faint color started to arise within her snowy white skin, and he realized that he let his tongue slip a second time.\nThus, Amane was left ashamed, his face searing, and his vision was swimming about.\n“Erm, ah…”\n“… Shall we?”\nMahiru said timidly, and Amane was at a loss of words.\nIt was Amane who said he wanted to hug, even though he just blurted it, but nobody would have expected Mahiru to actually agree.\nOf course, Mahiru would not invite just anyone. Amane knew she said so because she trusted him―but that request was really bad for his heart.\nShe blushed, and her eyes were moist as she looked up at Amane when she said so. Naturally, his sanity could not be contained.\nHe cautiously reached his hands towards Mahiru, and hugged her delicate body by her arms, wrapping his arms around her back.\nIt was the second time he hugged her firmly, but it was different from the time she cried. She was willing to be in his clutches.\nThat day, he never could feel her, but as he hugged her, he experienced how slender and feeble Mahiru was. She had lean shoulders, and her arms were frailly thin.\nThere was a sweet smell coming from Mahiru’s neck, and Amane had a feeling this was going to end up bad.\nDespite how agitated he was feeling, Amane managed to say his true thoughts calmly.\nHe was relieved to have Mahiru next to him. Rather, through this skinship, Amane felt happy.\n“…Amane-kun, I heard that by hugging 30 seconds, you can reduce a third of your day’s stress.”\nMahiru whispered in his clutches as she nudged her body slightly.\n“So there’s no stress if I hug for 90 seconds?”\n“I do not know…but I feel that my stress for the day is gone.”\n“Is that so?”\n“After all, many people asked me questions today.”\nOnce he heard that, Amane recalled of the conversation Mahiru had with the girls.”\n“Ah…erm…the most important person.”\nOnce Amane asked hesitantly, Mahiru, who buried her head in his chest, lifted it.\nShe was not looking embarrassed, but was giving a slightly forlorn smile.\n“…For me, the world is really small. I can count the number of people I like with a single hand. I am like a little hakoniwa…of them all, you are the closest to me, Amane-kun. You said I should be myself.”\n“…Mahiru.”\n“So you should have a little more confidence in yourself, Amane-kun. You should impose yourself more.”\nBecause you are too humble,\na wry smile appeared on Mahiru’s face, and Amane felt some heat from his eyelids.\n“Can I really?”\n“Of course. Please do the same as you did when you encouraged me.”\n“…I see.”\n“If you lack confidence, I shall encourage you anytime and embrace you. You should be fine with that, I suppose?”\n“Yeah.”\nOnce he heard her powerful words, Amane buried his face into her shoulder, and hid his expression.\nHe hoped to support Mahiru, but he ended up supported by her. He really could not laugh at this situation, but perhaps it was really like him.\n“…Has your stress vanished, Amane-kun?”\n“Just let me be for a little longer.”\n“Yes, sure.”\nAmane seemingly fawned about as he remained on Mahiru,\ngoodness me\n, who answered as she gave him such a smile.",

      "content": "“Huh, you’re serious this time Amane.”\nIt was break time, and Amane was staring at the whiteboard, copying notes when Itsuki approached him. Itsuki looked a little surprised as he exclaimed.\nThis notebook was good for recapping the lessons, and summarized the important points well, to the point where he could be proud of it. “Wow, you really put in work” when Itsuki peeked at the notebook, he looked dumbfounded and amazed.\n“Hmm…just wanted to work a little harder.”\n“What’s the occasion?”\n“Nothing really…just want to do something I can be proud of.”\nAmane had a goal, to not be so grumpy, hard on himself, and be confident. He decided to improve his grades as the first step to building confidence.\nIt so happened that there were upcoming tests, so he decided to score better this time around.\nAmane had above average grades. He wanted to use this chance to get into the top 10.\nThere was no way he could beat Mahiru for first, so he decided to aim for the top 10 for the time being. His grades would also affect his post-graduation, so it was a perfect goal for him.\n“I don’t know how to become a better man, and the definition of it differs from person to person. Anyway, let’s just make sure that I don’t embarrass her.”\n“I think you’re fine like this. You just need more confidence.”\n“It’s for the sake of gaining confidence.”\nAmane was only getting encouraged, and was not completely confident. He needed something he could be confident of.\nDespite that, the only thing he could do was to study.”\n“You’re not tidying your hair?”\n“That’s a different matter. I don’t need to do so now.”\nItsuki probably was hinting at Amane to maintain that old hairstyle, but Amane was unsure if he could actually cultivate this confidence in this state.\nAlso, there was a simple, major reason. If he were to appear as the boy they were talking about, Amane had a feeling the other boys would slaughter him out of envy. He thus chickened out.\nThe ‘important person’ Mahiru spoke of seemed to have shocked many boys.\nWhen they used to talk about the Angel, none of them mentioned anything about love. She just personally mentioned the term ‘most important person’ however. The power was enough to discourage her admirers.\nThe last time someone spotted her walking with anyone else, she denied it, saying they did not have such a relationship. It appeared she was hinting at one this time, which caused much guessing, and a major incident.\nAmane was the rumored boy. He really wished others would not discuss this before the true identity of the boy.\n“I just hope that you can finish your transformation soon and scare them. At least I can brag to others that you’re a friend I can be proud of.”\n“What’s the point?”\n“Hm, if you get a positive opinion, I’ll be happy, you know?”\n“…Really?”\nAmane felt a little bashful when Itsuki said so, but he did not know if he was just overimagining it.\nHe felt he did have a very good friend. he turned his face aside, not wanting this emotion to appear on his face, but Itsuki burst out laughing, as though he had seen through Amane completely.",

      "content": "“Say Mahiru. Itsuki and Kadowaki are having a study group at my place next Saturday. You fine with that?”\nAfter dinner, Amane and Mahiru brought the dishes to the basin when he suddenly asked her, seemingly having recalled something.\nAmane was going to focus and study hard for this exam. In the meantime, he asked if Itsuki and Kadowaki could join.\nOn a side note, Itsuki could get good grades if he studied well, but his grades were average otherwise. Kadowaki was an all-rounder who excelled at studies. He was athletic, had the looks, and was no slouch in studies either. Anyone would take their hat off for him.\nAmane was fine with opening a study group, since their presence would not affect him…but he was starting to worry about Mahiru’s thoughts, given that she would be cooking.\n“I am fine. Shall I cook for everyone?”\n“I guess. Thanks for doing this much…but are you okay with that?”\n“It is just an increase in portion. That should be fine…may I join too?”\n“If you don’t mind…maybe you can invite Chitose along too? I don’t know if she’s free though. I’m not sure if she’ll study for real.”\nChitose was not really a serious person. She could study at least, but she was not particularly smart.\nAt the very least, Amane could not imagine her studying seriously.\n“That will not be a problem…I have invited her.”\n“Eh?”\n“No, she said,\ndad will tell me off if I don’t score well for the tests this time~,\nso I did have plans to study with Chitose-san this Saturday.”\n“Wait, was he aiming for Chitose to begin with?”\nItsuki was the one who suggested this study group, and Amane suspected that he did so knowing that Chitose made such arrangements.\nThese guys,\nAmane noted wryly as he washed the stained plates with hot water. Mahiru too smiled as she put the cooled leftovers into the lunch box.\n“I guess. Even if that’s the case, this study group will be really lively.”\n“You don’t mind the noise Mahiru?”\n“I am fine. I do normally study after all, so I am not that worried.”\nAmane knew that Mahiru could say such words easily due to the hard work she usually put in. He did not have much thought about it.\nHe was however curious as to how she was able to study so efficiently.\n“Say Mahiru, can I see your notes later?”\n“Of course. Your notes are pretty too, Amane-kun.”\n“Well, I think they’re decent there, but I want to see the notes of our valedictorian.”\n“There is nothing much to look forward to.”\nMahiru giggled as she put the leftovers into the bridge.\nThe dinner put into the fridge was to be Amane’s breakfast the next day, and as Amane washed the dishes, he quietly worshiped Mahiru. Amane’s dinner and breakfast were cooked by Mahiru, and he ended up eating and living healthily every day.\n“Amane-kun, you are working hard for these tests.”\n“Hm, part of increasing my own confidence. Since I want to do it, I should go all out.”\n“I see…shall I give you some motivation?”\n“Motivation?”\n“If you manage to get into the top 10, I shall give you a lap pillow and dig your ears, Amane-kun. You slept soundly the last time, so I suppose you really enjoy it.”\nI do not know if this is a reward however,\nMahiru said with a smile.\nThis is a great reward\n, Amane thought to himself as he washed the dishes.\nWhat is she saying now,\nhe wondered, but he could not resist the charm of the lap pillow. Even if he wanted to refuse, “If you do not want it, I suppose we can pass on it.” Mahiru ended up commenting sadly, and Amane instinctively answered “I’ll take your word for it then”.\nHe was a little disgusted with how he was too honest with his desires, “It is a promise then.” but Mahiru smiled somewhat bashfully. Amane easily lost to his desire and accepted this.",

      "content": "“Pardon our intrusion.”\nIt was around 10am or so on the Saturday right before the tests. Itsuki, Chitose and Kadowaki arrived right on time. They greeted in unison, and entered through the entrance.\nTheir middle schools were all in the same area, so they met up before arriving. The main reason was that Kadowaki did not know where Amane lived, but another reason was that they were all on good terms.\n“Oh, welcome.”\n“Where’s Mahirun?”\n“She’s preparing lunch in the kitchen.”\nMahiru arrived earlier at Amane’s place, and was preparing lunch. She went ahead to prepare serving the others, as she did not have to rush with her studies.\nOn a side note, she was cooking roast beef. Once preparations were done, she would leave the beef to set, and they should be able to enjoy some sufficiently tender beef for lunch.\n“…She’s so used to it huh…”\n“Shut up.”\n“She’s like a newlywed wife welcoming your colleagues.”\n“I’m not giving you breakfast if you say anymore.”\n“No~! I want to eat Mahirun’s cooking~!”\nWhat nonsense are you saying?\nAmane cursed, and looked at Kadowaki, finding the latter staring at him somewhat dumbfoundedly.\n“What?”\n“…Nothing. It’s just that, Shiina-san so naturally shows up at your place, Fujimiya.”\n“…I don’t have a choice. She’s always been cooking for me.”\nAmane turned his head aside, and found Itsuki giggling while covering his mouth. Amane was reminded of his mother’s smile, and was frustrated. He gently kicked at Itsuki’s calf.\n“Welcome everyone…ah, is something wrong with Akazawa-san?”\n“Don’t worry.”\nMahiru was probably worried to see Itsuki’s mysterious smile, but that worry was redundant, and Amane hoped she would not mind.\nDespite being skeptical, it appeared she had nothing to worry about, and showed her usual smile. “Please proceed to the living room. I have some things to prepare.” the apron fluttered as she turned to return to the kitchen.\n“She looks like a newlywed.” Itsuki muttered as he witnessed that back. This time, Amane slapped him in the back.\n“Let us begin studying then.”\nAfter preparing lunch, Mahiru served tea, and sat next to Amane. As for why she was sitting next to Amane, that was due to the other trio’s plotting.\n“Yes~”\n“Erm, what do you not understand, Chitose-san? This is mathematics, I guess?”\n“Everything.”\n“E-everything…”\n“Chii’s bad at maths. Best she can do is pass.”\nChitose could study, but she was not exactly capable of it. She was rather bad at mathematics, and somehow, would miraculously avoid failing.\nMahiru’s face twitched the moment she heard ‘everything’. Nevertheless, it was to be expected that Chitose really did not understand. Luckily, she had some fundamentals.\n“She can’t handle applied problems. The best way is to teach her how to apply formulas to them.”\n“Is she fine with formulas?”\n“…Should be?”\n“More or less.”\nAmane sensed that Chitose still had issued, and hoped Mahiru would start teaching her from there. Chitose was not dumb in any way, but she could not solve them as she did not know how to apply. She should be capable of getting some marks once she understood those.\n“Anyway Itsuki, put in some effort.”\n“Hahaha.”\n“Don’t pull a fast one on me by laughing. Study.”\nWhat does he think a study group is for?”\n“Yuuta~ Amane’s so strict~”\n“It’s about time you get serious, Itsuki.”\nKadowaki refused to help with a hearty smile, and Itsuki dropped his shoulders, looking devastated.\nKadowaki had opened his textbooks and notes, and was studying diligently. Amane hoped that both Itsuki and Chitose would learn from him.\nOn a side note, Kadowaki had no particular weak subjects, and was an outstanding boy with above average scores.\nAmane too had no weak subjects. All he had to do was to memorize and apply what he studied.\nHe left Chitose’s tuition to Mahiru, and looked at the world history textbook he had prepared for himself.",

      "content": "“…I’m bored~”\nAbout two hours after the study group started, Chitose muttered in annoyances, and laid backwards. She then rolled about on the floor.\nChitose was wearing shorts and tights, so there was no worry of seeing her panties. Amane however picked the sofa blanket and threw it onto her lap, and lifted his head to look at the time.\n“Guess it’s about time to rest. It’s past noon.”\n“Yeah. It’s almost time for lunch…”\n“Mahirun’s cooking!”\nOnce she heard of Mahiru’s cooking, Chitose was revived as though she was given money.\nShe got up easily, and tapped at the table.\n“What’s for lunch today?”\n“Roast beef for mains.”\n“That’s quite filling for lunch…”\n“I remembered Amane-kun said he wanted some…”\n“Thanks for that.”\nAmane did say that he wanted to eat it, but he never expected Mahiru to cook for him, and was really grateful.\nAccording to Mahiru, this dish was easier to prepare than Amane imagined, so the plan was for them to have some meat, and to continue studying after food.\nHowever, Amane had a feeling that a certain person might not study after school. It would depend on her however, so Amane did not retort.\n“I shall go prepare it. Please wait.”\n“Ah, I’ll help serve too.”\nMahiru took some of her studying time to cook for them, and after all, Amane had been asking her to do so.\nLike usual, Amane suggested to help, “”lease do.”Mahiru smiled and nodded.\nThe dishes were already done, and they simply needed to heat it and serve it on plates. Amane only helped with serving the dishes…but it was all he could do.\n“You three clear the table. I’ll get a cloth…what’s with you.”\n“Nothing nothing~”\n“Tell me that after you hide that annoying face of yours.”\nAmane narrowed his eyes at a leering Chitose, and then followed Mahiru into the kitchen.\nHe took out the folded tablecloth from the basket, soaked and wrung it dry. At the same time, Mahiru took out a pot of potage from the fridge, and put it on the stove.\n“Amane-kun, please cut the lettuce later. I am cutting other vegetables.”\n“Okay.”\nThis little task was easy, so once Amane handed the wet cloth to Itsuki, he returned to the kitchen, washed his hands, and began cutting the two lettuce rolls Mahiru prepared.\nThey had more than sufficient. They were preparing food for five, three of them being hungry high school boys.\nIt appeared Mahiru knew that a high school boy’s appetite was not one to be underestimated. The other vegetables were rather bountiful. One reason however was that it really was just like Mahiru to wish that everyone would have more nutrition.\n“…It’s amazing how he instinctively acted.”\n“Right~?”\n“I didn’t get to show up, in more ways than one.”\nAmane heard such voices behind him as he cut the lettuce and stuffed them into the bowls.\nFive people’s worth of dishes were served on the same table.\nThe salad, and even the roast beef was sufficiently plentiful for three high school boys. The corn potage was sufficient enough for them to ask for seconds.\nOn a side note, they voted on whether to have bread or rice, and rice won. They too could have seconds. Amane loved rice, and was pleased to help himself.\n“Please help yourself.”\nMahiru showed a more angelic smile than usual as she coax them to each, and so the four of them clapped hands, said thanks, and began eating.\n“Delish.”\nItsuki quickly brought the roast beef to his mouth, commenting so. It appeared Mahiru was relieved as she smiled.\n“It’s really good, Shiina-san.”\n“Thank you very much. I did not add any flavorings though. It has nothing to do with skill.”\n“You’re being humble again.”\nHumble huh?\nItsuki laughed, and started gobbling down as he was probably hungry. Amane showed a wry smile seeing him like this.\n“It’s good~!” Chitose too giggled as she ate lots of meat, gorging as much as Itsuki, and the portions of roast beef quickly vanished.\nKadowaki in turn ate rather calmly. Amane hoped they could learn from Kadowaki.\nAmane then started eating the meat a tad later.\nRoast beef was unpalatable either when either overcooked or undercooked, but the meat was just right, tender and juicy. It did not feel dry. The freshness of the meat was contained, and he could feel the fragrance brimming with every bite.\nMeat is good after all.\nAmane was not really a meat lover compared to other boys, but he did find it delicious. The biggest reason was that he liked anything Mahiru cooked, that her cooking was delicious.\nAmane sighed blissfully, and showed a smile on his face.\n“You really can cook, Shiina-san. I’ve seen your bento, and it’s really great.”\n“Thank you for the compliments.”\n“I don’t know how to cook. The idea of staying alone during college is driving me angsty.”\n“…There are some who can live alone without knowing how to cook, you know?”\n“You’re talking about me right?”\nAmane had a feeling Mahiru was discreetly telling him off, but she was right, and he had nothing to grumble.\nAfter all, after Mahiru had taken care of him for so long, he should be kneeling down and thanking her. Thus, her words were to be expected.\n“Actually, it’s true that I can’t cook at all. I really have to thank you every day.”\n“I-I am not blaming you. Erm, I do not dislike cooking for you, Amane-kun.”\n“Really? That’s great.”\nAmane might never recover if Mahiru said she disliked it, even though he felt she would never say so.\n“But well, you really are the type to work hard for others, Shiina-san. You’ll make a good bride.”\n“B-bride…”\n“Yuu-chan’s right~”\nChitose referred to Kadowaki with a cute nickname, and continued,\n“I guess Mahirun doesn’t need training on how to be a bride.”\n“You should be the one training with Mahiru.”\n“That sounds really good, but I’ll be a third wheel.”\n“Wheel?”\n“No, nothing~ I’m happy with Mahirun teaching me how to cook. Please continue to take care of me, Mahirun.”\nChitose gave Mahiru a meaningful smile, and the latter shoulders’ shriveled. Her cheeks turned red, and she seemed strangely uneasy.",

      "content": "After their meal, they started studying again. However, Chitose was ultimately unable to focus, and while snacking away, she started rolling about, saying “I’m tired~”\n“Amane~, can we play games?”\n“Play all you want, but I don’t care how your grades turn out.”\n“Oyyy you’re strict.”\n“We can relax a bit, but you’ll overdo it. If you think you can watch yourself, go ahead.”\nI’ll continue with my studies,\nAmane replied as he continued to solve the questions. In a corner of his eyes, he saw Chitose puffing her cheeks slightly.\nHe already expected that Chitose, who hated studying, was getting sick of it. He set up a game console and and four game controllers next to the TV cupboard.\nAfter all, no human could concentrate fully. He felt it was fine if she just wanted to play and rest for a little while.\nAmane would take short breaks after every hour, and was fine with not taking long breaks. He did not dislike studying, and could keep at it for a long time.\n“You’re cruel Amane~”\n“We’re here for a study group, right? Whatever, we can play for a while. 4 game controllers. Take it as a break.”\n“I’ll take up that offer then~. But you shouldn’t push yourself too hard studying, you know?”\n“I rested.”\n“You’re that serious huh? Well, you’re always serious. I’ll play then~ what about you Ikkun?”\n“I’ll play then. Won’t be playing all the time though.”\nItsuki might have been worn out from studying for 2,3 hours, and was interested once games were mentioned.\n“How about you Yuuta?”\n“Sure. You fine with this, Fujimiya?”\n“Nn.”\nKadowaki was more serious than Itsuki and Chitose, but he too was interested in playing some games to rest.\nDo as you please\n, so Amane indicated as he turned his eyes towards the textbooks again.\nOn a side note, Mahiru was next to him, solving the problems quietly, and showed no sign of losing concentration.\n“You’re not playing, Mahiru?”\n“I shall study for a little longer.”\n“I see.”\nAmane was studying hard as he swore he had to work hard, but Mahiru was always in this state, and Amane was really impressed with her.\nShe managed to maintain her status as valedictorian due to her relentless hard work, and this relentless had work was what made Mahiru amazing.\nAmane saw the trio leave the table and occupy the space before the game console. He then purged them from his mind, and started writing with his mechanical pencil.\nThe sounds of the pencil and rubber rang clearly along with Mahiru’s breathing sounds next to him.\nHe could vaguely hear squeals from afar as he recalled the every teacher’s bias of questions, and solved the questions that could possibly be tested.\nHe had ease dealing with the tests of the teachers who had been teaching them since his first year, Amane memorized how the questions would be set based on the teachers’ personalities and lesson scope over the past year.\nHe planned to grasp the tendencies of the teachers who started to teach them this year.\nHe did predict the scope of lessons when he taught Chitose. It was up to chance, but he did not really expect to be wrong. Chitose should be able to avoid failing if she focused on these sections.\n“Amane-kun, please have some.”\nAmane was solving the questions when he realized that Mahiru, who should be next to him, had stood up. She put a cup of coffee next to his hands, and there was some potion milk and a small sugar cube\nHis face relaxed once he saw this cup of coffee.\n“Same as the usual. is this fine?”\n“Oh, thank you.”\nHaving been together for half a year, they knew very well what each other liked.\nMahiru served him coffee while he was thinking of having some. Amane gratefully received it by the handle, and found another little saucer.\n“What is this?”\n“It is a little Financier. I baked them yesterday as I think we need sugar for studying.”\nThere was a bite-sized Financier on the plate, a finely roasted brown.\nThere was a fork on it, for she had considered that Amane would be eating it while studying. The Financier was just large enough.\nIt appeared she had baked for Itsuki and the others, who were playing games. There were plenty of Financiers for three on the plate served on a tray, a few forks placed by the side.\nThere were also three coffee cups prepared for them. She also prepared sugar and milk sachets for them.\n“Chitose-san, everyone, please have some.”\nMahiru smiled as she approached them, and placed the tray on a little table by the side.\n“Waaa~! Thanks Mahirun!”\n“Ohhh, some desserts. Perfect timing. Thanks Shiina-san.”\n“My pleasure.”\nMahiru happily looked at the trio who were overjoyed by the desserts, and returned to Amane, who naturally smiled.\n“…I get the feeling that I caused you to prepare lots.”\n“No, I wanted to do this. I did this during my study break. This can be considered rest for me.”\n“You really are the type to give your all.”\n“…I just want to work hard for those who work hard.”\nThe moment he heard this mutter, Amane sensed heat rising up his throat.\nHe hurried downed it with the coffee before it could come out. He found the coffee exceptionally sweet. She added the same amount of sugar as usual, yet he found it really sweet.\nHe did not know how to react to this sweetness he did not dislike, how to react to Mahiru’s words, and lied to himself as he looked down at his textbook.",

      "content": "Ultimately, the gaming party lasted until evening.\nAmane could not concentrate after having studied for so long, so he stopped to join them for games. However, the long study time was not the only reason why he could not concentrate.\nWhat does she mean by working hard for those who work hard?\nMahiru’s little muttered swirled in Amane’s mind.\nAmane knew that Mahiru loved to act for others, but when she said so, it appeared that she had feelings for him.\nAs far as Amane knew, Mahiru’s fondness of him was not in the sense of a boy-girl relationship.\nBut once he heard her say so, he started to delude, wondering if she viewed him as a boy, and was willing to devote her utmost to him.\nNo, if she’s taking care of me and giving her all for me because I’m too rotten, that I can understand.\nAmane could not do housework, so it was possible interpretation of that. No, if he worked hard, he could at least live normally; at this point however, he was completely reliant on Mahiru.\nOne had to wonder if Mahiru was implying that she had the urge to keep taking care of him, or that she was taking care of him because she liked him.\nAmane liked Mahiru, and naturally he hoped the situation was the latter. He did not think it came out of nowhere, but once he thought of the possibility of her liking him, he found it impossible, in various ways.\n“Amane~, you fell out of the arena.”\n“Eh?”\nAs he was distracted by his thoughts while playing, he made a mistake, and his character fell off. It was game over for him as he had no remaining lives.\nItsuki, Chitose and Kadowaki were fighting.\nAmane did not know of Kadowaki’s abilities, but he usually would not have lost that easily. In other words, he was so distracted by Mahiru’s words.\n“You’re spacing out man. Guess you can’t concentrate after studying so much.”\n“…Maybe. You want to play, Mahiru?”\n“No thank you. I think it is about time to cook…”\nMahiru had a look at the time, and Amane did the same. It was almost 7pm, and might be a little too late to prepare dinner.\n“Ahh, seriously, it’s that late now…I got to go home. I can’t stay overnight.”\n“Yeah. Chii wants to stay over at Shiina-san’s place, but there’s no change of clothes, and she doesn’t have permission. Also, I don’t think Chii can wear Shiina-san’s clothes.”\n“Hey what are you saying now Ikkun?”\n“Height of course.”\nThe couple’s arguing amicably like usual, and Mahiru smiled at them.\n“Please stay over next time.”\n“You sure?”\n“Yes. If you say beforehand.”\n“I’ll stay over at Amane’s palce then…”\n“Feels like you just want food.”\n“Ah busted.”\nBut Shiina-san’s food is good\n, Itsuki smiled without any ill intent. “If Mahiru agrees that is,” Amane sighed.\nMahiru would have to cook more than usual, so Amane could not make the decision unilaterally. If she refused, they would have to eat outside, or at the convenience store. But that would feel like a boys night out, and might not be a bad thing.\nMahiru agreed with a smile. Amane had a feeling Itsuki would soon be staying over.\n“Will you be joining us next time, Kadowaki?”\n“Eh, can I?”\n“Of course.”\n“The ‘kick Amane in the back’ group will gather then.”\n“Oy, what strange group are you talking about?”\n“Who knows?”\nItsuki smirked, and Amane tugged at his cheek. Kadowaki was first speechless, only to smile in relief.\n“Say Mahiru…erm. What do you mean by working hard for those who work hard?”\nOnce the others left, Amane stood at the door, and without hesitation, asked whatever was on his mind.\nActually, he hesitated over whether he should ask. Before Itsuki left, Amane asked what he should do. “Alright, just ask.” Itsuki then kicked him.\nAmane never expected to be kicked, and slapped him back in retaliation. It appeared he did not learn from this lesson. It was pointless.\nOnce she heard that question, Mahiru blinked away a few times, and slowly curled her lips.\n“What do you think it means, Amane-kun?”\n“…That you can’t leave a rotten guy be and want to take care of him?”\nAfter all, he dared not go overly egotistic in saying that she liked him.\n“Fufu, that is true. I dare not lose sight of you, Amane-kun. You will cause a mess in the house if I do not keep an eye on you. Your nutrition too will be horribly imbalanced.”\n‘Ugh.”\n“You are hopeless without me after all, Amane-kun.”\n“Well, I can’t argue with that.”\nAmane was truly well cared of by Mahiru. Without her, he would never be able to live this lifestyle.\n“…That is fine, you know? I do like taking care of you, Amane-kun.”\n“You’re spoiling me rotten…you’re making it such that I can’t live without you, Mahiru…”\n“Fufu.”\nThe terrifying thing about Mahiru was that if she was not present, Amane’s life and mind would be completely wasted.\nHe was her slave, in more ways than one, and could not break free from her easily; rather, he could not break free at all, and did not want to. Of course, the most important reason was that he liked her.\nIf he was dumped after he confessed, it would not be an understatement to say that Amane’s mind and life would be dead.\nThat’s why I can’t take a step forward\n, he quietly mocked himself. One had to wonder what Mahiru was thinking when she leaned onto Amane.\nShe did not lean too closely, just lightly, up front. She looked up at him―and put her index finger on his lips.\n“…I will make you a good-for-nothing, so please go ahead and do so, no?”\nShe bashfully narrowed her eyes, as though she was pulling a prank. Amane stared at her, and forgot to breathe.\nIt was a smile he had never seen before, one so sweet yet so exciting…and a little alluring. She was practically a little devil. As she said, this smile could reduce him into a good for nothing, and more than capable of shocking Amane’s heart completely.\nHe felt his heart pounding wildly, his blood rushing.\nHe had seen an angelic smile, an innocent, fleeting smile, and various other smiles. None of them were as alluring at this Mahiru however.\nMahiru looked at a stupefied Amane happily, and regained her usual smile, “I shall prepare dinner then.” She went to the kitchen. As Amane watched her leave, he felt his face burning.\nAnd after that, Mahiru was huddled in a corner of the kitchen, remaining still, for she did something she was unused to.",

      "content": "“Say Amane, you overdid it this time, didn’t you?”\nItsuki looked a little dumbfounded as he muttered, staring at the test results rankings pasted on the corridor bulletin board.\nAfter the study group ended, Amane continued to study head, and finally took on the tests. His initial objective was to have a reason to be proud of himself…but more importantly, he wanted to purge away Mahiru’s smile from his mind, and concentrate.\n“…I will make you a good-for-nothing, so please go ahead and do so, no?”\nAmane had the unbearable urge to twitch the moment he recalled that alluring mutter.\nHe concentrated on his studies, and pondered over Mahiru’s words and face while trying not to be distracted. He ended up 6th this time.\n“No, I didn’t think I could do this well.”\n“You worked hard. Got some confidence now?”\n“…More or less. I have to maintain these grades though.”\n“Such high expectations…”\nAmane scored well, but he did not want Mahiru to see his grades slip thereafter out of carelessness. The high ranking this time was pointless if he did nothing to maintain it.\nHe could not be content with this, as they would have to take the college entrance exams later on. He could not attend college with the mentality that he could leave everything at the last minute. He hoped to put some effort into studying, even if it was for the sake of his future.\nOn a side note, Mahiru performed as usual and was the undisputed first ranked. It was due to her daily hard work, and not easily summarized by the word ‘usual’.\n“You’re 6th this time, Fujimiya-san.”\nMahiru noticed Amane’s name on the rankings as she stood behind him, and gave a beautiful smile.\nAmane smiled in the face of Mahiru’s angel mode, and did not falter.\nHe could feel stinging glares around him, and was not in the mood to be embarrassed about the incident that happened days ago\n“I guess. That’s good.”\n“Fufu. You have been working after all, Fujimiya-san. You were studying during breaks.”\n“…Yeah.”\n“Since you worked so hard, you may give yourself some reward, Fujimiya-san.”\n“Y-yeah.”\nAmane’s heart got unbearably ticklish once he thought about the reward.\nBy the way, he did promise Mahiru that she would give him a lap pillow if he was ranked in the top ten, and that she would dig his ears. He was purging various things from his mind however, and had long forgotten about this promise.\nOf course, he could refuse…but could he refuse the happiness that was the endearment of the girl he liked?\n“…Congrats on getting first too, Shiina. You should be giving yourself a reward too, right?”\n“Yes, but it is a bad thing to spoil myself too much.”\n“You’re very strict about yourself, Shiina. It’s fine to relax a little and let go. Well, I shouldn’t be the one saying that however.”\nNow that she mentioned it, Amane realized that he had a reward, yet Mahiru did not. He should give her one.\nNevertheless, he did not know what to give. He should ask her once he returned home.\n“How about you get something to coax her?” Itsuki whispered to Amane once he saw Mahiru’s Angelic smile.\nAmane planned to without him being told. He silently swore to himself that once he got home, he would ask her.\n“Hm, a reward for me?”\nAmane returned home to see Mahiru in her apron, preparing dinner, and called out to her. Mahiru turned around, looking shocked.\nHe thought of the reward after dinner, the devilish smile from days ago, and was strangely unable to calm down. It appeared she did not notice this however. From her expression, it appeared his words took her by complete surprise.\n“I do not have anything I want in particular.”\n“Like, anything you want me to do…?”\n“From you, Amane-kun? Hmm, I guess something like, please use the slicer on the cucumber there.”\n“Not that…whatever, it’s not like you have to say one.”\nMahiru had no desire, or perhaps, Amane had a feeling that she never took his words seriously. Despite that, he easily compromised as some extra manpower was fine.\nHe was fine if Mahiru did not need it. If Mahiru really had something she wanted Amane to do, he intended to do so as long as it was within his capabilities.\nIt appeared she just wanted the cucumber sliced. Amane washed his hands, took the slicer, and began cutting. Surely he was just helping however.\n“Please add salt and mix together.”\n“Okay…you really don’t have any wishes?”\n“No, I am satisfied with the situation now…I do wish to fulfill my true desire on my own.”\n“Your true desire?”\n“What do you think it is?”\nAmane lifted his head, and found Mahiru’s lips forming an arch.\nAt that moment, he saw that expression, the one akin to the devilish smile days ago. He dared not look at it directly, and looked down onto the cucumber.\n“…I-I don’t know.”\n“Is that so? This is fine. The status quo is fine.”\nShe showed a wry smile at his words.\nOnce again, she continued cooking, giving a vibe that she did not want Amane to ask any further. Amane was left at a loss of what to do, and could only continue slicing the cucumber.",

      "content": "“Now then, over here, Amane-kun.”\nAfter dinner, it was time for the reward (purgatory)\nMahiru sat at a side of the sofa, and slapped her thighs, as though it was a given. Amane was unsure of how to respond to that smile.\nOn a side note, she was wearing shorts and black tights. There was a layer of fabric above the lap, but the thin material emphasized the skin greatly.\nAlso, it appeared she had returned home to bathe, but she had a fragrance lingering all over her.\nIt was practically suicidal for Amane to enjoy her lap pillow and have her dig his ears at this point.\n“…No, erm.”\n“You do not have to force yourself if you are unwilling…”\n“Bu-but I’m really willing, you know?”\n“Then help yourself. We promised.”\nMahiru slapped her thighs again, and Amane gulped.\nThe weather had warmed recently, and Mahiru’s tights were thinner than before.\nThe fabric clinging firmly onto her thighs vaguely showed some color of skin, and looked really seductive.\nHer thighs showed a silky curve beneath the tights, and the defenseless sight appeared to be tempting Amane.\nIt appeared that Mahiru was going to murder Amane on this day, even though she might not have any intent to.\nNormally, Amane would try to refuse to protect his sanity and peace. However, the name of reward and Amane’s desire as a man pushed him on into Valhalla.\nAmane timidly sat next to Mahiru, and put his head on her thighs.\nHer thighs were as soft as he remembered. The fabric was thinner than before. The feeling and warmth struck him, and agitated his heart.\nAmane did not know where to look, and lifted his head. Mahiru’s smiled entered his eyes.\nHowever, her face showed up from time to time…all due to the two mountains in the way.\nIt was May, and the weather got hotter. Perhaps this was why Mahiru was dressed thinly, and the curves of her fine body were emphasized.\nEven through the fabric, the body maintained its alluring shape despite being affected by gravity. Amane did not look up anymore.\n“Shall I start digging your ears?”\nMahiru remained oblivious to Amane’s inner screams as she declared somewhat excitedly. She reached for the ear pick and the tissue on the table.\nAnd then, certain soft things landed on a side of Amane’s head.\n!?\nThere was an indescribable scream in Amane’s heart, but it appeared Mahiru still did not know. She quickly retrieved the ear pick, and straightened her body.\nShe probably did not realize that Amane had just felt the soft mass.\nHis heart was pounding.\nHis mind was no longer thinking about the ear digging. “Please do not move.” Mahiru quietly coaxed as she gently held down his head with one hand.\nShe probably was telling him not to move as she wanted to dig the ear. Amane really wanted to roll about, but was forced to remained still, which made him unbearable.\nDespite that, he dared not mess around too much, and obediently stared at the side of the table. Something hard slowly entered his ear canal.\nAt that moment, he shivered, for it was probably there the skin was thinner.\nAmane would not have such a feeling when he dug his own ears, but there was a strange ecstasy when Mahiru did so. It probably was because he was not doing it on himself…or maybe, he was excited that the girl he liked was doing it for him.\nHe knew that given her personality, Mahiru would be cautious while digging his ears. The extremely gentle motion still left him ticklish.\nIt was an irresistible feeling, and while he could not say that he was comfortable with it, there was a little sense of alluring comfort. This indescribable comfort had him unable to resist the matter of the ear digging.\n“Does it not hurt?”\n“Nn, it doesn’t. Feels good.”\n“I see, that is good. I heard this is a man’s room…is your romance satisfied?”\n“…Maybe.”\n“So you are a boy after all, Amane-kun.”\n“Then what else am I?”\nIf he was not a male, Amane would not be suffering so much, and would not be so excited about such softness. There was no way he would not be panicking about the prospect of the girl he liked doting on him so much, and even allowing physical contact.\n“Fufu. You are very gentlemanly, and I assumed you did not have much interest.”\n“Look, even if I’m gentlemanly, my words and thoughts aren’t the same, right? Watch out, guys are like this, always giving a goody-goody look, and always attacking when nobody else is around.”\n“By your reasoning, you are not a man, Amane-kun.”\nAmane bit his lips, for he felt that Mahiru was saying he was a coward. It appeared Mahiru had no such intention as she continued to slowly dig his ears.\n“Amane-kun, please turn around. I am going to do the other side.”\nAmane frowned, but he turned around to dig the other ear. On a second thought however, having to look at Mahiru’s belly was a different torment altogether.\nMahiru was wearing shorts, but a big tragedy would occur if he looked down. He could only look at her belly instead.\nHe had no idea if he was in Heaven, or Hell.\nIf he could abide by his desires, it probably was Heaven. However, he was hesitant, conflicted, and was practically taking a step into Hell.\n“…Amane-kun, it feels like you are shivering…”\n“Don’t mind.”\nOf course, Amane could not express his true thoughts. Mahiru would suffer if he did.\nHe could only hide his desires, and let her dig his ear. He was terrified of the future, for the Angel was innocently spoiling him rotten.\nMahiru seemed skeptical about Amane’s attitude, but Amane was facing towards her, and did not look up. She thus did not ask any further, and continued to dig her ears again.\nAmidst this indescribable itchiness, Amane closed his eyes, and awaited the time for it to end.\nHe closed his eyes, for if he opened them, he would have a strange sense of guilt. When this happened however, his senses were sharpened. he could smell Mahiru’s original scent, the shampoo, the liquid soap, felt the softness of the thighs, and could not calm down at all.\nIt would be great if he could enjoy this softness without hesitation.\n“Amane-kun, may I touch your hair once I am done?”\n“…Do as you please.”\nAmane would not have to feel so conflicted if he ran away immediately. Tragically for him however, he was a male, and he would hope to continue the lap pillow treatment if possible.\nCaught in a dilemma between stopping and continuing, Amane ultimately lost to his desires. He truly understood that in more ways than one, he was such a weak-willed person.\nOnce she heard him agree to it, there was a delighted vibe oozing from Mahiru.\n“It will be over soon.”\nMahiru said as she dug his ears delicately. Amane felt a little regret that it was going to end soon, and started brooding by himself again. Of course, he did not show this emotion in his expression or actions.\nThe itchy, palatable sweetness ended once Mahiru pulled out the ear pick.\nReplacing it were her fingers gliding through his hair, and another form of comfort arose.\n“Yes, it is done.”\nAfter combing his hair with her hand, Mahiru coaxed him gently like a child. Amane was embarrassed, and yet wanted to entrust himself to her.\nOnce he understood his emotions tend towards the latter, he nearly let out a groan of much conflicted emotion.\nIt was a reward, and Mahiru probably wanted to spoil Amane as much as possible, but surely he would end up a degenerate.\nShe clearly intended to turn him into a good-for-nothing, as declared. No matter how Amane tried to resist, this comfort robbed him of the energy to do so, and he could not do anything.\n…I’m really turning into a good-for-nothing…\nAmane thoroughly experienced the fragrance of a girl, the body warmth, and the gentle movements caressing him. It did not seem much on first glance, but in fact, he was really comfortable and blissful.\nThe situation and posture were so alluring to him. if she did these to him every day, Amane would surely end up a complete good-for-nothing.\nHaaa,\nAmane sighed to relax, and heard a little giggle.\n“It is rare to see you fawn around.”\n“…Whose fault do you think it is?”\n“It is mine.”\nMahiru gave a smile chuckle, and continued to comb with her fingers.\n“I want to continue doting and touching you when I see you, Amane-kun. Your hair feels great.”\n“…Really?”\n“Yes. It is smooth and glossy. How is it so glossy, I wonder…”\n“…Maybe it’s the shampoo mom recommended.”\nIt won’t hurt to keep your hair well!\nShihoko strongly recommended this, and Amane was using the shampoo used at a hair salon, said to be good for hair care.\nAmane did not dislike the smell, and his hair did feel smooth after he dried it. Thus, he kept using it.\n“Your hair’s smoother.”\nAmane picked up a handful of Mahiru’s flax-colored hair. The hair was smoother and glossier than his.\nThat description was more apt for her. Amane’s was far inferior. Her hair gave him an urge to keep touching; the fragrance was a faint soap smell, and did not sting. It was irresistible to men.\n“I get the feeling that you really put lots of care into your hair when I touched it.”\n“…Yes, I have not spared any effort on it.”\n“I see. Anyway, you fine with me just touching it as and when I please? They say hair is a female’s life.”\n“…I like it to be touched by you, Amane-kun.”\nThank goodness she didn’t see my face,\nso he thought, for his expression became really suspicious once he heard Mahiru’s words.\nShame, delight, confusion, sheepishness…he experienced an amalgam of emotions, and surely she would be suspicious if she saw it.\nI’m carried away because you say such stuff.\nAmane closed his mouth and eyes, sighed, and tried to look normal.",

      "content": "Amane opened his eyes to find Mahiru’s shirt before him.\nIt appeared he had fallen asleep again. The excessive comfort was so blissful that he fell asleep. Truth be told, he had no idea how long he slept, so he was feeling really uneasy.\nMahiru had stopped combing his hair.\nHe cautious got up, and found Mahiru leaning on the sofa, sleeping away.\nSuu, suu,\nonce he heard her steady breathing, he muttered.\nShe’s so defenseless.\nHe looked at the clock, and his face twitched.\nIt was 11pm. The lap pillow started after everything else was done, and that was 9pm. In that case, Amane enjoyed about 2 hours worth of the lap pillow.\nMahiru probably fell asleep because of the time, and because she could not move.\nSurely she dared not wake Amane up, and maintained this posture until she too fell asleep.\nHe hoped Mahiru would be a little more wary, given that she was in a boy’s house. Ultimately though, he too should bear responsibility as he fell asleep on her lap.\nHe did not know what to do, and after staring at her sleeping face for a little while, he decided to take a bath.\nIt appeared Mahiru had bathed, but Amane did not.\nHe could bathe first and let Mahiru sleep for a while before waking her up. Perhaps she might wake up once he was done.\nOnce he decided so, Amane hurried back to his room, and took his change of clothes.\nOnce he was done bathing, Amane had a look at the living room, and gently sighed.\nIt seemed Mahiru remained in dreamland, and even the noise from the blow dryer did not wake up her.\n“Mahiru, wake up.”\nAmane called out as he gently shook Mahiru, but she showed no signs of waking up. Perhaps she really did lose consciousness, for her body tilted increasingly, and Amane could only hold her up.\nThe continual lap pillow might have tired her out, or perhaps she was simply sleepy. In any case, Amane understood that she probably was not waking up.\nI think something similar happened before.\nHe remembered it was during the End of Year. Mahiru accidentally fell asleep, and Amane lent his bed to her.\nHe felt the same was about to happen again.\nOnce again, Amane shook her vigorously, but she did not wake up.\nNnn.\nA soft, sweet voice entered his ears. It seemed to be a sleeping sound, rather than a voice however.\nIt was not the first time the sleeping Mahiru looked so defenseless out of trust, but Amane wondered if this was really fine.\nGoodness me,\nhe cussed as he poked at her cheek. It appeared she was not waking up anytime soon however, and there was only a soft, smooth feeling.\nAgain Amane poked at Mahiru’s face, and the result remained. Left with no choice, he could only pick Mahiru up.\nIt was Spring, so even if Amane lent her his bed and slept elsewhere, he would not get sick. Truth be told, he really wanted to sleep while cuddling her, but in that case, the next day would be disastrous. Thus, he could not enact on it.\nHe knew he was a coward, but he did not want her to hate him, and could only endure. He carried her horizontally, and placed her on the bed in his room.\nHe tidied his bed before putting Mahiru down. All he had to do next was to put a blanket over her sleeping back.\n“…I wonder if I have to give Mahiru a talk, that she shouldn’t be sleeping in a guy’s house.”\nAmane could force himself on her if he never considered the consequences, and then develop the relationship from there.\nHe did not do so as he wanted to treasure Mahiru, and was thinking whether there was a reason to attack her. Not to say that he was a safe person to be with, there was no guarantee that he would not discard his sanity to enact on Mahiru.\nHe just hoped that Mahiru would not be so defenseless just because of the comfort and trust in his personality.\nMahiru was a very wary person, but in contrast, she loved to fawn towards those she opened her heart to. That was why she showed such a defenseless and innocent side, and for his sanity’s sake, Amane hoped she would change.\nHe sighed as he patted her sleeping face. Mahiru’s body started to twitch.\n“…Nn.”\nA soft voice rang.\nHer eyelids beneath the fine eyelashes started to open at a really slow pace, and revealed unfocused caramel-colored eyes.\nThe groggy, sleepy eyes appeared to be looking nowhere, and were distinct of one who had just woken up. Perhaps her mind was still delirious, for she was the type to not get her mind running after waking up.\nAmane leaned to look at Mahiru’s face. She did not wake up, and instead was spacing out, looking completely relaxed.\n“You awake? You were sleeping when I woke up, so I moved you to the bed. If you’re up, go home, or I’ll use you as a bolster.”\nMan, I’m a coward for just thinking of using her as a bolster.\nAmane thought, but if he said that he would attack her, there was a chance that she would hate him and cry, and he would be so devastated. He really could not bring himself to say so.\nAlso, he had a little wish.\nHe tapped the groggy Mahiru on the cheeks, wanting her to wake up and go home, but Mahiru remained delirious.\nShe turned her eyes towards Amane instantly, and then closed her eyes and tucked herself under the blanket, clearly showing how tired she was. Perhaps she just wanted to sleep there.\n“Oy.”\n“…Nnn…”\nIf her mind was still up and running like usual, she might listen to Amane. She was completely groggy however, and sought the blanket. It appeared even Amane’s words would be ineffective.\nAmane’s face twitched, and he snuggled under the same blanket, wanting her to feel some danger.\nHe slept next to Mahiru, and patted her head while she sought warmth beneath the blanket. He could have shaken her awake if he wanted to, but he could not bring himself to do so when she was so worn out.\n“Alright, wake up, or else I’ll really use you as a bolster.”\n“…Nnn.”\nOnce he whispered so to her ear, she gave a vague reply, and leaned over.\nIt was too sudden, and he froze. However, Mahiru did not appear to mind as she fidgeted about, trying to find a more comfortable position.\nShe wriggled like a caterpillar, and finally buried her face onto Amane’s chest.\nThis position appeared to be most suitable for her, and she stopped to sleep.\nWHY IS SHE SO DEFENSELESS!?\nShe fell asleep–onto a man’s chest at that, perhaps oblivious to her own actions. If Amane reached his hands out towards her, he could use her as a bolster, as he had declared.\nIt would be great if his heartbeat could wake her up. However, he was merely excited, and could not wake up the slumbering Mahiru.\nAmane heard a little breathing sound.\n“…Spare me already…”\nGiven how defenseless she was, she really could not blame anyone even if somebody did enact on her. Amane groaned once he saw that, and looked over at her who was clinging onto him.\nHer breathing was steady, and she was in dreamland. Amane could only chuckle dumbfoundedly.\n…Seriously, she.\nShe was unconscious, but typically speaking, she should not be giving full trust to a boy she trusted, cling onto him, or even allow him to sleep with her.\nAmane realized that she had some fondness for him, but perhaps she did like him as he had hoped, or so he hoped.\nHe did not know what the real situation was like, but at the very least, she could sleep on Amane’s bed without resisting, even if it was unwitting. She did not resist him being next to her, nor did she resist his patting.\nCan I interpret it in a way convenient to myself?\nAmane asked himself, and Mahiru naturally would not answer.\nShe was merely sleeping peacefully. After an internal struggle, Amane reached his hands out.\nHe reached his arms around her back, embracing her body that was already leaning onto him.\n“…I warned you though.”\nAmane muttered what sounded like an excuse, but nobody blamed him. Present here was a completely defenseless kitten and a wolf becoming powerless against it.\nAmane enjoyed the soft body, and apprehensively leaned his lips onto the forehead above her bangs.\n…I’ll take this as lodging and tuition fees.\nIt might be despicable of him to do so while delirious and defenseless, but if she remained awake, he could not have done so.\nAfter all, the girl he liked was sleeping on his bed, completely defenseless. He really hoped someone would have praised him for enduring this much.\nLike usual, Mahiru quietly slept in relief, “This idiot.” Amane muttered, and closed his eyes.",

      "content": "The next morning, Amane woke up while feeling groggy, and sensed a warmth next to him, which usually did not happen.\nIt was May, but the mornings were still cold. He instinctively hugged the pile of warmth. Once he clung onto it, he slowly opened his eyes.\nAnd the first thing he saw was the person he had a crush on.\n“!?”\nHe nearly shrieked, but he did not want to wake up the sleeping Mahiru in his clutches, and stopped himself with his little remaining sanity, swallowing back the urge to yell out loud.\nHe gingerly looked towards the girl in his clutches again, hearing the thumping drum that was his heart.\nShe was the pretty girl called Mahiru, no two ways about it.\nThat innocent, harmless, completely relaxed sleeping face was so angelic, sacred looking even.\n“Man she’s cute.” he noted as he saw her sleeping with a smile, and was cupping his head in frustration as he was at a loss of what to do. It was a metaphor however, for he was actually embracing her.\n…I lost to my desire and used Mahiru as a bolster. There’s no way we can sleep on a single bed though.\nMahiru had thoroughly devastated Amane’s sanity, and he unwittingly used Mahiru as a bolster, and even kissed her on the forehead. There was no way Amane would have made such a decision if he was his usual self.\nMahiru was like a little devil, wearing his sanity down till this point with such doting love. He could not use this as an excuse though, probably.\nMahiru was overly careless to think Amane as a harmless coward, someone she was safe with. Amane lost to his desires. They both shared responsibility. Amane would blame Mahiru, but he had to reflect on his own actions.\nHe took a deep sigh, and started to think about how he should deal with Mahiru in his clutches.\nHe did not know when…probably when she was asleep, but Mahiru was rested on his elbow. If he tried to pry her away, she would wake up.\nHe hesitated over whether he should wake Mahiru when she was sleeping in this state. he wanted to, and nag a few words, but the malicious desire to keep looking crept up on him.\nHe had a feeling that he had fallen as a degenerate of a man the moment he was never able to discard his desires immediately, which he should have.\n“…Nn, mm.”\nEarly in the morning and Amane realized how he was loyal to his desires, which left him disappointed. Mahiru might have noticed that Amane had woken up, or perhaps she was an early riser to begin with as she slowly twitched her body.\nAmane was frozen, unable to move. He was wondering how he should explain this to Mahiru, and certain soft objects were pressing on him as she had just leaned over.\n“Nn…kuma-san…”\nMahiru did not let go of Amane, and clung firmly as she reached her hand out, seemingly seeking something.\nThe lumps between them were contorted by the pressure, and Amane sensed he was at his limit as he pried away from her, hopped off, caught his breath, and slammed his head onto the wall.\nHe slammed it repeatedly, purging the looming desires from his mind.\n“…Fuahh……eh, I…?”\nHe sensed that Mahiru had woken up behind him, but he chose to ignore as he was busy smashing his head and purging his desires.\n“…Amane-kun?”\nA vague, sweet voice arose from behind.\nAmane turned around to see Mahiru seated up, her head tilted. She looked a little messy as she had just woken up, yet this messy look had an innocent alluring charm which left him unable to look.\nIn any case, it would be bad if he met her in the eyes. Again Amane slammed his head against the wall.\nDull bangs could be heard as he used too much force, and pain followed. Amane felt it might be an appropriate punishment for himself at this point.\n“Good morning…what are you doing?”\n“Hitting my head.”\n“…Why?”\n“I feel ashamed of myself.”\nAmane continued to purge his thoughts by killing off his brain cells, and Mahiru seemed to feel confused too. “Nnn…?” She made such a sleepy sound, and wrapped her arms around his waist to stop him, pulling her back.\nShe was embracing him tightly in this posture, and he really wanted her to stop.\n“…Mahiru-san.”\n“Yes…?”\n“You don’t have any thoughts about both of us being on the same bed?”\nAmane groaned, and Mahiru’s thoughts froze for a moment.\nAfter a little moment, she slammed her head into Amane’s back.\nIt did not hurt, but Amane understood Mahiru’s confusion and embarrassment behind him.\n“Eh, er-erm…ugh.”\n“Let me make this clear, I didn’t do anything.”\n“Nn, nn.”\nIt was obvious given their situation. Mahiru probably was not physically hurting, and surely would understand.\n“…Anyway, can you please move away a bit? Erm, I want to apologize properly. A-and, your chest’s touching, so please don’t cling onto me…”\nAmane was pleading away at the end. Mahiru too might have felt it was a bad thing, and hurriedly pulled away.\nOnce the softness and warmth on his back vanished, Amane momentarily felt it was a pity, and was inevitably ashamed of his own thoughts.\nHe was angsty due to his own desires, and turned around so as not to show them.\nMahiru was shivering, blushing completely.\nShe was not looking terrified, just embarrassed, which really left him relieved.\nAmane moved away from Mahiru, and got in a seiza before her, his fingers on the floor as he kowtowed in apology.\n“Sorry for yesterday.”\nAmane felt he should apologize the for the previous.\nHe positioned himself, got in a dogeza, and sensed Mahiru’s frantic breath near his head.\n“I-it is fine. I should be the one apologizing for yesterday. E-erm, looking at this, it seems you brought me to the bed…Amane-kun?”\n“Yeah.”\n“It’s my fault…”\n“I decided that we’d sleep on the same bed. You can tell me off.”\nNormally speaking, nobody would choose to sleep by the side. In fact, at the end of last year, Amane slept on the sofa, and felt it was reasonable.\nIt was truly ungentlemanly of him to sleep on the same bed as someone he was not dating.\nUltimately, he used Mahiru as a bolster. It was no laughing matter.\n“I used you as a bolster while you’re sleeping on the same bed. I should be the one at fault.”\n“N-no…I took the bed too. We have to share the responsibility.”\n“Say, do you understand that you shared a bed with a guy over a single night? What would you have done if I did the thing?”\nThe only reason he did not do so was because he was Amane. Any other guy would surely have done so whether she was asleep…or rather, when she was asleep.\n“A-Amane-kun, you said you will do so when I agree to.”\n“Look, I might not ask if I lose my sanity. Be careful. Seriously, you’re too defenseless that it’s scaring me.”\n“…A-Amane-kun.”\n“Hm?”\n“Do you think…I will sleep carelessly in anyone’s house…?”\nOnce he heard that question, Amane lifted his head, and found Mahiru staring at him silently.\nThere was a pleading glint in those honest eyes.\nAmane could not understand the emotions contained within, but he could tell that Mahiru looked a little hurt.\n“I-I don’t really think so.”\n“I trust you, Amane-kun. I will only sleep before you…”\nMahiru’s breathing was a little frantic as she concluded. Naturally, the heat rose up Amane’s face.\nWas her explanation not implying that she liked Amane, felt he was special, and could be careless around him?\nGiven her attitude the previous day, and her delirious alluring state, Amane started to think that she had feelings for him.\nHe knew that she would usually respect his personality. However, there was a chance that she might love him as a partner. The moment he thought so, the blood gushed to his cheeks.\nAmane was speechless as Mahiru’s words shocked him greatly, and his eyes swam about.\n…Is it really fine for me to take it that she likes me?\nThat was the intent Amane felt from her attitude, so he was confused and flustered.\nIf he was wrong, he might not be able to laugh at all. He would be so devastated to the point of death. He dared not make a conclusion, but looking at her attitude the previous day, perhaps it was fine for him to harbor a little hope.\n“…I-I understand this. But this doesn’t that you can just sleep in front of me like this. I’m a guy…you know?”\nBut no matter the feelings Mahiru had for Amane, such carelessness was a no go.\nOnce she heard this, Mahiru turned her head aside.\n“…You would have done so already if you could, Amane-kun. I thought you would not do anything.”\n“You’re saying this?”\nAmane ruffled his hair with a hand, and sighed.\n…She only does it before me, but that can’t do.\nThat was because she did it in front of Amane.\nAmane had fallen head over heels for Mahiru. If she remained so defenseless, there would surely be a day when he would lose control. It would be bad for both sides if they were to continue like this.\nAmane reached his hand towards her, thinking that she would not understand unless she experienced it personally.\nHe gently, yet abruptly, pushed down Mahiru, and leaned on her.\nThe flowing flax-colored hair scattered upon the bedsheet like water.\nThe white ocean was gradually turned a flowing flax-colored, and it was an unspeakably beautiful scene.\nMahiru was dumbfounded as it was too sudden. Amane then smiled and said.\n“…I’m just an ordinary guy. I have my desires. I’m just good at enduring it.”\nAmane usually contained himself, ensuring that Mahiru would never notice his desires. He too had his desires as a man.\nHe hid himself so that Mahiru would not be hurt. His sanity and the common sense from his upbringing had him braking hard, for without them, his desires would be easily revealed.\nIt was Mahiru who did not understand this logic.\n“If you tease me too much…you know right?”\nAmane put his face so close to her, they could feel their breaths. Mahiru’s eyes then swam about, before she closed her eyes.\nShe was blushing and quivering, unable to look at him directly as she was ashamed.\nShe looked like a pitiful rabbit who was caught by its predator.\nHe quickly lifted his face as he felt it was inappropriate to bully her too much, and moved aside.\n“…Be careful. Who knows what I’ll do next time.”\nHe touched her face, and she quivered harder than before. With a wry smile, Amane got off the bed.\n“I’ll wash my face. Hurry up and wake up.”\nOnce again, Amane deliberately brought his face to her ear. Once he saw her shiver again, he chuckled, and went to the washroom.\nHe arrived at the washroom, had a look into the mirror, and realized that he too was blushing, not much better than Mahiru. He grumbled a little, and turned the faucet.",

      "content": "“Mahiru.”\n“Y-yes…!”\nEver since the day they slept together, Mahiru looked a little panicky whenever he spoke to her.\nIt appeared she was conscious of the fact that he pushed her down. She would blush whenever he touched her, and be at a loss.\nShe looked innocent and adorable, but he was a little devastated that she pulled a little distance from him.\nWhether she intended to or not, Mahiru would always touch him innocent, harmless, defenselessly. At this point however, she pulled her distance from him, and he was disappointed.\nSurely it showed that Mahiru was aware of him. The warmth he experienced till this point was gone however, and he felt anxious.\nAfter dinner, he looked towards Mahiru, who was seated next to him like usual. Once she noticed his stare, Mahiru’s face would turn slightly red as she openly turned her eyes aside.\nAmane knew the reason, but he felt conflicted by her attitude.\nHe tried reaching his hand out to touch her fingertips, and she would shiver like never before. She would sit down again, escape his warmth, and pull her distance from him.\nHe was unable to reach his hand again when he saw her cuddling the cushion, and could only sigh.\nLooks like she’s rather conscious of it.\nShe probably understood how dangerous Amane was, or rather, the masculine side of his. Her constant shunning of him left him very hurt.\nAmane could not grumble as he was the one who did that to her. It was his nature as a male to be disappointed.\n“Want me to move away?”\nAt this rate, it was likely Mahiru would keep shivering, and that would be pitiful.\nDo we have to keep our distance until she calms down…?\nhe asked the with such a notion, but she suddenly lifted her head and looked towards him.\n“T-that will be fine. I just need time to sort out my thoughts.”\n“I got the feeling it’s all because you wouldn’t listen to me.”\n“Ugh. But, who would have thought you would have explained to me in that manner.”\n“I’d died if I didn’t do that.”\n“Why would you be dead?”\n“I mean socially.”\nIt would be a big issue if news of him sleeping with a girl he was not dating spread. The situation would be out of hand if Mahiru carelessly accept Amane like that.\nAmane thus warned Mahiru, despite how forceful he was.\nHowever, the result was that Mahiru tensed up as she was overly conscious.\n“Seriously, watch out. Don’t give me any chance.”\n“…I-I understand this…”\n“I know I’m at fault too, that I shouldn’t just carelessly touch you, but even I don’t know what I’ll do the next time this happens again.”\nIf Mahiru slept before him again, Amane really did not know what he would do.\nHe did not want to betray Mahiru’s trust in him, and at the same time, had the urge to touch her. If she was too defenseless, he was confident that he would touch her lovingly.\nAmane did not know whether Mahiru was being careless because she liked him, or that she trusted his personality, but his endurance was at its limit.\n“…Amane-kun, I.”\n“What?”\n“…Nothing.”\nOnce he heard that little murmur, Amane asked out of curiosity, but Mahiru shook her blushing face.",

      "content": "“Had an argument with that person?”\nThe sharp Itsuki seemed to have noticed a strange distance between Amane and Mahiru, for he asked this question during lunchtime.\nOn a side note, Chitose and Mahiru did not join them. Three boys were eating together.\n“Eh, you had an argument, Fujimiya?”\n“No, not really…erm, well, sorta.”\n“Why are you making it so vague?”\n“…Anyway, something happened. She’s a little wary of me.”\nAfter all, there was no way he could say that they slept together on the same night and he knocked her down on the second day.\nAmane thus explained the situation without specifying matters, and felt a dumbfounded stare from Itsuki.\n“Seriously, how long are you going to chicken out?”\n“…Shut up.”\n“Hm, seeing how cautious Fujimiya is, I don’t think he’ll pursue her without reliable proof.”\n“That’s called being a chicken.”\nBoth of them stated bluntly, and their words stabbed at his heart.\nAmane always realized that he was overly cautious. As Kadowaki said, he would not confess until he was sure Mahiru liked him.\nAlso, while Amane wanted to date Mahiru, he was terrified of the surrounding grudges, and dared note act aggressively. This was a downside to the person he liked being popular.\n“…Well, I’ll think about it once I can measure up to her.”\n“Truth be told Fujimiya, you’re good in many ways. You’re just being too down on yourself.”\n“You’re saying that when you’re elite in everything, Kadowaki?”\nAmane would not be suffering this much if he had the looks, smarts and athleticism Kadowaki had.\nPeople would be jealous of Kadowaki if he dated Mahiru, but ultimately, they would agree that these two were too unattainable, that they would be a good match.\nOn the contrary, if everyone did not expect an ordinary boy to snag Mahiru, they would be blaming him. He was no different from everyone else, yet he got this unattainable flower. Surely the envy would be off the charts.\n“Hm, I don’t mean to be jealous, but I think if I can be like you Kadowaki, I probably cna be a little more confident.”\n“Just go on with the confidence.”\n“I’m trying. I can’t just muster confidence as and when I can.”\nAmane was working hard on his studies. At this point, he hoped to remain in the top 10.\nLuckily, his memory and studying skills were decent, and he probably did not need to put in much effort maintaining his grades. All he had to do was to increase his standards.\nThe problem was his athleticism.\nIt would be great if Amane had Kadowaki’s athleticism, but in fact, his was average. His abilities were more academic inclined, and he could not expect to perform in sports.\nIf he were any better, he could at least perform during the sports festival the next month.\n“I’ll try to work hard at my own pace. Stop pushing me.”\n“I’m fine with you saying this, Fujimiya…but seriously, the people looking are the stressed ones.”\n“Yeah. The ‘kick Amane in the back’ group will have another meeting then.”\n“Seriously, what are you two up to?”\nAmane’s face twitched. He did not expect them to come up with this group, and Kadowaki shrugged with an awkward smile, “Look we’re cheering you on…”",

      "content": "“Ahh, I’m red~.”\nChitose bemoaned once she saw the groupings of the sport festival that would be held next month.\nItsuki, who went earlier to have a look, was in Team White. They were thus on opposing teams.\n“Will be great if our groupings are the same as our family names~.”\n“You two will still be on opposing teams.”\nItsuki’s family name was Akazawa, or red swamp, while Chitose was Shirakawa, or white river. This was the reason why they were dubbed the red-white couple.\n“I see…this is a tragedy…we’re enemies, but there’s a forbidden love tying us together…”\nAmane blatantly rolled his eyes at the lovey-dovey couple pretend to lament their fates after becoming enemies, before looking at the team list.\nAmane and Kadowaki were on Team Red, which also had Chitose.\nItsuki and Mahiru were assigned to Team White. Kadowaki, the ace of the track team, was assigned to Team Red, but based on the class groupings, most of the sports club members were on Team White.\nAmane did not really care about winning, but he was a little worried about embarrassing himself before Mahiru.\n“What are you planning to participate in, Amane?”\nAfter the lovey-dovey act with Chitose, Itsuki walked over to chat with Amane.\nHe and Chitose were the organizing members representing their class. This position was really suitable for him considering how he was great at livening the class mood, but he disliked the hassle. Amane was impressed that Itsuki actually signed up for it.\n“What are the events? Let’s see.”\n“The only ones we can choose are probably sprints, relay race, obstacle race, borrowing race, three legged race, ball toss, tug-of-war. Since you aren’t in any club, I don’t think the club tug-of-war has anything to do with you.”\n“Can I just go with ball toss?”\n“You’re choosing the one you don’t stand out…at least two.”\n“Ball toss and borrowing race.”\nAmane did not want to embarrass himself before Mahiru, but the relay race and the sprints were where the sports clubs would show off. Amane would be out of place.\nAs for the three-legged race, he could not pair with Itsuki, who was on the opposition. Kadowaki was on his team, but he was not confident that he could match the speed and leg strength of the sports club members.\nI’ll just choose something I won’t cause trouble in,\nhe muttered, and Itsuki showed a wry smile.\n“You really choose something that doesn’t stand out…ah, no, maybe you’ll stand out during the borrowing race.”\n“I can’t really race after all.”\n“You sure aren’t confident.”\nAmane would want to avoid an outright tussle against the sports club. His safest option would be to choose the events the arts clubs would participate in.\n“The problem is all the guys have to participate in the cavalry battle…and you’re on the other team.”\nIn this class, Amane was only on good terms with Itsuki and Kadowaki, though it was not that he never spoke to the other boys.\nKadowaki’s team might take Amane out of sympathy, but even though, Amane felt that there might be a strange awkwardness.\nThe cavalry battle was basically where classmates on good terms would team up. Amane knew he was a peripheral figure, and did not have much interest in the sports festival.\n“Ah, that should be fine.”\n“Hm?”\n“Yuuta, Kazu and Makoto want to be on the same team as you. See, right on cue?”\nAmane looked over to where Itsuki pointed, and there were three boys waving at him. One of them was Kadowaki; Amane never really spoke to the other two.\nHowever, he knew them to some extent.\nThose two were on rather good terms with Kadowaki. “It’s a rare chance, but I hope you’ll get along with my friends.” Kadowaki once heartily chuckled, and these were the friends he referred to.\nOne of them was in the same track team as Kadowaki, adept at long distance running, and had a serious look. His name was Kazuya Hiiragi, the one Itsuki referred to as Kazu.\nThe other was relatively short amongst the boys, Makoto Kuju, said to be rather weak by the girls.\nWhenever he was not not with Amane’s group, Kadowaki would often spend time with them.\n“Oy Fujimiya. Over here. Let’s team up for the cavalry battle.”\nIn the middle of this group was Kadowaki, who called out to Amane with his usual hearty smile. While Amane was feeling confused, Itsuki nudged him from behind. “Go on.”\nHe went over rather hesitantly, and was welcomed with a beaming Kadowaki.\n“You haven’t teamed up right, Fujimiya? If you don’t mind, we hope you can team up with us.”\n“I’m fine with that, but are you two fine?”\n“Sure.”\nAnswering first was the more honest looking Kuju.\n“Yuuta and Kazuya are taller, and height wise, you’re most suitable.”\n“Ah, I see…”\nThe rider would have much difficulty if the trio beneath were of varying heights, and would be slower as a result. Kuju might be the rider, and was worried about this.\nAmane was taller, and was of similar heights next to Kadowaki and Hiiragi.\nAmane was rather weak in terms of physique however. He was not as sturdy or nimble as them.\n“You fine with that, Hiiragi?”\n“Sure. We’re asking you because of this. We heard you’re on good terms with Yuuta, so I’m curious too.”\n“Don’t worry. Fujimiya’s a good guy.”\n“Well, you have the eye for people’s characters, so I’m not worried about that. More importantly, even if you ask me if I’m willing to get along, I won’t know without trying.”\nAmane showed a wry smile at these blunt words, and Hiiragi stared at him unflinchingly.\nThis appraising look left Amane a little uncomfortable, but he did just join a group of friends who were well familiar with each other. It was to be expected why Hiiragi would do this.\n“Anyway, please take care of me.”\nHiiragi showed a somewhat kind smile, and Amane had a feeling the former did not outright reject him. Amane too smiled, “Same here. Please take care of me.”",

      "content": "“Fujimiya, just asking, are you on good terms with Shiina-san?”\nKadowaki organized a simply bonding session at the fast food restaurant, and Kuju was munching at a chicken nugget when he suddenly raised this question, as though he had just thought of it.\nAmane did his best to show a stoic look as he stuffed fries into his mouth.\nKadowaki invited the four of them to prepare for the cavalry battle…or just a bonding session. Amane went along, but he never expected someone unrelated to him to ask such a question.\nHe glanced towards Kadowaki, and saw the latter’s expression was clearly saying\nI didn’t say anything.\nIt appeared Kuju too was quite the perspective one one.\nHe assumed he was trying his best not to show any expression.\n“Why do you think so?”\n“Well, the 5 of you often talk together, including Yuuta. I get the feeling that Shiina-san treats you differently from Itsuki and Yuuta.”\n“Really? I didn’t notice it.”\nHiiragi widened his eyes at Amane in surprise. It appeared he was just surprised.\n“Well, it’s not like you’re slow, Kazuya…I think I’m the only one who noticed it. The others were just looking jealous.”\n“That’s scary…”\n“Guess I’m right from your reaction.”\nKuju had a stoic look when he asked, so Amane gave Kadowaki a questioning look of what was going on.\nI trust them. They should be fine.\nKadowaki answered with a look of his own. Amane scratched his face.\nIt appeared Kuju was certain of it, but Amane hoped that he would not go about spreading it.\nNevertheless, Kadowaki might really have an eye for people, and Kuju’s question simply seemed to be one of curiosity, rather than gossipy. There was no malice in his question.\n“…Well, we’re on good terms.”\n“It looks like Shiina-san’s taking care of you. Guess I’m right.”\n“…Does it look that way?”\n“Sorta.”\nKuju’s insight was really terrifying.\nIt might be better for Amane to tell some truth rather than come up with a flimsy excuse, and this would make him more trustworthy if they were to bond.\n“Well, our places are close to each other, and I get chances to talk to her. We’re just on better terms.”\n“Was that before we’re in our second year?”\n“Yeah. We started interacting in school during this second year. Pretended to be strangers before that though.”\nOf course, Amane could not say that Mahiru was his neighbor who came to his house every day to cook. That would sound too surreal, so he simply mentioned something that was true to a certain extent.\nUpon hearing Amane’s explanation, “You already knew, Yuuta?” Kuju looked towards Kadowaki.\nSince the man himself said so, Kadowaki had nothing to hide, so he nodded. Kuju then sighed.\n“Well, you really are too kind.”\n“Kind?”\n“Nothing, just a comment to myself…so you’ve been hiding it from us, Yuuta.”\n“Of course I won’t say it when Fujimiya won’t. I don’t think you two will go about spreading it.”\n“Of course. There’s no way I’ll go out and do such an annoying thing.”\n“Your honesty’s a virtue, Kazuya.”\nKadowaki grinned away, and while Hiiragi was praised, he tilted his head. His face was clearly showing no suspicion about other people’s kindness, as though he was saying,\nwhy do you have to state the obvious?\nAmane felt there was a certain danger to that, but the fact remained that Hiiragi was a good guy.\nHiiragi too was famous for being serious, upright and honest, though in a different manner from Kadowaki. Amane was shocked, and yet he understood in amazement that he was truly Kadowaki’s friend.\nKadowaki had a keen insight of people, and there was nothing wrong with his choice of friends.\n“So we just don’t have to tell others.”\n“But Kazuya, you can’t really lie. I think it’s best for you to pretend not to know. Anyway, even if anyone suspect that those two are on good terms, they’ll ask guys like Itsuki and Yuuta, not you I guess.”\n“You’re right.”\nKadowaki chuckled, and Amane relaxed.\n“Nn, that’ll be of great help. I don’t want her to get into trouble.”\nAmane hoped to keep things under wraps, and was grateful that they would not say it out.\n“She probably doesn’t wants others to nitpick her choice of friends. I hope you guys can leave her alone for her sake.”\nAmane knew that if others learned of these, he would be reproached and envied, and steeled himself of it. There would surely be some who would ask Mahiru, albeit without malice, “Why Fujimiya?”\nTo the people at school, Mahiru was someone special, even if she was not a celestial being.\nJust as how nobles would be criticized for interacting with plebeians, so would questioning voices reach Mahiru.\nSuch questions were to be expected, but Mahiru would probably feel displeased by it. At the very least, she hoped to have a choice on who she should date.\nAnd…even if it was a guess, Amane had a feeling that Mahiru would be angry for his sake if he was belittled.\nHe did not want to rattle Mahiru’s heart, and hoped that they would hide this fact.\n…I don’t know if it’s just me, but it feels like Mahiru wants an overt relationship.\nThey had started interacting at school recently, and he felt the distance between them had shortened, but he merely dismissed this thought as him thinking too much.\n“…Ah, ahh…”\n“What’s with you, Kuju?”\n“…Nothing, just that I’m starting to understand. You have it tough.”\nKuju looked towards Amane with a somewhat perturbed look, though it was more dumbfounded. Amane in turn looked confused.\n“Yuuta, did you.”\n“Yeah.”\n“What, what are you talking about?”\n“I don’t think you’ll understand, Kazuya. Don’t mind.”\nEven though Kuju stated it so bluntly, “Guess I won’t understand.” Hiiragi did not seem to have his mood dampened. Such a response might be due to their trust and friendship.\nKadowaki and Kuju nodded in seemingly mutual understanding. Amane did not know what those two understood as he ate his fries, looking confused.",

      "content": "“What are you participating in for the sports festival, Mahiru?”\nAmane asked Mahiru after dinner. She took out ice cream from the fridge, and put the leftovers into a tupperware.\nOnce she poured the Chikuzenni that was for dinner into the tupperware, she handed Amane a spoon, and looked up as though she was trying to recall.\n“I am in the relay and the borrowing race.”\n“Oh, something in common. I chose the ball toss and the borrowing race.”\nHe did not know if his entry would pass, but he felt he should be able to, given how unpopular the ball toss game was.\nIt would be strange if he failed the borrowing race, but he did put a obstacle race as his third option, so he was fine with that/\nAn obstacle race did not simply rely on legpower. It required balance and flexibility. Amane’s running ability was average, but he probably would not pull his teammates.\n“You are not intending to exercise at all.”\n“I’m not really good at sports. leave that to the experts.”\n“…I remember your sports grades are average, Amane-kun.”\n“Unfortunately, yes.”\nIf his athleticism was any better, Amane might be a little more enthusiastic. Unfortunately, he was not really good at it.\nNevertheless, he was not so weak to be deathly afraid of sports, and was at least average.\nHe was unlike Kadowaki and Mahiru, both who had the grit and the talents. For him, the best of both worlds was something completely distant from him.\n“…You hate the sports festival?”\n“Hmm, I don’t really hate sports. I just don’t like to be forced to exercise.”\nAs they returned to the living room sofa, Amane recalled the painful memories of the winter marathon.\nIt was not that he did not have the athleticism, and he could at least run the distance during classes. Truth be told however, he felt it was pointless to finish a certain course within a time limit.\nHe might feel happier if he could complete his goal at his own pace. He really felt that compulsion really was bad for the mind.\nAmane frowned as he removed the lid of the ice cream, and Mahiru gave a little wry smile.\n“It is not that I do not understand. I dislike it when others force themselves.”\n“Right? I’ll just go at it casually…or just normally, contribute a little here and there.”\nIf he slacked too much, others would tell him off, and he would feel guilty.\nHe might not go all out, but he intended to perform suitably. There was no room for him to actually do so however if his primary choices were accepted.\n“Fufu. I will not see you perform then, Amane-kun.”\n“Relax, I’ll do well during the ball toss…probably.”\n“Probably?”\n“It’s not a flashy event. I won’t really stand up.”\nAmane did not understand why even though they were in high school, there was such a cute event called the ball toss. Some high schools had excluded them, yet his school kept it.\nPerhaps it was for the sake of those absolutely horrible at sports, but even so, there would unlikely be any tension when it came to the event.\n“You are rather accurate when throwing items. You never missed when you threw tissues into the basket.”\nThough it is because you are lazy,\nshe quipped, which had him wryly smiling.\n“Cut me some slack here. I never missed anyway.”\n“It is fine when you are at home. Anyway, you are really accurate at throwing.”\n“Well, I’m good at throwing, including darts. Mom brought me out before, and I did well.”\nThe mother’s escapades with the son included lots of places.\nThis included outdoor activities like survival games, white water rafting, to indoor like darts, bowling, game centers. Amane was dragged to various places, and picked up lots of useless skills.\nOne was of use this time around, so he could not say they were all useless.\n“Have you received some form of gifted education?”\n“For games, maybe.”\n“Shihoko-san is really amazing in a certain sense.”\nMahiru muttered in amazement rather than surprise. As the one who was dragged along however, Amane could not fully agree.\nHe was really grateful for Shihoko.\nShihoko had him gain lots of experiences, and back when he was depressed in middle school, she treated him like usual. It was for this reason that Amane was able to recover from a fatal spiral.\nNevertheless, he hoped Shihoko would not wear him out by bringing him to so many places.\n“…It is such an event after all, and I don’t think I’ll really stand out. I’ll try, somewhat, though I’m not too happy about it.”\nHe mused, stabbed the spoon into the suitably melted ice cream, and had a mouthful.\nBy the way, the ice cream in his hand was manufactured by a certain premium chocolate company that was only sold in convenience stores. It was less sweet, and filled with rich cocoa flavor.\nIt was priced at 500 yen, and was relatively expensive. Amane intended to treasure each mouthful dearly.\n“Do you really dislike the sports festival?”\n“No actually, it’s getting hotter, and it’ll be annoying to stand out there in gym clothes for half a day, even if there’s a tent.”\n“Well, I guess that is correct when you put it that way. You have to work hard though?”\n“I’ll moderate myself.”\n“Goodness.”\nMahiru pouted, but she was staring intently at the spoon, or rather the ice cream. Amane was left smiling wryly.\nHe thought he should have bought Mahiru one since she had quite the sweet tooth, and tried putting the spoon before her. Her eyes momentarily glowed.\nMan, she’s way easier to understand compared to before\n. He chuckled to himself, and brought the spoon near her lips. Like a kitten fed by her master, she put the spoon into her mouth.\nHer eyes narrowed into a slit.\nThe ice cream should be delicious. It was obvious from her face.\nMahiru and Amane had sensitive tongues compared to the normal person, and could precisely pinpoint the good and bad of the taste. Since she was eating it so happily, he appeared he got the right brand.\n“…This is of premium, no?”\n“You can tell?”\n“From the packaging. This is better than I expected.”\n“Really? Here.”\nAmane handed another large mouthful, and Mahiru ate it obediently, showing a satisifed smile.\nShe showed an expression more blissful than an ice cream melting under room temperature, and his body heat slowly rose up his face.\n…Uh oh. I’m now feeding her.\nAmane intended to maintain a normal distance from Mahiru whenever possible, but it ended up this way.\nMahiru too was so conscious of Amane, yet she gave such a careless expression. Typically speaking, she would not feel happy to be fed by a boy.\n“…Mahiru, take it all.”\n“Hm?”\n“I’m not eating it. Brewing some coffee. This is for you.”\nAmane handed the ice cream cup and the spoon to Mahiru, and escaped to the kitchen. Feeling despondent, he dumped the coffee beans and the filter paper into the coffee maker.",

      "content": "Early June, the sweaty season arrived, and Amane’s school held its sports festival.\nUnlike the peaceful mood of those in elementary and middle schools, the high school sports festival felt more like an extension of the classroom, and hardly any parents would show up.\nDespite that, the sports festival remained one of the few activities, and some of the students were rather excited. The juniors of the sports clubs especially were particularly riled up, for perhaps they assumed this was a chance for them to show their club advisors of their abilities.\nIn contrast, most members of the culture clubs were not particularly enthused.\nAmane did not join any clubs, and was more of the latter.\n“It’s tiring.”\nA classmate muttered under the same tent. Amane showed a wry smile when he heard that.\nAmane was not enthusiastic, but even he would not look so unmotivated. He acted as though it did not involve him.\nLuckily, his primary choices were chosen, so he did not have to go running about. The most activity he would require was the cavalry battle all boys had to participate in.\n“You don’t look like you dislike this, Fujimiya. I thought you would.”\nKadowaki too was under the Red Team tent, and looked at Amane’s face in surprise.\n“Well, I passed the registration, and I’m just lazing around now, so I don’t really hate it. I think studying’s a lot easier though.\n“That’s rare from you though…”\n“Well, Fujimiya, you’re great at studying, but not at sports. Not like you can do anything.”\nAmane could not deny the words of the eavesdropping Hiiragi, and showed a wry smile.\nIn fact, this was the case, and he could not deny it. Nevertheless, he felt conflicted to have someone pinpoint this.\nAmane was grateful to be told that he was great at studies, and impressed this was others thought of him. He could not help but admire those who had brains and brawns however.\n“Maybe I should exercise regularly. I do some jogging and running though.”\n“If my house’s a little closer, I can go jogging with you Fujimiya.”\n“There’s no way I can match your speed and stamina Kadowaki.”\n“Yeah Yuuta. Didn’t you forget that the last time I joined you, I was about to die? that wasn’t a jog, that was a sprint.”\nIt appeared Kuju had once accompanied Kadowaki on a jog, and at this point, he looked worn out.\nOn a side note, he was a culture club member, rather than sports, the Astrology club in fact. He was skinny, delicate, short, white-skinned, and clearly did not seem the sporty kind.\nBut well, the delicate and petite Mahiru was quite athletic herself, so not all people of his size were like that.\n“But I think you should be fine, Fujimiya. You didn’t seem that tired during the marathon.”\n“I do train everyday since I think about what happens when I’m old, but I can’t beat those who do sports.”\n“You’re the only one who’ll think about what happens when you grow out…”\n“You’re weird Fujimiya. No actually, I think you’re interesting, you know?”\n“Are you praising me?”\nHiiragi was upright and honest, and overly blunt…so curt with his words. Amane understood that immediately after they got along.\n“I guess Kazuya’s praising you, probably.”\n“Thanks for that.”\n“No need for that.”\n“What’s with this conversation…?”\nKuju did not hide how nonplussed he was, but he was not mocking them.\nThere was some relief in his expression, so it appeared he did not really mean what he said.\n“Ah whatever, you’re always an airhead, Kazuya.”\n“I don’t think I am…”\n“Well, you’re the only one who doesn’t know. It’s fine, don’t mind. Just be who you are.”\n“Ugh, really?”\nHiiragi easily accepted this fact, and did not ask further. “Is this really fine…?” Amane muttered, and looked towards the track.\nThe participants were ready to sprint.\nIt was probably a 100m sprint, given the angle of the track. The first group had finished running, and the second group started lining up.\nIt appeared the second group was the girls’ race. The faster runners of the Red Team were gathered there.\nOne of them was a familiar girl with brown hair.\n“Eh, does Chitose run fast?”\n“Ahh, Shirakawa-san’s fast. She was in the track team during middle school.”\n“Eh, really?”\n“Yeah. But she didn’t join in high school. They say that she had an argument with a club senior, and it’s too much of a hassle to join.”\n“Shall I retort about the fact that she actually argued?”\n“No erm, there’s a reason for that…anyway, she learned her lesson, or rather, she’s tired.”\n“…Tired?”\n“A lot of setbacks happened when Shirakawa-san and Itsuki dated. But well, hm, someone in the track team liked Itsuki.”\n“Ah I get it.”\nThe two of them were the official couple recognized by everyone in their year, but back in middle school, it was Itsuki who aggressively pursued Chitose.\nIt was said that Chitose was a lot more aloof compared to the present, and Itsuki spent so much effort to woo her, until they finally got together.\nOne could easily imagine what would have happened if the senior who liked Itsuki witnessed that.\n“She didn’t join the club because it’s too much trouble for her. She does like running though. You can see her running sometimes.”\nSince she lives near me,\nKadowaki quipped with a chuckle, and looked towards Chitose who crouched down.\nAmane was practically an amateur, but he could tell Chitose’s posture was solid, beautiful even.\nShe did not have that usual nonsensical, carefree smile when viewed from afar. She looked serious, pumped up for this.\nThe gunshot rang.\nAt this moment, she was the fastest to act.\nAnyone would have said that her posture was wonderful. She was fast as the wind, and even overtook the girls of the track time.\nHer soft hair fell behind her, and her body charged forth. She stomped hard, and arrived at the finish line faster than the others.\nHer running movement was mesmerizing, and she passed the finish line before they all knew it.\nOnce she finished, she took the winner flag, and looked towards the Red Team, towards Amane, and chuckled.\nOne might feel relieved seeing her wave the flag ferociously.\nOnce she was done running the 100m, Chitose returned, and proudly puffed her chest.\n“I’m back~ you saw it?”\n“We did we did. You’re really fast.”\n“Wow~ Thanks~!”\n“Yeah. The way you run looks comfortable, Shirakawa.”\nChitose looked greatly pleased to be praised by two current members of the track team. “Good work. You ran fast.” Amane too praised.\nIn fact, she was so unexpectedly fast that Amane was taken aback. “Ehh, I’m happy.” However, Chitose seemed fine with that as she grinned away.\nPerhaps it was just her, but the lack of tension this time seemed different from when she was running. Amane’s face relaxed.\n“But you’re as fast as usual, Shirakawa.”\n“Heh heh~, I’ve been training every day. Though I’m not as fast as I used to be during my club time.”\nIt seemed Chitose was faster back in middle school, which was shocking. Amane had many who had particular strengths around him, like athleticism, brains, and so on. He felt really envious as an ordinary person.\nHiiragi appeared to be from the same middle school as Kadowaki and the others, but he was shocked that Chitose had this speed even though she did not join the track team.\n“I’ve been thinking, how are you so fast? is it because you have a small surface area and have little air resistance?”\n“Hey Kazuyan, what do you mean, small surface area?”\n“Hm? I’m talking about height.”\nWhat else am I referring to?\nHiiragi stared at Chitose with an honest look, and Chitose immediately frowned.\nThe latter might have been embarrassed at herself, rather than angry. Surely she had assumed Hiiragi was talking about her body.\nOn a side note, Chitose was not as petite as Mahiru, but she was not really taller.\nShe was relatively taller than the average girl, but not particularly tall for a track member.\nAlso, she was lanky unlike a typical sportsperson. Perhaps this was why Hiiragi was shocked at her speed.\nHiiragi’s expression showed no other intent. It was all Chitose’s misunderstanding.\n“You embarrassed yourself huh, Shirakawa-san.”\n“Shut up, Makochin.”\nChitose blushed as she slapped at Kuju’s back, sitting next to time. Amane showed a wry smile, ensuring that she would not notice.",

      "content": "The only events Amane had to participate were the ball toss, the borrowing race, and the cavalry battle all the boys had to participate. Thus, he was rather free.\nSome particularly enthusiastic went for more than two, but Amane was not particularly invested in the sports festival, so he only registered for these two, and the group event.\nJust to note, the ball toss ended.\nThere was not much passion in such a competition, and it was merely a matter of throwing balls into a basket hanging up there.\nThey had to snatch the thrown balls, but there were already lots of them, and no need to contest. The entire competition ended peacefully.\nChitose nudged Amane in the back, wanting him to be active, but there was no reason to stand out.\nThe ball toss was merely a game of picking a few balls, gathering them at a spot, and throwing them at a basket. It was nothing particularly outstanding, just a boorish repeat of actions.\nThe only matter of particular note was that they scored more than the White Team. it probably was because they were more accurate, and gathered the balls in the first place.\n“You really choose the really boring events Amane~”\n“Shut up. It’s your duty soon. Hurry on.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nChitose looked at her schedule “Man, being a committee member sure is busy~” she grumbled as she went over to the organizing tent.\nThen why did you sign up for the job?\nhe wondered, but it was a little too late.\nHe watched Chitose skip off, and scanned the schedule pinned on the tent pole.\nThere were only a few events left for the morning. This would include Amane’s last personal event, the borrowing race.\nOnce they ended, it would be lunch break, followed by the afternoon.\nIn other words, once the borrowing race ended, Amane was only left with the cavalry battle.\n“…But seriously, she’s in charge of the borrowing race?”\nSince she was taking over this time, it appeared Chitose would be in charge of the following events, and she would be the judge…Amane had a feeling she was aiming for this.\nHe did not know who would be deciding the items, but it was likely someone planned something, which scared him.\nHis heart suddenly felt heavy, but he went towards the gathering spot for the next event, the borrowing race. It appeared Mahiru too went for this event, for she was waiting silently over there.\nThere was nothing for them to talk about, so Amane did not speak up. The moment his eyes met Mahiru’s however, she smiled and nodded towards him.\nThey kept their distance outdoors, but Amane’s heart raced a little once he saw her give her usual smile.\nAmane acknowledged her with a usual stoic look, but he was feeling uneasy inside.\nAnd Chitose, organizing this sports festival, looked at Amane and Mahiru happily.\nOnce it was time for the event, the participants followed the instructions of the in-charge…Chitose, and went to the field.\nThere were lots of folded paper scattered on the field. On her command, they could then pick up these papers, and retrieve the item listed inside.\nUnlike the other races, this borrowing race was rather leisurely, and the objective was to enjoy the borrowing process. They did not have to be so serious.\nDepending on the listed item however, one might end up in a public execution. He had to be careful.\n“All participants, please stand on the starting line.”\nChitose gave clear instructions through the microphone. She could be a proper emcee, assuming that she did not fool around. She had a cheery personality, was adept at reading the mood and situation, loud and clear, not too shrill, and could gather attention.\n“On your marks.” she did not fool around at all for the time being, as all the students and staff were watching.\nThe gun however was held by another boy, so she was just in charge of the countdown.\n“Get set” a beat after she called out, the airgun was fired.\nThe sound of this gunshot would always be bad for the heart, but Amane stoically jogged towards where the papers were put.\nThe faster runners had already opened the papers and read the contents. Amane followed them, picked up a folded one, and saw what was inside.\nThere were a few words in proper handwriting.\n“Someone you think is pretty.”\nHe was asked to pick a person and not an item, but he did expect something like that.\nHe really want to comment about who would choose such topics, but luckily for him, he could somehow deal with this.\nAt the very least, it was not the hardest kind of question, ‘the person he likes’. He simply had to choose someone who was objectively pretty.\nIn other words, he had to call over the acclaimed beauty…which would be Mahiru. Once Mahiru was done borrowing her item, he would just have to bring her along to the finish line.\nThough he might stand out if he be brought her along, it was the requirement. Everyone would think it was an appropriate decision once they knew what he had to take.\nSuch was his thought as he intended to look for Mahiru, who probably was looking for a piece of paper…someone grabbed at his T-shirt next to him.\nTruth be told, she was pinching rather than grabbing. The hem was tugged at a few times, and he turned around skeptically.\nRight before him was the person he was looking for, looking at him worriedly.\n“Fujimiya-san, I will have to borrow you. Will you come along with me after you borrow what you need?”\n“Eh, me?”\n“Yes.”\nAmane never expected them to have to borrow each other.\nIn a certain sense, this was good, but he felt it was too obvious.\nThey were in the middle of the field however, and since Mahiru had already spoken to him, there was no point worrying about standing out.\nChitose, standing opposite the finishing line, smirked away as she looked at them.\nI’ll remember this!\nWell, Chitose was the one who wrote the papers, so these items were certainly part of her plan. He did not know what Mahiru drew, but since the latter chose him, he felt Mahiru would never budge on the answer.\n“Ahh…anyway, what do you need to borrow?”\n“It is a secret.”\nTheir items would be announced once they crossed the finish line, yet Mahiru was unwilling to speak up.\nAmane could only sigh, and head towards the finish line.\n“Well I need to borrow you too, let’s go to the finishing line together.”\n“…What do you need to borrow, Fujimiya-san?”\n“It’s a secret.”\nHe returned the same answer to her, and she smiled.\n“We shall know once we cross the finish line, then.”\nShe said, and held Amane’s hand.\nShe ignored the buzz around them, and led Amane to the finish line.\nAmane felt a little wince in his gut, but once he saw how elated Mahiru was, he felt it was to be expected. He thus realized the one who fell for the other would be disadvantaged.\nOnce they passed the field, which he could not bear to stay on, they crossed the finish line. A really delighted Chitose welcomed them.\nAmane unwittingly clicked his tongue, and Chitose did not seem to mind.\n“Huh, both of you are crossing the line together~? I do remember you two are participating in this.”\n“Damn you, Chitose, what’s with you leering away? We’re borrowing each other.”\n“Hahaha~ let’s see what you got then. Who’s first?”\n“Fujimiya-san, please.”\nAmane was shocked that Mahiru answered without hesitation. Chitose seemed to have understood as she pointed at Amane’s paper, perhaps wanting him to show her.\nHe probably felt there was no need to hide it, so he showed the paper to her.\nOnce she saw it, Chitose looked slightly disappointed.\nAmane did not know what Chitose hoped for, but it seemed the result was not what she wanted.\nDespite that, she regained her vigor, and beamed away as she brought the microphone to her mouth.\n“Now we’re checking the item. Number 1 of the Red Team got…\n“Someone you think is pretty\n.”\nOnce they heard the question, there was a relieved vibe from everyone.\nAmane made a safe choice. As far as he knew, there was no one in school prettier than Mahiru. He did think she was the cutest.\nHis opinion aside, bringing Mahiru over was really a normal choice.\nThere would be hostility since he arrived at the finish line along with her, but it appeared to have simmered because of the topic.\nThe issue was Mahiru’s item.\nAmane did not know what she chose, but since she specifically chose him, he started to wonder if her listed item would mean the death of his peaceful school life.\nChitose received the paper from Mahiru, blinked away, and looked at Mahiru’s face.\nAmane could not see the paper from his angle, but her experience seemed to be wondering, c\nan I really say this?\nWhat’s this item that needs me to be here?\nChitose’s reaction left Amane all the more nonplussed.\nMahiru’s smile remained so serene. In other words, she was fine with it being said out.\nOnce she understood Mahiru’s intent, Chitose showed her usual smile.\n“Hmm~in that case, coming in at the same time is Number 1 of the White Team. The topic she got is…\nsomeone important\n.”\nOnce her voice resounded throughout the field, there was an immediate buzz at the students rest area.\nAmane instinctively looked towards Mahiru, whose eyes met his, her pink lips showing a smile.\nThat smile was of a child who had successfully executed a prank, along with some tinge of bashfulness.\nThe one thing certain was that Mahiru looked towards Amane, wanting to know his reaction once he knew what her item was.\nYou little devil…\nAlways the deep thinker, Mahiru could easily visualize the surrounding reactions if she revealed her topic.\nDespite that, Mahiru chose Amane as her borrowed item, to bring change into their relationship.\nHenceforth, they would no longer be mere strangers.\nShe was not showing the beautiful smile she usually had at school, but a sincere one towards Amane. “Everyone’s going to ask us questions after this.” Amane groaned as he ruffled his hair.",

      "content": "“What’s going on, Fujimiya?”\nAfter the morning games ended, they returned to the classroom, and unsurprisingly, Amane was questioned by the boys in this class.\nMahiru was the unattainable flower, the one admired. That Mahiru borrowed Amane in front of everyone, under the pretext of being an important person. Amane understood that the boys found it unfair, but he too was troubled to be suddenly interrogated.\n“E-even if you ask.”\n“Why are you with Shiina-san!? As her important person!?”\n“Anyway, when did it start?”\n“You didn’t interact at all, right!? You only started eating together recently, didn’t you!?”\n“What does Shiina-san see in you!?”\n“We don’t understand at all!”\nEvery single question had him on the brink of giving up.\nTruth be told, though he had expected to be questioned, the boys’ interrogation was much more intense than he anticipated. He hardly had the time to eat lunch.\nOf course, the boys were not the only ones who reacted. The girls did not join in, but they too gave Amane some looks. Some appeared to be sizing him up, some looked delighted, and some even looked relieved.\nIt was likely due to their biggest competitor Mahiru liking Amane.\nThe sizing looks in turn were probably wondering,\nthat Mahiru had fallen for this guy? How is he like?\nAll the stares in class were gathered upon him, and he was already groggy from the attention.\nOn a side note, Itsuki and Kadowaki were a little away from the other boys “Ahh” giving wry grins. Chitose too looked at them, looking strangely excited. Amane really hoped these people would come save him.\n“Please do not bully him excessively.”\nThe first to reach out and save him was the other person involved, Mahiru herself.\nShe might have gone off to buy isotonic drinks, for she arrived late in the class. There were PET bottles in her hands, and they were covered in sweat as the weather was a little hotter.\nOnce her eyes met Amane’s she showed a gentle smile.\nThanks to that, the boys shot murderous iooks at him, and he was really stressed out.\n“Amane-kun will be troubled if he cannot have lunch during noon break.”\nOnly intimate people would call each other by names. It appeared Mahiru was no longer intending to conceal how she usually addressed him.\nShe did not mind even though she was the center of attention from both boys and girls. One boy finally had enough, and went towards Mahiru…he was the one who confronted Amane up close.\n“Shiina-san! You said Fujimiya’s your important per,”\n“Amane-kun is the important person to me.”\nMahiru confirmed decisively, showing the smile no different from usual.\nMahiru confirmed decisively, and showed a smile no different from usual.\nOnce the boy saw that Angel’s peerless smile, he was momentarily intimidated. Though he lost some morale, he continued asking, perhaps due to the support of the surrounding stares.\n“E-erm…in that case, lovers?”\n“Even if that is so, is there anything you wish to say to me?”\n“No, what I mean is…if you’re lovers…why someone like Fujimiya?”\n“Someone like Fujimiya?”\n“Ah, no, erm, that unimpressive looking Fujimiya, doesn’t seem suitable, to be dating you, Shiina-san. There are better.”\n“Really?”\nAmane gave a thousand yard stare, thinking that the boy had stepped on Mahiru’s nerves.\nMahiru hated Amane for looking down on himself. According to her, she did not wish for Amane to receive inappropriate opinions.\nBy the same logic, she hated it when others too derided him.\nFrom Amane’s viewpoint, he did not show any of his old self, no matter how Mahiru viewed him. He felt this opinion was just, and did not deny that he did not look impressive.\nWhether Mahiru would allow that however was a different matter.\nThe smile on Mahiru’s face remained the usual.\nBut the vibe around her had frozen a slightly.\n“No, erm.”\n“What is unimpressive about him?”\n“Eh?”\n“May you be specific of how he is unimpressive?”\n“Th-the vibe around him, his looks, and erm.”\n“Will you choose someone to like based on his appearance?”\n“N-no, erm.”\n“Will you choose someone to stay with for a long time based on his appearance?”\nThe Angelic smile remained on Mahiru’s face. That should be the case, but she was exuding an extraordinary pressure. To put it, she might be angry.\nEven Amane, who was quite the distance away from her, could feel it. The boy facing her might be feeling it more.\nThat boy surely realized the rage beneath her smile.\nEven though Amane could only see his back, he realized the boy was terrified and rooted.\n“E-erm…”\n“Sorry, I should not have bullied you.”\nThe pressure subsided, and Mahiru’s face reverted back to the disturbed, gentle smile.\nBut the boy she was facing stumbled a little, for he caused the always gentle and smiling Mahiru to be furious.\n“I shall correct your words. Amane-kun is cool and kind. I like how poised he is, the warm disposition he has. He is also very gentlemanly, and willing to respect me. When I was suffering, he would stay by my side to console me, and was considerate for my sake. He is not someone to badmouth others at least, nor will be get in the way of other people’s love.”\nMahiru went for the haymaker at the very end.\nHer declaration at the very end was clearly stating,\nI will not fall for you when you badmouthed him in front of me.\n“Is there anything else you wish to say?”\nShe tilted her head with a cute smile, prompting the boy to say. He was at his limit, and whimpered nearly inaudibly, “No, nothing.” He weakly left before her sights.\nMahiru looked towards Amane, her line of vision unhindered.\nAmane was troubled, wondering if he should be blushing that he had basically received a confession in front of everyone, or pale that he had to consider what would happen in the future? Mahiru showed him the most beautiful smile for the day.\nIt was different from her Angelic smile, it was an elated, sweet smile she would show at his house.\n“Amane-kun, let us eat together.”\n“…Oh.”\nNone of the boys questioned Amane anymore.\n“She said it first.”\n“ugh.”\nAfter the various events in the afternoon, the cavalry battle was finally about to start. Amane and the others were huddled together, and Amane was speechless once he heard Kadowaki mutter.\nThey were far from the tent, for the stares around them were really annoying.\nThere were still people looking, but it was incomparable to before, still relatively fine.\nYou should have gone first, Amane.\nSuch was the implication in Kadowaki’s words, and Amane could not refute it.\n“I can tell, somewhat, but are you really on such good terms with Shiina-san, Fujimiya?”\nKuju looked a little doubtful. Perhaps he had sensed a little change in the relationship between Amane and Mahiru.\n“Hm, well, we started getting along since last year.”\n“So you’ve been hiding this the entire time? Well, I can understand from the commotion during noon break.”\nHe gave Amane a sympathetic look.\nKuju, Hiiragi and Amane were all in the same class, but the former two could not approach when Amane was surrounded and interrogated.\nThey were not on good terms with Amane, and their decisions were sound, but Amane really hoped that Itsuki and Kadowaki would help him out a little.\n“But it’s really amazing. It sure felt good seeing Shiina adamantly dump those useless guys.”\n“Rather than calling them useless, I just think this incident really shocked them too much…”\n“Hm really? But if he’s a guy, he should have just confessed outright to a girl he likes. They didn’t do that, they harassed Fujimiya, and badmouthed him. They’re bums. They dared not risk yet wanted to get her, and kick up a fuss when they couldn’t get her. That’s not just being useless, that’s just being immature.”\n“Ugh.”\n“Kazuya, some of those words hit Fujimiya in his sore spot.”\nBut if he’s a guy, he should have just confessed outright to a girl he\nlikes. These words accurately stabbed at Amane’s heart.\n“Yep, because I’m getting anxious for Fujimiya.”\n“Shiina-san has clearly stated that she likes you.”\nAmane knew that.\nMahiru did this much, and Amane could no longer lie to himself. He could be certain that Mahiru clearly had feelings for him.\n…I know this much.\nAmane knew very well how cowardly he was. He was running away, for fear of being rejected.\n“Fujimiya, do you like Shiina?”\n“You can’t tell, Kazuya…?”\n“In that case, why don’t you just confess to her? Given her attitude, it’s obvious Shiina likes you.”\n“…I know. She made this step, and I too have to step up.”\nAmane understood that it would be embarrassing of him to not do anything when she went this far.\nHe also understood that as Mahiru had expressed her feelings, he should respond with sincerity. He already decided his answer; all that was left was how to convey it.\nHiiragi gave a determined Amane a delighted smile.\n“Yeah, that’s how it is. Anyway, let’s knock down the opponents during the cavalry battle.”\nThose guys are definitely going to aim for us.\nHe was happy for some reason, and Amane could only give a wry smile.\n“I’ll get a heavy responsibility, you know?” Kuju grumbled deflatedly, for he was to be the rider, but he just sounded despondent rather than annoyed, and Amane was a little relieved.\n“How about you learn from Kazuya, Fujimiya? Let’s knock down a few more of them.”\n“I’ll try my best.”\nAmane felt he should show some manliness, fend off all the hands reaching for Mahiru, and possess her for himself.\nAnyway, I’ll explain things properly when I get hom.\nThus, he would have to ensure things go smoothly in the afternoon match. Amane pumped himself up, and the other trio exchanged smiles.",

      "content": "“Man that was harsh…”\nAmane had a bath, washed away the dirt on his body, and once done, he leaned on the welsofa, feeling comfortably fatigued from the exercise.\nAs expected, he was attacked furiously during the cavalry battle.\nThough it was expected, the aggressive bumps caused Kadowaki and the others much trouble.\n“This is youth huh?” Hiiragi said excitedly, giving a bloodthirsty grin. Perhaps he liked such competition after all.\nAmane’s team did not survive till the very end as they faced the incoming onslaught. Thanks to their rider Kuju’s heroics, they got more headbands they imagined.\nKuju contributed the most, but Mahiru, observed in the opposing ranks, smiled at Amane.\nAnd just like that, the afternoon matches ended, followed by the closing ceremony. After the usual cleanup, Amane returned home.\nToo many things happened, and he ended up all weary, but the day did not end.\n…I have to say this.\nMahiru mustered such courage to reveal their relationship publicly, and chose to establish a relationship with Amane.\nHis pride as a boy would be ruined if he dithered and did not reciprocate those feelings.\nBut how am I supposed to do it?\nHe made up his mind, but once he thought about how he had to confess, he was hesitant and troubled. Perhaps this was the reason why he was derided as a coward.\nIt was the first time in his life that he had really fallen for someone. it was no wonder he was troubled, given that he had to confess to such a person.\nGirls surely wanted to be confessed to under such a romantic atmosphere. How do I convey my feelings to make her happy?\nThese frustrations would never garner any answer as they continued to swirl in Amane’s mind.\nWhile he put his hands on his forehead, wondering what to do, he heard the door unlock.\nHe shuddered, for the sound indicated the arrival of the girl who caused him frustration, the girl who unlocked the door using his key.\nit was the first time in his life that he was really tense hearing the sound from the door.\nThe door was then shut and locked.\nThe slippers echoed off the floor, and a sound seemingly encompassed the air…appearing at the entrance was the familiar girl with the flax-colored hair.\n“Amane-kun.”\nThe faint red lips formed a gentle arch, a gentle expression.\nShe showed a expression similar to the usual, as though the buzz at school never happened. No, her smile was sweeter than usual, and his heart pounded faster.\nOne had to wonder if she noticed how shaken Amane was, for she sat next to him as usual.\nThe distance between them was smaller than a fist.\nShe was about to position herself again, and the soft silky hair fluttered, the shampoo fragrance flung violently towards Amane.\nIt appeared Mahiru too went home to wash away her sweat. One could notice that her smooth milky white skin was showing some redness.\nOnce he realized that Mahiru had just left the bath, Amane tensed up more than before. Mahiru in turn showed him a beautiful smile.\n“Amane-kun, I feel you have lots of things to say to me, or ask…but may you listen to me before then?’\n“O-oh?”\nNow what?\nAmane wondered, and straightened himself. Mahiru lowered her head towards him.\n“I apologize for blocking your retreat, Amane-kun. I am really sorry that many were looking at you, when you hated it.”\n“Hm?”\n“Erm…I knew very well this would happen.”\nOnce he saw Mahiru lift her head awkwardly, Amane understood what she was guilty about.\nShe knew very well her influence, and till this point, ensured that everything she did would make her adored.\nThat Mahiru declared Amane to be the important person to her, in front of everyone, and surely that would cause confusion. Amane knew that she did it even though she knew this would happen.\n“Well, I know you did it even though you knew what would happen.”\n“Are you not angry, Amane-kun?”\n“Nope.”\n“I see. Thank goodness.”\nAmane in turn had resolved himself, for Mahiru did it despite the consequences. He knew how serious she was, and did not dislike it at all.\n“I know I was a little forceful. I wish to apologize if I made you unhappy, Amane-kun…but if I did not do so, you probably will not understand.”\n“Ugh…”\nAmane groaned when Mahiru had indirectly called him a coward.\nOf course, Amane realized his own cowardice, but his heart would rattled when the person who adored him said so openly.\nHe cautiously looked towards her eyes, and found a mischievous glint in them.\nIt appeared those eyes were hoping for something, as though yearning for Amane to take the step forward.\nAmane gulped, and slowly spoke.\n“Erm, say, Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“…Do you really like me, Mahiru?”\n“Yes, I do…I like you, Amane-kun. I view you as a male.”\nMahiru smiled and affirmed Amane’s cautious little question.\nHer answer was just as he expected, but he felt his heart pounding wildly. It felt as though his boiling blood was flowing throughout every corner of his body.\nHe had vaguely sensed her feelings, but he ignored it all this while.\nIt was to be expected then that he was overjoyed and excited to receive her feelings.\nHe froze, seemingly enduring the exhilaration that overwhelmed him. Mahiru too showed a wry smile at him, and one had to wonder what she was thinking.\n“Actually, I am not hoping for you to answer me immediately, Amane-kun.”\n“Eh?”\n“I simply wish to convey my determination. I like you, Amane-kun, and I wish to continue living with you…I am content with conveying these feelings.”\nIt appeared Mahiru had misunderstood, thinking that Amane was troubled, for she showed a gloomy, crestfallen smile.\n“I simply wish for you to like me more, Amane-kun, until your hesitation is all swept away.”\nMahiru’s expression showed much confidence, and nobody other than Amane might have seen such an expression. Once he saw that she was about to stand up, Amane reached his hand out, and pulled her towards him.\n―Now that she said this much, I have to give her a reply. I can’t embarrass myself by not giving her one.\nMahiru always respected Amane’s wishes, and said that she was fine taking it slow. Amane cast aside his hesitation, and embraced her.\nHer delicate body froze in his clutches, and perhaps she understood he was hugging her, for she immediately relaxed.\nShe was seated on his legs as he suddenly pulled her over, and leaned on his chest as she lifted her head towards him.\nThe caramel-colored eyes showed shock, confusion, and some hope.\n“Erm, it’s the first time I’ve fallen for someone. I thought I wouldn’t be like this…I thought I couldn’t do this at all.”\n“…Is it because something happened in the past?”\n“Ahh, yeah.”\nAmane embraced Mahiru firmly, not letting her go as he gently nodded.\nHe said he was hesitant about liking someone, for somewhere in his heart, he refused to recognize her feelings. That was because back in middle school, his friends betrayed him, and their words stuck in his heart like a wedge.\n“It might be really stupid…but I used to think of some people as friends, but they betrayed me, and mocked me for being of no value…I was the only one who treated them as friends, but they just used me. Even I found it stupid.”\nBack in his hometown, Amane’s parents were famous for being relatively well off.\nWhile his household was not as rich as Mahiru’s to hire a nanny, they were much richer than the other families. Amane himself never boasted of his wealth, but the items he had were of good quality.\nA few classmates gathered around Amane, probably out of jealousy, or wanted to use him, or both.\n“I think you should be able to understand somewhat, Mahiru…when your parents have money, the people around you will start to be greedy, and want to get some benefits.”\n“…Yes.”\nThey got along really well with Amane. It started at the start of middle school, but they really did, and were so close, they could be considered friends.\nThey were so close, Amane felt that he could get along with them even after he got to high school.\nBut when he saw them slander him, his heart broke.\n“I was stupid and immature to not see their real personality. I get the logic, but even so, I’m still scared of trusting others.”\nAmane was scared that if he trusted others, would he too be betrayed by others again?\n“I know not everyone was like them. Maybe some of them really wanted to be my friends. But…once the doubt kicks in, it’s not going to disappear that easily, right?”\n“…Yes.”\n“So I left my hometown, wanting to stay alone peacefully at a place where nobody knows of my parents.”\nOf course, Amane’s parents had enough of his depression, and gave him encouragement, and cheered him up. However, having considered how painful it would be for him to harbor such scars of his hometown, they sent him to Shuuto’s Alma Mater.\nThey were unable to leave their hometown because of work. Amane did not want them to worry, so he chose to stay alone, and met Mahiru at this place.\n“…Those who betrayed you were really foolish, Amane-kun. You are so kind and outstanding after all.”\nMahiru reached her hands towards Amane, showing a tragic smile, and Amane too smiled.\n“Back then, I thought I would never like anyone else…though I never expected that to change so quickly.”\nAmane stared at Mahiru again.\nHis heart felt warm, embarrassed, and doting. Mahiru was the first ever person to illicit such feelings, and might be the last.\nSuch were the feelings he had for her.\n“…Back at the start, I didn’t think you’re cute.”\n“I know. You told me to my face.”\n“Well, sorry about that…when we first met, you were dishonest, aloof, and not cute at all. I thought we just had a mutual benefit…but before I knew it, I started to be dissatisfied about this.”\nAt the start, Amane did not want to get too involved with her.\nWhen exactly did this change then?\n“I started to want to know more about you, wanted to touch you, and wanted to treasure your. I wanted to have you. It’s the first time I had such thoughts.”\n“…Yes.”\n“I was enduring this the entire time, thinking that I couldn’t do it…you said this was fine, so it’s not that I thought of giving up, but that I wondered what I could do to be a match for you? You took the first step however, Mahiru, before I could do anything.”\n“Fufu…I too have been enduring this. You are so handsome, and I worried if others would snatch you away. I was worried if you would like me.”\n“I guess you’re the only one who’ll like someone like me.”\n“Mmm. Again with such words…”\nMahiru looked displeased, as though deriding him for belittling himself again. Once she saw his expression however, she blinked several times.\nAt this point, Amane was not showing the good-for-nothing face Mahiru had criticized him for, but a serious, resolved look.\n“…So starting from now…I’ll work hard to ensure that nobody says you chose wrongly.”\n“Eh?”\n“I’ll work hard to be a good man, and not let anyone belittle your choice. It’s somewhat difficult…to not look inferior next to you, Mahiru, but I do want to stand with my head held high.”\nAmane wanted to be an outstanding man, someone who could stand proudly next to Mahiru, that nobody would blame Mahiru for.\nIt was not just for her sake, but for his too, for him to have some confidence.\nAnd the first step should start from these words.\n“I like you, Mahiru…will you go out with me?”\nHe muttered as he looked at those clear caramel-colored eyes, and they turned moist as though a membrane was laid over them. The tears did not fall however, merely showing his silhouette.\nShe closed her eyes, as though hiding them and smiled at him.\n“…Yes”\nHer answer was feeble, elated, and shivering. Amane would be the only one to hear her however. Once she agreed, she buried her face into his chest again.\nShe wrapped her arms around his back, holding him firm, and did not let go.\nI am not letting you get away again,\nshe seemed to imply, which left him a little embarrassed. He too wrapped his arms around her little back, and embraced her firmly.\n―I’m definitely not letting go.\nHe wanted to treat her dearly, to dote on her, to love her.\nIt was the first time he felt such feelings after his heart resonated with Mahiru’s.\n“I want to make you happy, Mahiru.”\n“You cannot guarantee it?’\nMahiru impishly asked as she slowly lifted her head. Amane smiled as he brought his lips to her ear.\n“This is my wish. I wish to personally make you happy, Mahiru. My resolve is…that I will definitely treasure you, and make you happy.”\n“…Yes.”\nOnce she heard the passionate oath, Mahiru nodded with a sweet smile that was melted by these feelings.",

      "content": "It was the day after they started dating, and Amane looked towards Mahiru, who sat next to him as usual.\nThey had the day off after the sports festival, and it was usual for her to drop by. She frequented his house before they were dating, so there was no special change. It was a natural situation before him.\nNaturally, Mahiru sat next to Amane, and read the textbook found in his house.\nYes, everything went as normal.\n…But seriously, what do we do after we start dating?\nAmane had no dating experience, and Mahiru was his frist lover.\nIt was the same for Mahiru, but given their similar experiences, it was natural for the male to desire to lead.\nEven if he wanted to lead however, he had no such knowledge.\nHe did not have much interest in other people because of what happened in the past. Amane was one with relatively few desires for a boy, and he never dreamed of actually dating a girl.\nTragically, all his passion was spent on studies and hobbies, and he lacked the crucial knowledge.\nIf he had played a few gal games, he might have some dating knowledge. He had no such interest however, and did not know anything.\nHe knew little. He only knew that dating couples would hold hands, go on dates, kiss each other on the lips, and once they got closer, would bond physically.\nAmane could not possibly bring himself to suddenly kiss her, let alone hold hands and go on dates.\nIn that case, the conclusion was,\nwhy don’t we go on dates?\nThis was not what it meant to be dating however.\nHe wanted Mahiru to be happy, and to be happy with her. The fatal lack of such knowledge left him in a little despair.\nIf it were Itsuki or Kadowaki, they could probably guide him along smoothly.\nAt this point, he was really envious of those two who were more gifted than him in many ways.\n“Is anything troubling you?”\nWhile Amane pinpointed his deficiencies in his mind, Mahiru went to speak to him, perhaps having noticed him.\n“Ah, erm, uh, yeah.”\n“If you do not mind, you may discuss it with me, you know?”\nMahiru did not understand what Amane was troubled about as she smiled and put the hand on her chest, giving a confident look to leave matters to her.\nAmane was embarrassed to ask her as it too was her first time dating. As his first date however, he thought it would be fine to talk with her. It might be better for both of them to discuss this through, than for him to brood alone.\n“…Say Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“You know, we’re…dating now, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“…What do we do exactly for dating?”\n“Eh?”\nAmane knew how stupid his question was, but he was serious.\n“E-erm, it is the first time I am dating someone…and I do not read shoujo manga or love novels or the like. I am not certain of how it should go.”\n“…Th-that makes sense.”\nOf course, Mahiru too had no relationship with the males, or rather, she spent days not having any interest in them. Once she heard his frustrations, she looked a little troubled.\n“Have you thought of anything?”\n“…Like holding hands?”\n“We’ve been holding hands.”\n“Spending our vacation together?”\n“That’s normal.”\n“Going out together?”\n“We did it.”\n“Hugging?”\n“Yes.”\nUnfortunately, Mahiru’s knowledge was about as much as Amane, and the examples she raised were what they did before.\nIt was no wonder that if anyone was to ask Amane what would lovers do, he could not think of it immediately.\nWhat do lovers do exactly…\nAmane wondered, and sighed. Mahiru timidly tugged at his sleeve.\nHe did not know what was going on as he looked towards Mahiru again, and found her blushing for some reason.\n“…Erm, it is hard for me to say so, embarrassingly so…bu-but have we been doing lover acts even when we were not dating…?”\nSilence beckoned upon Mahiru’s words.\n…Now that we mention it. No, wait, we’ve been doing this without saying it outright…!?\nBoth of them naturally lived together in the same space, held hands, and went dating, so they did not realize these were acts usually done by couples who were rather close to each other.\nNo, Amane might have known right from the beginning, but he paid no mind to them as he was too used.\n“I-I too have been working hard, to get you to look back at me…but, these really are things, lovers do, if I think about it.”\n“…N-now that you mention it…”\n“So, how about we act like normal, rather than have this unnatural understanding that we are lovers…well, we just need to touch each other every day, spend each day together. That is good for us. There is no need to beat around the bush. Let us just go at our own pace…is it okay, to continue dating like this…?”\nAt our own pace\n. These words resonated hard in Amane’s heart.\n…We don’t really have to restrict ourselves to this.\nAmane was anxious, wondering what were acts between lovers, but he really did not need to. Mahiru liked Amane, and Amane liked Mahiru, which was why they dated. This was the only fact they needed.\nThey did not have to force themselves, and just needed to spend time understanding each other. That was all.\n“I guess. Sorry, I just feel…I’m not taking it easy at all. I don’t know what to do for our first date.”\n“…Yes.”\n“…Erm, in other words…even though we’ll be the same as before…I’ll do so while expressing my feelings for you.”\nHe wrapped her hand, her palm. Her blushing face looked a little red.\nShe bashfully lowered her eyelids, and held his palm back, leaning onto his elbow.\n“Amane-kun.”\n“…Yes?’\n“…I am happy with just this.”\n“Yeah.”\nAmane muttered in agreement, and silently enjoyed the warmth next to him.",

      "content": "“Amane-kun, please wake up.”\nA gentle voice called for him.\nOnce he heard this whisper-like voice, “nn”, he groaned while still in his comfortable dreamland, and then lifted his heavy eyelids, opening his eyes slowly.\nHis vision was a little blurred, probably due to fatigue. The sunlight shining through the window showed the girl dear to him.\nShe had a knee on his bed as she leaned forward, probably have shaken Amane about. The flax-colored hair dropped like vines, swaying about.\n“…Mahiru?”\n“Nn, good morning.”\nAmane called out her name to confirm, heard a familiar voice, and saw her face.\nHis mind started to feel a little confused, not because he was sleeping, but that Mahiru was present. She was at his place, as though it was natural, and his confusion gradually subsided.\n“…Morning. Why are you here, Mahiru?”\n“Do you not remember what we talked about yesterday, Amane-kun?”\nMahiru frowned, and he repeated the word “Yesterday”. It took him a while to recall the conversation they had the previous day.\n“Can we go to school together on Monday?”\nMahiru said this before they went their separate ways on Sunday.\nShe fidgeted, and lifted her head towards him uneasily, which made him a little restless.\nMahiru asked so cautiously as she wanted to be sure if Amane wanted to hide their relationship.\nThey did discuss and decided to reveal their relationship openly, but she appeared a little uneasy.\nSince there was pretty much an open confession, Amane felt it was impossible for them to hide the relationship any further. He intended to just go along with it, and say that they were officially dating.\n“Hm, it’s fine.”\n“R-really?”\n“Why do I have to lie to you?”\nAmane promised, and the uneasiness vanished from Mahiru’s expression, turning into delight.\n“I always wanted to go to school together.” She muttered bashfully, which caused his heart to race, but it appeared she did not notice it, for she looked overjoyed.\n“I shall visit your house in the morning then, Amane-kun. We shall have breakfast together.”\n“Woah, fresh breakfast from you early in the morning, Mahiru? I’m really lucky.”\n“It is leftovers from our bentos…do you mind if I make your bento, Amane-kun?”\n“Please do.”\nHe was really blessed to have her breakfast, and now lunch too. Of course he could not refuse this offer.\nMahiru too looked relieved and overjoyed that she did not have to worry about others, which cheered Amane up. At the same time, he felt ticklish and gaudy.\nWe’re going to school together tomorrow, huh?\nTill this point, Amane left home at a different time from Mahiru, so that others would not notice their relationship.\nThere was no further need for that.\nAmane would surely be envied if they were to openly reveal their relationship at school, so he did feel uneasy. The most important thing however was that Mahiru really liked him, and he was delighted to be by her side.\nAs he stared at her delighted smile, “I need to work hard tomorrow too.” he muttered.\n“…Ah.”\nAmane groaned a little, for his mind might have gotten running after the sleep, and he recalled what happened the previous day.\nIt was not that he disliked it, but simply because, it was bad for his heart to see Mahiru’s face immediately after waking up. He should still consider whether he should allow her to wake him up.\nMahiru looked dumbfounded upon seeing him.\nShe was not really dumbfounded however, just comforted and helpless. Amane was really sorry and embarrassed by this, so he exerted strength near his lips.\n“How can you be so forgetful…here, change up and wash your face.”\n“Alright.”\nMahiru would probably use this time to prepare breakfast.\nAmane stifled a yawn, and got up from the bed, removed his shirt, “Kyahh!?” and heard a shriek next to him.\nHe looked towards Mahiru as he put his shirt onto the bed. He saw her eyes were closed, her body quivering, and her face instantly turned red.\n“I-I did say before, please do not remove your clothes when I am around.”\nMahiru was clearly flustered to see him strip in front of her. He could only show a wry smile.\n“Well I’m a guy. There’s nothing wrong with showing.”\n“I do have a problem…”\n“I’m not really doing this for you to see, and I’m not telling you to get used to it as soon as possible, but you can’t go swimming in the summer if this keeps up.”\nIf Mahiru has no immunity against seeing a guy’s body, how did she spend her summer during middle school…\nAmane wondered, but she really could not swim, so perhaps she found a reason to excuse herself.\nGiven her serious personality, it was hard to imagine her skipping classes. According to her, she chose a high school where swimming classes were not imperative, since she could not swim. Perhaps this too was a possibility.\nThey did make an ambiguous promise to go to the pool during the summer, and Amane would feel awkward if Mahiru was overly consciousness. After all, there were often half naked males near the pool, and he did not know if she could endure such a sight.\n“Ugh…I-I will try…”\nMahiru might have realized this as she muttered with a teeny-weeny voice, cautiously opened her eyes, and saw Amane.\nShe was blushing, looking to be on the verge of tears. Once she saw his upper body, she shivered, “Uu.” and groaned.\nTruth be told, Amane did not train his body to be particularly attractive.\nSince the start of their second year, he was doing some exercises and muscle training recommended by Kadowaki, so that he would not be a mere beansprout…but he did not have much muscle. At the very least, nobody would shun him.\n…If she’s not used to it, it’ll be a headache if something happened.\nIt might be a long time later until their relationship deepened, but if she was unused to that, Amane had a feeling many situations would not proceed as smoothly.\nBut Amane felt he too might freeze up upon seeing Mahiru’s body. Perhaps the same would apply for both sides.\n“…Ah, nn, erm…please go ahead and cook.”\nAmane’s face too turned red as he suddenly imagined something bad. Once he said that to her while she was blushing, “I shall proceed”, she scampered away like a rabbit.\nOnce she disappeared beyond the door, Amane knocked his head on the nearby wall, muttering to him “Oh what am I thinking early in the morning?”",

      "content": "Shown in the basin mirror was an unfamiliar looking self.\nAmane was wearing the usual school uniform, but the region above the neck was drastically different from before. He could not say that he had never seen it before however, for this was an image he would occasionally show Mahiru. He was rather uncomfortable about not wearing plainclothes.\nHe fiddled with his fingers, fiddling with the bangs that were no longer blocking his eyes.\nThe good thing was that boys did not need to put on makeup like the girls, but Amane really was unused to dolling himself up like this.\n“…Amane-kun.”\nA voice came from behind.\nThrough the mirror in the washroom, he saw Mahiru call for him after she was done preparing for school.\nHe turned to look at her, and found her looking a little gloomy.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“…Do you not dislike it?”\n“Dislike what?”\n“…That hairstyle?”\n“Oh, this?”\nMahiru seemed a little hesitant as she expressed her worry.\nHe showed this hairstyle to her, the one he refused to go to school with. Mahiru was worried that the others would associate that man with Amane.\nThis was something Amane himself wanted to do, so he did not dislike it.\nIt would be a lie to say that he had no hesitation, but he felt that since he made up his mind to stand next to Mahiru, he had to dress himself up and not bring her to shame.\nHe was not astoundingly handsome, but Itsuki and Kadowaki had vouched for his looks, so it should not be much of a problem. In any case, Amane hoped that nobody would say she had bad, unrefined taste in men.\n“I don’t really hate it. Do you, Mahiru?”\n“…Not really…just that I am feeling a little conflicted.”\n“Conflicted?”\n“…I may not have you for myself.”\nMahiru shriveled as she said such adorable words. As she was really cute, he chuckled, and patted her head while ensuring he did not ruin her hair.\n“So do you want to possess me for yourself?”\n“…I do.”\nTruth be told, Amane was only joking, but Mahiru nodded earnestly, and clung onto his chest.\nAmane never expected her to actually nod. He was the one to say it, but even he was a little intimidated. Despite that, he wrapped his arms around her back.\nMahiru was a head shorter than him, so she buried her face into his chest. She grabbed his shirt, and seemingly would not let go.\nShe lifted her head towards him, and looked so heartfelt.\n“…You are really dashing, Amane-kun, so you will have many girls talking to you. I am happy that you will be rated accordingly…”\n“You think I’ll fall for other girls?”\n“I do not think so, but this is an emotional issue.”\n“Are you jealous?”\nAmane inadvertently asked, and Mahiru immediately blushed. Despite that, “Yes” she answered earnestly, and rubbed her forehead onto his chest, rolling about.\nShe probably was feeling embarrassed. Her face was already red to the ears, as seen through the flax-colored hair.\n“How cute.”\n“…baka.”\n“Relax. I’m not interested in anyone other than you, Mahiru.”\nIt might not be sufficient reason to make her not jealous, but Amane had no intention of viewing other females as love interest. He already had a cute, possessive female he loved most, and there was no way he could look aside.\nTo state the extreme, Amane did not care about others, and would not be interested in them, unless they were really close to him. He was confident that he would not look at them.\nHe could not possibly be close with those females that would suddenly approach him after he got handsome.\n“…I know. I shall show that I love you, Amane-kun, and ensure nobody else has a chance.”\n“Just watch yourself. I don’t want others seeing you making such cute faces, Mahiru.”\n“…Why are you always saying such things out of a sudden, Amane-kun!”\nMahiru was furious for some reason, and he could only pat her head frantically to coax her. However, Mahiru slapped his back with her hands that were on his.\n“You cannot be saying such things so nonchalantly, Amane-kun.”\n“Can’t, as in…?”\n“It is bad for my heart.”\n“I should be the one saying that…sometimes I feel like I’m about to die when you suddenly fawn towards me.”\nIt should be said that Mahiru’s skinship was more destructive.\nAmane’s heart would throb and race whenever he unwittingly felt that soft body, or sniffed at the floating sweet fragrance, or the sweet, intoxicating smile that was shown without restraint.\nAgain at this point, Amane’s heart pounded wildly as Mahiru was too adorable. She buried her face into his chest, and probably realized it too.\n“…This sudden attacks are highly potent.”\nMahiru grumbled softly, and leaned her cheeks onto his chest.\n“…But since your heart is pounding so much, I shall forgive you today, Amane-kun.”\nIt appeared Mahiru was delighted that Amane’s heart was pounding wildly as she muttered and rubbed her face onto his chest.\nThat gesture was similarly adorable,\ncalm down calm down,\nso Amane nearly groaned as he muttered so, patting Mahiru on the head to quell the impulse gradually forming in his heart.\nFive minutes later, Mahiru was done recharging.\nShe was blushing slightly, and her eyes were a little moist. Amane’s heart would be in jeopardy if he stared directly at her. He managed to purge his anxiety however, for she appeared to be contented.\n“Let us go then.”\nThere was more than sufficient time, and no matter the amount of skinship they enjoyed, there was no way they would be late.\nNevertheless, Amane felt it was time for them to go, so he gave her a holler. “Yes” she smiled back.\nI’m already worn out since morning.\nHe did not dislike it, on the contrary, he was elated. It was for this reason that he would endure, and felt fatigued. He could retaliate if it was a rest day, and let her fawn around until she melted away. They could not do so however as they had to go to school.\nIt appeared Mahiru did not notice his fatigue, for she was completely energized.\nEarly in the morning, and Amane was troubled and strangely fatigued in various ways, but it was not vexing to him. He showed a wry smile, took whatever he needed, and left along with Mahiru.\nIt was the first time he left home with her while wearing the school uniform, and he was strangely emotional about this. he locked the door, lowered his head towards Mahiru, and found her looking a little uneasy.\nHer hand was timidly tugging at his hem.\n“…Shall we hold hands?”\n“Yes.”\nIt appeared Amane got it right. “Damn, she’s cute.” he muttered towards an apprehensive looking Mahiru, and interlocked his fingers with her slender fingers.",

      "content": "“Feels like people are looking at us.”\nAs the distance to school decreased, many stares were directed towards Amane, and he grumbled tiredly.\nThere were various stares ranging from those wondering who was the man holding Mahiru’s hand, to envy, curiosity, and also, some admiration\nIt was to be expected, but he found such stares to be more unbearable than he imagined.\nLuckily, not all the stares were negative. He was still unused to them however.\nHe had always preferred to live a quiet, unimpressive life, so he felt restless about these stares.\n“It is to be expected. You look like a new person after all, Amane-kun.”\nBoth of them held hands as they went forth, clearly intent to show that they were lovers. Obviously, there were other boys looking at them.\nHowever, the Amane at the sports festival seemed very different from the Amane walking alongside Mahiru at this point. Nobody said it, but their eyes were clearly looking curious.\n“Is there really such a big difference?”\n“Hm. How do I express this? Your hairstyle did change, and so has your appearance. More importantly, your back has straightened, and you look confident. The impression you give is really different.”\n“Sorry for being so unmotivated all the time.”\n“Please do not berate yourself…you have changed, Amane-kun. I do like both sides of you, but I hate it when you berate myself.”\n“I don’t want to be hated. I’ll take note of this.”\n“That is good.”\nMahiru smiled as she leaned her body onto him, and more stares gathered upon them.\nAmane’s face nearly cringed in the face of these venomous glares. Once Mahiru showed the absolutely Angelic smile towards their surroundings, the murderous glares vanished completely.\nIn a certain sense, the Angel was truly the strongest person, for she was capable of silencing those around them.\nAmane felt unsettled even though the stares had somewhat changed, and held her hand as he looked forward. They were about about to arrive at school, where he would be basked under more stares. His gut started to ache.\n“With all the stares like this now, how am I supposed to enter the classroom later?”\n“Please give up on that notion…or do you dislike this?”\n“Not at all. I decided that I’m going to change.”\nEver since Mahiru confessed to him, Amane understood that he could no longer live like before.\nHe decided that he could not embarrass himself, even though he was by her side. He told himself that he should be mentally prepared to tough it out, rather than not work hard, and make sure he could be a match for Mahiru.\n“…is that so?” Mahiru answered once she heard his words, and exerted more strength into her fingers.\n“Huh, Mahirun?”\nAmane noticed that Mahiru’s ears were blushing next to him, and he wanted to talk to her, only to hear a voice behind him.\nHe turned around once he heard the familiar voice and affectionate nickname, and saw Chitose standing there with her eyes widened.\nShe looked stunned at Mahiru, and then at Amane.\nOnce she saw their hands held together, “Ohhh~” she leered away, skipped towards them, and slapped Amane on the back.\n“Morning~ So you made it this far, bor?”\n“Shut up.”\n“Good morning too Mahirun~ Looks like things went well.”\nChitose appeared to be in a really good mood as she kept slapping his back hard with a grin.\nHe had experienced curious and jealous looks the entire day, and Chitose’s look of pure curiosity made his heart hot.\n“Congrats Mahirun. My efforts watching over your has paid off.”\n“Yes. I did talk to you regarding various things.”\n“Yes yes, like how do we deal with Amane’s blockheadedness?”\n“…Mahiru?”\n“B-because, you are truly a blockhead, Amane-kun.”\nGiven that she said so, Amane really could not refute.\nMahiru had always emphasized this, but Amane never responded well to it, and the responsibility was on him. It was no wonder then that Mahiru would discuss this with Chitose.\n“Well, it’s Amane.” Chitose, who once discussed this with Mahiru, gave such an appraisal he was displeased with, and looked up at him.\nIt was likely that she was giving a proper, inquisitive look at him as it was the first time she saw him dress nicely.\n“But well~ it’s the first time I see you take look this manly, Amane.”\n“What do you mean by that.”\n“That’s what Ikkun and Yuu-chan say. Hm hm, not as good as Ikkun, but you look fine for a guy.”\nChitose giggled again as she slapped Amane on her back. She probably was expressing her approval in this manner.\nYou’re still the same as before.\nThis might be an encouragement from her, and his lips relaxed a little.\n“I guess Itsuki’s the best for you huh?”\n“Of course. You’re the best for Mahirun though. There’s nothing to grumble about.”\n“Well you’re right. I’m fine with being the best for Mahiru.”\nAmane was not aiming to be Chitose’s number 1. He was content with Mahiru calling him her number 1.\nHe glanced aside at her, and found her holding his head, leaning her face on his elbow, muttering, “…Amane-kun is number 1.”\nHer face was blushing slightly, and perhaps it was because she was strangely embarrassed by Chitose’s declaration before her.\n“What a good girl~ You’re so cute. I’d have given you hugs if Amane isn’t around.”\n“Alright alright alright, don’t do this when we’re on our way to school. Do whatever you want after school.”\n“Woah, great, your boyfriend agrees, Mahirun. Come here and give me a hug~!”\n“Eh, p-please be gentle…?”\nMahiru was troubled as she nodded, given that she was suddenly asked to be hugged. Chitose beamed away as she went next to Mahiru, probably eager to celebrate for Mahiru’s sake.\nOnce he saw how intimate the two of them were, Amane looked away from Mahiru, and towards the surroundings.\nThere were more people around them, probably because they were arriving at school.\n…I guess the questions will keep coming once I enter the classroom.\nHe visualized his future that would arrive in a matter of minutes as he saw the many people before him, and showed a wry smile away from the two girls.",

      "content": "Once he got to the school compound, there were many more of them.\nWhile Chitose was next to them, Amane and Mahiru obviously garnered much attention when they held hands walking into the classroom. “Woah, so many are looking.” Chitose noted nonchalantly, but Amane was still unused to the stares around them.\nMahiru herself might have been used to it, for she was walking very calmly. She held Amane’s hand firmly, probably intending to declare their relationship openly.\n“The Angel and a boy…” “Shiina-san’s different from usual…” “That guy? He’s completely different from the one at the sports festival…” there were such voices on the corridor. Unfortunately, Amane was that ‘important person’ Mahiru mentioned at the sports festival.\nMahiru did not answer those voices, and instead showed the Angelic, sweet smile, dispersing it towards those around them.\n“Amane-kun.”\n“Hm?”\n“We are reaching the classroom. Are you fine with that?”\nMahiru asked right when they were about to reach the classroom.\n“I’m fine. I was mentally prepared the moment I decided to show up like this.”\n“…I see.”\n“I guess everyone will be shocked though. Mahirun said you had a complete image change over the weekend, Amane.”\nEven I was shocked,\nChitose chuckled, and Amane started to regret it. Perhaps he should have told her, Itsuki and Kadowaki.\nHe dithered on this matter as he was embarrassed about revealing that they were overly dating, and did not mention it. He should have told those who cared for him though.\n“…Chitose?’\n“Hm?”\n“Erm, sorry for not telling you.”\n“No biggies. It started right after the sports festival ended, right? I guess you two were busy flirting with each other, and you don’t like to announce it through messages since you prefer to say it out. I don’t mind.”\nBusy flirting.\nAmane felt conflicted to recognize this, but in fact, they practically spent the entire yesterday clinging onto each other, and thought of nothing else.\nAnd as Chitose said, since Amane had been in their care, he would have desired to tell them personally. Chitose found out before then however, and came to tease Amane, who confirmed this matter instead of revealing it.\n“…Thank you.”\n“Don’t mind. I worked hard to tie the red string of fate between you two, so worship me more~”\n“Got it. I’ll treat you to the crepes at the station, Chitose-sama.”\n“Alrighty then~”\nChitose joked, and Amane went along with it. While chatting, he entered the classroom alongside Mahiru.\n“Ah, good morning Shiina-s…eh?”\nThe first to notice them were the first girls gathered near the classroom entrance.\nThey were seated on the table, chatting furiously when they noticed Mahiru enter the classroom, and lifted their heads…before noticing Amane holding Mahiru’s hand.\nTheir eyes then moved from the hands towards his face.\nThe expressions on their faces clearly were imply,\nwho is this guy?\nIt was to be expected, for Amane never showed such an appearance before his classrooms.\nA few might have seen like like that, but he never attended school with such an appearance as Amane Fujimiya. He might seem like a complete stranger to them.\nHowever, Mahiru openly revealed that Amane was the important person to her during the sports festival the previous week, and the memory remained fresh in the students’ memories.\nThey could easily equate the boy holding hands with Amane if they put in a little .\nBefore they came to that conclusion, Amane let go of her hand, and went to his seat to put his stuff down.\nIt was to clearly indicate who he was.\nAnd before he knew it, the classroom was quieter than usual.\nThe usually chatty classmates too were looking at Amane.\n“Morning Fujimiya.”\nAmidst this awkward silence, Kadowaki and Itsuki approached Amane with the usual smile.\nHe was glad that they recognized him, and treated him as usual.\n“Morning, you two.”\n“Say, have you finally seen the light?”\n“Seen the light…well, I’d say she caught me, and I caught her back.”\nAmane had discussed this matter with them many times, and Itsuki was the first to notice that Amane was interested in Mahiru. They immediately realized that Amane and Mahiru were dating, for Amane entered the classroom while holding hands in that style.\n“Yeah congrats. I’m only on better terms with you recently, Fujiimiya. It’s not like we know each other for a long time, but I was really anxious for you two. I feel like I’ve finally waited for this moment to come.”\n“I waited for half a year, you coward.”\n“Shut up. It’s my fault, okay?”\nIn fact, Itsuki was probably feeling emotional watching Amane and Mahiru get closer to each other. “It’s been a long time.” he nodded away as he muttered.\nFor good or bad, Itsuki did give Amane much help, and gave him a push, or rather, a kick in his back. Amane was grateful for Itsuki’s efforts; though the latter was sometimes too much of a busybody, he had been cheering on the dithering Amane.\nOf all the people Amane knew, Itsuki was probably the one giving the most blessings to this relationship.\n“So you decided to dress up like this.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Ah, but I really am not used to this. It’s a strange feeling.”\n“Yeah. Never saw that ever since that incident.”\nKadowaki last saw Amane like this during Golden Week, which was about a month ago. It was natural for him to still be unused to Amane’s image when he only saw that once. Mahiru was the only one used to seeing Amane like this.\nAnd that Mahiru in turn had Chitose cling onto her and pat her head, while they were surrounded by other classmates.\nThe classroom was really quiet, and even though Amane was a little far away from them, he could hear what they were asking Mahiru. Well, he would have known what they were asking even if he could not hear.\n“Erm, Fujimiya-kun!”\nMan, she sure has it tough,\nAmane thought as he looked over, only for him to be talked to.\nAmane then turned to the voice, and found a few girls clearly giving him excited looks, huddling around him.\nAmane really was somewhat inept at dealing with girls, and this situation was bad for his gut. He knew this would happen however, so he looked towards them unflinchingly.\n“…What is it?”\n“Wow, it’s really you, Fujimiya-kun! It shocks me how you’re different from the one I know!”\n“That’s a huge change in impression.”\n“Yes yes! You look really plain the last time.”\n“It’s a little rude to call him plain, you know?”\n“Ah, sorry Fujimiya-kun.”\n“It’s fine. You’re not wrong to say that.”\nAmane was nearly devoured by the vigor shown by the girls, but he did his best not to get caught in their pace, and showed a wry smile.\nThey were completely right, so he did not want to refute them, and was not angry.\nHe was the one who remained plain looking, and he did not want to stand out in personality, so he maintained an impression of a a harmless, honest guy in class.\nIt appeared everyone in class had dismissed Amane as an ordinary boy.\nIt was no wonder then that they were troubled by this sudden change.\n“That’s quite a huge change in impression.”\n“Yeah. Is this weird?”\n“No no no, I think you look a lot better.”\n“It’s more like, we’re shocked to see you become so handsome.”\n“I guess my efforts aren’t wasted if you say that.”\nAmane felt embarrassed to be praised directly, but it was pointless for him to deny it. He did learn that it was bad to be overly humble sometimes, so he graciously accepted this praise.\nHe tried his best to give a gentle expression as much as possible as he nodded, and they smiled back happily.\n“Say, can I ask something?”\n“Please do, if it’s something I can answer.”\n“I’m wondering, was it you who walked alongside Shiina-san back then, Fujimiya-kun?”\nI guess the question’s finally here,\nAmane wondered.\nIt was a matter of time until someone asked, so he decided to answer and address his views on this matter.\nTheir classmates were probably pricking their ears at this conversation. If he declared it, it was likely that news would spread throughout the entire school.\n“Yes, it’s me.”\n“A-are you two dating? I saw you two holding hands while coming to school…”\n“Yeah. Thanks to everyone, we started dating last week.”\nOnce Amane confirmed this, there were agitated shrieks in the class. He could hear some voices of despair and grumbles by the boys, but he decided to ignore them.\nAfter all, the boys would be asking him further questions; he would handle them when they come.\n“Erm, how did you and that Shiina-san…”\n“It started last year, and our relationship just naturally improved. Isn’t that right, Mahiru?”\n“Yes.”\nIt appeared Mahiru was done answering her questions, but it was more likely that she felt a conversation with Amane would make things much easier, as she approached him with a beaming face.\nOnce she stood next him, she showed a beautiful smile at the girls questioning Amane, while being so close to him, they were about to touch.\n“It is a little difficult to explain, but after many things have happened, we started dating. I had a crush on him, so I am really happy now…it feels like we were boasting when we came here while holding hands.”\nMahiru put her hand on Amane’s, just as they did while going to school. Amane gave a wry smile as he in turn held her hand.\n“No, I think I fell for you first.”\n“It was me, no? Either way, you would not confess, Amane-kun.”\n“Sorry about that. I confessed properly, forgive me.”\n“…I think I confessed first.”\n“I’ll do so properly next time.”\n“What are you planning to do?”\n“…Who knows?”\nThere was only one objective a couple would have, and Mahiru would understand if she put some thought into it…but she merely felt skeptical.\nAmane felt that he should not say it at this point, and that he was not of the appropriate age to take responsibility, so he decided to keep it to himself. It seemed these words would never fade even after many years,\nHe hoped to keep these words to himself until then, when he intended to personally say it to her.\nMahiru lifted her head unhappily towards him as he pulled a fast one on her, but once he patted her head, her dissatisfaction was quelled.\n“…You are fooling me again.”\n“I will say it later. Let me off for now, please.”\n“Goodness.”\nShe verbally expressed her unhappiness, but her face looked elated.\nShe hurriedly covered her increasingly blushing face however, having noticed something.\nAmane did not know what was going on as he looked around, and found his classmates remaining silent.\nTheir stares were gathered upon the two of them.\nI messed up.\nAmane did intend to show how good their relationship was, and to lay down the fact that he was Mahiru’s boyfriend. He however did not intend to converse with her as he usually did at home.\nAnd once he carelessly patted her head, it was obvious what their classmates would think.\n“…Amane, you two are just unwittingly flirting. Take note of that.”\nEven Itsuki, dubbed part of the original bakauple, reminded Amane. The latter hastily removed his hand from Mahiru, bit his lips, and tried to prevent showing the heat rising up his cheeks.",

      "content": "The news of Amane and Mahiru officially dating immediately spread throughout the entire school.\nIt appeared everyone knew it was a fact and not a rumor, thanks to the classmates who liked to gossip for both good and bad reasons, and also because everyone had seen them attend school together.\nThanks to that, there was always discreet discussions whenever they had to swap classrooms or go to the corridor. Thus, Amane was really uncomfortable with it.\n“The commotion will subside in a few days, I guess.”\nKuju commented as he stood some distance away from the ruckus. “Yeah.” Hiiragi too nodded.\n“People aren’t going to keep talking about the same thing. Sooner or later, they’ll be discussing something else.”\n“That’ll be great. I’ll have a headache if it keeps up every day.”\nEven during lesson time, Amane could hear others muttering something. Truth be told, he did not feel so good.\nOn a side note, the boys in the class kept questioning him during the breaks, and his stamina had dropped by half. Luckily, there was no gym class.\n“I think there’ll be fewer people asking you questions. People will be surrounding you for a different reason though.”\n“Different reason?”\n“Some might think you’re a good commodity to have.”\n“Sorry that I’m sold out then.”\nAmane had assigned his future to Mahiru, and he could not possibly look at anyone else even if he was ask to. Truth be told, even if there were other females better than Mahiru, there was no way Amane would choose anyone but Mahiru.\nAmane would be troubled if anyone hoped that he would look elsewhere. He would be surprised and disappointed if anyone was to think of him as such a frivolous boy.\n“Well, love is sometimes unreasonable.”\n“Mm, that’s rare coming from you, Makoto.”\n“How rude. But well, it’s impossible for anyone to stop liking someone , even if she’s already someone else’s girlfriend. Love is like an impulse after all.”\nOf course, you can’t just turn impulse into action,\nKuju quipped, and looked towards the chatting girls, sighing,\n“For me, I don’t think anyone can butt in between you two.”\n“Same here. The lovey-dovey show is also a mean to ward off everyone else. I never thought you two would actually do that in front of everyone…!”\n“Forget about that…!”\nAmane was overwhelmed with embarrassment as he recalled the conversation he had in the morning.\nThe intimate act was truly to fend others off, but patting her on the head was basically a confession, and he did sound like he was intending to propose to her. He did not intend for his classmates to know.\nLuckily, Mahiru managed to misdirect them. Itsuki and Kuju however might have noticed something when they said dumbfoundedly, “That’s passionate.”\n“Well, since everyone now knows that Shiina-san shows that look only to you, I think that’s a fair result, Fujimiya?”\n“…You say that, but shameful things are shameful.”\n“You’re saying that when you held hands while walking to school?”\n“That’s different.”\nThere was a difference in shame between acts that were done intentionally, and acts that were done unwittingly.\n“Just give up. Also, there are some grateful that you two are so lovey-dovey?”\n“Grateful?”\n“The girls are happy now that the guys looking at Shiina-san can look elsewhere.”\nAmane did consider the little mutters.\nIt appeared the girls who valued Mahiru differently were not being completely united, and some of them were conflicted by how Mahiru had attracted looks from other boys.\nMahiru had been alone till this point, a flower who never showed affection to anyone else. Now that she had specified Amane as a target and showed no interest in any other boy, it would mitigate some of the displeasure they had.\n“Not all of them like me. Some do probably badmouth me behind my back.” Mahiru had once noted wryly, and Amane felt that girls were terrifying. Now that this was done however, it seemed Mahiru could finally relax.\n“Girls really have it tough, I guess. Well, since this is settled, the next thing is to let everyone know that Mahiru’s just an ordinary girl. It feels like she doesn’t like everyone calling her the Angel because it’s embarrassing.”\n“I guess she really hates it huh.”\n“Yeah. Yuuta’s always giving a strange look whenever anyone calls him Prince, so that’s expected.”\nAccording to Hiiragi, Kadowaki too was ashamed to be called Prince. Perhaps both Kadowaki and Mahiru had the same troubles. Amane quietly prayed for them in his heart.\nHe earnestly wished that Kadowaki would one day find someone who could understand him, just like how he came to know Mahiru. He hoped that this kind, unpretentious person who treated everyone equally could get his happiness.\n“…What are you chatting about?”\nWhile Amane prayed for Kadowaki’s happiness, Mahiru approached them, seemingly done chatting with chitose.\nShe probably did not heart what they were talking about, but it seemed she noticed that Amane had been blushing because they pointed out his actions in the morning. She gave a somewhat mystified look towards the trio.\n“Ah Shiina-san? Nothing much. We’re just talking about how you’re an ordinary girl.”\n“How did you end up talking about this…?’\n“Ahh, no, erm…it’s just that we’re talking about how you’re not the Angel but just an ordinary girl, Mahiru.”\nAmane pretended to forget what happened in the morning, and briefly mentioned what they discussed. “I see.” She nodded understandingly.\n“I know that I have become an idol in some way. That may be true.”\nMahiru hushed her voice. Kuju and Hiiragi gave a look that practically screamed,\nah yes.\nSince they spent much time with Kadowaki, they had seen many similar instances, and so they probably were concerned about Mahiru, who was the same kind of person as him.\n“But I am no longer concerned about what they say.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes…after all, I am fine if Amane-kun alone thinks I am an ordinary girl.”\nAmane, Kuju and Hiiragi were the only ones to hear this murmur, but it was overly destructive.\nMahiru smiled bashfully, and her cheeks reddened slightly. Amane was not the only one mesmerized by her.\nHe heard Kuju and Hiiragi next to him gasp. The passing students too stared at her face, completely dumbstruck.\n“…Fujimiya, control your girlfriend.”\nWe have a lot of victims around\nus, Amane quietly agreed with that notion, but he too was helpless, for he was the biggest victim, and it took him lots of effort to suppress his pounding heart.\n“…Man, she’s completely lovestruck.”\nKuju muttered in amazement, and Mahiru’s face remained red as her smile brightened in seemingly affirmation.",

      "content": "“Amane-kun, what about lunch?”\nOnce morning lessons ended, Mahiru went to Amane’s seat with two bentos in her bag.\nAmane wanted to eat with the usual gang, but he was hesitant, worried that he would cause them much trouble.\nOn a side note, while he had ate together with Kuju and Hiiragi, whom he was on speaking terms with recently, they refused to join him for lunch, for despite being single, they did not want to get caught in the crossfire. Tragically, Amane could not deny this, since he did mess up during the break.\n“Hm. We’ll eat together if Itsuki and the others are fine.”\n“You think we won’t join you?”\nItsuki, Chitose and Kadowaki approached Amane and Mahiru with wallets in hand, giving wry smiles.\n“Don’t make us look like we’re strangers. Just be normal.”\n“Itsuki…”\n“To be honest, I think it’s better for us to be around. Otherwise, you two will be too deadly without any brakes on.”\n“…I feel very conflicted.”\nAmane could understand Itsuki’s explanation, given how careless he and Mahiru were on this day, but the reversal of roles really had him feeling conflicted.\nOf course, Amane would not do what he did in the morning, but there was really a possibility that he or Mahiru could mess up. Itsuki’s worry was warranted.\n“Anyway, we’ll be the same as before.”\n“I hope Mahirun will continue to attack and escalate things though~”\n“People looking at them will be bothered. Look, you two are being so lovey-dovey…think about it.”\n“You too Kadowaki…?”\n“My face’s getting hot just looking at you two. Well, it’s for the best that you two are happy though.”\nAmane could not say anything as the smile was completely magnanimous. “Well, just make sure to watch yourselves, otherwise other people are going to be hurt.” Kadowaki quipped.\nIt was obvious, given Kuju and Hiiragi’s reactions, so Amane nodded seriously.\n“…We’re going to the cafeteria, right? I don’t have a bento. Got to buy from there.”\n“Alright.”\n“Let’s go then~ what’s for today’s set meal special?”\n“I remember it’s fried chicken.”\n“Oh great. The fried chicken skin’s there’s coated thinly. it’s nice.”\nItsuki grinned away as he waved his wallet and left. Feeling grateful for him, Amane followed.\n“…Amane-kun, this is your bento.”\nThey occupied a table for five at the cafeteria, and once the others returned with their food, Mahiru took out a bento from her bag, and handed it to him.\nAfter that, Mahiru took out her own bento box. Amane’s share was a tad bigger than hers, and while he was not a big eater, a high school boy’s appetite would be much more than a girl’s, and Amane’s could satiate his appetite.\n“Oh, thanks.”\n“Mahirun’s bento is great~”\n“Not giving you anything.”\n“Miser~”\nChitose puffed her cheeks cutely, “Shall I exchange some with you?” once Mahiru suggested, the balloon on the face quickly subsided.\nWhile Chitose was being immature, she showed a carefree smile, and her actions befitted her expression. Itsuki was relieved to see that.\nAmane watched the two girls talk as he opened the bento lid.\nIt contained yesterday’s leftovers of simmered tomato chicken, spinach, buttered corn with soy sauce, boiled broccoli, mini tomatoes, wieners with octopus faces drawn, on, and the fried egg roll Amane liked.\nThere were more main dishes, probably because Amane’s appetite was taken under consideration.\nAmane could eat anything, and while he liked vegetables, the presence of meat increased his appetite. Coupled with the egg roll he liked, he could feel himself gaining some vigor.\n“Are you fine with more egg roll there, Amane-kun?”\n“I think I can work hard over the entire afternoon with this.”\n“That is an exaggeration.”\nNo I’m serious.”\nAmane really liked egg dishes, and this egg roll would energize him. The amount really was as he desired.\nItadakimasu,\nhe quickly prayed, giving his thanks for the food and Mahiru, and immediately reached his chopsticks for the egg roll.\nHe put it in his mouth, and found it damp. He took a bite, and the stock oozed out, its flavor blending with a slight sweetness that had him smiling.\nThe egg roll was so delicious, he found it a pity to swallow it immediately. He chewed on it slowly, savoring it.\nHe should chew slowly, but a bigger reason was that he wanted to savor it more.\nStill the same as usual,\nAmane continued to eat the bento, clearly showing the joy on his face. Kadowaki marveled as he looked at Amane.\n“…You really are enjoying the food, Fujimiya.”\n“It’s really good.”\n“I know that. But Shiina-san’s definitely proud of herself when you’re eating it so deliciously.”\nKadowaki called off to Mahiru, who smiled as she watched Amane. “Yes, I am very grateful. Amane-kun always says that my cooking is delicious.” She blushed and smiled.\n“The effort really has paid off.”\n“Well, I’ve been eating your cooking, and it’s really delicious.”\n“I have grasped your preferences, and shall continue to work hard.”\n“Just maintain it at this level.”\n“But I still wish to ensure that I meet your preferences completely.”\n“I’m fine with however you like it, Mahiru. Your cooking’s always delicious.”\nAmane showed no intention to leave Mahiru, and while he wanted her to match his preferences, he wanted to know more of hers.\nHe did not want her to match his preferences completely, but that the two of them would come to a common ground. Amane had thought about matching her preferences.\nAmane nodded away happily as he ate the octopus wiener with the cute doodled face made out of sesame seeds. Mahiru’s shoulders shriveled as she showed a gaudy smile.\nAmane could not help but look around once he saw her face blushing inside her, and spotted Itsuki’s dumbfounded look.\n“…Man, what can we do when we can’t stop you two from flirting.”\n“…We aren’t flirting.”\n“So he says, Chii.”\n“Eh~ you’re saying that it’s not flirting, just the beginning?”\n“Say, you two?”\n“I don’t think this is really flirting when it’s a little more controlled than your antics in the classroom, but there’s no way for anyone else to interrupt you two.”\nUpon hearing that, Amane looked away from their table, to the surrounding seats, and found their peers and the upperclassmen boys looking at them.\nWhile there was some murderous intent in their stares, they hastily looked away when Mahiru gave them a look. They really were easy to understand.\nAmane did not know whether he should be ashamed that the surrounding students could hear them, or delighted that they were able to fend the others off.\nHe showed a crooked smile, and “I thought you did it on purpose…” Kadowaki muttered.\n“…Seriously, you two are on great terms, but be careful not to enter your own world that easily, okay?”\nWell, it worked out this time,\nhe continued with some bewilderment, and Amane pursed his lips.",

      "content": "It was a long day especially for Amane, probably because he was basking under the stares.\nWhile he did deliberately do that intimate act before his classmates, he was mentally worn out from the many eyes on him. Some of them were looking unfriendly, which made him all the more weary.\nNot all of them were negative however. Some were simply curious, and some were cheering them on.\nMost of the latter kind of stares were from the girls, and it showed how popular Mahiru was, in various senses.\n“Let’s go home, Mahiru.”\nHe did not need to suffer various stares for the day, at least.\nOnce the lessons ended for the day, Amane said so to Mahiru, who was preparing to go home.\nNeither Amane nor Mahiru joined any clubs. It would be troublesome if Mahiru actually joined one, and caused much imbalance in club membership. Thus, she did not.\nIt was a choice she made while knowing her own popularity, but that fact made Amane sad.\nShe did not mind however, “I met you because I did not join any club, Amane-kun…” and instead said such an adorable line, which made him embarrassed.\n“Yes, let us go home.”\nMahiru finished packing her items, and showed a gentle smile, which in turn softened Amane’s expression\nHe was delighted that they were finally able to go home together, since they used to go home separately back then.\n“I’ll be going back then.”\nAmane took Mahiru’s bag from the table as he called out to Itsuki next to him. Kadowaki was gone from the classroom as he had to attend club activities.\n“Yeah. I can’t bring myself to disturb the newlyweds, so you two can go home and go wild.”\n“Who are the newlyweds, you idiot?”\n“Wait, you two are an old couple.”\n“I don’t mean that.”\nWhat are you saying?\nAmane glared, but Itsuki did not seem to mind.\nInstead, he looked rather delighted, showing that usual frivolous look even in the face of Amane’s harsh stare.\n“Well, you clearly are. Don’t you think so too, Chii?”\n“Yeap~”\n“You two are annoying. So you’re saying we’re a bakauple?”\n“Yo, second gen bakauple, I get to call you this since I’m the first gen.”\n“You bastard.”\n“E-erm please calm down Amane-kun.”\nAmane was about to flick Itsuki in the forehead, but held back as Mahiru came to stop him.\n“Akazawa-san, please do not tease Amane-kun too much.”\n“Mahiru…”\n“Amane-kun is rather dishonest, and will pout if you tease him too much. Please exercise some restraint.”\n“Et tu Mahiru?”\n“I am joking.”\nAmane felt conflicted that even Mahiru joined in on the teasing. However, he could not stop her as she was giving her natural smile at school.\nIn the past, she gave the textbook, beautiful smile that was hailed by everyone, and hid her true smile beneath. At this point, her smile and attitude was unhindered, and it was no wonder that he could not reproach her.\nDespite that, Amane was a little peeved that he could not pull a little payback, so he intended to keep teasing Mahiru once they got home.\n“Come on, Amane-kun, shall we head back?”\nMahiru prompted somewhat hastily, as though she realized something. “Yeah sure.” Amane chuckled, and held her hand.\n“I think it is great that we can openly reveal our relationship. It allows us to go shopping together.”\nMahiru noted quietly as she picked the ingredients for tonight’s dinner at the supermarket.\nA supermarket was not usually a place student couples would visit, but neither Amane nor Mahiru had any plans to date, and since they had to prepare dinner, they came here.\n“Well, we couldn’t come here together the last time.”\n“Yes. Now we can openly shop for items, and so on.”\n“Yeah. If needed, we can just discuss what we’re going to eat.”\nAmane would usually discuss with Mahiru beforehand what they would eat, but henceforth, they could discuss this immediately if he had a sudden desire to eat something.\nThey originally intended to have Japanese food, but once Amane saw the daily set meal at the cafeteria, he had a craving for fried chicken, so Mahiru went to fulfill his wish.\nMahiru chose the chicken thighs, and put them into the basket Amane was holding. “I think it is better to have some fish tomorrow after some meat.” It appeared she was thinking about the next day’s dinner.\n“What shall we have for tomorrow?”\n“Anything…but you’ll be troubled if I say this, right? Well, I want some horse mackerel.”\n“I believe it is the perfect season for it, yes. Some Nanbanzuke horse mackerel. Not too sour, I suppose?”\n“Yeah.”\nYou know me well,\nAmane chuckled, “I have cooked for you for half a year after all.” Mahiru retorted.\nIt was true that since they ate together for half a year, she naturally knew of his likes. Speaking of which, it had been half a year since the two of them got involved, but lots of various events happened, and Amane was amazed by that.\n“…We’re dating after half a year. That’s amazing.”\n“It does feel like a long time to me? You really are a blockhead, Amane-kun, to notice and pretend not to.”\n“Ugh…I’m sorry.”\n“Fufu. I am not intending to bully you…I am fine with knowing that you like me.”\nMahiru giggled impishly, which left Amane uncomfortable. Truth be told, the problem was that Amane was indecisive, and had to bear the brunt of his mistake fully.\n“Erm, I’ll express my love properly after this.”\n“Yes, so will I.”\n“…It’ll be tough for me if you continue to be like this, Mahiru.”\n“Tough?”\n“…Don’t turn me into a wolf.”\nAmane’s sanity might go on strike if Mahiru continued to fawn over him, so he hoped she would contain herself.\nIt appeared she understood the intent of these words, and her face turned red, sounding like a steam engine. “I-I shall take note of that…” she whispered with a fading voice, “Ok.” and Amane nodded back, trying his back to not let his face turn red.",

      "content": "“E-erm, Amane-kun…”\nMahiru sounded doubtful in Amane’s clutches, and Amane did not answer as he wrapped his arms around her body.\nHe hugged her after dinner, as retaliation for her teasing him, but he felt it was torture to himself.\nMahiru would basically accept anything Amane would do to her. He could casually hold her hand, or pat her head, or even hug her, and she would not loath it.\nShe would not be repulsed even if Amane kept sniffing at Mahiru’s sweet scent or embraced her to enjoy her soft body. She would always say “I like it when you do this, Amane-kun.” and allow him to, as long as he did not go overboard.\nIf Amane planned to retaliate against Mahiru, who had permitted him to act to some extent, he too would have to bear some damage. One had to say that he was not hurting Mahiru at all; his sanity was under attack.\n“What is with this out of a sudden, Amane-kun…?”\n“…This is retaliation for what you did at school.”\n“Retaliation?”\n“You teased me, so now I’ll tease you back.”\n“But this makes me happy.”\n“I guessed so.”\nAmane himself was enjoying this, and he too wondered what he should do next.\nTruth be told, Amane had no guts to attack Mahiru.\nPersonality-wise, they were neither capable of taking the initiative, nor following the lead. They were the type to take it step by step, slowly approached each other, to touch each other hesitantly and get used to each other. It was hard for them to go on the offensive.\n“…But seriously, this position is making me embarrassed enough.”\nAmane accidentally blurted out his true thoughts. As expected, a single embrace required courage, and he was embarrassed. He was working hard, trying to ensure that he could touch her outright, but he could not do anything about his heart that was pounding wildly.\nUpon hearing his words, Mahiru blinked away.\n“…I cannot say I am not ashamed.”\n“Eh?”\n“After all, I feel relieved and comfortable to have you touching me like this, Amane-kun, but I do feel embarrassed…erm, my heart flutters.”\n“I can’t tell from your face though.”\n“…Will you not laugh at me if you can see it?”\n“Laugh at you…? I think I’ll just look at your face and find you cute.”\nAmane might retaliate, but it was more likely that Mahiru’s embarrassed self would be so adorable, his heart would be writhing.\nShe was cute in appearance, voice, gesture, personality, and obviously, she would be cute if she was bashful. Amane, who was sunk several times on this day, could easily conclude this.\nOnce he answered her seriously, Mahiru closed her eyes, and headbutted Amane’s chest.\n“It-it is because you always say such things…this is the bad thing about you, Amane-kun.”\n“Which part?”\n“…You have no self-awareness at all.”\n“No, you’re the one not realizing that you’re out to kill, Mahiru.”\n“That is not true. You have so much destructive power, Amane-kun.”\nShe rolled her forehead about, clinging close while wrapping her arms around Amane, “I suppose it is due to Shuuto-san’s teachings.” she muttered.\nAmane did not understand why his father’s name was mentioned.\nNevertheless, there was no doubt that Mahiru was being embarrassed. In a certain sense, the payback worked.\nIf he said anything more, Mahiru might never lift her head again. He remained silent as he patted her head.",

      "content": "“Say Itsuki?”\n“What now, bro?”\n“…Has Mahiru’s popularity increased after she started dating?”\nBack in the classroom, Mahiru was dealing with many classmates surrounding her, and Amane grumbled softly as he watched her. “Yeah.” Itsuki agreed.\nMahiru’s popularity had increased, rather than decreased, ever since they started dating two weeks ago.\nShe was already the most popular student of the entire year, and at this point, and garnered more people around her.\nThere were more girls than boys, but the boys were giving her passionate looks. Amane felt conflicted upon seeing this.\n“Well, I get why Shiina-san’s more popular now.”\n“Why?”\n“Hm…there’s a feeling that she was behind a glass panel back then, but now she looks more approachable. I think it’s because people used to think of her as some unattainable, unapproachable person, but now that she’s with you, she’s showing a girly side to herself.”\nIt was true that ever since Mahiru dated Amane, her smile had changed somewhat.\nWhile her smile was Angelic, she was starting to show her usual side. She showed the innocent smile of a girl in bloom, rather than the feeble, delicate one.\nLittle by little, Mahiru was no longer acting like an Angel, but revealing more of herself. Amane was delighted by this, yet he felt conflicted that the smile only he knew of would be diminished in vlaue.\nHe hoped that everyone would know Mahiru was just an ordinary girl, not an idol, but he was troubled that everyone would know about this. This contradiction had him hating himself.\n“But well, I still feel conflicted about this. Now everyone knows the true personality of someone only those intimate with her did. I should be happy, but I just feel troubled. I think I’m just being petty.”\n“That’s you showing your possessiveness…but I think that’s not all to her. She surely has some other faces to show you.”\n“Well yeah.”\nWhenever they touched, she would look bashful, yet a little elated. When she pouted, her cheeks would balloon unhappily. When she fawned, she would show a sweet, gentle smile akin to a sponge of honey. These were all the expressions only Amane could see.\n“And well, you’re the one who changed Shiina-san. It’s because of you that she has that smile. Don’t be scared, just go up there, and say ‘My Mahiru is cute, right?'”\n“…I don’t dare to assert myself like that. Not going to be jealous though.”\n“…I remember the same mouth flirting furiously before everyone though.”\n“T-that…wasn’t on purpose.”\n“If that was on purpose, you have guts. Even if it wasn’t, you’re spreading your affection without realizing it. People around your are getting hit by that.”\nLearn your lesson,\nhe poked at Amane’s forehead, and the latter pursed his lips.\nFor some reason, whenever some students were next to Amane and Mahiru recently, they would blush and look aside.\nAmane was not touching Mahiru much, and did not really talk much, but the students were blushing, which had him confused.\nThere were some jealous stares, but more warm ones. What he heard from the boys in the class was, “Man, I know I don’t have a chance when those two are so close. I can give up now…”\nOthers had said that Mahiru was only looking at Amane, and while he was embarrassed by this, it was true that he was a little happy.\n“I think one reason is that Shiina-san’s acting like she’s not going to let you be taken by anyone.”\n“Why would I be? I don’t stand out like Mahiru, nobody’s going to be interested in me. I’ll be troubled if there is.”\n“…Look, you don’t really stand out, but you’re above average across the board. Your face’s decent, your body size, your brain, and athleticism…hmm, so so, and even though you’re very rude, your personality’s OK, especially since you’re very honest. You’re pretty much one to be envious of, when it comes to girls.”\n“You know…it’s disgusting when you’re praising me like this…”\n“50 points from you for being blunt. Well, even though your words don’t match your thoughts, it’s obvious. You’re very straightforward.’\n“You’re just saying that I have a twisted personality, right?”\nWhile he was not as bad as when he was most helpless, Amane felt he had a twisted personality.\nHe felt virtues like good personalities and honest were more suited for a good boy like Kadowaki, and not someone like himself who had a somewhat twisted personality.\n“Well, I think you’re easy to understand. You’re very honest. Chii says the same.”\n“Say, you two.”\n“You keep saying that you’re twisted here and there, but you’re really very honest, and considerate for others. It’s just that your words are a little crude.”\n“Sorry for being crude with my words.”\nAmane tilted his head aside, and Itsuki chuckled, before going over to pat Amane’s shoulder. Amane elbowed back, and whispered, “Thanks.”",

      "content": "“Amane-kun, I have to go somewhere after school. Can we go home separately?”\nIt was a certain day in July, after school, when Amane planned to return home with Mahiru as usual, only to hear her say such words.\nMahiru was usually the one who wanted to return home with him, so her request had him surprised, and he had to stare at her face.\nWhenever she had something to do, Mahiru would often go along with Amane. Since she politely refused to, one had to wonder if it was something she did not want him to know of.\nLooking at her expression however, he knew she was not guilty of anything, and was not worried.\nSummer nights often came late, and she should be fine if she did not stay out too long. Nevertheless, Amane really wanted to go home with Mahiru.\n“Oh, got it. I’ll see you later.”\nSince he knew Mahiru would spend time with him at his place, he respected her wishes.\nIt seemed she was a little relived that Amane would accept this, and then she widened her eyes warily, as though she had realized something.\n“…Please do not return home with other girls.”\n“You think I will?”\n“I do not, but there is a likelihood that other girls will ask you out, Amane-kun…I cannot say that I disallow it, but I dislike that. Some did talk to you just a while ago…”\nIt was a miracle that Amane did not make any noise.\n…Wait, is she jealous?\nGiven his usual attitude towards Mahiru, he could not imagine anyone asking him out, but it appeared she was worried about this.\nTo wit, the girls who spoke to Amane were probably cheering them on, saying things like “Do your best”, and there was no need to worry.\nMahiru appeared a little uneasy, and lifted her head towards Amane uneasily, in a pleading manner. Amane found this adorable, and wanted to pat her head, but he disregarded this notion as there were onlookers.\nThe last time he did this, the onlookers were petrified by Mahiru’s smile. He would not repeat the same mistake again.\n“Don’t worry, my heart’s all yours, Mahiru. I’m not going to accept anyone else’s invitation. At most, I’ll end up dragged along by Chitose.”\n“…That will do.”\nIt appeared Chitose was still within limits. There was no way Chitose would fall for Amane however, and neither would Amane fall for Chitose, not with Itsuki around. Mahiru would probably be fine if it was Chitose.\nIt appeared Mahiru was somewhat relieved to hear Amane say this, for the tension was sapped from her shoulders, and she lifted her head towards him with a somewhat bashful look.\n“And, erm, it will be bad if you misunderstand, somehow. I shall tell you where I am going.”\n“You don’t have to keep it a secret?”\n“Y-yes.”\nShe said it was not a secret, but Amane felt Mahiru was stammering. It seemed she wanted to continue however, so he patiently waited for her to do so.\n“E-erm…I am going to buy something.”\n“Really? That’s nothing to be embarrassed about.”\n“Chitose-san and I…e-erm, will be buying swimsuits.”\n“…Swimsuits?”\nIt was true that entering July, the shops were starting to sell swimsuits.\nAmane and the others often passed by a large area in the shopping mall where swimsuits were sold. He also clearly remembered his female classmates saying that they would be buying new swimsuits.\nHe however never expected Mahiru to actually buy her own swimsuit.\nTruth be told, Mahiru could not swim.\nShe did say that since she did not want to swim, she chose a school where swimming classes were not a requirement. In any case, she probably could not swim.\nAnd that Mahiru wanted to buy a swimsuit.\n“…Are we not going to the pool together…?”\nShe fidgeted and shriveled as she whispered bashfully. Amane froze once he heard that, and pinched his face.\n…Don’t say that with such a face.\nAs expected, the classmates loitering in the classroom were looking over at them.\nThere were expressions ranging from shock to warm smiles, which left him gaudy, ashamed, and unable to calm down. His heart would pound wildly whenever he saw Mahiru’s bashful face, and with so many staring at him in this atmosphere, he wanted to dig a hole and bury his head in.\n“…I see. Then…go ahead.”\n“Y-yes…which will be better?”\n“The safer ones.”\nHe had to give an immediate answer.\nGiven her pretty face, one would assume any swimsuit would suit her nicely, but it was best for her to wear something not too revealing.\nAfter all, while Amane and Mahiru had been dating for weeks, he hardly saw her reveal much skin.\nIn school, Mahiru would button up to the neck, and wear tights. She would wear such formal clothing, one had to worry if she would get heatstroke.\nAt home, she would never wear clothes that would reveal her chest, and her skirts were on the longer side. Even when wearing pants, she would wear tights.\nIn other words, Amane practically saw nothing of her skin, or nothing at all. He never had the chance to.\nIn this situation, if she were to wear a swimsuit, a sexy one at that, he probably would collapse on the spot and be unable to get up.\nOnce Amane said so decisively, Mahiru widened her eyes, and then she gave a chuckle.\n“It really is a typical answer from you.”\n“I’ll die. Something not outlandish please.”\n“Hm hm, what shall I do?”\n“Mahiru>”\n“I shall discuss with Chitose-san about which kinds will delight you.”\nAmane pursed his lips as he looked at the somewhat bashful looking Mahiru.\nBetter send a message to Chitose, make sure she doesn’t choose anything weird.\nIt was more than a matter of life and death, and he had to stop Chitose, even if he had to knock Mahiru over.\nChitose was not in the classroom, and it appeared she was off to return something to her friend in another class. Amane decided to send a message to her, and poked the face of Mahiru who appeared to be contemplating a prank.",

      "content": "“Please look forward to the moment I wear it.” Ultimately, Mahiru did not inform Amane of the swimsuit she bought, and instead, she slyly diverted the topic.\nAmane did remind Chitose, but he was unsure if she would listen. He was worried that she would excitedly choose a swimsuit with high exposure for Mahiru, going all “You’ll like this Amane.”\n“Please, nothing too fancy.”\nHis mutter echoed in the bathroom, and only he could hear it.\nSince Mahiru offered to do so, Amane let her deal with the leftovers and the dishwashing, and took a bath to wash away the sweat. He was thinking about the swimsuit the entire time.\nAs a high school boy, Amane too would have delusions, wondering what swimsuit she would wear.\nThere was no doubt that Mahiru would be mesmerizing if she showed her slender body to everyone. She always had such a fine figure, and if she wore a bikini, Amane would surely be unable to look at her.\nThe mere imagination of it had his heart pounding wildly, his body fiery. It was also partly due to him being in the bathtub, but he was getting hotter in another sense.\n…Well, I guess any clothing suits Mahiru well, but I’ll be embarrassed to look at her. Can I really stand by her side?\nAmane had the right to look at Mahiru, and the right to stand by her side, but if he did stand by her side, he would look inferior in many ways.\nHe looked at his own body, which did not have much muscle.\nPerhaps his body was not one to get much muscle mass, for there was no visible effect even after his exercises.\nThus, no matter what he wore, Amane’s would appear to be on the thinner side. He was skinny, actually, and did not have much flesh. He clearly did not look sturdy.\nHe felt it would be better if he bulked a little more, but since his parents were rather skinny too, it appeared to be hereditary, and not something he could resolve.\n“Ahh…I should’ve trained myself more.”\nIt was too late for him to regret it.\nMuscles do not simply grow immediately, and it would take some time to see the results. It was July, and even if he put in the effort, Amane did not think there would be visible results by the time his summer vacation swimming trip with Mahiru arrived.\nHe sighed, and buried half his face into the water.\nAmane imagined the sight of Mahiru in a swimsuit, and also how he would be frustrated standing next to her. He ended up soaking in the water for far too long.\nTypically, he would bath for only 10 minutes or so, but this time, he exceeded half an hour. It was obvious how bothered he was.\nHe spent so much more time bathing, and it was past 10pm. Amane had a look at the waterproof clock placed there, and confirmed the time.\nMahiru would usually return home at 10pm. She should be back.\nWell I guess she went home.\nAmane concluded as he wiped the droplets off his body, and quickly got changed.\nAs he had soaked for too long, his body was hot, and he did not wear a shirt. He intended to dry himself using the air conditioner.\nHe put on his jersey shorts, along with a towel on his head, and left the changing room for the living room. If his parents saw him in this state, it was likely they would say, “You’re sloppy” or “Don’t hurt your tummy now”.\nHe wondered if there was any program being aired on the TV as he went to the living room, and found a familiar flax colored hair dangling on the backrest of the sofa.\nShe’s not going back?\nMahiru typically would not stay around; it was rare for her to remain.\nShe lowered her head slightly, and moved her elbow, seemingly looking at her hand. It appeared she was finishing the revision she should be doing at him.\nAmane was impressed to see her working hard as usual, and approached her.\n“It’s rare to see you here at this time.”\nHe said as he picked up the remote control from the table and switched the channel. She lifted her head, seemingly having noticed Amane, and froze.\n“Ah, eh, eh…”\n“What now?”\n“…Wh-why, is your upper body exposed…?”\nAmane would usually dress like this after bathing in the summer, and it was nothing out of the ordinary to him. Mahiru clearly was panicking however as she covered her face with her hands.\nOne could see red skins between the gaps of her fingers.\n“Well, that’s because I’m feeling hot.”\n“I-I am still here, so please do not dress like this.”\n“I thought you went home…it’s 10.30pm.”\n“I intended to call out to you before heading back, Amane-kun.”\nHe realized this was the reason why Mahiru remained, and sat next to her.\nHer shoulders then shivered, and he chuckled.\n“…Are you this embarrassed?”\n“Of course!”\n“But since you bought a swimsuit, I guess that means you want to see me in my swimsuit, right? I don’t think I’m showing as much as I will in a swimsuit. Is this too much for you?”\n“Uuu…”\nMahiru said she wanted to go swimming with Amane, which was why she bought a swimsuit.\nThus, she would have assumed Amane would be wearing one. It was to be expected, given taht they were about to go swimming.\nIn other words, Mahiru did intend to see him half naked.\nDespite that, she was so flustered to see him half naked, and he was worried if she could go to the pool.\nSince she was embarrassed to see Amane like that, one had to wonder if she could endure the sight of the males in swimwear around her.\nBefore they became lovers, Mahiru was flustered to see him half naked. She probably had no tolerance to a man’s skin. Amane was uneasy about letting her visit places like a pool or the seaside.\n“…Well, you got a swimsuit, but you might not be able to go to a pool.”\n“Y-you say that.”\n“How about you get used to this now?”\nAmane was showing less skin than he would in a swimsuit. It was a chance for Mahiru to get used to it, but she shook her head repeatedly.\n“I-I cannot do not. Not when you are like this now, Amane-kun.”\n“Why?”\n“…Y-you appear erotic, Amane-kun.”\n“Erotic?”\n“I find myself weak seeing you just out of the bath.”\nMahiru did not look meet Amane in the eyes; it appeared it was not simply because she would see his body.\nEven if she called him erotic, Amane felt he had no manliness or charisma. It appeared Mahiru did not think so however.\nWell truly, Mahiru herself would look really alluring fresh out of a bath. Perhaps it too was the case if the person she liked had just finished bathing.\nHowever, Amane was not going to stop just from hearing these words.\n“So if I say I want to hug you now, you don’t want it?”\n“Eh…?”\n“If I say I want to feel you more directly, you don’t want that?”\nAmane was not saying that he wanted Mahiru to strip, but he would like to experience some contact with the girl he liked, without reservations.\nOf course, he would stop immediately if Mahiru was unwilling. If she was willing however, he hoped to embrace her in his clutches. Surely she would blush and shiver all over, but Amane really had the urge to tease her when she was like this.\n“I-is it not sexual harassment?’\n“Forget about it then. I don’t want to be end up hated by you.”\n“…I-I will not, but…erm…you…wi-will not do, anything strange, I believe…?”\n“You think I’ll do anything you’re unwilling to?”\nBasically, Amane would wish he was dead due to the guilt he would feel if Mahiru hated him or cried. He could not ask for the unreasonable. He would hope to do so only when both sides agreed to it, and not force the issue.\nAll Amane wanted to do on this day was to embrace her, get her used to it, and not do anything more.\nHe stared at her intently as he answered honestly. After her eyes wavered, she stared at him nervously, her face still beetroot.\nHowever, she showed no sign of refusing.\n“…Well…e-erm…pl-please go easy…”\nAfter saying this with a teeny-weeny voice, Mahiru cautiously reached her arms out.\nAmane opened his arms wide to receive her, embraced her, and her body was clearly shivering as she shriveled in his arms.\nIt appeared she was wondering where to put her face, so she did not put it on his body. However, she hesitantly put her cheek on his flat chest.\n“It is smoother than I thought.”\n“Thought, as in…?”\n“…And, your heart is pounding faster than I imagined…”\nGiven that Mahiru had put her cheek onto Amane’s chest, it was likely she could hear his heartbeat, loud and clear.\n“Do I look that relaxed?”\n“…Yes.”\n“How can I be? Erm, there’s no way I can hug anyone like this, when you’re my first girlfriend, Mahiru.”\nIt was Mahiru and Amane’s first relationship, and obviously, neither of them experienced such body contact.\nThis mere embrace had Amane so embarrassed, his body heated up once again. Yet at the same time, he felt delighted.\nHe could not hide his heartbeat while faced with such an embrace.\n“…You are a boy too, Amane-kun.”\n“What do you think of me as?”\n“I-I did assume so the last time. Y-you did remind me…”\nThis last time she spoke of was probably about the lap pillow reward after their tests.\nAmane pushed her down to remind her, since she was overly careless. Back then, her face was blushing, and she realized there and then that Amane was a boy.\nAmane was worried if she had forgotten that he was a boy, but it seemed she did remember as she lifted her head on his chest, saying with while still blushing,\n“…Amane-kun, you are thin…”\n“Sorry about being thin. I don’t seem reliable, right?”\n“Not at all. But, erm, y-you are sturdier, th-than I thought. I am surprised…”\nMahiru traced the center of Amane’s chest with her finger.\nHe did not have much muscle, but he did have lumps. Her finger slowly glided by the abs that seemed to be there, and yet not.\n“I have not touched a man’s body before. It is a new feeling for me, so I am shocked…”\n“…You can touch if you want, but if you go overboard, I’ll touch you, Mahiru.”\nAmane patted Mahiru’s waist jokingly, and she shivered.\nHe reflected upon how carried away he was, but Mahiru did not seem to hate it and merely covered her face with her palms.\n“E-erm…next time, if, it, is just a little…”\n“…Eh?”\n“…I do not dislike it.”\nMahiru whispered as she appeared to be somewhat bashful , peeked at Amane, before covering her face completely once again. Amane could not resist as he groaned, and embraced her with more strength.\n※Author’s comments: After this, Mahiru returned home as usual.",

      "content": "It was a month since they started dating.\nAmane had not taken the initiative to kiss Mahiru, and did not know how to interact with her.\nThey held hands and embraced, but he did not take the next step.\nJust days ago, Amane embraced her while half naked, but he did not do anything. Itsuki would have laughed at Amane if he heard of this.\n…Can we really progress like this?\nHe laid on the bed, covering his eyes with his arm.\nIt was daytime on his day off, and he was lazing around on the sofa as Mahiru would be here in the evening. Amane was prone to laziness whenever Mahiru was not around, and after he had brunch, he just lazed around on the bed.\nMahiru was usually here in the day. She was expected to be here in the evening on this day, probably because she realized the implication of the ‘you may touch’ she said days ago.\nThe day after she said that, she was strangely tense, fidgeting all over. It was most probably because of this.\n…If I had been a little more assertive though.\nIf Amane could muster a little more courage, they could have kissed, even if they did not go all the way to intercourse.\nAs a high school boy, Amane naturally had his own desires, and often had thoughts of kissing the person he liked.\nBut he never said his desire, and never took action.\nHe wanted to touch her body if possible, even if they could not go all the way, he wanted to kiss her all he wanted.\nHe was worried that she would be unwilling, and dared not do so. Bad things would happen if he did not control himself, so he never took this step.\nWell, Mahiru said I can touch.\nAmane dared not be careless about where he could touch, and how much he could.\nEven he found himself useless, and truth be told, he still found himself cowardly, yet he could do nothing about it.\nIf I were a little bolder, c\nan we do lover-like things?\nAmane wondered, sighed, and closed his eyes as he shielded them from the light with his arm.\n“…Amane-kun, you will catch a cold if you leave your belly exposed.”\nA silver bell-like voice pulled Amane’s consciousness back.\n“Little by little, Amane opened his heavy eyelids, and found a flax-colored curtain in his blurry vision.\nIts owner was Mahiru, who should not be here, kneeling on one knee, leaning her face towards him.\n…Mahiru.\nHe recognized his dearest girl in his blurred consciousness, and slowly reached his arms out towards her.\nIt was not a major deal towards him, and he just wanted to experience her warmth.\nHe pulled Mahiru towards himself without holding back, probably because he was groggy.\n“Kyaa” of course, Mahiru made a cute sound when she was suddenly pulled over, and fell onto him.\nOnce he felt her soft yet suitably heavy body, he turned around, and rolled with her on the bed.\n“…E-erm, Amane-kun…?”\nAmane sensed the troubled presence and voice in his clutches, and yawned as he brought his face close to her, experiencing her warmth.\nHe was too lazy to get up, so he closed his eyes, and buried his face into the body of the girl dearest of him.\nHe might have touched the region near her neck.\nHe inhaled, and Mahiru’s milky sweet fragrance entered his nostrils, comforting him greatly.\nHe really did not like sweets, but the delicious smell had him mesmerized, and he could not resist from biting her.\n“Kyaah!?”\nHe did not nibble too hard, just a little contact, but he heard a gentle squeal.\nThat too felt comfortable.\nHe had a lick, and there was not much sweetness. He could only feel some subtle tenderness and silkiness. Perhaps it was because he found Mahiru sweet after all?\n“A-Amane-kun, are you delirious?”\n“…Nn.”\n“Goodness..!”\nWhile sucking away at Mahiru’s skin, he felt an impact on his back.\nIt did not hurt, but it was Mahiru using all her strength to shake and slap at him. He moved away from her while his mind remained in a groggy state.\nHe blinked hard, focused his eyes on Mahiru, and saw she was blushing, glaring with teary eyes.\nThere was a little red dot the size of a pinky at the base of her white neck.\n“…Mahiru?”\n“Good morning…you appear to be so sleepy. Are you awake now?”\nOnce he heard that sarcastic voice, he looked at his position, posture, and distance from Mahiru, only to freeze.\nOnce he was fully awake, he grasped his situation. It was really had.\nHe was delirious, and she was his girlfriend, but he had just dragged a girl onto the bad, made contact with her, and bit her neck. Even Mahiru too might be displeased.\nMahiru remained in his clutches, and did not look disgusted, but she glared at him a little, her face still blushing.\n“Say, Amane-kun, I will feel troubled if you touch me like that.”\n“I’m very sorry.”\n“…Is there a mark?”\nShe pointed at where the lips touched, and Amane realized too late that he had messed up.\nEven in the summer, she would button her the collar, so that part did not look visible. Nevertheless, it was the base of the neck, and she might show it while changing. Chitose would surely tease her if she found it.\n“Erm, I’m sorry, but yes.”\n“…Baka.”\nShe pouted and grumbled, but she did not seem angry.\n“Th-this will not be an issue if it cannot be seen, but why here…”\nAmane also did not know why he practically sexually harassed Mahiru.\nHe really wanted to touch her, and do lover things, but he did not want to do anything she would hate him for. Forcing himself onto her was something against his principles.\nNevertheless, he did this while groggy, which mean that he probably was subconsciously yearning for this…frustrated, actually.\nAmane realized the consequences if he was more physical, and started to be terrified of his own desires.\n“Erm, sorry. I’ll take note in the future. I don’t want to make you unhappy.”\n“I-I did not say I am unhappy! Well, erm, actually, it is embarrassing, but, I do not dislike it.”\n“I get carried away because you say such things.”\nThe moment Mahiru said so, Amane had the urge to suck on the white skin, so he hoped she would not say so.\nIf he tried to love her with all his might, she probably would be overwhelmed with embarrassment, and he might not be able to control himself. That would be scary.\nWhile suppress the urges rising inside him, he straightened his body, along with Mahiru’s. She then leaned onto him.\n“Look Mahiru, I’ll be troubled if you do this. Just stay a little fur…”\nAmane could not finish his words.\nA warm breath grazed his shoulder, and he felt a soft pain.\nHe gasped, and looked towards the warmth. He saw Mahiru move her face away from his shoulder, not concealing her blushing face at all as she looked up at him.\n“…This is payback.”\nShe muttered softly out of shame, and lowered her eyelids. Amane reached his limit, and embraced her little body.\nHe could not help himself once he realized the softness, sweet scent, and body warmth were all in his clutches.\nMahiru lifted her head in shock, and Amane put his lips on her cheek. A rose bloomed there.\nHe quickly broke away, and met her in the eyes. Her caramel colored eyes were really wide.\n“…Amane-kun.”\n“Shut up.”\n“I have not said anything.”\n“…You would’ve pushed me aside if you disliked it.”\nAmane did kiss her on the cheek, and if she disliked it, he would not do it again…but she shook her head.\n“There is no way I dislike it…erm, I am delighted.”\nShe said bashfully as she showed a relaxed smile. Once again, Amane could not resist bringing his lips to her face, and muttered softly, “You adorable one.”",

      "content": "“HYAAHHAAA!! OUR SUMMER VACATION IS FINALLY HERE!”\n“Why are you so agitated?”\nIt was midway through July, and after the closing ceremony and the homeroom briefing period, the students were finally liberated, happily talking about their summer plans.\nItsuki got excited the moment homeroom ended, and Amane was just thinking that it was too hot out there.\n“Well, isn’t this obvious? It’s heaven after the hell that’s class time…onward to paradise…!”\n“That’s just because you don’t like to study. I don’t hate it.”\n“Shut up you top scorer. You get more time to flirt with Shiina-san, Amane.”\n“Flirting…say, it’s not like we spend all day doing that.”\nThey probably spent more time doing their own things, rather than being together.\nThey often studied together and split the chores while spending time at the same place, and did not simply flirt away.\nMahiru obviously would keep studying, but she did exercise and take care of her body for the sake of her health and beauty. Amane too went running with her as exercise, but it would be a fallacy to assume they were always together.\n“…I’ll be blunt, you two think it’s too difficult to consciously flirt with each other, but you’ve been doing that without realizing it.”\n“How so?”\n“Well, I guess you two will look at each other, smile, lock arms, hold hands, and so on.”\nAmane could not deny that.\nHe did not really embrace Mahiru, but such little skinship was something they did every day.\nThe standards of flirting was hard to define. Amane did not think it was flirting, but it might seem so to the common folk.\n“Look, even I’m getting hot just seeing you two flirt around. Right Yuuta?”\n“Ahaha, yeah. I’m embarrassed to see it too.”\n“You too Kadowaki…?”\n“But thanks to this, fewer people are trying to stop you two. I don’t think this is a bad thing.”\nIt was true that there were not many boys who would harass Amane or argue, or even try to snatch Mahiru, as he had expected.\nThe most likely reason was because Mahiru was clearly showing her fondness of Amane. She did not care about anyone else, and it seemed they had given up.\nDespite that, Amane was mentally prepared to hear some grumbles or arguments. For some reason however, his classmates appeared to be watching over them, giving a protective vibe. Truth be told, Amane was nonplussed.\n“But seriously, it’s because of Shiina-san’s pressure that you didn’t get anything.”\n“Pressure?”\n“More like, she’s fending them off? What else could they do after seeing Shiina-san like that during the sports festival? If anything happened to you, she’ll be furious.”\n“Furious huh…I can’t imagine that.”\n“I can’t imagine that either, but she definitely will be. Looks aside, the teachers really trust her. It’ll be really scary to be her enemy.”\nIt’s really scary to make such a kind person angry.\nHe quipped, and Amane silently agreed.\nShe’s probably the type I can’t afford to anger.\nAmane did say he could not imagine Mahiru getting angry.\nBut he understood it would be a really bad thing if she got angry.\nShe always had a kind smile on her face, and was not one to get angry over such petty things. Amane had a feeling that if someone crossed the line, she would smile and reason with that person till he would be unable to refute. It was not impossible, considering what happened during the sports festival.\nAmane did not intend to infuriate Mahiru, and she was more likely to be sad than angry if he actually did something. He made up his mind to keep Mahiru calm.\n“…Are you intending to anger me?”\nThe moment Amane quietly swore to himself, Mahiru and Chitose dropped by.\n“Ah Mahiru-san, actually, no we’re just talking about how you’ll probably be angry if anyone did anything to Mahiru.”\n“Certainly…but I will not be angry. I will talk until that person understands.”\nItsuki shivered a little once he saw Mahiru smile.\nMahiru probably would explain in words to get that person to understand, as declared. She probably would not want anyone to get on her bad side, and would press on with her smile and logic as weapons, and force that person to agree.\nAmane hoped he would not become her enemy.\n“Amane, you can’t anger Mahirun, you know?”\n“There’s no way I’ll do that. I don’t know what I can do to make her angry.”\n“…Be a playboy?”\n“You think I can do that?”\n“Actually, I don’t think so, that’s impossible given your personality. Once you open your heart to someone, you’ll treasure her.”\n“…Thanks for the compliments.”\nHe was a little ashamed to be praised directly.\n“But you really become cowardly when you value her too much. You only kissed her on the cheek.”\n“Mahiru.”\n“N-no, I am not unhappy with that…she asked me about the mark.”\n“Alright, forget about that.”\nMahiru explained the entire matter of the mark after she was asked, and Amane decided not to talk about it.\n“Ah, I think a kiss…”\n“Itsuki.”\n“Yes yes. My friend, the highness is really embarrassed. We usually do that little thing after all.”\nRight Chitose?\nItsuki called out, and started flirting.\nIt’s not like I climbed the way to adulthood like you two.\nAmane quietly muttered to himself.\nThose two had been dating for two years, and obviously arrived at a phase Amane and Mahiru had yet to reach. Amane often heard Itsuki talk about this, and was not shocked in the slightest, though he did feel some shame.\nIt appeared Mahiru too might have heard so from Chitose, for her face too was flushed. It appeared she was thinking the same thing as Amane.\n…I guess it’ll take a long while.\nThey never kissed on the mouth, and copulation might be a far cry. Amane did not have any desire to do so, and thus the two of them could only approach at a same pace.\nOnce Amane’s eyes met Mahiru’s, her face turned red as she lowered it. Amane too was embarrassed, and looked away from her.",

      "content": "“Mahiru, when’s a good time to go to my hometown?”\nIt was the first day of summer vacation, Amane asked her once she came to his place as usual.\nThey should have decided on this long ago, but Amane got too excited after he started dating Mahiru, and due to many other issues he was busy with, he did not have the time to talk to her. Shihoko said they could drop by any time, so they probably could return near the Obon period in August, like the previous day.\nOnce she heard his question, Mahiru blinked away.\n“…Ah, you don’t want to return to my hometown?”\n“No, not that. It is just that I remembered that I will be disturbing your parents…erm, I am fine with any time.”\n“I see. How long will we stay there? I think two weeks or so is fine, including Obon.”\nAmane showed a wry smile once he saw Mahiru hastily wave her hands, denying that she did not dislike the idea of going to his hometown. He wondered how long they would take.\nItsuki and Kadowaki did not invite Amane out to Obon, and usually, it was to be spent with family. That would probably be the period when they would return home. It would be a while until they had to return to school.\nJust the previous day, Amane was too lazy to do his own housework, so he spent the two weeks at his hometown lazing around. Since Mahiru would be with him, he had to take note of her plans. If they wanted to relax, they could spend a week or two there.\n“I have no specific arrangements. My outing with Chitose-san has yet to be decided, so erm, how long do you plan to return home?”\n“About two weeks or so then. It’s rather long. You fine with that?”\n“Yes.”\nSince it appeared Mahiru had no prior arrangements, Amane ended up suggesting the timeframe.\nAs a girl, She probably needed more clothes, so Amane suggested that she send the luggage over, and give Shihoko a message.\nShihoko might still be working, and would not reply immediately, but she would probably agree happily, and try to extend their stay. Amane’s mother loved cute things, and was particularly fond of Mahiru, especially given the latter’s personality.\n“But I guess mom will be really happy.”\n“Fufu, I guess.”\n“…Prepare yourself though.”\n“Hm?”\n“My mom’s going to harass you.”\nShihoko would obviously cling onto Mahiru.\nShe always wanted a daughter, and given this chance, she would dote on Mahiru dearly, as though she had a daughter.\n“I am rather grateful for that…”\n“That’s good…anyway.”\n“Hm?”\n“Don’t mention anything about us dating.”\nAmane whispered after some hesitation, and Mahiru froze.\nIt appeared she had not reported this to Shihoko, but the latter might realize from their attitudes once they got to Amane’s hometown, and tease them. Amane was conflicted on whether he should say this, and mitigate the damage he would suffer later.\nHowever, there was only a possibility that damage would be mitigated. The opposite might occur, and such was the terror that was Shihoko.\n“…Wh-what do we do? It will be awkward for us to report this again.”\n“Yeah. Mom’s definitely going to ask thoroughly.”\n“But I think I should pay a visit, since I have received her precious son.”\n“Ain’t I the one who received you, Mahiru…?”\nTypically, it was the male would welcomed the female. Considering Mahiru’s family situation, he should be the one welcoming her, and not the reverse. Shihoko definitely had no issues welcoming Mahiru him in.\nHe would give himself over to Mahiru if she wished for it, but it was true that he was the one who received her.\nHe said that, thinking this basis was established, but once she heard that, she blushed, and clung onto the cushion.\n“…Your honesty in saying such things is a virtue, Amane-kun, but that is also a fault.”\n“So which one is it?”\n“It is a virtue, only when saying so to me.”\n“You think I’ll say that to anyone else…?”\nAmane would never show interest in anyone else, and Mahiru knew that very well. What was she worried about?\n“…Same goes for this. Either way, this is fine. I think this is a virtue you have, Amane-kun. I think it is due to Shuuto-san’s teachings.”\n“Why dad?”\nAmane was confused as to why Shuuto’s name was suddenly mentioned, but once he saw Mahiru cupping the cushion and leaning towards him, he patted her head.\nHe did so because she was adorable, rather than before he wanted to coax her. So he patted her dotingly, and she lowered her eyes bashfully as she let him pat. It might be just Amane, but she seemed really comfortable, so it probably was not a bad thing.\n“…I think you will become like Shuuto-san, Amane-kun.”\n“Really? I don’t have that baby face.”\n“No, I mean the inside.”\n“I don’t believe I can be that calm.”\n“…I do not mean that.”\nBaka\n, Mahiru muttered with a voice barely audible for Amane to hear, and leaned on his elbow. He deliberately leaned backwards, and she fell onto his lap.\nThe caramel-colored eyes were hidden under the eyelids, appearing, closing, and appearing again. Amane saw this, and smiled as he put his palm on her cheek.\n“I can’t be as gentlemanly as him, but I’ll dote on you in my own way, Mahiru.”\n“…This is what I am referring to.”\n“My dad’s doting abilities are better than mine.”\n“…I am already drowning.”\nShe put her head on his lap, her hands wrapped around Amane’s that was on her face as she showed a relaxed expression, and closed her eyes.\nShe rubbed her cheeks, and smiled.\n“…May I continue to drown?”\n“I’ll give you however much you want…don’t drown in the pool next week though.”\n“…Baka.”\nThis time, she retorted with a pout so cute and so clear. He laughed, and patted her face again.",

      "content": "The day they went to the pool, a strangely tense Amane changed clothes.\nHe went to a leisure facility in the suburbs along with Mahiru, and they went their separate ways to change clothes…but before then, he noticed several male stares upon Mahiru. One could easily assume that she would mesmerize these men once she changed into the swimsuit.\nIf Chitose was around, she probably would be able to deftly resolve this issue, but the two of them so happened to come alone. Amane could not refuse Mahiru when she looked up at him and said, “I want the two of us to come alone.”\nHe made up his mind to protect her from the demonic clutches of the other men. He changed into his swimsuit, put on a rashguard, and left the changing room.\nHe arrived at the location they agreed upon, and waited for Mahiru. Naturally, she was late.\nHe was not unhappy about this, and just felt it was to be expected.\nFemales would take more time to change than the males, and one could imagine how packed their changing room would be.\nGirls really have it tough,\nso he thought as he leaned his body on the thick pillar, where the light signage was.\nIt was summer vacation, but still a weekday, and there were relatively fewer people. Nevertheless, the place was packed.\nAmane listlessly spotted various people of all ages and genders pass by, and spotted a familiar flax-colored hair among them.\n“Amane-kun.”\nAs expected, his dearest girlfriend was approaching.\nHowever, he felt it might be a mistake to bring her over. As Mahiru advanced towards Amane, so did many stares.\nAmane usually would not be so conscious that Mahiru’s beauty was out of this world, and she might be more beautiful than the magazine models.\nThere was no way she would not attract attention at all while wearing a swimsuit.\n“So-sorry to keep you waiting. There were too many in the changing room.”\n“O-ok.”\nMahiru did not run, but skipped over to him as she was by the water, and stood before him with a faint smile.\nHe really had difficulty figuring out where to look, given that she was in a swimsuit.\nIt appeared her skin would turn red and ache when exposed to the sun, so she applied much more suntan lotion. She looked exceptionally white just wearing the swimsuit.\nHer skin was a speckless milky white under the sun, so white that she did not appear Japanese.\nThe body of flesh, formed by the skin that remained oblivious to any suntan, was perfect.\nAmane knew how delicate she was, and was reminded of that once he saw her.\nDespite that, she had noticeable lumps at where they should be. The breasts hidden under the frilly white based bikini formed steep slopes and gentle curves.\nHe assumed she was thin given how much she wore, but he never expected her to have large masses. It was not exaggeratedly large however, an ideal size that could be cupped in a hand.\nAmane was shocked that the cautious Mahiru chose a bikini, but it was not particularly lewd. Due to the large frills, the cleavage was sufficiently hidden, and coupled with her appearance, there was a innocent elegance to her.\nAmane’s eyes started swimming once he saw her in her swimsuit.\nHaving seen some gravure idols in his manga magazines, the sight of his girlfriend’s swimsuit was really dazzling.\n“…What is it?”\nOnce she was within touching distance, she asked bashfully, putting her hands on her chest.\nDue to the difference in height, Amane saw shadows formed by the fruits up close, and gulped.\n“Amane-kun?”\nOnce she saw the lack of response, a doubtful looking Mahiru gently touched his elbow, and he recovered.\n“…Do-does it not suit me?”\nThere was no way it did not suit her. It suited her so well, Amane did not know where to look.\n“Not at all. It suits you so well that I think it’ll be great if it’s just the two of us.”\n“T-thank you.”\nA female’s clothing should be praise, never mind that it was a swimsuit his adorable girlfriend picked for him. He would not be a man if he did not comment on that. Once he expressed his thoughts, she heaved a sigh of relief.\nHowever, it appeared Mahiru was embarrassed about showing as much as she ever did, and one could easily see she was heating up inside out.\nHe felt that if she was embarrassed, she could have worn something with more fabric. It seemed to be Chitose’s coaxing however, so Mahiru might be powerless to do anything about it.\nBut speaking of which.\nAmane had a look around, and found many staring at Mahiru in her swimsuit.\nEven some, who brought their girls along, were starting blankly at Mahiru. Some of them were slapped by their girlfriends.\nThese people could testify that they had witnessed an Angel by the waterside, but Amane was a little miffed as the boyfriend, for his girlfriend in swimsuit was being stared at.\n“I say that it really suits you, but.”\n“But?”\n“…This won’t do.”\nAmane removed his parka rashguard, and put it on Mahiru’s shoulders.\nMahiru was small to begin with, and the rashguard covered till her thighs. It was sufficient in warding off stares.\nOf course, the fine beauty of the legs would attract attention, but it was to be expected since the rashguard could not cover everything.\n“Put it on.”\n“But…Amane-kun, you…”\n“…What if I say that I don’t want other guys looking at you?”\nAmane really felt so.\nHe knew that since Mahiru had such an ideal body of fine curves, she would garner much attention, but he just hated it. If possible, he wanted her for himself.\nOnce he muttered so, “…y-yes…” she answered, and her face turned so red, it could not be simply due to the summer tan.\nOnce she quickly zipped up the front, the onlookers sighed with regret. Amane was relieved that he managed to stop the other men from giving leery looks at his girlfriend, held her little palm poking out from the loose sleeve.\n“Come on, let’s go.”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru gently nodded, held Amane’s hand, and he slowly walked next to her.\nSince they were by the waterside, Amane originally intended to hold her hand and walk, to prevent her from tripping. This time however, it was to fend the others off.\nHe boldly walked next to her towards the shallow pool. Next to him, “…Amane-kun.” Mahiru muttered as she looked up towards him.\n“Hm?”\n“…If it is just the two of us, will you look at me, in my swimsuit?”\n“If that’s the case, I’ll have an eyeful. Might even touch you.”\nIt would be dangerous if Amane really stared at her or touched her, so he would control himself a little. However, he joked with hyperbole, and Mahiru looked as though she was contemplating something.\nAfter ten seconds or so, she closed the distance between them, while still holding his hand.\nOr rather, she clung onto his arm.\nAmane felt a soft feeling through the rashguard. This time, he was the one blushing.\n“Mahiru, they’re touching.”\n“…Is this the moment when I should say that it is deliberate?”\n“Your inner angel isn’t working.”\n“Girls can become either angels or little devils in front of those they like.”\nIt appeared Mahiru was being quite the little devil.\nDespite that, she was rather embarrassed, shivering, and blushing. She did not intend to break off though, and deliberately latched her breasts on Amane’s arm.\nAmane could not easily swing away his right arm, since she was touching the elbow. If he bent it, his elbow might end up lodged in her cleavage.\n“…I don’t mind you clinging onto me, but I’ll really enjoy this.”\n“I-it is embarrassing to hear you say that…but it is fine.”\n“…Oh gosh you idiot.”\nAmane never expected her to accept, and muttered so. Despite his words, he desperately recited the digits of Pi to keep his mind off the soft feeling on his elbow.\nPing’s comment: Okay, it’s not Mahiru, but by the 1st illustrator of the series.\nhttps://mangadex.org/title/33536/saint-cecilia-pastor-lawrence\nClose enough.",

      "content": "Mahiru would always garner attention, and Amane brought her along to a shallow pool, shook a little waterproof bag in his hand, and looked towards Mahiru.\n“So, what are we going to do?”\n“Going to do, as in?”\n“Well, this leisure facility really isn’t a good place to teach your swimming. I guess you’ll be troubled to be forced to swim, right?”\n“That is the case.”\nAmane could swim, and could actually teach Mahiru, but this was not a swimming school, and there was no swimming lanes. She would surely bump into others while he was teaching.\nIn any case, the pools at this leisure facility were more for fun than actual swimming. Those who actually wanted to swim would not gather at such a place, but at a swimming school.\n“I can teach you how to swim if you want, Mahiru. But I think…well, since we got this chance, I want to play with you.”\n“E-erm, same here. I am glad to be with you, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru leaned over, and looked up at him. Once he understood the destructive power of this little devil, he patted his adorable lover on the head, and slowly regained his composure.\n“Let’s just play all we want then. And well, if we’re really going swimming, you need to remove the rashguard.”\nMahiru’s small and voluptuous body was hidden under Amane’s rashguard at this moment, and if they went swimming, it would hinder them. She had to remove it.\nThe other men might look at Mahiru again, and Amane wanted to avoid their gazes.\nTruly, it was a male privilege to enjoy the sight of one’s girlfriend in swimsuit, but Amane might die in many ways if they looked for too long. Thus, he could not allow that to her.\nFrom his point of view, the breasts were lower in defenses and possessed extremely high attack. He really could not stare at it.\n“…Are you intending to keep hiding it?”\n“Ugh, I think it’s a pity to show you to others, Mahiru…”\n“…Do you not want to look, Amane-kun?”\n“Well I do, but if I look, I’ll die.”\n“Why will you…?”\nMahiru appeared dumbfounded. She probably would not understand this feeling.\nOf course, as a boy, Amane had his own desire to look, but he did not want to end up kneeling on the ground. Otherwise, he would be socially dead, and mentally.\n“…But Mahiru, you’re almost dead seeing me half-naked.”\n“Th-that…”\n“Anyway, I thought you can’t handle other guys who are half naked, but you’re looking at them properly.”\nAmane assumed that given Mahiru’s innocence, she would be flustered to see other males in swimsuit. It seemed that she was only embarrassed by Amane’s words, and not his appearance.\nOnce he pointed this out, Mahiru’s shoulders shivered and shriveled.\n“…Erm, I have no interest in anyone other than you, Amane-kun…so I did not look at them.”\n“O-okay…”\n“…Actually, my heart is beating fast…but I am enduring this to make your heart jump.”\nMahiru put her hands on Amane’s flat chest, and felt his heartbeat. “It is pounding wildly.” She giggled shyly. Amane resisted the urge to yep, and nibbled at her cheek.\nShe blinked, looking stunned, and Amane gently poked the exposed skin showing through the half zipped rashguard, where the heart was.\nOnce he did, he felt a heartbeat, and a soft sensation.\n“…Can we stop now if you don’t want to be teased after we go home, you little devil?”\nI’ll make you suffer lots if you tempt me too much,\nonce Mahiru heard Amane’s persuasion, her face practically steamed, and she hastily pulled awya from him.\nHer eyes swam about as she probably imagined the sight of him teasing her, and she looked completely bewildered.\nIt appeared she still wanted to hold hands however, and touched the fingertips of Amane, whose heartbeat she felt.\n“…Amane-kun, you lecher.”\n“You’re the one tempting me, Mahiru. You said I can enjoy this.”\n“I-I did.”\n“Look, please let me take it step by step. I don’t want to do anything impulsive. I want to treasure you.”\nThey merely kissed the cheek, and could not simply skip the many steps towards adulthood. Amane might say that he disliked that, for he would simply be gunning for her body.\nThe moment Mahiru heard that he wanted to treasure her, her eyes fluttered and dampened. She then buried her face into his chest, and hugged.\n“Oy.”\n“…This kindness of yours is really what I love about you, Amane-kun.”\nAnd due to her blissful smile, Amane gulped down many things that were rising up, and patted her head.",

      "content": "Amane calmed himself down in many ways, and stepped into the pool along with Mahiru.\nThe pool was at Amane’s waist height, given that he was already an adult physically. It reached Mahiru’s chest however, and she looked up at Amane, looking somewhat uneasy.\n“…Relax Mahiru. You won’t drown.”\n“Amane-kun, 30 centimeters of water depth is sufficient to drown someone.”\n“Say…I won’t let you drown. Even if you’re drowning, I’ll just do CPR on you.”\nAmane joked to cheer Mahiru on, but she clung onto his elbow, and looked up at him.\nHer eyes showed hint of a pout, and yet seemed expectant.\n“…So there will not be one if I do not drown?”\nAmane stared at Mahiru once he heard that slight disappointment.\nHer lips curled into a lump, and she clearly looked displeased…while seemingly begging and fawning. Perhaps Amane was overthinking it.\nThe faint red lips remained glossy even without lip gloss, and Amane unwittingly gulped. Despite that, he could not lose his sanity here and bite those sweet lips. He averted his eyes.\n“…I-I think we can wait…erm, not here.”\n“I-I am not saying that we have to do it now. But, erm…I thought you would not want to, Amane-kun.”\n“W-why wouldn’t I!? I always wanted to do this!”\nThere was no male who would not want to kiss the girl they liked. Even Amane, who had relatively little desire, wanted to fully touch Mahiru and kiss her as much as he wanted.\nOf course, he felt such things should go in phases. If he imposed his desires upon her, she would surely shun him. Thus, he endured. It was not because he did not want to do so.\nAfter Amane denied so adamantly, Mahiru’s face turned beetroot. She then pressed her forehead onto his elbow, shielding her face.\nOnce he saw her ears redden, Amane realized what he had just said, and he too blushed.\n“…N-no…”\n“…Is that not it?”\n“Well, I can’t say it’s not, but…erm, I’ll find it unbearable if this happens. Please wait just a little longer.”\nAmane was chided by Itsuki for being a late bloomer, and he could not deny it at this point.\nFrom Mahiru’s viewpoint, Amane might appear to dither too much. He treasured her too dearly, and progressed so little, so she had been waiting.\n…Is Mahiru hoping for us to continue?\nDoes she want to do more lover things?\nHe looked down at Mahiru to be sure, and found her blushing, covering half her face as she looked up towards him.\n“…Please do as you wish, Amane-kun. Chitose-san said that it is bad to have you endure too long…so please do so in moderation…”\n“CHITOSSEEEEEEEE!!!”\n“Well, Chitose-san is the senior in boy-girl relationships…”\n“She told you to do unnecessary stuff, right!? L-listen up Mahiru, just go at our own pace. I never thought about forcing the issue early, and…if we hurry too much, you probably won’t be able to take it.”\nMahiru probably hoped for some progress, but if they were too anxious, she might reach her limit. Amane thus felt it was not a problem if they too her time.\nIf Amane could not control his sanity, he did not know what he would do, so he hoped to slowly progress on.\nOnce he said so with a serious look, Mahiru lowered her eyelids bashfully, and bumped her forehead into Amane’s elbow.\n“Ye-yes. Erm…le-let us go swimming.”\n“Y-yeah…”\n“…I have never been to such a place. Please teach me everything, Amane-kun.”\nI do not really go out with others after all.\nShe whispered once again. Thus, Amane held her hand, and waded through the shallow pool.\nGiven her family circumstances, nobody brought her to a leisure facility. And having realized this, he felt a strange sense of sadness, but such fun was something for her to slowly experience.\n“Let’s give you all the first experiences you want this summer, Mahiru.”\n“…I-it is embarrassing to hear you say this…but, yes.”\nThe blushing Mahiru smiled happily, and so did Amane, who held her hand and led her to somewhere with fewer people.",

      "content": "Though she initially worried about drowning, Mahiru seemed to not car about it as she played in the pool, probably because she was with Amane.\nAmane rented a float ring from the nearby customer center, and handed it to Mahiru, who pouted and said “It feels like you are taking me for a child…” Safety first though, so she slipped her body through it.\nThe strength was sapped from her as she floated on the water, looking up at Amane with a relaxed face.\nAmane waited by her side for the time being, wanting to observe her. Given this situation, they should be fine swimming.\n“It feels comfortable.”\nShe smiled next to him, and floated about in the ring. “Yeah.” Amane replied as he stayed by the poolside.\nHe liked to swim, but he did not really like to play by the waterside, so he was fine just lazing around like this. If Chitose and Itsuki were around, they probably would want to play beach volleyball or the water slide.\nIt was nothing bad per se, but Amane preferred a peaceful time like this.\n“Well, you probably won’t drown now. Have fun.”\n“…I am embarrassed about having to use a float ring at this age.”\n“Women use them too. See, there’s another one on a float ring too.”\nAmane pointed at a lady in swimsuit, floating around while put through the float ring.\nBut adults would use a float ring for leisurely purposes, rather than to assist in swimming.\nMahiru, who had the float ring on, looked over at where Amane pointed, hurried back to the surface, and sat on it.\nOnce she saw that the ring held her up, she blinked, and smiled elatedly. It appeared she liked it like this.\nThe milky white ankles beneath Amane’s rashguard were exposed as they kicked up water.\nHer legs were fine and slender, and appropriately soft. While Amane was entralled by them, Mahiru splashed water on him.\nWater was dripping from Amane’s chine as he looked towards Mahiru, and found her showing a happy, carefree smile.\nOne had to wonder if she knew where he was looking, or just wanted to splash water on him…once Amane counterattacked lightly, her smile brightened.\n“You are good. Ehhh!”\nOr perhaps she just wanted him to pay attention to her.\nMahiru splashed water on Amane, who smiled as he counterattacked.\nDespite that, Mahiru could not move as she was seated on the float ring, so Amane attacked gently to not cause her trouble.\nHe gently poured some water onto her tummy using his palm, and splashed some water back. It appeared she went easy on him too, and only splashed at his chest.\nAmane was getting used to the water temperature, but he narrowed his eyes as it was cold. He then sprayed at Mahiru again.\nMahiru might topple over if they went overboard, so he went easy on her. She splattered the water surface excitedly with her legs.\nRight when Mahiru did so, she lost her balance.\n“Say, you.”\nIt would be bad if the float ring toppled as well, so Amane held up Mahiru and had her lean onto him. She then clung firmly onto him.\nIt appeared she was terrified since she nearly fell into the water.\n“Obviously you’ll fall over if you overdo it.”\n“Uu…I am sorry.”\n“Good thing I’m around.”\n“…I would not be so excited if I were not with you, Amane-kun.”\nOnce he heard this murmur, Amane stared at Mahiru.\nShe wrapped her arms around his back, her face still buried on his chest as she continued.\n“…Everything I see is dazzling because I am with you, Amane-kun. I am so happy because I am with you…and I feel that you will surely save me.”\n“…Man, I’m bothered too, when you’re so adorable saying this.”\nMahiru’s murmur clearly appealed to Amane’s likes, and his face naturally blushed.\nHe wanted to murmur and ask why Mahiru was so cute.\n…She really likes me.\nOf course, he knew that very well, but once he felt such goodwill from her, his chest heated up, and was overflowing with love.\nIf they were at home, he would have patted her head and not let go. it was best not to go overboard at this public place however.\nThus, Amane embraced Mahiru and muttered, “…I’ll dote on you more when we get back.” and let her go. Mahiru’s face was then red like a tomato even though she was in the water.\n“…I do wish for this.”\nHowever, Amane was sunk once he heard that murmur.",

As expected, Mahiru was being courted.\nThey probably would not drag her away as they were in the open, but Amane was miffed as her boyfriend.\nMahiru was clearly showing her annoyance. It appeared she was not showing the angelic smile in the face of these males she did not know.\nThat expressionless look, coupled with the rashguard, showed no openings, and Amane sighed at that.\n…You guys can’t get girls because you don’t know how disturbed she is now.\nBy the way, according to Itsuki, “Those guys who flirt with girls while ignoring their reactions and try to impose themselves aren’t popular at all, and it’s just awkward.” Amane too had the urge to agree.\nIn any case, Amane was wearing a male rashguard, which they somehow missed out, or perhaps they lacked understanding.\nMahiru was sitting on the bench, where they agreed to meet. She could not flee from them, for she could not move until Amane returned.\nHe decided to apologize to her with a ‘sorry to keep you waiting’, and hurried towards Mahiru.\n“Kept you waiting.”\nWith drinks in hands, he spoke to Mahiru, who was waiting on the bench, and she immediately looked overjoyed. The pursuers truly were causing her much trouble.\nThey were stunned to see her become a different person altogether, as though ambushed, and looked towards Amane.\nOnce they saw his appearance, they showed an inexplicable sense of superiority. Perhaps it was because Amane was not dressed up nicely.\nAfter all, there was no way he could show up with waxed hair. He did iron his hair somewhat, but it did not look as impressive as when he waxed it.\n“Sorry, I’m with her. Please don’t invite her.”\nAmane did not mind the stares, for he was used to being humiliated and looked down. Instead, he showed a smile to strangers, and their smiles got heinous.\n“With you? You serious? You think you match her?”\n“Someone gloomy like you can actually bring her…hey.”\nSorry for being such a gloomy guy,\nhe thought. It was a fact that his appearance did not stand out, and he did not want to refute this.\nHowever, it was them who were not a match for her. Mahiru had a innocent, elegance, delicate appearance. Those frivolous males who would cast their nets elsewhere after wooing girls could not possibly be a match for her.\nAmane did not want trouble, and wondered if he should refute while trying not to anger them. At this moment, Mahiru giggled.\nHe abruptly looked towards her, and found her covering her mouth gracefully.\n“If we are to ask whether he is cheerful or gloomy, I will say he is more on the gloomy side.”\n“You’re laughing…?”\n“I know he is not cheerful, because he is a calm, poised person.”\nAmane did not know what Mahiru was going to say, so he watched her silently. Then, she looked at them for the first time.\nThere was no goodwill, merely a frosty feeling.\n…Is she angry?\nMahiru hated it when Amane was belittled, and obviously had no feelings for these men. She seemed to have disdain for them.\n“But assuming that he is gloomy, is there a problem?”\nMahiru did not sound angry when she said that.\nHowever, she sounded as though there was not a problem, and the males wooing her were left speechless.\n“I like him, so it does not matter whether he is gloomy or cheerful. I like his personality, appearance and temperament, all together, and his nature is just trivial.”\nMahiru said adamantly, and turned towards Amane, and smiled.\nHis heart felt hot once he saw this endearing smile of goodwill that would never be shown to them. He felt gaudy as he never expected Mahiru to profess her love for him so openly, but more importantly, his heart was elated.\n“It will be great if you can encounter an outstanding lady who thinks so in future, big brothers.”\nShe summarized, and showed not the smile of honey and chocolate that was melted and mixed together, but the Angelic smile shown to complete strangers. They could only stare blankly at Mahiru.\nTheir faces were red, probably because Mahiru’s smile was too dazzling.\n“Ah, no, erm…”\n“Say, big brothers, over there.”\nWhile they stammered and tried to reach out towards Mahiru, Amane nonchalantly waved their hands off, and pointed elsewhere.\nThey looked over at where Amane was pointing, the observation deck, where a man was watching them.\nThe safety facilities at this pool were well placed, with lifeguards watching every corner. Their main duty was to remind people not to fool around by the waterside, to prevent accidents, but of course, they would keep an eye out for suspicious people.\nThe lifeguard noticed them ever since Mahiru was disturbed, and often cast a few glances over.\nOnce they noticed him staring at them, they gave awkward looks, and hastily left.\nThey dared to speak to an unattainable flower who clearly brought her boyfriend over, yet were so timid about this. It was no wonder then that Amane laughed out liud.\nThe two of them were finally left alone, and Amane sat next to Mahiru.\n“Sorry I’m late.”\nFirst, he had to apologize.\nAfter all, Mahiru was approached because Amane left her alone, which gave her an unpleasant mood.\n“I am fine. It was packed over there, no? This happens often when i am alone.”\n“…You say that, but it’s my mistake to leave you alone. I guess you’re scared.”\n“I am not since they are able to communicate properly.”\nActually, I think those guys are just worried about how others will look at them.\nThe conversation might have lasted a little longer if not for the lifeguard. Amane intended to drag Mahiru by the hand and leave if it got too troublesome, but since they left first, he had nothing to complain about.\nHe handed her the orange juice she wanted, and sipped the lemon-lime soda he ordered through the straw.\n“…You’re not scared?”\n“Rather than that, I feel that my good mood is ruined.”\n“Sorry, please don’t worry about that.”\n“It is not your fault, Amane-kun…of course, please allow me to have a sip of yours.”\nThat makes us even\n, Mahiru pointed at Amane’s lemon-lime soda, and smiled impishly.\nI got to hand it to you,\nAmane wrly noted, and handed the cup to her.\nIt was obvious Mahiru made such a joke so that Amane would not feel too guilty, and he thoroughly felt how sorry he was, along with her graciousness.\nShe did not ask anything else regarding that incident, received the soda, and took a sip…and she frowned suddenly, her eyes filled with some tears.\nThe carbonic acid was a little shocking, but should not be enough for her to overreact. Amane could drink it normally, but not Mahiru, it seemed.\n“Ah, does it taste weird?”\n“…No, I hardly drink carbonated beverages…it is so stinging.”\nMahiru’s eyes were a little moist, probably because it was too stimulating to the tongue. Usually, she would drink water, tea, coffee, or at most, squeezed fruit juice. Amane had never seen her drink carbonated beverages.\nShe was not that terrified of spicy food, but it seemed she could not take such agitation.\n“I don’t think someone who never drank any carbonated drinks should drink something this rough…why are you drinking this?”\nYou should have expected this,\nhe said as he snatched the soda from her, patting her head. Her eyes, moist from the agitation, looked up at him.\n“…I want to taste it along with you, Amane-kun.”\nOnce he heard this little mutter, Amane nearly dropped the soda, but barely managed to prevent the tragedy.\n…My girlfriend’s unbelievably cute.\nThe word ‘unbelievably’ might sound dismissive, but it was actually rather high praise. Amane found it unbearable.\nHer expression and gestures were already adorable, and she just said she wanted to share something. Obviously Amane had the urge to yell.\nIn any case, as Mahiru was too adorable, Amane dared not look at her face directly, and merely held her hand, turning his face elsewhere. She then latched onto his elbow, and leaned on him.\n“…I want some orange juice too.”\n“Fufu, sure.”\nAmane looked elsewhere as he rested his elbow on the bench railing, and did not look at the giggling Mahiru.\nAnd because of that that, he never noticed them approaching.\n“Yo, the cute Missy and the herbivore bro there, how about you play with us?”\nThey heard a familiar frivolous voice, which they did not expect at this place.",

      "content": "Amane looked towards the voice, and found the faces he expected.\nOne of them was a frivolous handsome chap, and the other was a pretty tomboy. They were the faces he usually spotted at school.\n“Why are you here, Itsuki?”\n“No, I wasn’t stalking you. It’s really a coincidence. I’m not that curious.”\nItsuki denied it with a serious look. That truly might be the case.\nTruth be told, given their personalities, if they were really stalking, they would have helped her the moment Mahiru was wooed. Given the timing, it appeared they found Amane and Mahiru after the latter were reunited.\nChitose’s expression too showed that they did not mean it.\n“Well, we heard that you two would go to the pool this week, but we didn’t expect to meet on the same day at such an open place. Sorry to disturb this world of your own~”\n“…I say.”\nSince it was a coincidence that they met, Amane had no intention to grumble, but when Chitose gave a leery ribbing at the very end, he glared at her.\nDespite that, since she was wearing a swimsuit, it would be rude to look at her skin. He merely stared at her face instead.\nShe was wearing an orange separate swimsuit, and might have noticed Amane’s stare as she giggled. “Yaa, you perv~” she fidgeted about.\nShe knew that Amane was not looking at her body, but she still fooled around. Amane gave a long sigh and gave Itsuki a look that basically complained “Deal with her already”. He then got a reply that went “she’s really energetic in the summer”. It seemed he had no intention of stopping her.\n“Goodness me.” Amane looked dumbfounded, and turned towards Mahiru. She had zipped up the rashguard to cover herself from the flirting men, but it seemed that zipping to the neck left he really hot.\nShe zipped down to the chest, letting air in, and Chitose blinked away.\n“Hm? Mahirun?”\n“What is it?”\n“…Eh? Are you wearing that swimsuit?”\n“That swimsuit?”\n“Hm, isn’t there a black string ouuo”\nChitose’s voice tailed off vaguely as Mahiru had covered her mouth.\nMahiru straightened her back, reached her hands towards Chitose, and froze, perhaps having noticed Amane’s stare.\n“…Nothing at all.”\nShe shook her head, her face was flushed.\n“So there’s another one.”\n“Ah, no, e-erm…it is embarrassing to wear that in front of everyone.”\n“Well, there’s a chance you’ll end up naked. So you’re going to wear that when alone with Amane? How cuteeemmmmmmm”\n“Chitose-san, please be quiet.”\n“Okay~”\nAgain Chitose’s mouth was muffled by Mahiru, and she did not seem apologetic.\nAmane was shocked that Mahiru would actually purchase a swimsuit that would be embarrassing to her if she wore it in front of everyone, but once he remembered that she said she would wear it when the two of them were alone, his heartbeat ran wild from the boldness she showed.\n“…Is it that dangerous?”\n“Dangerous? Actually, given Mahirun’s nice body, I think it might look like there’s too little fabric on her.”\n“Chitose-san.”\n“But I think Mahirun might really get angry if I continue. You should see it for yourself, Amane~”\n“I-I will not show him!”\nMahiru was red like a ripe apple as she refuted this. He felt some pity, but sensed that it was to be expected.\nIf Mahiru really disliked it, Amane obviously would not say that he wanted her to wear it. It would be a lie to say that he did not want to see his girlfriend like that.\nChitose’s tone seemed to infer that it was not something that bared that much, but could emphasize Mahiru’s fine curves.\nAlready, Amane was having issues looking at Mahiru directly. If that swimsuit actually revealed more, he was actually relieved that Mahiru refused to wear it.\nNevertheless as a man, Amane really wanted to see it.\nPerhaps there was a look of pity on Amane’s face, for Chitose leered away once she saw that, and Mahiru glanced at him discreetly.\n“You’re not going to show it to him?”\n“…We can negotiate.”\nMahiru whispered back, put on the rashguard hood, and lowered her head to avoid Amane and Chitose’s gazes.\nEven though it was not shown, one could imagine her face seemingly scalded.\n“…Chitose, don’t tease her too much. You don’t have to worry about me too much, Mahiru.”\n“But Mahirun’s cute though.”\n“Isn’t that a given?”\n“Ohhh, you’re a natural…”\nSince Mahiru had always been cute, Amane naturally replied so, and Chitose gave him a dumbfounded look.\nAmane did confess that Mahiru was cute, long before they were dating, so there should be nothing to be surprised about. It seemed both Itsuki and Chitose were both taken aback though, for their eyes widened greatly.\n“Man, aren’t you doting on your girlfriend, Amane…and you said that you wouldn’t have a lover, or talk about romance or anything…”\n“Shut up.”\n“Well~ this is what they say about love changing people~”\n“You looking down on me? Everyone agrees that Mahiru’s cute, so it’s obvious that I think my girlfriend’s cute, right? Don’t you always boast about how Chitose’s cute, Itsuki?”\nEver since Amane got to know Itsuki and had Chitose introduced to him, he had to listen to Itsuki brag about his love life. He did not think he was any better at bragging than Itsuki.\nThis isn’t weird or anything,\nso he thought, and gave them a dumbfounded look. They sighed, and shrugged.\nHe was incensed by their attitude as he glared at them, and Itsuki merely gave a wry smile.\n“But I think you better stop.”\n“Why?”\n“Looks like Shiina-san’s in trouble.”\nAmane turned to Mahiru, wondering why she was mentioned, and found that she was grabbing the hood, covering herself as she shivered. It appeared she was really embarrassed.\nIt appeared she was embarrassed to be praised in front of anyone. Amane panicked, and she lifted her head slightly towards him; it appeared there were tears coming out.\n“…This is a virtue and a flaw of yours, Amane-kun.”\nShe murmured, and covered herself within the hood again. Amane was at a loss of what to do, and could only wait until Mahiru recovered from her embarrassment.",

      "content": "Once Mahiru’s shame faded away, the four of them began to play together. The good thing about four of them being together was that there would be fewer chances for other males to try and woo them.\nWith four of them together, none of them would end up alone, and Amane made sure that would not happen.\nFurthermore, Itsuki looked the frivolous handsome guy with a friendly vibe, an ideal guy with a sunny disposition. The males trying to woo the girls would have second thoughts.\nNevertheless, Mahiru and Chitose stood out in appearance, and there were a few stares at them.\n“Mahirun Mahirun, take this.”\n“Kyaa…goodness, Chitose-san.”\nMahiru silently pressured them to move towards the shallow pool, so they went there to play. Amane was seated by the poolside, watching Mahiru and Chitose splashing water at each other happily.\nHe felt relieved seeing those two on such good terms, having fun.\nThey were exquisite beauties, thought of varying types, and were soothing to the eyes.\n“Ah, intimacy between girls is great.”\nItsuki smiled as he sat next to Amane, watching the two girls.\n“You sound like an old man.”\n“How rude. You’re giving lewd looks at those two, right?”\n“That’s an exaggeration.”\n“But you feel very relieved seeing them, right, you silent pervert?”\n“Right back at you.”\n“I’m not keeping it to myself.”\nThat won’t do either\n, Amane retorted, and stared blankly at Mahiru, who was smiling happily after Chitose splashed water on her.\n“So, why do you look so listless?”\nItsuki stopped smiling and asked Amane, leaning a little forward as he looked towards the latter’s face.\n“Ah, well, I think Mahiru’s cuter than before.”\n“You’re starting to fall deeper in love.”\n“Not that, I just think that she likes to smile more often. Back then, she didn’t really smile.”\n“We never saw that, but was she that aloof back then?”\n“Yeah, haughty and vicious, distrusting of others…it’s great that she’s smiling like that now.”\nMahiru’s smile was a lot more earnest compared to when they first met.\nShe was showing such honesty, along with a carefree smile, and that could not have been imagined compared to her old uppity self with a slightly venomous tongue.\nAmane proudly assumed that Mahiru’s change was because she was with him, but it was also partially due to Chitose. There were some things those of the same gender could only discuss, and understand.\nHe too was happy to see her so happy.\n“I feel the same about Shiina-san changing. She felt like an idol back then, unapproachable. Right now, she’s just heads over heels for you, Amane, and that’s really adorable.”\n“Heads over heels…say.”\n“No well, her goodwill’s so earnest and easy to understand. It’s already obvious that she treats you very different.”\n“…Just to ask, did you think that Mahiru already liked me way back then, Itsuki…”\n“She liked you so much that I didn’t know why you’re so hesitant.”\n“Seriously?”\nAmane had a vague feeling that Mahiru liked him before they dated, but it seemed she liked him for a much longer time than he expected. Clearly it was the case, actually.\n“I think she started to change a little when she trusted you and had interest in you.”\n“…Really?”\n“And I guess it’s because Chii’s around. For good or bad, she’s always easily excited and approaching, so she’s dragging Shiina-san along.”\n“Please control her already, boyfriend-san.”\n“No no no, Chii won’t prod into the places she shouldn’t be going into. And look, Shiina-san’s very happy.”\nAmane looked towards where Itsuki pointed once again, and found Mahiru looking embarrassed as Chitose clung onto her happily, but still accepting.\nOne could see how much Mahiru trusted Chitose, and her face was really gentle. It was really great that she had more people she could trust.\nOf course, Amane would hope that he himself was the one she trusted most.\n“Don’t worry.” Itsuki slapped Amane in the back. Amane could only smile wryly, and “Oy, the young men spacing out there, join us~” Chitose, still clinging onto Mahiru, waved away.\nMahiru too waved, seemingly hoping for Amane to go over.\n“Since the cute girls are calling for us, we have to go over.”\nItsuki dipped into the pool, which reached his waist. Amane saw him grin away while moving towards the duo, and smiled too as he went towards Mahiru.",

      "content": "“Fuiii, fun fun~!”\nEven for high school students, it was tiring playing for several hours. The four of them sat on the bench to rest.\nThey rented a ball for volleyball, and under Chitose’s vigorous pressing, Mahiru was dragged along to a small water slide experience. Nevertheless, it might be really exciting to her.\nShe looked refreshed as she sat next to Amane, but was leaning onto him gently, probably due to fatigue.\n“I’m so happy. It’s been a while since I had this much fun.”\n“Yeah. I haven’t exercised this much in a long time.”\n“You didn’t really show up during the sports festival. Did a good workout this time.”\nAmane was no slouch at athletics to begin with, but he could not consider himself adept, and would never have exercised as he just down. He would participate in the gym classes fully, but was never too enthusiastic.\n“Amane started swimming seriously midway through.”\n“Well a pool’s a place for swimming…it’s nice to do so once in a while.”\n“Mahirun was looking at you back then.”\n“Eh, s-sorry Mahiru.”\nMahiru and Chitose had much fun, so Amane went for a simple swim, but perhaps Mahiru was waiting for him back then.\nHowever, she hastily shook her head.\n“Th-this is not what I mean…it is good.”\nAfter some thought, Amane realized what she meant by good.\nMahiru could not swim, and was envious of Amane, who could.\nHowever, he dared not mention to Chitose and Itsuki that Mahiru could not swim, and merely smiled wryly as he patted her head.\nIf they had another chance, they probably could practice a little.\n“Let’s go to a pool next time.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Hm, what~? You want to see Mahirun’s black bikini?”\n“Are you an idiot. I don’t want to show that to anyone else.”\n“So you obviously want to see it when you’re alone.”\n“That’s…a privilege as a boyfriend.”\nAmane had no thoughts of showing Mahiru’s black bikini to anyone else. Even at this point, she was hidden under his rashguard, and he wanted her to wear swimming shorts.\n“Hear that Mahirun? You’re not showing it to your boyfriend?”\n“As I said, we can negotiate.”\nAmane smiled at Mahiru, who turned her head aside, and again patted her head gently.\nOnce they left the leisure facility together, Amane’s group arrived at a family restaurant.\nIt was before 6pm, and a little early for dinner. They expended lots of energy playing and swimming however, and they were hungry. Perhaps it was the right time.\nMahiru never had the chance to visit a family restaurant, and looked a little excited. That adorable sight had Amane smiling, but he sheathed that smile away when Chitose and Itsuki tapped him lightly where Mahiru could not see.\n“But speaking of which, you’re going to Amane’s hometown for the summer right, Mahirun?”\nChitose asked as she sliced the hamburger steak she orderde.\nMahiru probably did mention that she was going to Amane’s hometown with him when she arranged plans wit Chitose. Chitose in turn leered away.\n“It feels like erm, meeting the parents.”\n“Sorry to disappoint you, but Mahiru already met my parents.”\n“I see~…I guess it’s like a wife following her husband back to the hometown.”\n“Whatever.”\nWhat are you saying now. We aren’t engaged, let alone married.\nSo he thought, but typically speaking, no high school couple would actually meet each other’s parents, and Amane could not deny it completely.\nLeaving her aside, Amane ate the fried egg roll in his Japanese set meal. Chitose gave a look of pity as she never got to tease him.\nHe ignored her as he chewed at the egg roll, but did not find it addictive. It tasted very normal unlike Mahiru’s, and not really delicious.\nI guess Mahiru’s cooking is the best\n, he thought to himself, looked over at Mahiru, and found her slightly bashful.\nPerhaps it was the ‘wife’ part that embarrassed her.\n“Shiina-san, you’re going to Amane’s hometown? …I guess Shihoko-san will be happy.”\n“Akazawa-san, you know Shihoko-san?”\n“No, I just heard of her…and understood her the moment Amane described her.”\n“My mom has quite the personality…and you probably think she resembles someone.”\nIt appeared that Itsuki immediately deduced that Shihoko was like Chitose. Surely Chitose and Shihoko would get along really well if they met.\n“Hm, what what~”\n“Well, we’re saying you’re cute, Chii.”\nItsuki nonchalantly dodged the issue and praised her. “Ikkun, serious~” Chitose looked completely satisfied.\n“Ah right, Amane, hurry up and tell me when you’re going back. I want to go out and play with Mahirun before you two leave.”\n“Sure sure sure. Probably in August. Have fun then…also, do your assignments.”\n“Why are you sounding like my mom~!?”\n“Isn’t it because you complained last year, “I can’t finish my assignments~!”…”\nChitose probably was the type to dither her assignments until the last moment, and last summer, she only began in a panic when the vacation was ending.\nAmane was already done with his assignments, and so was Mahiru. They would continue with their revision.\n“I don’t wanna do it though…oh yeah, I can get the Angel to teach me.”\n“I may, but I will not if you keep calling me Angel.”\n“How strict. I like the cold hearted Mahirun though.”\nMahiru and Chitose were able to converse easily, and Amane felt some relief as he ate his food before it got cold.\nHe did not find outside food delicious, for he probably was completely used to Mahiru’s cooking.\n“Mahirun, I want some fried egg rolls tomorrow.”\nAmane muttered to Mahiru, who was next to him, and she looked towards the tray before him.\n“Are you not eating it?”\n“This is no good. Something’s missing. Yours is the best.”\n“Fufu, I really have to hand it to you. I shall make breakfast and wake you up then.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was summer vacation, and Amane could not wake up early, so it was great that Mahiru would wake him up.\nIt would be bad for his heart to see Mahiru’s face immediately after waking up, but it surely was the best alarm clock.\nAmane was excited, for he discreet looked forward to the next day’s breakfast. Itsuki stared at him dumbfoundedly.\n“A couple already staying together…”\n“Shut up.”\nHalf-staying together,\nhe did not comment as he quietly drank the somewhat cooled miso soup.",

      "content": "“Have you locked the door and windows?”\n“I did that while you’re looking, right?”\nAmane heard Mahiru remind like a teacher at his own corridor, and smiled wryly.\nMahiru usually would not talk this much, but she probably reminded him out of worry, since they would not be home for a long time.\nThey would visit Amane’s hometown for two weeks from so, starting from this day. Mahiru was worried if anything would happen during this period.\n“I did, but I am asking just in case.”\n“Right right right. You didn’t forget anything, right?”\n“No. I have delivered the necessary luggage, and I did check through my handheld items this morning. I have locked my door and windows, and checked through everything from your trash to the freezer. Please do not worry.”\n“Thank you for going all out with this.”\nIt was almost impossible to carry two weeks worth of luggage over, so they had them delivered by courier, and did not omit anything. Mahiru did drop by to clear Amane’s house, and the latter really could not lift his head towards her.\nFeeling grateful that she would notice such minor details, he took Mahiru’s bag off her hands, and held her palm.\nShe blinked, “This is what I like about you.” and said bashfully, holding his hand.\nAmane’s hometown was an hour’s ride on the Shinkansen.\nThey sat on the seats they booked, chatted happily as they enjoyed the scenery, and soon after, the Shinkansen arrived at its destination.\nIt had merely been a year since he last saw the scenery that was the train station, but he felt strangely nostalgic. At the same time, he held Mahiru’s hand, and went to the gathering spot they agreed of.\n“So this is your hometown, Amane-kun.”\n“Yeah. We need to take another train ride though, or a car. I’m still not home yet.”\nThe Shinkansen was merely a major station for them to alight at. In fact, the journey would require a little more time.\nShihoko, who had time, would be the one to welcome Amane back, so he accepted her goodwill. One could say that she had a simple reason of wanting to meet Mahiru as soon as possible though.\nHe went over to the big pillar by the ticket gantry, where most people would gather, and spotted his mother far away.\nIt was still embarrassing for them to hold hands in front of his mother, so he let go of her hand. Mahiru seemed a little disappointed, and so he hastily patted her back.\nI haven’t told them we’re dating yet. Please forgive me.\nIt was already a habit for them to hold hands, and they would always unwittingly do so. He had to take note of this at his old home.\nMahiru seemed a little reluctant, but appeared to understand once she saw Shihoko, and regained her usual expression.\nShihoko too appeared to have noticed them; she made a cheerful, likable smile as she approached.\n“It has been been a while.”\n“Well well, Mahiru-chan, welcome! You really came here!”\nWell, that’s mom for ya.\nAmane noted wryly, for the first thing Shihoko did was to greet Mahiru.\nMahiru was a little taken aback by Shihoko’s vigor as they had not met in a while, but she bowed her head with a graceful smile and gesture.\n“Thank you for your invitation. It is rare to have a family reunion, and I am intruding…”\n“No no no it’s fine, we’re the ones who want to see you, Mahiru-chan! We actually wanted to meet you during spring break, but we couldn’t arrange for time…ah, what’s with you, Amane?”\n“You’re not going to say a few words to your son?”\n“Ohh, welcome back Amane. Thank you for bringing Mahiru-chan along yes.”\n“Yes yes.”\nAmane was not angry as he knew she was joking, but as he had replied curtly, Shihoko jabbed at him, saying “What are you pouting about. Of course I’m glad to see you back, Amane?”\nThe smirk left him very frustrated, but it was to be expected.\nHe waved her hand off, and surveyed his surroundings.\nHe heard that Shihoko would welcome him back, but surprisingly, Shuuto was not present. Shuuto too should have taken leave, but Amane assumed his parents would show up.\n“Where’s dad?”\n“Shuuto-san’s making lunch now~”\n“I see.”\nThat made sense.\nShuuto liked to cook and serve others, so he probably was preparing various things at home.\n“That’s great Mahiru. Dad’s cooking is delicious.”\nSo he said, but he did not say,\nit is not better than yours though.\nMahiru too showed a faint smile.\n“I see. I am looking forward to it.”\n“Heh heh. Look forward to our family dishes then.”\n“Mom, you should be the one cooking…even though dad’s better.”\n“Hey, that’s unnecessary.”\nShe puffed her cheeks that appeared unbefitting her age. It was true however that Shuuto’s cooking was better.\nShihokowould cook on the weekdays, and Shuuto would cook on the weekend. Shihoko was the more experienced, but Shuuto was still better in skill.\nNot that hers was bad, but Amane felt Shuuto’s was better due to flavoring. of course, he was grateful for both of them since there was someone cooking at lest.\n“Well, it’s not the first time you’re being dishonest Amane. Let’s go home now. We should be able to arrive at noon if we leave. The car’s here. Let’s go.”\nNo point talking too much in this station,\nShihoko waved and said, heading towards the exit of the station. Amane gave Mahiru a glance.\n“Let’s go then.”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru nodded a little, and Amane held her wrist.\nThey could not lock fingers, but at the very least, he could excuse himself by saying it was to prevent her from getting lost.\nMahiru widened her eyes, and showed a happy yet somewhat bashful smile as she leaned towards him. Amane too was a little embarrassed as he slowly followed Shihoko.",

      "content": "The car moved for 30 minutes, but to Amane and the others, it felt like 2 hours passed before they arrived at the Fujimiyas’ residence.\nBefore their eyes was a relatively large house, for it had a library, a spacious kitchen, and and empty room. Mahiru’s eyes were widened, for it seemed bigger than she imagined.\n“It is big.”\n“Ah thank you, our house is rather big. Actually, we have so many rooms because we hope for a daughter, but things don’t go as planned…you can come over though, Mahiru-chan?”\n“Eh, erm, about that.”\n“Mom, stop teasing Mahiru. It’ll trouble her.”\n“Oh my oh my.”\nHer cheerful smile was probably more of a leer due to Mahiru’s reaction.\nShe lowered her head bashfully, which led to Shihoko creating her own delusion. Truth be told, Amane did not want her delusion to remain as a delusion, but he definitely could not say this to Shihoko.\n“Alright, it’s hot out here. Hurry in.”\n“Yes yes, I guess it is to be expected.”\n“What do you mean, to be expected…”\nIt appeared Shihoko’s cheerful laugh was not going to stop, so Amane gave up and nudged Shihoko in the back; she unlocked the door.\nThere were footsteps inside, and it was probably Shuuto who noticed that Shihoko and company had returned.\n“Welcome back.”\nOnce they stepped through the door, as expected, Shuuto was waiting.\n“I’m back Shuuto-san. I brought Mahiru-chan along~”\n“It has been a while, Shiina-san.”\n“It has been a long time. I have been feeling.”\nIt had been half a year since Mahiru last met Shuuto, and she was still a little nervous. Shihoko was honest, friendly, or rather, clingy towards Mahiru, so there probably was no sense of distance between them. However, she did feel Shuuto was a little distant.\nOnce Shuuto noticed how Mahiru was a little tense, he showed an amicable smile.\n“You don’t have to be so terrified of this uncle.”\n“No, but…”\n“The problem is that you don’t look like an uncle.”\n“Why that’s sweet of you.”\nAmane’s father truly did not look his age.\nHe looked so young, he did not appear to be nearly 40. Truth be told, nobody would be able to guess his age on first glance, given his youthful looks.\n“It’s been a while. You look a lot better, Amane.”\n“Did I change much over the past half year?”\n“Yep. You look like a man now, filled with confidence, and dressed nicely.”\nAmane was dressed in his outdoor getup as he had to be with Mahiru, but perhaps he really did not look confident back then. He did lack confidence in the past, actually, which made it appear that he looked confident.\nHe felt a little awkward that someone noticed it. Once he clammed up, Shuuto showed a little smile.\n“Now then Shihoko-san, I’ll leave the house to you. I still have to serve.”\n“Okay, come in then. The place isn’t big, but we hope you’ll be able to enjoy something.”\n“No, that is…please pardon us.”\nMahiru dutifully bowed and removed her shoes. Amane too changed into indoor slippers.\nHe knew his house well enough, and did not need a walkaround. However, he intended to tail the females, to ensure that Shihoko would not say anything unnecessary to Mahiru.\nShihoko watched Shuuto return to the dining room, and waved at them “Over here~” as she welcomed them to the stairs.\nThe bedrooms and guest rooms were on the second floor, and Shihoko was probably helping out there.\nAmane intended to visit his own room, and opened the luggage that was delivered. Once he remembered where the guest room was, he gave an inexplicable expression.\n…The last year I was here, there’s only one room not used as a storeroom.\nThe room connected to the veranda was meant to be for the other child. His parents did not have one, and this room was not used. It was neat and renovated properly, anc could house someone.\nHis cousins would use this room whenever they visited over long vacations, though they hardly came by these days.\nAmane was not really planning anything, but his gut ached a little once he wondered whether it was fine for a girl to stay in a room he could easily pass by.\n“So Mahiru-chan, use this room.”\nAs expected, Shihoko led her to the room next to Amane, who sighed.\n“Thank you for preparing the room for me.”\n“Ah don’t worry about that. The washroom on the second level is there, and next to your room is Amane’s. The veranda is connected, sorry about that.”\nThe veranda is connected,\nMahiru blinked, and Amane averted his eyes awkwardly.\n“I’ll lock up on my side. Lock up yours.”\n“I-I am not worried about this.”\n“Oh my, are youths fine with this?”\n“You want me to commit a crime?”\n“It’s fine if she agrees though?”\n“Nope!”\nWhat a pity\n, Shihoko lamented, seemingly jokingly when she heard Amane’s reply, and chuckled.\n“I’ll go prepare lunch then. You two check your luggage. Mahiru-chan’s is in her room now.”\n“Yes, thank you very much.”\n“No biggies. See you later then.”\nShihoko smiled, and went down the stairs. Once Amane did not see her back anymore, he gave a heavy sigh.\n“Sorry, I guess this is the only empty room.”\n“N-no, I am fine with this.”\n“Well, it’s fine now that we’re dating, but it’d be bad if we weren’t. My mom probably doesn’t know…goodness.”\n“It is fine. And…since the veranda is connected, we can see the stars together.”\nOnce he saw how bashful Mahiru looked, he wondered if she was worried about being attacked at night, and gave a wry smile. At the same time, there was a rising delight in his heart, for she hoped to spend the nights with him.\n“…Yeah, we will if it’s convenient. Alright, go unpack your stuff.”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru was smiling happily, and one had to wonder if she noticed Amane hiding his embarrassment as she entered her room.\nAt this point, Amane once again realized that they would be living in the same space for two weeks. He covered his face with his hands, and entered his own room.\nShuuto cooked lunch to welcome Mahiru.\nLike Mahiru, Shuuto was capable of cooking all kinds of cuisine. He made Paella as the main dish as Shihoko wanted to have some.\nHaving recalled that they had a special pan for this, Amane had a feeling that his house truly had these cooking utensils prepared.\nOf course, Paella was not the only thing on the table. There was also Bisque and salad with lots of seafood.\nNaturally, each of these dishes were delicious, and Mahiru was really delighted with them. It seemed she too felt Shuuto’s cooking was fine.\n“Our son hasn’t troubled you, I suppose?”\nA little while after lunch, Shuuto looked towards Mahiru, and asked.\nOn a side note, Shihoko was not present as she was in charge of cleaning up after lunch. There was the sound of washing coming from the kitchen, and one could really sen that she was there.\nOnce she heard Shuuto’s question, Mahiru blinked away, and immediately shook her head to deny it.\n“No…he is no trouble.”\n“Can’t you just say that you had no choice but to take care of me?”\n“…I am really happy all this while. I never thought it would be a hassle to be with Amane-kun.”\n“I see.”\nAmane was speechless once she said so without hesitation, and unwittingly answered flatly.\n“You don’t have to be shy, Amane. It’s good to thank her more.”\n“…I’ve always been thanking her.”\n“Yes. I know.”\nIt seemed Mahiru noticed how Amane was trying to hide his embarrassment, for she gave a bell-like laugh.\nHer laugh left him all the more flustered, his lips twitching. She laughed again, and Amane was powerless.\nYou’ll pay for this later,\nso Amane said to Mahiru, but she merely showed a beaming face. It appeared those words were ineffectual against her.\nLeft at his wits end, Amane turned his head again, and Shuuto laughed.\n“You really are dishonest, Amane. This is the adorable part about you though.”\n“You’re calling a guy adorable? Are you looking down on me?”\n“But you are really adorable, Amane-kun.”\n“Mahiru, we’ll have a talk about this later.”\n“Yes, we shall talk about this later.”\nMahiru smiled as she said so, and Amane was speechless. She really was difficult to deal with on this day. Just a moment ago, he assumed she was nervous, but it seemed she had adapted well.\nPerhaps it was because she was conversing with Amane.\nShuuto looked bemused as he watched Amane and Mahiru talk, and seemingly remembered something as he blinked hard.\n“Ah yes, Shiina-san. Shall we go shopping together? Shihoko-san asked me to buy some.”\n“Why are you asking her out immediately?’\nAmane sounded displeased as Mahiru had just pulled a fast one on him, while Shuuto showed his usual smile.\n“I will not go on a mad chase like Shihoko-san, you know?”\n“I know that.”\n“Watch the house then, Amane.”\n“WHY ME!?”\n“You will be a hindrance if we are going to talk about your past.”\n“Why are you saying that I’m a hindrance!?”\n“Yes you are.”\nShuuto heartily nodded, and ignored the speechless Amane as he looked towards Mahiru.\n“Are you willing to go out with this uncle here?”\n“I do not mind if it is with you.”\n“Let’s go then. At the same time, I wish you’ll help me choose a present for Shihoko-san.”\nShuuto smiled once Mahiru agreed, and Mahiru appeared a little troubled.\n“A-a present, is it? is there an anniversary…?”\n“Dad often buys presents for mom. It’s not a special day.”\nShuuto treated women well, and was earnest to all, especially to his dear wife Shihoko. He was willing to buy a present for her, even if there was nothing to commemorate.\nAccording to him, it was usual thanks for every day, a proof of love, and that he wanted to see her happy. Back when Amane lived in this hometown, he was the one who accompanied Shuuto on such trips.\nShuuto probably invited Mahiru out for her point of view as a female. The main objective however might be to discuss about Amane.\n“…You really are like Shuuto-san, Amane.”\n“I didn’t do that much.”\n“Did you not buy dolls or cute little things for me?”\nAmane often bought things that Mahiru would like, things that would suit her, but it was because he liked them, and wanted to thank her for taking care of him every day.\nHe might be similar to Shuuto in this aspect. Perhaps he was really similar, but he did not think he did it as frequently.\n“Well, you’ve been taking care of me every day after all, Mahiru.”\n“…I am talking about this aspect, you know?”\nAmane answered, sounding like he was giving an excuse, and Mahiru giggled, sounding a little bewildered and yet delighted, impish even.\nShuuto too looked elated, and Amane stood up as he wanted to get away, escaping to Shihoko in the name of helping her.\n“Oh my, Amane, what now?”\n“…Here to help.”\n“Ah, thanks. You sure you don’t need to chat with Mahiru-chan?”\n“Mahiru’s going out with dad to buy stuff.”\nAmane had a look at the living room, and found the two of them laughing and preparing to leave.\nThey moved so quickly as Shuuto probably noticed Amane was a little pouty, and wanted to give him time to cool down. Amane was occasionally terrified at home his own father could sense the little feelings in people’s hearts.\n“Ah, they’re going shopping. I guess Shuuto-san has things to ask Mahiru. That sounds good.”\n“Ask what…?”\n“Your usual behavior, I guess? I don’t know everything about Shuuto-san after all.”\nShihoko passed the air dried Paella pan to Amane, who obediently went to slot it into the utensils cupboard.\nAt the same time, Mahiru and Shuuto had left the living room. Amane gave them a vengeful look as they left, and returned to Shihoko who was still washing her dishes, wiped them clean, and put them into the cupboard.\nAs he often did the same with Mahiru, he dared to say he was familiar with such work. However, Shihoko’s eyes widened once she saw Amane’s actions.\n“You’re skilled at this, Amane.”\n“Thanks for the compliments.”\n“I’m relieved to see that you don’t rely on Mahiru-chan for everything.”\n“What kind of scumbag of a guy do you think I am…?”\nAfter all, Amane was not that shameless to have Mahiru do everything.\nIf he did, he would first feel guilty.\nHe already had her do the heavy lifting with cooking, and should show care for her, and do whatever he could for her.\nYou don’t have to mention that\n, Amane narrowed his eyes at Shihoko, who looked impressed as she called out, “…Hey Amane.”\n“Yes?”\n“Which base have you arrived with Mahiru-chan?”\n“Pfft!?”\nAmane spat out as he never expected this question. Shihoko nonchalantly finished the washing of the dishes.\nHe instinctively grabbed the plates and dried them with a cloth, but he frowned hard, unable to hide how shaken he was.\n“What are you shaken about? It’s obvious that you two are dating. There’s no way to hide that.”\nAmane could not deny those words.\nThe vibe between Amane and Mahiru was different from Hatsumode. It was to be expected since they were dating, but Amane intended to hide this matter from his parents.\nIt was for naught however as they had seen through it.\n“…Can’t I?”\n“Of course you can. I want her as a daughter. More than glad to.”\n“…Really?”\n“I thought you two went all the way. Those loving expressions and the mood between you two seem to indicate so.”\n“Ack! That’s impossible!”\nAmane raised his eyebrows at these impossible guesses, but Shihoko showed no remorse.\n“…Mom, don’t ever mention this to Mahiru.”\n“Of course I won’t. I want a daughter though. Looking forward to it.”\nShihoko was barren due to issues with her body. Amane could understand her desire for a daughter, and could not blame her as he merely pouted instead.\n“…Don’t pressure Mahiru.”\n“I know that. That’s why you have to keep her.”\n“You think I’ll let go of a keeper?”\nIn the past, Amane was willing to leave Mahiru as long as she was happy, even if it was not him being her partner. He would no longer say these words again however.\nIt might seem petty, but one could say that his desire to treasure Mahiru and not let go had intensified. He wished for Mahiru’s happiness, so much that she would not look at any other boy as a love interest, and that she would not let go of him.\nAmane thus had no intention of letting Mahiru look away.\nOnce she heard his firm conclusion, Shihoko was momentarily stunned, and then she happily giggled away.\n“Fufu, you really are similar to Shuuto-san here. He’s the same as before.”\n“I don’t have dad’s natural talent in that.”\n“Really? Shall I ask Mahiru-chan?”\n“Hey stop it.”\nIf she were to ask Mahiru, the latter would likely reveal some behind the scenes that would leave them embarrassed. He had to stop Shihoko with all his might.\nAmane glared at Shihoko, but it appeared ineffectual as Shihoko chirped leisurely, “I’m looking forward to Mahiru-chan’s return.” Amane ended up frowning harder.",

      "content": "A few hours after Mahiru and Shuuto left home, they returned right when Shihoko was about to prepare dinner.\nAmane would be teased endlessly if he remained with Shihoko, so he went to his room, unpacked his luggage, and did some textbook questions to kill the time. It was then that Mahiru, who had just returned, looked for him.\nMost of the furniture was moved into Amane’s room, and there was nothing much left in her room. Shihoko would occasionally clean up the room to make it presentable at least. Amane naturally welcomed Mahiru in, but she looked a little restless.\nIn any case, Mahiru looked rather jittery, probably because they were alone, they were in his room, or that she had just went out with Shuuto. He put a cushion on the floor, and had her sit on it.\n“Welcome back Mahiru. You’re not tired?”\nAmane went to the kitchen to get two servings of barley tea, and put them on a folded table while asking her. She blinked away a few times, and looked relieved.\n“Yes. I have been sitting here and during the trip. I just wanted to move a little.”\n“I see…anyway, I guess since you’re panicking so much, you heard something from my dad, right?”\nMahiru averted her eyes.\nBullseye\n, it seemed. Amane sighed.\nHe did not think she was in the wrong, but he really wanted to talk about this with Shuuto. The latter would just avoid the issue or tease Amane back instead, so Amane could not say anything either.\n“Goodness, what did dad…say anyway?”\n“Nothing really interesting. He merely asked me how are you now, and how adorable you were when you were young.”\n“…What did you hear?”\nAmane had no memory of his childhood, and did not know if there was anything embarrassing about them.\nSince Shuuto went out of his way to tell Mahiru however, Amane would assume that it was something embarrassing. It might be an adorable joke to the parents, but not to Amane, who would think of it as his childhood failures.\nTell me the specifics\n, Amane narrowed his eyes at Mahiru, and she brazenly averted her eyes.\n“E-erm…I guess so?”\n“Why aren’t you looking at me?”\n“At least I know now that you are adorable, Amane-kun.”\nHe sighed once he heard this answer that was not an answer.\n“Wh-what is it?”\n“Naughty kids who don’t answer should be punished.”\nHe pulled Mahiru from next to him, and had her sit between his legs. He embraced her by the back, and tickled her tummy.\nMahiru seemed shocked by this, and fidgeted as she looked up at Amane.\n“E-erm, Amane-kun?”\n“I remember you’re ticklish, Mahiru.”\n“…Pl-please wait. We can negotiate.”\n“I wouldn’t have to do this if you fessed up.”\nAmane slid his fingers by her flank beneath the clothes, and she clearly shuddered.\nHe felt the slender body that was devoid of excess fat as he gently stroked her silky wait. Already she was panting a little.\nAs Mahiru’s reaction was too good, he started tickling her with his fingers, slowly agitating her skin.\nMahiru fidgeted while in his clutches, and he had so many bad thoughts as a result, but he could not stop at this point.\n“Fuu, w-ait…fufuf, Amane-k…”\n“But seriously, aren’t you too ticklish Mahiru?”\nAmane went easy on Mahiru, but it appeared she was very sensitive as she cupped her knees, shivering as she panted slightly.\nHe was shocked by how adorable she was, and how how stubborn.\nHe made ensure not to touch the places that would be dangerous for his sanity as he slowly tickled her. Mahiru then appeared to have enough as she suddenly turned towards Amane.\nHer face was a little red, and her eyes were damp because of the itch. He felt his heart jolt in more ways than one when she glared bak.\n“A-Amane-kun no, baka. You are cruel.”\n“This wouldn’t have happened if you revealed it earlier.”\n“I-it is nothing in particular. He mentioned how you bawled in your younger days when you crashed the bicycle into an electric pole, how you clung onto Shihoko-san and said ‘I love you mama’, and that you said that you wanted to become as suave as Shuuto-san and spiked your hair with wax.”\n“What horrible things he said!”\nShuuto mentioned all the awkward things Amane himself had forgotten, and once this little bit was revealed, he covered his face.\nAmane already had a feeling that Shuuto would talk about his childhood, but he never expected such embarrassing moments. He wanted to ask Shuuto what the latter wanted.\nHis parents might have found them to be topics worth chatting happily, but to him, it was a black history.\n“I do find it adorable though.”\n“You’re not praising me. Forget about what he said.”\n“…I will not forget about these, since you tickled me.”\nAmane felt that Mahiru would remember these incidents even if he did not tickle her. She sounded pouty however, and Amane reflected on his own excessive actions. He gently wrapped his arms around her back.\n“Okay okay, I’m sorry.”\n“…The next time you tickle me, I shall whisper to you what Shuuto-san told me.”\n“Stop with the mental attacks…I get it, I get it. Sorry.”\nAmane embraced Mahiru and coaxed her, while she obediently remained in his clutches, burying her face into his shoulder.",

      "content": "“Mahiru-chan, go take a bath.”\nAfter the dinner reunion, it was time to enter the bath. Mahiru was sitting next to Amane, watching the TV and Mahiru said to her.\n“May I do so later…”\n“You’re a guest though. Don’t be shy. If you’re not willing to do so alone, I can lend Amane to you.”\n“What nonsense are you talking about?”\nShihoko said something increasing with a smile, and Amane naturally frowned.\nLending Amane would mean having him bath together with Mahiru. Amane did not think Mahiru would agree to it. She already had issues with wearing a swimsuit, and certainly would not think about going completely naked.\nAs expected, Mahiru’s face was blushing completely.\nShe glanced aside at Amane, and blushed further than before. Surely she imagined his body, and got all the more embarrassed.\nAmane too was the same, and might be indescribably embarrassed to think more about it. Thus, he could not allow himself to think too much.\n“I-it is really too much, erm, to go naked…”\n“Oh my, do I prepare more towels?”\n“Erm, no…”\n“Dear dear dear, you don’t have to be so embarrassed though? Shuuto-san and I often bathe together.”\n“E-erm…”\n“Don’t take them seriously Mahiru. Dad and mom do often bathe together, but we don’t have to.”\nShihoko clearly suggested so as teasing.\nAmane’s parents were always lovey-dovey. They would definitely hold hands while going on, smile at each other, and when sleeping, would share the same bed.\nIn many ways, they truly loved each other. Their son might find it awkward, but they were famous locally for being such sweethearts.\nThey bathed together in the name of bonding as a couple. Shihoko suggested this so that Amane and Mahiru could get closer together, rather than teasing him outright.\nEither way, they’re being busybodies.\nIf they were to bathe together, Amane might turn the bathwater red, and was left awkward about it.\n“Oh my, young man, will this do?”\n“What do you mean, will this do? There’s no way I can do this back home.”\n“You don’t sound like you aren’t opposed to it.”\n“…I’ll have to negotiate with Mahiru.”\nAmane thoroughly realized that the ‘we shall negotiate’, which he heard Mahiru use these words days ago at the pool, was such a convenient line.\nMahiru’s eyes swam bashfully, but she might really be opposed to bathing together, and could only try to pass off this matter.\nTruth be told, Amane knew of shame even as a youth, and understood that both sides would die for personal reasons, but he really admired what his parents did. He might not actually do so though.\n“Alright, just ignore my mom and go bathe.”\n“Y-yes. I shall do so.”\n“You really are a wimp Amane. Go on now, Mahiru-chan.”\nAmane sent off Mahiru to fend off Shihoko, who might keep going forever, and returned to the living room.\nShuuto chuckled as he heard this conversation, and once he saw Amane’s cringing face, his lips showed a wry smile.\n“Shihoko-san, don’t tease them too much~”\nShihoko would calm down whenever Shuuto chimed in. Amane was really grateful for Shuuto.\n“…But leaving that aside, that is a great idea though?”\n“You too dad? Spare me already.”\n…If not for the fact that he too joined in on the teasing.\nAmane’s face was immediately weary, and Shuuto showed a peaceful smile.\nOnce Mahiru was done bathing, Amane was next.\nAmane had to do so quickly, for his parents would be making out in the bathtub.\nHe passed by Mahiru, who just left the bath. His heart jolted, and he quickly entered the bath.\nHe could not remain for long, for he often thought, “If I share the same bathwater as Mahiru…” and nearly fainted from heatstroke.\nOnce done, his parents went to the bathroom. He and Mahiru were the only ones at the living room.\n“Th-they really love each other.”\nMahiru had to utter so when she saw Shuuto reach for Shihoko’s waist and go to the bathroom.\n“They’ve been like this ever since I was aware of my surroundings. I’m used to it.”\n“…I think your family is nice.”\n“Thanks, though sometimes it hurts my heart.”\n“Fufu.”\nAmane put his hand on his chest, and stuck at tongue out. Mahiru covered her lips and giggled.\n“…But just to ask, are you fine living here? Not feeling tired?”\n“Not at all. They have treated me very well…erm, like a daughter…”\n“Well, my parents wanted a daughter. I guess they probably will dote on any cute girl that comes here.”\n“Y-yes.”\nSince his parents wanted a daughter, naturally, they welcomed Mahiru elatedly.\nOf course, Mahiru’s personality was an important reason. Shihoko was thus so fond and concerned about her.\nMahiru might be a little embarrassed about the word cute, and there was a slight redness on her face.\n“After I grew up, my parents wanted someone who can fawn over them. Go ahead and do so. If there’s anything you need or any place you want them to bring you to, you can look for them, you know?”\nIf Mahiru wanted anything, Amane’s parents, especially Shihoko, would happily fulfill it for her.\n“I-I guess fawning is out of the question…but.”\n“But?”\n“I, have a little desire, to go out with everyone…”\nBecause I admire those families who go out together,\nMahiru quipped very softly, her breathing seemingly louder. The moment he heard that, Amane felt his chest being gripped at.\nMahiru was on bad terms with her parents. Shihoko and Shuuto would probably be a real family to her.\nAmane thought that they could be a family, but it was not something he could decide, so he would not say so.\n“I see. I’ll tell mom, but since you don’t know where to go, I’ll just let her decide where she wants to go.”\nAmane did not mention that, and decided that the whole family would spend time with Mahiru instead.\n“I guess we’ll go to a leisure facility or a shopping mall. If there’s anywhere you want to go, you better mention it. Mom will bring you to weird places, you know?”\n“Fufu, I am fine going anywhere with you, Amane-kun.”\n“If you say that, mom’s definitely going to bring us to strange places…”\nMahiru smiled happily once she heard Amane’s words. Amane was quietly relieved, and once he mentioned the strange places he went to, she giggled happily.",

      "content": "It was late in the morning when Amane woke up, as he was either fatigued from the journey, or his parents’ words. To be precise, it would be noon in an hour.\nHe picked up the blanket that fell off without him knowing, and folded it as he yawned.\n…We still haven’t made plans for today.\nMahiru suggested that the four of them would go out together, but Amane had not informed his parents of that. He intended to rest up days after they returned home.\nHe felt it was fine for him to wake up even though it was almost noon, but he felt it was lazy of him even though it was summer vacation.\nHe slowly got up, got changed, tidied himself, and went to the living room. Of course, Mahiru was already in the living room, gathered around the table with Shihoko and Shuuto.\nThey appeared to be looking at a large book, and Mahiru’s eyes were sparkling as she looked on.\n“Morning. What are you looking at?”\n“Ah, morning.”\nMahiru’s expression was devoid of fatigue, and once she greeted him, she continued to look at that thing.\nAmane wondered what it was, and looked over, only to cover his own face.\n“…Say, why are you looking at my photo album when I’m not around…?”\nAmane muttered once he spotted a familiar looking child covered in dirt.\nHis parents really treasured memories, and would take photos to commemorate. It was not strange to have an album. The problem was that they showed it to Mahiru.\nDepicted in the opened album was himself during his childhood, and most of the photos showed him being more adorable, innocent, and reckless than he was at this point.\nAmane had the urge to click his tongue, and glare at Shihoko who was proudly and happily displaying the album that showed images of himself covered in mud, on the verge of tears.\n“Eh, you want to see yourself in cute photos? Why didn’t you say so earlier?”\n“I’m not. I’m saying, don’t show them to her on your own.”\n“…May I not?”\n“Not that you can’t, but well, I’m embarrassed.”\n“These are adorable.”\n“Calling a boy adorable isn’t really a praise.”\nHe was fine with her calling him cool, but it was not flattering to be called adorable.\nHe knew she meant that he was adorable as a child, but he could not be happy about it.\nHe turned his head aside, and sensed the trio laughing.\n“Isn’t it good though? Mahiru-chan looks so mesmerized here.”\n“She definitely wants to laugh.”\n“B-because we have you here, Amane-kun…”\n“Shiina-san really likes you. As a parent, I’m glad to see someone so reliable next to you, Amane.”\nAmane spotted Mahiru close her eyes and shrivel once Shuuto said so.\nShe probably was embarrassed to be praised. Nevertheless, Amane was the one who felt more shame, for his black history was revealed without him knowing, and his embarrassing photos were shown to her.\nHe plopped onto the sofa, showing his unhappiness, and his parents smiled at him.\n“Stop kicking a fuss. You do have a good child who will accept you unconditionally, no?”\n“…That is true.”\n“But we’re a little sad that you didn’t inform us, Amane.”\n“Ugh.”\nIt appeared Shuuto too knew that Amane and Mahiru started dating. One had to wonder if he heard from Shihoko, or that Mahiru informed him directly.”\n“…Isn’t it shameful to report that we’re dating?”\n“You should have told us beforehand. Well, I noticed it already.”\n“You brought a girl back home after all, Amane. You two are so easy to read.”\n“Shut up we’re dating already alright?”\n“How dishonest you are. Mahiru-chan, are you fine with that kind of child?”\n“Erm, Amane-kun gets embarrassed easily…but I like that about him.”\n“Oh my.”\n“I’ve relieved to see you two on such good terms.”\nAmane’s parents looked towards Mahiru, looking encouraged as they then gave Amane a similar look, resulting in Amane’s fatigue levels increased. Amane really did not want to bother answering.\n…It’s my house, but I really don’t want to stay.\nAmane knew this would happen given his parents’ personalities, but as a son, he felt it awkward and unnerving. Mentally, he was restless about how Mahiru was more popular and more adapted to this household, rather than the actual son.\nHe sighed, gave up, and put the album on his lap, flipping through it.\nThe photos Mahiru had happily seen mostly contained Amane’s failures. Some were taken to commemorate, but most of them were photos of a child messing up.\nHe was peeved that there was a photo of him crossdressing.\nAmane had a late development, and looked really childish even midway through his middle school. Once, Shihoko had him crossdress for fun.\nIt was in his second year that Amane’s height shot up, and that did not happen. It was a painful memory for him to eavesdrop that others said he had a feminine face though.\n…That’s nostalgic.\nNaturally, he thought of those he once got close, and then split from.\nHe left this land to hide from them, but at this point, for good or bad, he had a clean break, and was no longer side.\nThe most he felt was a slight unwillingness at the prospect of meeting them, who had graduated at this land.\nHe quickly closed the album, seemingly discarding his frustrations, and found Mahiru looking at him.\n“…Er-erm, are you angry, Amane-kun…?”\n“Why do you think so? I’m just feeling nostalgic.”\nIt seemed Mahiru was worried about Amane clearly looking displeased. The latter shrugged, and put the album back onto the table.\nHe could not let her worry. While he did not want to suffer the warm expressions from his parents, he reached out and patted her head.\nMahiru widened her eyes, but soon she narrowed them, and relaxed.\nAs expected, Shihoko clearly looked elated. Amane ignored her as he continued to coax the uneasy looking Mahiru.",

      "content": "The third day they returned, Mahiru had completely adapted to Amane’s house.\n“Ah, Mahiru-chan, well done.”\nThe trio were in the kitchen, dressed in aprons, happily making sweets. Amane had no combat ability with this, and was not invited to the party. He could only sit in the living room, and watch them afar.\nSince Mahiru came from afar, Shihoko and Shuuto were concerned about everything regarding Mahiru, to the point of prioritizing her over their own son. They were already living together happily.\nThey really wanted to dote on the honest and cute girlfriend of their own son, which he understood, and was happy about.\nHe did not think he needed their care, and was fine with that, but he naturally felt very conflicted to be sidelined.\nMahiru was clearly happy to be doted so lovingly by Shihoko and Shuuto, and of course, Amane too was happy about it.\nShe really yearned a harmonious family. Amane felt he was fine with a little discrimination against himself since she could have this familial feeling.\nThe only thing troubling him was that his parents cared for Mahiru too much, and that his time with Mahiru was reduced.\nWell, we’ll be together once we get back. That should be fine.\nAmane knew that once they got back home, they would practically be alone together the entire time. Nevertheless, he felt very conflicted.\nIn any case, Mahiru was being very cordial with his parents, who were really concerned with her, so he left the living room, and retreated to his room, escaping from this unpleasing feeling.\nHe sat cross legged before the foldable table, and opened the textbooks he brought along.\nHe had nothing to do, and most of his entertainment stuff were sent to his present house, so he could only spend his time doing so. Either way, they would have tests right after summer vacation, and he had to study, even if it was for the sake of maintaining his rank. He already liked to study to begin with, and did not find it a chore.\nHe silently spent his time studying, as any proper student would.\nThe textbooks were all very new, but he had ease doing so due to his daily hard work. He did not slack off as he wanted to remain next to Mahiru, as his parents would desire, and show the results that were visible.\nHe marked a red circle as he answered, while thinking to himself that the kitchen was certainly lively. There were a few careless mistakes, but he got most of them correct. He heaved a sigh, but felt a displeasure that should have faded in this quiet space.\nI should be spending my time alone, but now I don’t like it when I don’t have anyone next to me. When did this happen?\nThere was no doubt it was because of Mahiru.\nHe had taken Mahiru’s existence for granted, and started to feel annoyed about being alone.\nHe twirled the red pen out of boredom, and sighed silently.\nHe was soon done with the textbooks, and it was something he should be delighted with, but he sighed. Right when he was about to put the pen down for the mechanical pencil, there were three knocks on the door.\n“Amane-kun.”\nOnce she was done knocking, Mahiru’s cautious voice rang.\nAmane assumed she was cooking at the kitchen, but then he saw it was past 2pm, and they should be done.\n“What is it?”\n“Nothing. Erm, just that you disappeared…”\n“I’m just studying. Nothing to do after all.”\nAmane never expected two hours to pass, and this showed how focused he was. To be precise, it was due to the many thoughts he had that he focused on his studies, wanting to purge them.\n“…I see. Erm, may I enter?”\n“You can, but you aren’t going to chat with them?”\n“…I wish to talk with you, Amane-kun.”\nPerhaps Mahiru was still being clingy towards Amane, for she would not have any reason to look for him at his room.\nHe realized his immaturity, but naturally, he could not shoo Mahiru away, ‘come in’, he said, and opened the door for her.\nOnce he- did, he found Mahiru beyond the door, holding a tray, looking inside timidly.\nThere were two servings of cafe au lait and profiterole on the tray. It seemed they were just made\n“Please excuse me…”\nMahiru entered courteously, and Amane too was a little awkward.\nHe hastily kept aside his textbooks and stationery, took out a cushion for Mahiru to sit on, and received the tray from her, putting it on the table.\nThe profiterole were well done and so pretty; it could easily be put on display at a cake shop. Since Mahiru made them, they should be delicious.\n“I just made them, so they probably are not too cold…”\n“Oh thanks.”\nAmane was really grateful that Mahiru brought them here, and thanked her earnestly. For some reason, she lowered her eyelids awkwardly.\n“…Are you not angry, Amane-kun?”\n“Why?”\n“Y-you seem a little moody, and not approachable.”\nIt seemed Mahiru too realized that.\nHowever, she was mistaken, as Amane was not angry at all. He felt conflicted and lonely, but not furious. His parents and Mahiru were not at fault, and Amane was the only feeling moody.\n“I’m not angry. I’m just feeling lonely that you got taken away, Mahiru.”\n“Eh…e-erm…”\n“Sorry, I know you get along really well with my mom, but I’m just pouting on my own.”\nI’m rather childish huh,\nAmane shrugged, and took a sip of the cafe au lait Mahiru brought to him.\nHe knew Mahiru really yearned for a family, and he should have watched over her with a smile. The problem was that Amane did not feel that he belonged, and ran away.\nHe felt that he should be fine as long as Mahiru was happy, but he did not like to be left behind, and chose to be alone. He was the one who was angry, and of course, he would not vent his frustrations on his parents.\nHe put the mug down, and took a short breath. Mahiru watched him silently…and leaped into his chest.\nActually, she was leaning into his chest, and Amane was troubled by this sudden skinship.\nHe did not know what happened to her, but in any case, he patted her on the back to coax her. Mahiru slowly lifted her head, and stared intently at Amane’s eyes.\n“…I am glad to be with Shihoko-san, but my most enjoyable time is with you, Amane-kun.”\nShe muttered, and cautiously leaned her lips on his cheeks.\nHer face left Amane’s by the time he felt the little softness.\nHer cheeks were red unlike before, and her eyes were moist. Amane then kissed Mahiru on her soft cheeks.\n…Man, I’m like an idiot.\nIt was too foolish of him to pout and grumble by himself, even though Mahiru had such deep bonds with him.\nOnce again, he understood how much she liked him, the overwhelming emotions conveyed on the silky cheek.\nAmane was unused to kissing, even though it was on the cheek. The same for Mahiru, who shivered a little whenever Amane’s lips approached.\nInitially, Mahiru wanted to run away from the shame, but he embraced and touched her, and she entrusted herself to him, gently narrowing her eyes.\nSometimes, Mahiru too would kiss back at his cheek. She truly was adorable, and Amane embraced her with all his might.\n“…Say Mahiru.”\nAfter kissing each other on the cheeks for a while, Amane looked towards Mahiru’s eyes.\nIn return, she looked back with a bashful, somewhat delighted, and yet relaxed look.\n“Erm, shall we go out together tomorrow? Mom and dad have to work?”\n“Two of us?”\n“I haven’t brought you around here before. It’s about the same as where we’re living thought, nothing really special.”\nAmane only suggested this with the idea that the two of them would be alone, and Mahiru widened her eyes, showing a smile more relaxed than when they were kissing.\n“Yes…erm, I am fine to accompany you anywhere if it is the two of us, Amane-kun.”\n“Okay.”\n“I do want to remain like this for a while…Shihoko-san and Shuuto-san wanted me to accompany you.”\n“Those busybodies…wait, they aren’t. It’s just me being useless. They saw through me.”\nIt appeared his parents were concerned.\nAmane found himself to be so foolish, he chortled, and his body shook as he slowly let go of Mahiru.\nIt appeared Mahiru was disappointed that Amane had let go of her, “I want your dessert though.” he pointed at the profiterole however, and she bashfully lowered her eyes.\n“…Shall we eat together?”\n“Yes.”\nSo Amane stopped hugging her, sat next to her, and held her hand. She showed a warm smile.",

      "content": "“You two are going out today, right?”\nThe four of them were seated in the morning, ready to have breakfast, when Shihoko suddenly mentioned as though she just mentioned.\nIt did not seem that they were joking however, “It is boring to stay at home all day after after all.” they readily noted.\n“Hm, but we aren’t really going anywhere. Just a random stroll.”\n“I have not gone out before. I am looking forward to it.”\nOver the past three days, Mahiru spent her time at Amane’s house, except for the shopping trip with Shuuto on the first day. One reason was that Amane’s parents had been hospitable to her, and another was that it was inconvenient to have her wander at this familiar place.\nAmane assumed his parents would bring her out, but they chose to laze around at home. Thus, he felt he should at least bring her out.\n“We only have a park and a supermarket out here, you know? Want to go along?”\n“No, a simple stroll with you will do, Amane-kun. I am happy to be with you.”\n“…I see.”\nAmane already knew that Mahiru was not looking forward to visiting any place, but that she was looking forward to going out, or to be precise, to spend time with Amane, and his heart heated up.\nHe knew from her expression that she was satisfied just being with him. He was elated and yet embarrassed, and his eyes wavered a little.\n“But well, you two are already beyond lovers.”\n“We used to be like that when we’re younger.”\n“No, Shihoko-san, you weren’t as calm as Shiina-san, you know?”\n“How strict of you.”\n“Though that makes you adorable too.”\n“Goodness~”\nMan, these two are getting at it early in the morning,\nAmane thought as he saw the bashful Shihoko and Shuuto praising her naturally. He ignored them as he took a large mouthful of Shihoko’s omelette.\nThe omelette itself was fine, but Amane felt Mahiru’s was better. The reason however was because it would be Mahiru cooking them, rather than the standards. He had fallen completely for Mahiru’s cooking, and would detect any imperfection in Shihoko’s cooking.\nHe wondered if he should have Mahiru prepare breakfast next time as he looked at her, and found her looking at his parents admiringly, enviously, and somewhat bashfully.\nHe had a vague idea of what she was thinking, and he too became awkward.\n…I can’t really go this far however.\nAmane too hoped to form an intimate bond in Mahiru’s heart, despite him saying otherwise.\nOnce again, he looked towards his always lovey-dovey parents, and discreetly blushed once he imagined a certain day in the future.\n“Let’s go then.”\nA few moments after his parents went out to work, Amane said to Mahiru, who was sitting on the sofa.\nIt was morning, but he did not intend to go far, just a simple stroll nearby. It should be fine even though it was almost noon. They would not be out for long, for the plan was to return home at noon, and Mahiru would cook bacon omelette carbonara.\n“Yes, I am ready.”\n“Well, we don’t really need to bring stuff out when strolling…I intend to go to town next time.”\n“…I-is that, a date?”\n“Yes it’s a date. Today’s rest day.”\nA girl had to prepare herself for a sudden date tomorrow, so Amane’s plan was to just go out for a stroll. By its definition, this might be considered a date, but there was much difference in how serious they would take it.\nHe hoped to go out with her for an entire day, and they would merely go out for a stroll on this day.\nMahiru was clearly elated about the next date, and showed a delighted, sweet smile.\n“I am looking forward to the date.”\n“Sure. I’ll plan it out, so jut look forward to it.”\n“I am fine as long as I am with you, Amane-kun.”\n“I know, but since we’re here, let’s choose some place where we can enjoy ourselves.”\nMahiru herself said that she would be satisfied just being with him, and that was obvious from her face. However, as her boyfriend, Amane hoped to make her happy.\n“Well, that’ll be for next week. Let’s just go for a normal stroll today.”\n“Yes.”\nAmane reached his hand out, and Mahiru naturally held it.\nHe was a little embarrassed by this, and smiled to hide that shame as he held her hand, and led her out of the door.\nIt had been a year or so since he returned home, but the surrounding area did not change much. Feeling nostalgic, he walked down the familiar road.\nBoth of them held hands during this time. Boys and girls on vacation would glance admiringly towards Mahiru whenever they passed by, and Amane found it a little funny, laughing out loud.\nIt proved that Mahiru was really pretty, which was a good thing, but he was bemused by the many people who looked at her.\n“What are you laughing about, Amane-kun?”\n“Hm? Well, you’re pretty, and you attracted lots of people.”\n“It is pointless to attract those stares though.”\n“What about me?”\n“…I shall let you look however you want, you know?”\nMahiru smiled teasingly, “I’ll have a good look at home.” and Amane too smiled back as he held her hand, and led her into the park.\nThe park was relatively big, and had more scenes of nature. It is a place for the people living nearby to rest.\nThe children were in a large sand pit, shrieking and playing sand. Some were queuing for the slide next to the jungle gym. Their parents were looking at them at the nearby benches, or playing with them.\nBoth of them smiled heartily once they saw this comforting daily sight.\n“They are all so energetic.”\n“We don’t have that much energy to run around like that.”\n“But you dislike running to begin with.”\n“I’m fine with that, but it’s just that I’m forced to run at a certain speed.”\nSome hated sports not because they disliked keeping their bodies limber, but that they disliked having others look at them, or to be forced to exercise.\nAmane was one such person who preferred to exercise freely alone. He hated sports, but not exercise.\n“Will you play with those children?”\n“I’ll be seen as suspicious, right? I won’t leave you aside, Mahiru. Look, you’re wearing a dress, and you can’t run or squat, right?”\n“Yes…but I think they have it good. I never got to play like that before…”\nI used to play in the garden alone,\nshe quietly muttered, and Amane held her little hand once again.\n“…We can’t really play now. So…if there’s a chance in the future.”\n“Eh? Y-yes…?”\nIt appeared Mahiru did not really understand. Amane felt it was a pity, and yet at the same time, thought it was fine for her not to realize.\nHe intended to mention it once they graduated from high school, so it was fine for her not to notice what he said, and to slowly consider about setting up a family.\nHe had a feeling she probably would not refuse.\nHe smiled, befuddling Mahiru who tilted her head in confusion, and gently held her hand as they strolled through the park.\nHe tried to ensure that they were under the shade, and they saw the blooming flowers in the flowerbeds, enjoyed the refreshing breeze blowing through the trees, and enjoyed a very leisurely time\nAs they had walked quite a bit, Amane stopped at a vending machine to buy some drinks, resting at the nearby shade.\n“But honestly, you’re already used to my place, Mahiru.”\nHe had a gulp, sighed, and asked her, whose caramel-colored eyes blinked at this sudden question, before she relaxed.\n“Yes, I am grateful.”\n“You’re more used to it than me.”\n“I-is that so?”\n“You’re completely used to it. It’s like your first home.”\nMahiru had completely found herself at home with the Fujimiyas, was heavily doted, and it would not be out of place to say she was one of the Fujimiyas. Of course, all three members of the flavor doted on her.\nAmane aside, his parents really doted on her like their own daughter, and she seemed very relieved.\n“Do you have fun at my house?”\n“Yes, everything feels enjoyable at your house. Shuuto-san and Shihoko-san really took care of me.”\n“Yeah, better than me.”\n“Do not pout now, Amane-kun.”\n“I’m not. I have you.”\n“…Yes.”\nAmane hoped for Mahiru to be part of the Fujimiyas. Even though he might feel abandoned, he was happy that his family would gladly accept Mahiru.\nIn any case, he was fine with having Mahiru. Obviously, Mahiru would always return to him, so it was fine for his parents to care for her. He felt a little conflicted that their time together would be reduced however.\nShe seemed a little bashful upon hearing Amane’s words, and stuck her forehead onto his elbow, hiding her face. He found that gesture adorable, and intended to pat her head.\n“…Fujimiya?”\nAmane heard this voice, and stopped his hand from patting her head.\nHe recovered to find a presence nearby. Neither of them had noticed anyone approaching them, as they had enjoyed themselves.\nHe stopped, put his hand down, and turned towards the voice…to find a boy causing him some strange sense of nostalgia.",

      "content": "In a corner of his heart, Amane had a feeling they might meet again.\nThey never left this place, fooled around during the summer, and all lived near their middle school.\nHowever, he never expected them to meet at this moment.\n“It’s really you, Fujimiya. I couldn’t remember your name until it was mentioned.”\nThe name…was Tojo, and he was looking at Amane. Tojo did not look too different from when Amane last saw him at the middle school.\nIn contrast, Amane had greatly changed over the past two years away. He was dressed in outdoor clothing and hairstyle, so Tojo might not have recognized him immediately.\nTojo’s smile was as frivolous as Itsuki, who too was of similar demeanor. While Itsuki was a cheerful, good boy, Tojo instead was more of a hoodlum.\n“It’s been a while, Fujimiya.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Thought you left this place. Now you’re back?”\n“Only in the summer vacation. Looks like you’re rather lively.”\nAmane answered more normally than he expected, probably because while he was shocked, he did not falter.\nTojo was a local lad, and it was to be expected that he would appear here. It was merely a coincidence after all. After all, Amane’s residence was nowhere near, and Tojo was a mere unrelated stranger.\nHe felt goosebumps in his heart as he recalled the past, but once he sensed Mahiru’s warmth next to him, they dissipated.\n“What’s with her? You bluffed her?”\n“Of course not. She’s my girlfriend.”\n“Ugh.”\nTojo sized up Mahiru. He looked peeved to hear Amane mention the word girlfriend.\nTojo would occasionally show such a face back when they were on better terms, and it was then that Amane understood why Tojo did so.\nThat expression was shown only when others had something Tojo did not have.\n“You’re good, getting a girlfriend. You used to be so cute, and now you’re a man now.”\nTojo leered at Amane, but the latter had no thoughts. Amane assumed he would be hurt, but he really thought nothing about it, and instead, was worried that Mahiru next to him would be furious about him being belittled.\nHe glanced aside at Mahiru, and found her blinking, before she smiled.\nHe never knew if he should be relieved by such a smile, and was uneasy at her reaction. Tojo then showed a gleeful smile.\n“Hey girlfriend, do you know? He’s better now, but we used to tease him for looking like a girl, and he nearly cried.”\n“Now that’s nostalgic.”\nAmane showed no reaction towards those malicious words.\nFirst off, Mahiru was holding his hand by the side, and more importantly, Amane merely felt nostalgic about meeting Tojo, and found the latter to be such an ordinary person.\nIn the past, Tojo had the better physique and size. He was cheerful, would earnestly raise his own views, and had many friends.\nAmane was once scared of showing hostility against someone who was outright superior. He also suffered much from Tojo’s betrayal.\nAmane remained completely calm, not to the point of nonchalance, but he was capable of calmly looking back at the past, thinking that it all happened. Despite verything that happened, Amane no longer shivered as he did back then.\nTojo’s face was a little red, probably displeased that Amane appeared to react flatly. he raised an eyebrow.\n“You look rather calm…so girlfriend, what value do you see from this guy? he doesn’t have any outstanding points other than his background, right? You know how he used to be such a wimp?”\nTojo turned towards Mahiru, but the latter’s poised smile showed no change.\n“Amane-kun told me everything. Well, I did not know how cute he was…”\n“Unfortunately, I don’t have a photo to show.”\n“Fufu, but I just saw it.”\nHe was cute,\nso she quietly chimed, and Amane looked towards her unhappily. she showed her original smile for an instance, only to revert to her angelic smile thereafter.\n“…That aside, you did mention that he does not have value, no?”\nShe stood next to Amane, straightened her back, and stared at Tojo, who looked a little intimidated as she was mesmerizingly stern.\n“Do you only choose those who are rich? Do you choose your friends based on the value they can provide you with? I do find that lonely.”\n“This…”\n“Even with money, I was never really satisfied…my heart remained cold even though I have money.”\nMahiru put her hand on her chest as she muttered quietly, and Amane’s heart was gripped.\nMahiru herself had a decent background, and her family was wealthy enough to hire a homemaker. Everything she had was valuable. She once said that her parents only gave her money.\nThus, she valued money lightly, and prioritized human feelings over it.\nAmane was not hurt by Tojo, but his heart ached once he thought of Mahiru’s situation. The reason was that he had long forgotten about Tojo.\n“After I met Amane-kun, I felt happiness in my heart for the first time…it is not money nor appearance that decides a person’s worth, but the inside. I will not use external factors to determine his worth.”\nMahiru firmly stated, and neither pitied nor rejected Tojo. Instead, she merely stared at him calmly.\n“If there is nothing valuable other than money to you, that is fine. I will not deny anyone’s values. I just need Amane-kun to understand that I value him most.”\nThe angelic smile became the original smile, directed towards Amane.\nThat alone was good enough.\n“That’s enough, Mahiru.”\n“But…”\n“Actually, I’ll feel embarrassed listening to that…though I’m happy. You can leave it for when we’re alone together.”\n“…Yes.”\nIf Amane did not stop her, Mahiru might rattle off all of his good points, and would reveal how much she liked Amane.\nHer purifying smile would be shown to Tojo, which Amane would find inappropriate, for Tojo was a mere stranger, not something to be involved with.\n“Thanks.”\nHe muttered, and shielded Mahiru by standing before her.\n“Tojo.”\n“Wh-what?”\nAmane quietly called out, and received a flustered sounding response.\n…I guess he’s really just passing by.\nAmane had no further thoughts about seeing Tojo like that, probably because he had taken the latter for the past, and severed ties with him.\nHe was looking so calm, he never expected himself to be so when he left his hometown, terrified of seeing Tojo. Mahiru too sensed Amane’s mood behind him, and did not stop him.\nUnlike the poised Amane, Tojo clearly looked sheepish, and waited for him to continue.\nAnd Amane merely smiled back.\n“I’m grateful to you now. You used me, and we broke our ties, but I was really happy back then. It’s a kind of redemption for me when I was so naive.”\nAmane had no intention to begrudge Tojo.\nHe was hurt, he suffered, but he used that as an experience. It was that incident that formed his present self.\nHe liked his present self, and because he ended up like this, he met Mahiru, and bonded with her.\n“Looking at the outcome, I guess it’s great that I was friends with you. Now I met Mahiru, and I think you using me was great for both of us. I was hurt, but I was able to mature because I managed to overcome that adversity. I got a priceless thing because of you guys.”\nIn a certain sense, Tojo and the ex-friends who were not present did form a crucial part in Amane and Mahiru’s encounter.\n“Thanks…I’m not going to be friends with you, and I have nothing more to say. That’s just what I want to say.”\nThe words of thanks were parting words.\nAmane had no intention of getting involved with Tojo. Since he lived near his current school, he intended to continue his studies there.\nAmane and Tojo were in different schools, lived in different areas, and learned different things. They were to be mere strangers, just former friends.\nTojo seemed thunderstruck by Amane’s earnest words. Amane turned his back on him.\nThe goosebumps from Tojo had dissolved.\n“Let’s go back then, Mahiru.”\n“Yes.”\n“Nn.”\nAmane held Mahiru’s hand, and she looked slightly bashful.\nShe too abandoned all concern for Tojo, and looked only towards Amane.\nAmane showed a wry smile at that, and left the park without looking back, abandoning all interest in his former friend.",

      "content": "That night, Amane laid on the bed, closed his eyes, and waited for sleep to come. However, he just could not sleep, and laid there.\nUsually, he could fall asleep easily, but he just could not on it was this particular day. He was strangely excited, and restless.\nHe wondered why it was, and felt it was probably due to his encounter with Tojo.\nThough Tojo was a former friend, and one of the reasons why Amane suffered, Amane felt that the goosebumps and shivers associated with them were long gone.\nHe felt relieved after their encounter, and somewhat emotional.\nHe realized how much support he received from Mahiru after they met, how much he grew, and also, an unspeakable sense of achievement.\nHowever, he probably would be unable to sleep if this kept up. He got up, intending to breathe in some fresh air outside to clear his mood. He put on his slippers, and went to the veranda.\nHe opened the window, and was met with damp air, causing him some discomfort as he was already in the air conditioned room. The summer temperatures remained high even at night. It had been the case over the past few nights, and it was no wonder that he felt hot.\nThe air was fresh though. There were no lights from the nearby residential areas, and he could see pretty stars. These were sufficient in killing time, alleviating his boredom before he slept.\nHe leaned on the railing, enjoying the quiet space and the radiant starlights. Suddenly, he heard a rubbing sound at the window.\nIt did not come from his room, but from the other room connected to the veranda. He turned around to see Mahiru dressed in a one piece nightgown, poking her upper body out as she looked back at him.\n“…You still awake, Mahiru?”\nAmane never expected her to be still awake.\nIt was the middle of the night, and Mahiru had a regular pattern in her lifestyle. As she mentioned before, she would sleep before midnight, so he never expected her to be awake, let alone arrive at the veranda.\n“I feel a little sleepless…are you unable to sleep too, Amane-kun?”\n“Well yeah…lots of things happened after all.”\n“…Yes.”\nLots of things happened,\nMahiru went to the veranda, her eyes lowered as a result of those words. “Ah, no, that’s not what I mean.” Amane noted wryly.\n“Look, I’m not thinking about those things, you know? I guess I’m reflecting more on how much I’ve grown.”\nMahiru’s momentary concern was excessive.\nAmane had no further thoughts about Tojo. He merely felt his own changes, and would never imagine the latter’s face again. He was no longer threatened.\nMahiru seemed relieved when Amane said with a chuckle, and she too gave a little smile.\n“Fufu…you have become stronger and matured, Amane-kun. You probably grew a lot since middle school.”\n“Yeah. About 20cm or so.”\n“You really grew.”\n“Of course.”\nAMane had changed, not simply in terms of height, but more importantly, his heart changed over the past year, and the manner he viewed things too changed.\nLooking back at the past, he felt he was a really unlikable, nonchalant, and arrogant boy. After all, because of them, he could not deny the part when he was not cute, not sociable.\nHe felt that he was more poised compared to before.\nThe reason that was due to the dearest girl next to him.\n“As you said, you have grown, Amane-kun. Physically and emotionally.”\n“…Yeah.”\n“Do you have confidence?”\n“Yep.”\n“That is good. Even if you do not, I shall support you.”\n“Thanks for that. Really.”\nMahiru showed a warm smile, and put her hands on the railing, looking up at the sky. Amane had an urge to dote on her.\nShe would smile next to him, just like this. She would stay by his side to support him, to encourage him. She hoped for him to be by her side. Amane was really elated to have such a precious, rare person, next to him.\n“…Say, Mahiru.”\n“Hm?”\n“…I want to touch you.”\n“Eh?”\nMahiru slowly turned towards Amane once she heard these sudden words.\nHer expression was filled mostly with shock. Amane was embarrassed by the words he said, and yet he had no intention to correct himself as he stared at Mahiru’s perturbed, faltering eyes.\n“…I have an urge to touch you. Can I?”\nHe really wanted to touch her.\nHe wanted to feel the warmth of Mahiru, who loved him, doted on him, and supported him.He wanted to experience that fact that she was by his side.\nAnd as Amane stared at her intently, her caramel-colored eyes flickered, before they were lowered bashfully.\n“…Not that you cannot.”\nOnce he heard that little murmur, Amane felt a little more warmth in his heart.\nHe understood that he was allowed to do so, and reached his hands for Mahiru.\nHowever, he wanted if he should embrace her at the veranda. Thus, he touched her palm instead.\nHe felt the feeble hand that strongly supported him, and led him on. He brought her into his room.\nThis house was cooler than the apartment Amane stayed at, but it was still hot at night, so the air-conditioning was switched on. They felt a cool breeze once they entered.\nIt was the middle of the night, so he silently closed his window, and sat Mahiru on the bed.\nThere was no sofa, and they could only sit there. Amane had no other intentions. Once he let her sit however, she froze, and turned stiffly towards Amane, causing him to chuckle.\n“I won’t do anything.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Are you looking forward to it?”\n“O-of course not?”\n“As a guy, I feel rather conflicted here.”\n“Eh?”\n“Just joking…I just want to touch you.”\nAmane had no intention of doing that thing that would cause her to be immediately wary. He wanted to wait for her to be ready, and not force the issue just to have her.\nShe finally relaxed, and Amane slow wrapped his arms around her back. She too wrapped her arms around his.\nHe felt a soft sensation slowly filling his heart, had a scent of the sweet fragrance, and an unspeakable sense of happiness. Once again, he felt a looming desire to dote on her, and embraced her as much as he wanted.\nMahiru too narrowed her eyes comfortably in his clutches.\nShe never said how happy she was, but surely she too felt the same as Amane, considering the soft smile on her lips and the peaceful mood emitted from her.\n…I really love her.\nThis emotion deep in his heart brought forth warmth and happiness in his body, and increasingly, his own presence.\nHe assumed he would never love her more, but his feelings were increasingly rooted, increasingly passionate, and probably would never vanish again. Perhaps he too would be like his parents, his fondness of her getting stronger, becoming a gentle, peaceful, radiant form that would never vanish.\nHe loved her with all his heart, and could firmly conclude so.\nAs he harbored these feelings that could not be restrained, Amane unwittingly lifted Mahiru’s chin with his hand, and brought his lips against Mahiru’s moist smile.\nThe caramel-colored eyes up close blinked a few times.\nAnd then, Amane felt a blunt pain on his forehead, turning it aside.\nReeling from the pain, it was his turn to blink away.\nIt was probably Mahiru who caused the pain this time, and her eyes were swimming about, clearly looking perturbed.\n“…Ow.”\n“S-sorry, you took me by surprise, so…”\n“I-it’s fine. I’m at fault for doing this out of a sudden…sorry.”\nAmane understood that she instinctively bumped her head into him, and he was the one who kissed her without permission. He could not have blamed her.\nGiven her reaction, he started to regret, thinking that he should have waited a little longer. Mahiru then began to shrivel however, and looked around.\n“I-it is not that I dislike so, erm, but, it really took me by surprise…well…pl-please do it, once again. I will be fine, this time.”\nMahiru sounded bashful, but she closed her eyes again and lifted her head, preparing herself. Amane smiled, and took her lips again.\nMahiru headbutted him before he could savor her lips the previous time. This time however, he got to enjoy them as she was prepared.\nThe lips were softer and moist compared to his.\nHe worried that his lips were dry, that Mahiru would feel displeased about them, but she did not seem to dislike it. He gently nibbled on them, and she twitched her body, seemingly ticklish, which gave him an inexplicable desire to dote on her more.\nThey temporarily broke away, but as Mahiru was so adorable, Amane’s urge to go again was beyond his control, and he nibbled on her lips again.\n“Unnn.” He heard the little sound, not knowing if she was surprised or protesting, but once he did so, as though coaxing her, her voice vanished.\nThere was some gulping sounds that came with that.\nOnce Amane moved his lips away for real, Mahiru buried her face into his shoulder.\n“…Yo-you never said you were going to do it a few times.”\n“Yo-you don’t want it?”\n“N-not that, I am not prepared…erm, I am embarrassed.”\nIt is our first time,\nMahiru muttered, but it sounded differently to Amane’s ears, and his heart raced.\n“…Is it really your first time, Amane-kun? You seem more capable than I thought.”\n“How so…erm, I just had the desire to kiss you, and didn’t really think about it, so I was a little forceful…”\n“I-I do not dislike, it thought…I am fine, as long as we know we are doing it…a little more, if you will.”\nAs a boy, Amane could not possibly stop once Mahiru looked up to him and said so.\nOnce again, he kissed Mahiru on the lips, but at her pace, only at their lips.\nInstead, Amane cupped his palm on the back of her head, not letting go.\nBoth of them turned their faces around, as though enjoying the moist lips, twirling around. Amane’s heart was already pounding loudly at this moment.\n“…Fufu.”\nMahiru giggled as they kissed, and put her hands on his chest, straightening herself and looking at at him.\n“…I do not know the significance of kissing until I liked you. I suppose those who truly love others will feel really happy.”\n“…Are you happy now?”\n“Yes.”\n“…Same here.”\n“Fufu. We are the same.”\nMahiru looked bashful and yet carefree. Once again, Amane kissed the slightly sweet and fragrant lips, and she shivered.\nHe felt she was unwilling to go further, so he moved his lips away. “That is not the case.” Mahiru giggled shyly, and leaned onto him, muttering, “You are warm, Amane-kun.”\n“…Are you cold?”\n“Yes. I think the air conditioner timer is yet to…”\nThe room temperature was set to be warmer than it would be in the day, but it still remained cold. Amane did set the timer to switch off after several hours, but she was certainly cold in that thin nightwear of hers.\nAfter all, she was wearing a short-sleeved one-piece dress. Her elbows were exposed, and it was no wonder she was cold.\n“Do you want me to warm you up?”\n“Oh my, how will you do so?”\nAmane asked jokingly, and Mahiru latched on, a rarity from her.\n“What do you want me to do?”\n“What do you think I want you to do?”\n“What do I think you want me to do next, huh?”\n“Have a guess.”\n“…You’re getting ridiculous.”\n“Fufu, I will not lose this time.”\n“Yes yes. This is what I’ll give Mahiru-san.”\nHe embraced Mahiru, and rolled onto the bed.\nThe flax-colored hair danced in his clutches, and the caramel colored eyes seemingly widened in shock.\nAmane kissed Mahiru on the cheek while she was stunned, grabbed the blanket by the side, and laid it over them. Mahiru seemed to have realized what happened, and leaned her face onto his chest.\n“Now both of us are warm.”\n“…Yes.”\n“And we have an optional service of an arm pillow.”\nDo you want it?\nAmane reached his arms out, and Mahiru giggled, courteously putting her head on his arm.\nMan is her face close,\nAmane thought, and smiled. Mahiru’s smile turned impish.\n“What is the price of the extra service?”\n“A huge discount limited to Mahiru. Omelette for tomorrow’s breakfast.”\n“I shall lie on it then.”\n“You’re already doing it.”\nBoth of them smiled at each other, and Amane cupped his other hand onto her back, closing his eyes.",

      "content": "Amane woke up the next day to find Mahiru in his clutches, and froze.\nHe quickly recalled that they slept together the previous day, and did not make any sounds, but despite that, the fact remained that his heart was burdened once he woke up. The thumpings in his heart had him feeling stifled, but he managed to calm down once he saw Mahiru’s peaceful sleeping face.\nHe took a deep breath to calm himself, and once again, looked at her sleeping face.\nShe was nestled on Amane’s elbow, sleeping soundly, adorable, innocent, mesmerizing.\nAnd it was probably because she was sleeping peacefully that her face was relaxed, giving a gentle impression.\n…She’s so cute and defenseless.\nThe sleeping face was truly angelic, her beauty and innocence befitting her appearance.\nMahiru might feel awkward and pout if he mentioned this to her, but he could keep his thoughts to himself. Even if he did utter this, she might not realize it.\nThinking how adorable she was, Amane kept staring at her as he used the free hand to pat her head.\nHer hair was glossy and smooth, with an angelic halo. Amane gently caressed her hair, and slightly nudged his somewhat numb elbow while ensuring that this arm pillow did not wake her up, adjusting his posture.\nHis numb arm was a trivial problem as long as he could marvel at this sleeping face.\nOnce he saw that she was still sleeping, he gently brought his lips to her eyelids.\nAnd as he continued to look at Mahiru’s smiling sleeping face, there was a knock on the door.\n“Amane, you awake?”\nCalling out from the door was his father.\nWhat do I do?\nHe probably was here to wake Amane, but if Amane answered, Mahiru might wake up.\nShe was sleeping so soundly, and it would be a pity to wake her up. Amane too wanted to see more of her sleeping face.\nOn the other hand, if he did not answer, Shuuto would enter and wake him up. Amane wondered how he should answer…but before he could decide, the door opened.\nBeyond the door, Amane saw the familiar face of his father, and his face cringed.\nIn contrast, Shuuto widened his eyes once he saw Amane on the bed, “Oh my.” and he chuckled.\nIt was that moment when Amane realized that Shuuto was going to inform Shihoko, and they would tease him. He gave up, and put his index finger before his cringing face. Even without hushing Shuuto, the latter probably understood what Amane wanted.\nShuuto was one who understood matters well, and once he saw that gesture, he nodded, smiled, waved back, and stealthily left the room.\nThe door was shut, and the footsteps faded away. Once Amane was certain of that, he sighed silently.\nWill be great if there’s no misunderstanding.\nA pair of lovebirds on the bed might cause unwarranted misunderstandings. Amane did nothing but to touch and kiss Mahiru, completely moral gestures. His parents however did not know how far they went.\nNo, Shuuto might be able to notice that they did not go overboard, and probably did not assume so. Embarrassing matters were still embarrassing after all.\nAmane steeled himself for questioning later, patted Mahiru’s hair, and then, the slender body in his clutches moved.\nSpeaking of which, it would be rare to see the habitual-inclined Mahiru not wake up at this time.\n“…Nn.”\nShe made a soft voice in her throat, and buried her face into Amane’s chest once again, seemingly seeking warmth. Amane was increasingly overwhelmed by cuteness, but if he went with his impulse to embrace her, she would wake up completely. All he did was to stop at headpats.\nThe air-conditioning had stopped, but Mahiru did not leave Amane as she rubbed her face onto him. He wondered if she was scared of the cold, and tapped his feet onto hers. A cold sensation was felt, and it seemed Mahiru really was scared of the cold.\nAmane realized that the air conditioning was set too coldly, so he wrapped his legs around hers to warm her up, his arms around her back to pass on warmth towards her directly.\nHe felt it was a wonderful thing to be able to share the warmth, and gently wrapped her soft body. She then moved her body greatly, and turned her head slowly towards Amane.\nThe caramel-colored eyes were slightly damp, as though a water drop could be heard, and they remained dazed even after she saw his face.\nHer expression was lazy, lethargic, and looked so tender.\n“Sorry, did I wake you up?”\nAmane smiled at the tired looking Mahiru, and patted her head again. Once again, she closed her eyes, and let him continue.\nHe felt she was completely dazed, but this was fine for him, so he continued to caress her sleepy face with a doting gesture, and she made a cute snort.\n…Mahiru likes to fawn around whenever she just wakes up.\nHe felt she was adorable whenever she was in that relaxed state after waking up, and would marvel and touch her. 5 minutes or so later, she finally woke up, and widened her eyes.\nOnce he was sure she woke up,\ngood morning,\nhe said, and deliberately kissed her face. To his bemusement, she froze.\n“…Nnn, Amane-kun…? W-why?”\n“You forgot? We had such a hot night.”\nIt appeared that since she just woke up, her mind was still not working, so he tried to twist his words.\nHe was not lying, per se. It would refer to the weather, but he did not mention that the air conditioning was too cold.\n“E-eh?” once Mahiru heard that she spent the night with Amane, she made a loud shriek, and checked herself.\nWhile her clothes were a little ruffled, there were no signs of any hanky-panky going on. After all, there could not be any, since they never did.\n“Just joking…I didn’t do anything.”\n“Y-yes…”\n“I did kiss you on the face, just now.”\nA morning kiss should be fine, right?\nOnce Amane said so, Mahiru blushed completely. “You are being aggressive so early in the morning.” She muttered, and Amane quietly chuckled to himself.\n“…You looked relaxed. Slept well?”\nIt seemed she had finally woken up. Amane embraced her, and asked, and she bashfully lowered her eyes before him.\n“…Erm, I feel safe, being in your clutches.\n“Your heart isn’t pounding?”\n“I-it is…but, I can relax.”\nThough my heart feels jittery,\nMahiru muttered, and wrapped her arms around Amane’s back. The latter chuckled, and looked at her face.\n“If you’re relieved, shall we sleep together every day?”\n“E-erm, well.”\n“Just joking.”\nAmane tried to say this, knowing that Mahiru would be embarrassed. He did not need to be taken seriously.\nAfter all, if he were to sleep with her every day, his sanity might vaporize. At this point, he was already at his limit, and if she was to lie by his side every day, he might end up pouncing on her.\nHe could no longer trust his sanity, and muttered to himself that he might lose it if she did not take it as a joke. He then noticed Mahiru’s head lowered.\nHe wondered if he went overboard with the joke, and gently patted Mahiru on the back to coax her. She then lifted her head towards Amane.\nHer face was completely rose-colored.\n“…On-once in, a while, is, fine.”\nAmane’s mind immediately went blank once he heard this shrill yet soft voice.\nOnce in awhile.\nIn other words, Mahiru did not dislike the idea of living together, and also the idea of sleeping next to Amane.\n“Are you serious?”\n“S-since we, are lovers…we may, live together, no?”\n“…Th-that’s true, but.”\nAmane was speechless to hear her words.\nIt was common for high school couples to live together. Amane and Mahiru were rather slow about this.\nThe bakauple often stayed at Chitose’s place, and did things Amane and Mahiru had yet to do.\nThe problem was that Amane was a little hopeful of things to come when she suggested they live together. It was a boy’s nature, to hope for some things as a boyfriend.\nIt seemed Mahiru noticed what Amane was thinking, and her face turned completely beetroot, her eyes teary as she stared at it.\n“Erm, I am not thinking of doing those…but I am glad since I will be able to spend more time with you, Amane-kun…”\n“…Oh.”\n“…Can we?’\n“Of course. I’m really happy.”\nAmane stated his opinion once he saw Mahiru look up at him, only to let slip some of his inner desire.\nAs she was shivering in embarrassment, he reflected on his actions while swallowing the rising desires within him, and patted her head.\n“…An-anyway, until next time.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Yep, get ready then. You probably need to get changed, right?”\n“O-of course.”\nAmane ended the topic for the time being. They might be affected greatly by their thoughts otherwise.\nHe took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down, and let go of her. She hurriedly got off the bed, probably out of embarrassment, and turned her head back.\nWhat?\nThe moment he wondered, she quickly closed in on him.\nThere was a whiff of sweet fragrance, and a soft sensation on the lips.\nBoth left quickly, replaced by the smooth flax-colored hair fluttering away, caressing his cheeks.\n“You teased me lots just now, Amane-kun. This is payback.”\nShe blushed, seemingly enduring her shame. Her hair then fluttered as she quickly left the room.\nOnce he saw her leave, Amane fell onto the bed again.\nI probably can’t leave until I cool down.\nHe fully realized Mahiru’s unexpected boldness as he kept looking up at the ceiling, until his body stopped being hot.",

      "content": "“Good morning Amane.”\nAmane’s parents were waiting for him at the living room.\nBreakfast was being prepared, and that includes Amane’s share. Dishes could be heard being prepared in the kitchen, and a familiar flax color could be seen. Mahiru was probably making omelettes.\n“…Morning.”\n“Hurry and sit down now. Mahiru-chan’s making breakfast for you now.”\n“Oh.”\nIt took Amane a while to arrive, for he had to cool himself down in various ways. Thus Mahiru, who should have spent much time tidying herself, was already making breakfast.\nit might be better for Amane since they agreed to have omelettes, but a little more restraint would be prudent.\n“You two are really on good terms.”\n“…Well we’re dating, that’s very normal, right?”\n“You say so, but this is beyond boyfriend and girlfriend. She is acting like a young wife.”\nThe moment Shuuto suddenly said so while looking towards Amane, one could hear a plate dropped in the basin.\nLuckily, it did not shatter, but surely it was because Mahiru was greatly rattled.\n“Ara, Mahiru-chan, are you fine?”\n“Y-yes, the plate is not broken. I apologize for dropping it…”\n“That’s fine~ everyone makes mistakes.”\nThis mistake was caused by them, but Amane never mentioned this, and ignored Shihoko’s leer towards him.\n“So, did something happen yesterday?”\nMahiru made omelettes for Amane, sat down, and the quartet had breakfast.\nShihoko went straight for the haymaker the moment Amane had a mouthful in his mouth, and the latter froze.\nHe slowly chewed since it would be bad to talk while talking, and once done, he said,\n“…Why do you think so?”\n“We realized you two were a little different once we got back, so our guess is that something happened.”\n“Don’t underestimate your parents. We’re able to see how our son has changed.”\nAmane intended to act as normal, but it appeared his parents has seen through them.\nThey looked a little worried, but he had crossed the hurdle. It was in the past, and nothing to worry about.\n“Nothing much. I just met Tojo. Had a few words with him.”\n“Ah, so that’s how it is…problem is solved, I suppose?”\n“Well yeah. I’ve overcome this. I don’t think I’ll be frustrated by them again.”\n“You’re acting more like a man. That’s a good thing.”\nShuuto seemed really relieved to know that Amane was fine.\nBack then, Amane caused his parents much worry, which lasted till this day. Amane did buck up a little after he started high school, but it seemed this was still a concern to his parents.\nWhile Shuuto looked a little more relieved, Shihoko seemed a little dumbfounded to hear Tojo’s name.\n“That Tojo hasn’t changed at all. Well, his parents are decent, and he’s still in his rebellious phase.”\nShihoko had vast connections due to her personality and work reasons, so many that it was pointless. Amane could not imagine the adults having such relationships, but perhaps it was because he did not know.\nOf course, since she interacted with the locals, that would mean Tojo’s parents too.\nAmane did meet Tojo’s parents before, and recalled they were really as kind as their appearances would imply. They actually apologized for what their son did, so he did not have any feelings about him.\n“Who knows. I don’t have anything to do with him, and I don’t care. I probably won’t meet him again.”\n“Your virtue is that you let bygones be bygones, Amane…if you remained despondent, we would have regretted calling you back home.”\nEven though the agreement was that Amane would return to his hometown biannually, Amane’s parents seemed worried about Amane.\n“Well, I’m the one who decided to come back…and since we met, I guess we sorted out everything. It’s all good.”\nAmane felt that this encounter was a good thing.\nIt was better for him to meet it head on than to have shivers in his heart, and grow from it. This proved that Amane was completely healed inside.\nIt was because of Tojo and the others he did not meet again that he got to meet Mahiru. He might really have to be grateful for them, though they might be unhappy about it.\nShihoko showed a kind smile once she saw Amane devoid of worries.\n“Children do grow after all. You were on the verge of breaking down back then, and it was worrying…but I guess there’s nothing to worry about now.”\n“Love makes people stronger after all.”\n“Don’t say such an embarrassing thing…”\n“But it is true though?\n“…Well, ya.”\n“Hahaha. I’m glad that you finally found yourself a partner, like me and Shihoko-san.”\n“…Y-yes.”\nMahiru, who was listening silently, shriveled. Shuuto and Shihoko looked elated.\n“Do rely on Amane when you need to, Mahiru-chan. I’m worried when you’re always taking care of him.”\n“N-not at all. I-I have been relying on Amane-kun all the time. He is the one supporting me.”\nAmane felt he should be the one saying these words, but Mahiru looked towards him bashfully, for she might really think so.\n“That’s good…and don’t rely completely on Mahiru’s efforts, Amane. Do help each other out, you know?”\n“I get that. I’ve always been by her side. Of course I’ll definitely help her.”\nAmane intended to continue helping Mahiru as they live together, even without anyone reminding him so.\nHe did not want to be someone who completely relied on others and not consider the burden caused. Truth be told, Amane would be a good-for-nothing without Mahiru, but he did not want to be a good-for-nothing, personality-wise.\nAnd just as he received Mahiru’s aid this time, he would support her if she suffered, and hold her hand.\nThis is what it means to live together,\nAmane remembered these words to heart as he looked at his parents, and hoped to remain so.\nFinding that person he could rely on might be his biggest blessing in life.\nHe did not stand by Mahiru’s side half-heartedly. He looked aside, and found her lushing and shivering.\nShe appeared to be on the verge of tears, but in fact, she was about to explode from the shame.\nOnce her eyes met Amane’s she immediately lowered her eyes. Clearly she was getting restless due to the shame she felt.\nDespite that, Amane could not let her escape, so he held her hand under the table. She jolted, and held his hand back to cushion the impact.\n“Oh my, how adorable. I would have enjoyed myself if not for the fact that I have to work.”\nShihoko beamed once she saw Mahiru being in that state.\nAs she said, she probably would dote on Mahiru if not for work.\n“Hurry off to work.”\n“So you’re going to make out when we’re gone?”\n“Yeah, so?”\nIt seemed Amane would be teased no matter what he did, so he simply affirmed boldly. The hand he was holding shivered, its grip not weakening however.\nAmane felt Mahiru was probably delighted.\nHe would have flatly denied it in the past. Thus, Shihoko was shocked by his honest admission, only to smile thereafter.\n“Why that’s bold of you to say so.”\n“Shut up.”\n“That’s good. it’s springtime for you, Amane.”\n“But it might get hot like the summer.”\n“You two don’t get to say this when you’re always in summer.”\n“Since you’re born by us who are always in summer, how about you join us?”\nShihoko chirped away, smiling as she seemingly blessed them. Amane gave a bitter look, but he decided it was not worth it, since Mahiru did not seem unwilling, and he gave up, turning his head aside.",

      "content": "Once Amane’s parents left for work, Amane and Mahiru sat next to each other, on his bed.\nPerhaps it was the environment, for Mahiru seemed rather unnatural despite the distance between them being the same as usual. Obviously she was concerned about Amane, for her eyes wavered towards him from time to time, and her face would blush once their eyes met. Amane’s heart too felt ticklish as a result.\n“E-erm, making out is…”\nIt seemed Mahiru was concerned about those words, for she fidgeted as she asked him.\n“Hm? Ah, I just said something to shut my parents up. If I denied it, they’ll keep teasing me.”\n“So, erm, you did not intend to…?”\n“Actually, I really want to make out.”\n“…Eh, yes.”\nMahiru shriveled, looking bashful. Amane felt that she was really being concerned about him, and showed a wry smile.\n“If you don’t want, I don’t mind.”\n“I-I do want this, of course. If it is with you, Amane-kun…I do-do want some, make, out.”\n“I see.”\n“B-but…how do we go about, doing this?”\nWhat followed Mahiru’s question thereafter was silence.\n“…Like kissing.”\n“Kissing?”\n“….And kissing.”\n“Isn’t that just kissing?”\n“N-no, to be specific, like hugging, holding hands…even though we are already doing so.”\nAfter all, they were on such good terms that they were unwittingly making out. At this point, the conscious act of making out had them wondering what they should do.\nSkinship and kissing should be considered part of making out, but they wondered if that should be allowed.\nOne had to say that they already started doing so naturally, so they had no idea how to take the next step.\n“If we want to make out more, what shall we do next?”\n“…Anyway, shall we stick together?”\nIt was not a new idea, but this gesture had Amane relieved yet agitated. Once she heard this suggestion, “…Nn.” She muttered in affirmation.\nShe obviously looked hesitant, yet she leaned towards him, and he reached out to receive her..latching his arms onto her knees and back as he carried her.\n“Kyaa.” she made a cute shriek, and he was delighted. He put her between his legs, on the bed.\n“I think this is better.”\n“…Y-yes.”\n“Can’t we?”\n“N-not at all. Erm…well, it feels like I am being wrapped by you, Amane-kun…?”\n“Shall I wrap you up as you wish?”\nHe reached his hands towards Mahiru, embracing her firmly, seemingly wrapping her up after she said such adorable words. Mahiru’s face was flushed red immediately, her eyes damp as she turned away.\nIt was hypocritical of Amane to comment so, but Mahiru really was shy, always blushing at the smallest of matters, which made her adorable. They dated for about two months or so, but she was still not used to skinship. Her innocence was understandable.\nAmane too was a lightweight however, and though his face did not show it, his heart palpitated.\nIf Mahiru had her ear at his chest at this point, she would know immediately that his heart was pounding wildly.\n“…I like to be embraced by you.”\n“I see. If you’re willing, I’ll do it as long as you want it.”\nHe muttered by her ear while embracing her slender body, and she clearly shook.\nHer ears are a weakness,\nhe smiled, and gave a long exhale, causing her to shake more than before, and turn around.\n“…Amane-kun.”\n“Sorry sorry. It’s not on purpose.”\n“Do-do not do this just because I am ticklish…”\nYou are too much,\nshe pouted, looking displeased.\n“I shall talk about your childhood stories, Amane-kun.”\n“Oh dear this does trouble me a little.”\nHe probably would die of embarrassment if she mentioned them, so he noted to himself never to go overboard while touching her.\nHowever, he had no idea how far he could go, to what extent he could touch, so he did a little, touched her hand, and kissed the back of her head. He felt he was missing something.\nHe wanted to touch her more, to enjoy that soft feeling.\nSo he thought, but that was all the skinship he did, just light contact.\nMahiru however was so embarrassed, her face and ears were beetroot as she let him touch.\nShe’s really adorable.\nHe touched her often, but she had been increasingly flustered recently. Amane was supposedly the one who was more rattled, but it seemed the opposite had taken place, and he felt sorry about that.\n“…Amane-kun, your hand is big.”\n“Hm? I’m tall, so my hands are big.”\n“I like your hands…I like it when you touch.”\n“Well I’ll start touching if you say that.”\nOnce Mahiru said something so dangerous, Amane’s mental defenses would relax immediately, so he hoped she would be a little more self-conscious. It seemed she never considered as much as he did, for she muttered, “Actually, I do not mind…”\nHe wondered how he should handle her carelessness.\nOnce she said such adorable words that would drive any male crazy, he sighed, and touched her belly.\nShe fidgeted, feeling ticklish, but he did not mind as he moved his fingers beneath her belly button, and went up.\nHe went up at breathtaking pace, and finally stopped before the curbes.\n“You fine if I go up like this?”\nAmane never did mountain climbing, but he felt it was easy for him to climb and conquer the mountains. After all, as she said, his hands were big, and even her substantial contours could be held in his hands.\nYou want me to climb up these mountains? H\ne deliberately muttered, and Mahiru seemingly exploded like a volcano in his clutches.\nShe turned around, her face ripe like an apple, but Amane chuckled, not minding her at all. At the same time, he kissed her blushing face.\n“This is part of making out.”\n“…Uuu, A-Amane-kun…”\n“I said I’m not too sure of what making out is about, but that’s because I excluded these stuff.”\nAmane felt it was inappropriate for them to go this far two months in, so he had been controlling himself. He wanted to respect her will.\nBut when Mahiru uttered those words unwittingly, he had to warn her.\n“I reminded you, don’t forget I’m a guy. I’m going to touch.”\n“Uuu…y-you say this, but, your face is red too, Amane-kun. Can you really do it?”\n“Shut up.”\nAmane obviously knew his face was red, and knew what he said was really embarrassing.\nHowever, Mahiru might not understand if he did not say so. He had to.\nMahiru went silent, and slowly moved his hands aside.\nAmane knew he was rejected, and was about to show a wry smile, but she turned her head around, and latched onto him.\nHer sudden embrace had him experiencing the softness and sweet scent.\n“…If you really want to…I will accept so, even though I will be embarrassed.”\nShe muttered as she looked up at him, her voice soft and gentle. Amane was stunned. He had to do it.\nShe stared at him after saying such a bold and adorable thing. One could say that Amane’s mind just blanked out.\nShe trusted Amane as she looked at him, feeling embarrassed, uneasy, and yet a little hopeful, leaning onto him. She might really be fine with it, as she said, if it was Amane, and accept all his wishes. It was obvious how much she loved Amane, given her expression and the mood.\nMahiru basically entrusted her body towards Amane, who was a tad late to think, and moved.\nThe first thing he did was to bring their lips together.\n“Nnn.” A soft voice was up close and personnel.\nAmane tasted the soft moist lips as he held her slender body, feeling her tenderness.\nHe did not touch her soft lumps with his hands, and gently let go.\nOnce he saw her lips twitch on her blushing face, he put his face to her neck.\n“…I’ll leave the rest for later.”\nOr I can’t stop myself.\nHe noted, and kissed her white neck.\nThat was all he did since he knew he should not leave a mark, and decided not to lift his face until he could suppress his rising desires.\n^Someone asked for blushing Mahiru, so I obliged.\nNot her, but close enough.",

      "content": "“Why, your face is really red, Mahiru-chan. Something wrong?”\n“N-nothing.”\nAmane’s parents had different occupations and workplaces, but they returned home together. They tilted their heads skeptically once they saw her.\nShe was seated on the living room sofa, her face flushed, probably because Amane had suddenly kissed and held her hand.\n“Amane, did you…”\n“I swear I didn’t do anything.”\nAll he did was to hug her, along with simple skinship. It was still too much for Mahiru however, for she remained innocent until the very end.\nAmane had no right to point this out at others, but he had completely recovered, for he was quicker to do so.\n“You say you haven’t done anything, but you did say you wanted to make out, right?”\n“A healthy make out. That’s fine, right?”\n“That’s bold of you to say.”\n“Shut up.”\n“It’s unfair for you to do it, Amane. I want some make out with Mahiru-chan too.”\n“Mahiru’s mine. Don’t wanna.”\n“Oh my.”\nIf Mahiru was left to Shihoko, the latter would take care of her, but Amane would feel anxious. Mahiru would be happy yet tired. He could never allow Shihoko to have Mahiru to herself.\n“Mine…” Mahiru muttered away, and blushed, which caused Shihoko to smile more.\nAmane ignored Shihoko’s sly smile as he looked towards Mahiru’s white, completely beetroot face. Shuuto too showed a genial smile once he heard these.\n“How about we bond as a family?”\n“Eh?”\n“Well, Shiina-san said she wants to go out with everyone, no?”\nAmane told his parents that Mahiru wanted to go out with everyone, but it seemed she never expected Shuuto to mention this, and her caramel colored eyes blinked away.\n“Well, you and Shiina-san will be around next weekend. We’ll go out then.”\n“Yep, we finally get a chance, so let’s all go out together!…you don’t like it?”\n“I-I fine with this this!”\n“It’s decided then. Huhuhu, where shall we go then?”\nShihoko sounded a little delighted, “Where shall we go then.” she discussed amicably with Shuuto, and Mahiru shriveled, looking a little terrified.\nShe said that she was hoping for this, but she was a little sorry to inconvenience them when they said they would be going out.\n…Mom and dad said they want to go out because they like Mahiru though.\nThey would never spend time with someone they hated, even if Amane told them to.\nTruth be told, his parents had taken a fancy for her to accept her in. They said they wanted to go out, so it was pointless to worry.\n“Prepare yourself. Mom and dad will drag you around everywhere.”\n“Erm, I am grateful and glad for this, since I never had an opportunity to go out with everyone.”\nMahiru’s feeble smile seemed a little forlorn, and lowered her eyes, for she might be recalling her childhood. Shihoko continued to smile as she sat next to Mahiru on the sofa, opposite Amane.\nShe then hugged Mahiru, and cuddled the head.\n“You’re already family, Mahiru-chan. You can fawn however you wan.”\n“Yeah she dotes on you more than she does to her son.”\n“Oh dear, you jealous?”\n“Of course not…Mahiru’s so happy. There’s no way I’ll feel jealous about that.”\nMahiru lowered her eyes bashfully as Shihoko hugged and doted on her, and the vibe from before was gone.\nSuch an expression was proof that the dishonest Mahiru was feeling dishonest.\nShe was happy, and he hoped she could take the name of Fujimiya, so he was really overjoyed that his parents were fond of her. However, he felt conflicted by the relatively intense skinship.\n“You’ve grown.”\n“Are you taking me for an idiot?”\n“Of course not? I’m just impressed that you’ve become a boy who’s glad to see the one you love receive happiness.”\n“You don’t have to say it…”\n“Well, there are few people like you out there. You are our child after all.”\n“Yes yes.”\nAnyone would hope for their loved ones to be happy. The best thing would be to see them smile heartily.\nTruth be told, he was the one wishing solely for her happiness.\nMahiru shriveled bashfully as Shihoko continued to pat her, and Amane showed a kind smile.",

      "content": "“Where are you going, Amane-kun?”\nAmane was wearing his shoes at the entrance, and Mahiru, having noticed that he was about to leave, spoke.\nIt was past 3pm, a little too late to go out, which was why she asked.\n“Hm? Ah, just the nearby supermarket. Mom asked me to buy stuff.”\nAmane did not want to go out in the spur of the moment.\nHe just received a message stating that his parents would be late, and had no time to go shopping. Thus, they needed Amane to buy some necessities.\nAmane had nothing to do, and was fine with shopping, but he hoped his parents would have told him earlier.\nIt seemed Mahiru understood Amane’s explanation, “I see.” for she answered, and knelt down next to Amane, who was tying his shoelaces.\nAmane figured, from the door mirror and his own senses, that she was combing his hair with her fingers, for his hair was probably curly.\n“Do you need me to go shopping with you?”\n“Ah it’s fine. It’s not much, and it looks like it’s going to rain, so I have to hurry. It’s not much, I can do it alone.”\nGiven the weather, it might rain if he dithered outside for too long. Furthermore, while the clouds were blocking the sun, he did not want to remain outdoors for long.\nHe would be back soon after shopping, so he assumed it would be faster for him to go alone, which was why he refused. Mahiru looked a little disappointed, “…I see.” and Amane hastily looked up at her.\n“Ah, I don’t mean that I don’t want you to go.”\n“I-I know. I simply wish to go out with you.”\n“…When we’re on our date next time, okay?”\nIf they were to go out, Amane hoped to do so the next time they went dating. After all, the ladies had to prepare themselves, and could not simply leave.\nHe gently reached his head out to pat her head. She widened her eyes, “Understood.” and smiled.\n“I shall wait for your return.”\n“Right.”\nIt seemed she accepted this, so he too nodded, took his bag, and left.\nLater on, Amane was really thankful that he did not bring Mahiru along.\n“…Well, it rained.”\nHe knew the weather did not look good, and as expected, the raindrops fell one after another, pelting on his clothes. His clothes were heavier than when he left home, darker in color. The fabric clinging onto his body was annoying, so he tugged at them for air.\nLuckily for him, the goods he bought were in plastic bags, and were safe from the rain. The only thing that suffered this time was Amane, who was completely soaked once he got home.\n“Welcome back, Amane-kun. It really rained heavily, no?”\nMahiru teetered to the entrance in slippers, and widened her eyes once she saw him.\nShe probably never expected him to be this drenched, and he never expected the rain to be such a downpour.\n“I’m back. Didn’t expect the rain to be that big.”\n“It would be great if that weather remained until you returned…do hurry and wash up. I have prepared your clothes.”\n“Oh, thanks.”\nMahiru naturally received the items from Amane’s hands with a smile, and he felt his heart warm.\nHe felt a familial sense in this natural conversation, either of peace or bliss, and was a little ticklish inside.\n“…It feels great.”\n“Hm?”\n“It feels great to have someone prepare for my bath, and welcome me like this.”\nSince his parents had to work, Amane never got a chance to experience this. However, as it was common in manga and dramas, he was quietly envious.\nAnd once he felt this happiness of a family, he was really ticklish, as though a warm, spring sun was shining into his heart.\nHe felt unspeakably blessed, for this conversation was between two who wanted to cherish each other for their entire lives.\nMahiru’s cheeks were a little red, and she shriveled. “I’ll take a bath, thanks.” Amane chuckled, and passed her by.\nIt might be unfitting of him to say such things, but he was so delighted that he could not hide the glee on his face.\nOnce he was done bathing, he found Mahiru waiting for him at the living room sofa, holding a blow dryer.\nThere was a blow dryer in the washroom, but it appeared she knew he would leave the bath without drying his hair, and was prepared.\n“It feels good to have air conditioning right after a bath.”\n“It is cooling, but you may catch colds easily…do sit there, hurry.”\n“It’s fine though.”\n“If you leave it be, you may catch a cold, or damage your hair.”\nEnough with that, hurry and sit down,\nonce Mahiru said so, Amane obediently sat next to her, and she stood up, went behind the sofa, and plugged in the dryer.\nShe then wiped away the water using a towel, which made him ticklish, more mentally than physically at list.\n“You do have to change this lazy habit of yours, Amane-kun. There are times when you are half-naked after showering.”\n“It’s hot though…I’ll dress up in the winter.”\n“Of course you have to when it is cold. You cannot be baring your upper body even though the weather is hot. will catch colds easily. I will not allow it as long as my eyes remain black and alive.”\nYour eyes are caramel. Are you intending to be with me forever?\nAmane suppressed the urge to do so, and had Mahiru continue as he honestly answered, “I’ll take note of that”.\nAfter all, it was comfortable having someone take care of him. He was sorry about that, but Mahiru wiping the water off him left him really refreshed.\nOnce she absorbed most of the moisture with her deft movements, Mahiru took the dryer she prepared, which then exuded warm air.\nShe always took care of her own hair. Even though she was not being subdued about it, her movements were rather comforting.\nAmane disliked others touching his hair, and it was the first time he felt relieved having others take care of his hair. Perhaps he liked it when a certain person touched his hair after all.\n“It is really unfair how smooth your hair is even though you hardly care for it.”\nAmane heard a little murmur as the dryer bellowed.\n“Really? Well, I don’t really take care of my hair as much as you do, Mahiru, but it’s amazing how silky and smooth your hair is when you work so hard.”\nMahiru’s hair was fine like silk, and one would assume, through looking, that she put in much effort into taking care of it.\nAs Amane often touched it, he knew Mahiru’s flax-colored hair was straight, soft, fine, and felt good.\nThe pretty, straight hair were devoid of split ends, and had an angelic glow anyone would be envious of. Amane was really impressed by how she managed to keep this long hair full of glow.\n“It takes a long time to maintain long hair. It is really troublesome.”\n“Well yeah, I guess it’ll takes you a long time to take care of that.”\n“I did think of cutting it off…do you prefer short, or long hair, Amane-kun?”\n“I don’t really have a preference…both looks cute, but I just want you to be happy with your appearance. If possible, keep it at a length you like.”\nAfter all, females would not necessarily tidy their appearances for the male’s sake. Many ladies would keep their hair length as how they would like it.\nIf Amane told Mahiru to change her hairstyle, he would be delighted that she would change it to his preference, and yet conflicted.\nHe felt it was fine if Mahiru could maintain the appearance she liked, and no matter her hair length, she was adorable. He hoped she would go along with her own wishes, and not be affected by whatever he said.\n“…Is that so?”\n“Do you want me to have a certain hairstyle.”\n“I like you no matter the hairstyle you have.”\n“Really? I’ll take it as that then.”\n“…Yes.”\nAmane did not look back, but he sensed a bashful mood behind him, along with a giggle.\nIt seemed he answered correctly.\nMahiru happily dried his hair. Suddenly, her fingers, which were combing his hair, stopped moving.\n“But…”\n“Hm?”\n“Your hair curls up when it is wet, Amane-kun, and that is really,”\n“Really?”\n“…Alluring…and handsome, I think.”\nIt seemed Mahiru merely wanted to express her thoughts, and not actually want some make out but once Amane heard her mutter, his lips formed a smile.\n“Shall we do it?”\n“N-no need! I will die!”\nAmane suggested half-jokingly, and it seemed Mahiru shook her head violently, so much that the movements affected her hand on his hair.\nSurely her face was completely red.\nAmane regretted that he could not see that face, and merely chuckled as he imagined Mahiru’s embarrassed look behind him.",

      "content": "“How about this, Mahiru-chan?”\n“Ahh…this is fine. The laces feel good.”\nAmane was at a corner of a shop, lazily watching two girls converse…though in terms of age, it was between a girl and a lady.\nNext to him, Shuuto too watched them lazily.\n“Both of them look really happy.”\n“Hm…why are the ladies so enthusiastic about clothes?”\nThe four of them arrived at a shopping mall as Mahiru wished for it. The two females were at the clothes shop, eagerly matching clothes on themselves, and that was when Amane had nothing to do.\nHe did not think it was a pain to accompany them on their shopping trip, picking clothes, but he had difficulty talking to them as they had seemingly formed a garden for ladies, excitedly chatting away. Thus, he kept this distance.\nShuuto in turn stood next to Amane, probably because he wanted to see the two excited ladies.\n“I suppose no matter their ages, girls hope to maintain their beauty; perhaps one reason is that they simply like to dress up.”\n“Well, it’s fine to look, I guess?”\n“How they’re dressed up?”\n“That too. The main reason though is that they’re happy to pick clothes.”\nIt seemed most boys would find it a hassle to go shopping with girls, but Amane was used to it since he was often asked to accompany Shihoko. He was also not the impatient type, and could find some fun while waiting.\nAlready, he was very satisfied to see Mahiru smile, and really enjoyed this time as a rsult.\n“Hmm, I see you too are starting to enjoy this, Amane.”\n“What are you two doing in the corner, Shuuto-san, Amane? Come here.”\nIt appeared Shihoko had noticed Amane and Shuuto, the latter nodding away, and she waved at them, ushering them over.\nMahiru too was looking at them, holding two clothing in her hands.\nBoth father and son went over as they were summoned. Shihoko beamed happily as she grabbed Mahiru’s shoulders from behind, gently nudging her towards him.\n“Now which of these suit Mahiru-chan more?”\nIt appeared Shihoko wanted Amane to choose clothes for Mahiru.\nHe had a look, and found a blouse with laces befitting a princess, and one was a pastel blue blouse that looked calm and cheery.\nTruth be told, Amane felt both really suited her. After all, no matter the one he preferred, Amane felt he should not nitpick since Mahiru was the one who wanted to buy it.\n“You can choose, Mahiru.”\n“…E-erm, I want to know of your likes, Amane-kun, so I asked…”\nMahiru lowered her eyes bashfully, and looked up towards him with tentative anticipation, causing him to gsap.\nHis heart raced from the mere knowledge that she wanted to match his tastes.\nThere was no doubt he already liked how Mahiru was, but she wanted to wear the clothes Amane liked, which he was really delighted about.\nHe sensed his cheeks blushing as he compared the blouses with Mahiru’s face, and chose the one with laces.\nMahiru smiled as she picked the one Amane chose, putting the other blouse back.\n“…She’s really adorable, isn’t she?”\n“I know.”\n“You aren’t holding back now.”\n“Shut up.”\nShihoko chimed with a smile, and Amane turned his face aside.",

      "content": "They bought clothes, left the shop, and wandered aimlessly in the shopping mall.\nThe mall was the largest in the prefecture, and Amane had assumed it would be boring just walking around, but it was unexpectedly interesting. He did not think it was suffering, but the onlookers’ gaze gave him an indescribable feeling.\nHis bias aside, his parents were nice looking, and little would be said of Mahiru. It was no wonder they had many gazes upon them.\nMahiru was long used to this, and latched onto his arm without a care in the world.\nWhile she was used to the onlookers’ stares, it seemed she was still a little embarrassed about walking with her arm latch onto him, for her face was a little red.\nOn his side, Amane felt something soft poking at him, and really was unable to calm down, but if he clearly conveyed these feelings, Shihoko would obviously tease him like no tomorrow. He did his best not to show his emotions on his face.\nHe held the bag containing Mahiru’s clothes, diverting his attention, but Mahiru clung firmly onto him, as though asking why he was not looking at her, which left him in a major pinch.\n“Say, Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“…Ah, well.”\n“What is it?”\n“…You didn’t bring the clothes you bought on Golden Week, right?”\nAmane wondered if he should point out that Mahiru’s breasts were rubbing against him, but once he recalled that she would occasionally say impish things, that it was on purpose, he hesitated again, and decided to talk about something else.\nMahiru was dressed in a princess-like, pure looking one piece dress, not the off-shoulder dress she bought the last time. She said she would wear it to show Amane, but Amane never got to see it, and wondered what it was about.\nOnce she heard the words Golden Week, Mahiru blinked away, and become bashful.\n“…I want to wear it for you when we are dating alone.”\n“…I-I see.”\n“You will bring me along, no?”\nMahiru truly was adorable, leaning on him and tilting her head, and he slowly held the palm that was latched onto him.\n“…I think we can talk about that when we’re alone. It’s a family trip now, different from a date.”\n“…Y-yes.”\n“Anywhere you want to go to?”\n“I am fine with any place as long as I am with you, Amane-kun.”\n“If you say so, I don’t want to go anywhere. It’s great to see you dressed up, but I don’t want to show you to anyone.”\n“…We shall have a date at home then. I am fine with that. It is said the weather over the upcoming days will be terrible.\nOn another note, it seemed the weather report had forecasted terrible weather, due to an approaching typhoon.\nThe typhoon would not arrive, but the aftereffects sweeping by might cause rain.\nIt should be long gone by the time Amane and Mahiru returned home, but since they were at his hometown, he did wish for some nice weather.\nDue to the typhoon, there was a likelihood that they would not be able to go out. So he thought, but it seemed Mahiru wanted to spend time alone with him, and was not really insistent on going out.\nAmane planned to check the weather once he got back, and held her hand firmly once again.\n“Same here. I’m fine with anywhere as long as I’m with you. Anyway, we’ll plan according to the weather.”\n“Yes.”\n“…I thought you two would be making out already, but you’re planning dates now?”\n“Too bad we already have plans for that.”\nShihoko, who was walking before them, teased them jokingly, and Amane nonchalantly retorted. His parents giggled before them.\nHowever, they seemed more relieved than impish, and turned ahead without pursuing the matter. Amane snorted once again, and held Mahiru’s hand.",

      "content": "The worry days ago came to pass.\n“It’s raining.”\n“Yes it is.”\nThe water pelted upon the ground, causing loud sounds. Amane and Mahiru exchanged looks, and nodded away.\nThey had a premonition from the weather report, but they still felt conflicted, given that it would be raining for the remaining days of their trip.\nLuckily, there was no warning sounded, so Amane’s parents went to work.\n“We can’t go out unless we’re planning to get soaked out there.”\n“We may catch a cold as a result, Amane-kun. That will not do.”\n“Yeah. Let’s just rest at home.”\nBoth preferred to stay at home, and did not think it was anything bad. They found it a pity that they could not go out, but were otherwise indifferent.\nBoth of them were at home, and Amane first held Mahiru’s hand, sitting on the cushion laid out on the floor.\nWhile doing so, he watched the mini TV in the room, and used the reflection to see how Mahiru was being.\nIt seemed that though the date was ruined, Mahiru was not too bothered about it. Her eyes sparkled as she saw the cute cat commercial aired on the TV.\nShe liked cats, and so did Amane. Thus, Amane thought it would be great if they could raise cats, and touched her little hand, seemingly tickling it.\nMahiru gave a reproaching look towards Amane, probably because she was feeling ticklish. She did not say anything, but she clearly was about to say,\ngoodness me.\nAmane smiled at her, pulled her over, and had her sit between his legs.\nHe then put his chin on her little shoulder, wrapped his arms around her waist, and she went completely beetroot.\n“…E-erm, Amane-kun.”\n“This is fine, right? I’m not going to touch anywhere strange.”\nAll he touched were her belly, back, and shoulder.\nOn a side note, the date had ended…or rather, was changed to a date at home, but Mahiru was wearing the off-shoulder dress, probably because she wanted to show it to Amane. Thus, Amane could feel the smooth skin of the exposed shoulder beneath his shin.\nHe looked down, and as the shoulders were exposed, so too was the collar. He could vagurely peek at the round lumps and the valley that was not completely hidden under the clothes.\nIt was a magnificent view, but some indecent thoughts might occur if he looked at it for too long. He turned his eyes aside, and kissed the blushing ear.\n“Kya…”\n“These clothes really suit you.”\n“M-may you please not whisper at my ear…it is bad for my body.”\n“Bad for your body?”\n“…I will shiver.”\n“Feeling cold?”\n“N-no…erm, well, I feel shiverish…”\n“Hm?”\nAmane blew at her ear, and she hurriedly turned over.\nThis time, she glared at him with a blushing face. She might pout away if he overdid it, “Sorry”, so he muttered, and embraced her body once again.\n“…You are bullying me, Amane-kun.”\n“Sorry sorry, I won’t do that again…but seriously, these clothes really suit you too well. I don’t want to show you to anyone else. Guess it all worked out now we’re at home.”\nTruth be told, most clothing would suit Mahiru well, and this off shoulder dress was no exception. He looked at the white, pearly skin anyone would have tried to lick on, and was grateful for the typhoon.\n“…Does it really suit me?”\n“Yep, it’s really cute. It shows your slender body really well, your skin’s pretty, and it really suits you.”\n“…That is good. I bought it to show you after all, Amane-kun.”\n“Show me that again.”\nAs Amane was embracing Mahiru from behind, he could not look at her up front. He did see her in the dress from up front before they entered the living room, but he wanted to enjoy the sight up close and personal.\nMahiru cautiously turned her body around once Amane said those words, and leaned her body onto Amane’s chest.\nHe put his hands on her knees and back, tucking her between his legs. Mahiru, who was already blushing, was redder than before.\n“Now this makes it easier.”\n“…You are really bold today, Amane-kun.”\n“Well, it’s a date, thought we’re at home.”\nShuuto repeated many times the previous day that the male should take the initiative in dates. They never left home, but a date was a date even at home, and Amane should seize the initiative.\nAmane tickled her cheek, and her reddened face relaxed as she bashfully lowered her eyes again.\n“…I will die if you are so enthusiastic every day, Amane-kun.”\n“I guess if we do this every day…”\n“N-no can do…my heart will be unable to take it.”\n“Is your heart pounding that much?”\n“…Yes.”\nSaying that, Mahiru grabbed Amane’s hand, and put it in the middle.\nActually, it was the back of the hand, but the soft warmth did reach him, along with the strong heartbeat that was much faster than before.\nThe fabric was thin, the heartbeat was clearly felt, and the softness was thoroughly emphasized.\nAmane gasped as he looked towards Mahiru, and their eyes met. Her caramel-colored eyes were bashful as they continued to stare at his, and it appeared she wanted to say something.\n“…It is unfair if your heart is not racing as much as mine.”\n“…My heart’s pounding at lot.”\n“Really?”\nMahiru buried her face on Amane’s chest.\nShe listened to the rhythm of his heartbeat. probably to hide her embarrassment. Amane knew then how loudly his heart was bounding, “it really is.” for Mahiru muttered happily.\n“…Well, there’s no way my heart won’t race when my girlfriend’s doing such things.”\n“You seem to be taking it in stride recently though, Amane-kun…that is devious of you.”\n“It’ll look bad on me if I don’t take it in stride, right?”\n“No, you are always a dashing person, Amane-kun.”\n“…Thanks for the praise.”\nAren’t you saying this to rattle me more?\nAmane had the urge to say so, but it appeared Mahiru’s words were really heartfelt, so he swallowed his words back.\nInstead, he embraced Mahiru, who was clinging onto his chest, and patted her head.\nDamn, you’re cute.\nHe accidentally blurted out, and Mahiru lifted her head somewhat, looking a little bashful. This little gesture pricked his urge to dote on her, for he too felt he was completely mesmerized.\nHe patted her head lovingly to regain his composure and empty his heart, and Mahiru’s shame too faded away as she comfortably let him pat her.\nIt seemed she liked headpats to begin with. This should be sufficient in calming her down.\n“…Say Mahiru.”\n“Hm?”\n“Is it fine if I consider this a date? We aren’t doing anything.”\n“I feel happy, so it is fine. Weather and location aside, the most important factor is who I am with.”\nMahiru said some really comforting words as she firmly embraced Amane. Amane too embraced her gently, “Yeah.” he muttered with a chuckle.",

      "content": "“Say, if this is a date, we’ve been dating all this while…you’ve been in my house often.”\nAmane did not think a home date was any special, probably because he was used to having Mahiru next to him.\nMahiru was practically available at his place all the time. However, they did not seem so intimate as they were at this point, merely leisurely watching the TV, laughing away, having meals, doing their homework, and nothing akin to the date.\nPerhaps it was this reason that he did not feel tense, or that his heart was not racing.\n“Fufu, yes. I suppose we have been dating at home every day, no?”\n“Maybe, though there are times when I want to go to your place instead of it just being at my place, Mahiru.”\n“My house…?”\n“Ah no, I’m not thinking of anything guilty. It’s just that I’m interested because I’ve never been there.”\nIn fact, Mahiru had been the one visiting Amane all the time, so Amane had an urge to visit hers.\nIt was merely borne out of curiosity to see how Mahiru’s room was like, but he really could not say anything, as a boy wanting to enter a girl’s room would have anyone second guessing.\n“I am fine with that…but there is nothing worth looking at, you know?”\n“I’m just interested…you don’t mind your lover’s room, Mahiru?”\n“I have visited your room often, Amane-kun.”\n“Yeah, you’ll wake me up, and sometimes even sleep in my room.”\nMahiru had many chances to visit Amane’s room. She would wake him up in the morning, and whenever he was not around, she would drop by to sleep.\nHe remembered one moment when he bought something, and wanted to change clothes at home, but found Mahiru sleeping sounding in his room, which left him awkward.\nHe did say that she could enter his house, and she did not see anything she should not, but he hoped she would understand how he would feel as her boyfriend, seeing how defenseless the girlfriend on the bed would be.\n“B-because…your scent is really comforting, Amane-kun…”\n“Well I can’t calm down. Any guy seeing his girlfriend on the bed will be attacking already.”\n“…You really are gentlemanly, Amane-kun.”\n“I’m glad that you’re careless because you trust me, but my sanity can’t take it, so watch yourself.”\n“Sorry.”\n“…Next time you do that, I’ll take a photo of you sleeping.”\n“P-please do not.”\n“Then watch it.”\nIt seemed Mahiru was not opposed to the idea of showing Amane her sleeping face, but she did not want him to take photos. He really did not understand what she was thinking.\n“I shall sleep in your house only when you are around.”\n“…Okay.”\nBecause I have been the one embarrassed.\nMahiru giggled impishly.\nDamn you’re cute,\nand Amane retorted with some begrudging praise, and gently kissed the winner on the cheek.\nThat alone left her completely beetroot, unable to say anything. Truth be told, nobody knew who actually won, and she was really adorable.\n“…You are despicable.\n“I don’t care.”\n“Am I not the one losing all the time…?”\n“No no no. I’m the one who lost, since I’m always mesmerized by you. Forgive me.”\nMahiru said that she had been losing, but that was not the case, for Amane was often beaten by her cuteness, and hoped she would occasionally aware the win to herself.\nAnd once she heard the word mesmerized, she blushed, and closed her eyes, saying, “I guess that is the case…” Amane chuckled once he saw her response.\nHe embraced her before she could realize that he chuckled in amusement, and put her face towards his chest.\nIt seemed she felt blessed to receive this, and she adjusted her posture slightly, before she probably found the best position for herself, and leaned her entire body onto him.\nHe understood that she was fawning over him because she trusted him. He had another urge to chuckle, for a different reason, and smiled.\n“…You really like to fawn around.”\n“You said I can, Amane-kun.”\n“I did, so do as you want.”\n“I will become a good-for-nothing…”\n“I’m already a good-for-nothing, so now I’ll make you a good-for-nothing.”\n“You may pass on that payback.”\nGoodness,\nMahiru lifted her head, obviously looking a little displeased. Amane gently kissed her forehead, and her face immediately turned red, ringing like a steam engine.\n“…I have a feeling you are trying to pull a fast one on me.”\n“You dislike it?”\n“Not at all…ugh.”\nHow sleazy of you,\nshe muttered, and rolled her forehead on his chest. Once again, Amane chuckled, and carefully tidied her somewhat messy her.\nOnce done, she regained her usual straight hair. The smooth, silky hair felt comforting to touch, and even though the hair was tidied, Amane wanted to continue touching it. Mahiru did not show any displeasure; on the contrary, she looked a little delighted. Thus, he did not stop.\nAmane had such thoughts as he stroked Mahiru’s hair like a kitten on his lap. At this moment, Mahiru seemed to have cooled off completely as she rubbed her face onto him.\n“…I feel happy being able to laze peacefully at your old house, Amane-kun.”\n“That’s great. I was worried that you wouldn’t be happy about being at my house.”\n“Fufu, I am reluctant to return home now.”\nAmane was worried what would he have to do if she was unused, or uncomfortable with this place before they arrived, but it seemed he worried too much.\n“You’re already used to my house.”\n“It is because Shihoko-san and Shuuto-san were so good to me.”\n“Mom and dad dote on you more than me.”\n“Are you jealous?”\n“No.”\nAmane already knew Shihoko and Shuuto would care for Mahiru, and she would remain by his side. Thus, he would not pout.\nHe felt that his parents were really too fond of their future daughter, but he could understand their feelings since they wanted one the entire time.\n“Fufu. Is that so? If you are pouting, I shall hug you.”\n“You’re not going to huge me until I pout?”\n“I shall hug you whenever you want to, Amane-kun.”\n“Shall we?”\n“Sure.”\nMahiru stopped leaning on Amane, and opened her arms wide. Amane pursed his lips, wondering how he should react.\nShe probably intended for him to leap into her clutches. Given her fine curves and body along with that off-shoulder dress of hers, Amane would probably feel happiness burying his face in her chest, but surely many other incidents would follow.\nBut well, we’re dating, so this…\nthere was a little devil muttering inside him.\nHe would be allowed to enjoy however he wanted, as long as he did not go overboard…and as the desire caused him to falter, he let out a soft murmur.\nHe was powerless to resist this alluring temptation.\nHe wrapped his arms around her back, and buried his face into her opened nape.\nIf he lowered his face slightly, he would land upon the soft lumps. He could not do that much, but he brought his lips upon Mahiru’s beautiful collarbone, and silky white skin, savoring the sweet fragrance of her body.\nIt seemed Mahiru felt a little ticklish, but she did not dislike it at all, and wrapped her arms around his back, embracing him as though she was doting on a child.\n“Fufu, you really do like to fawn around too, Amane-kun.”\n“Shut up.”\n“You may continue to fawn over me. I shall turn you into a good-for-nothing.”\n“I’m already one.”\nAmane sensed himself melting, and also that he was melting her. Both sides doted upon each other, bonding with each other, and ended up at a point where neither could exist withou each other.\nAmane kissed the clean neck, and lifted his head towards Mahiru. He found her giggling, enjoying herself while still embracing him.\n“You look rather small from here. You usually seem large and very reliable.”\n“Really? …Well, you’re small and slim, Mahiru. It’s easy to hug you.”\n“You are being hugged by me though…but I think it is because I have been hugged by you all this while, Amane-kun.”\n“So you really belong to me now, Mahiru.”\n“Yes…you are mine too, Amane-kun.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Fufu.”\nMahiru giggled happily as she patted Amane, and Amane found himself to be near his limits as he lifted his waist, and kissed her neck.\nShe then shivered so quickly, for her neck was as sensitive as her ears were.\n“Uuu…please do not leave a mark here.”\n“I won’t, but I’ll kiss you.”\n“Th-that tickles too…”\n“You can shove me away if you hate it.”\n“…Meanie.”\nYou know I cannot do this.\nAmane seemed to have heard this pout, but he knew that if Mahiru really hated this, she would reject him, and thus, she had no issues with him doing so.\nOnce he gently kissed her skin, she patted his back, seemingly indicating for him to stop, so he did.\nShe glared at him, her face seemingly burning red from within. Amane hugged her, and patted her head to console her.\n“…Anyway, you hate to go back now?”\nShe might pout if he continue to cling onto her, so he tried going back to the original topic. Mahiru was stunned to hear that, and then, she showed a faint smile.\n“N-not at all…just a little lonely.”\n“That’s good.”\n“Hm?”\n“Shows that you’re enjoying your time here.”\n“Th-that may be so.”\n“We’ll drop by next time. End of the year, or next summer.”\nAmane would return to his hometown again after this trip. His parents asked that he show up during the summer and winter breaks, so if Mahiru was willing, he was fine with returning together once again.\nShihoko and Shuuto would be pleased, and Amane would not need to leave Mahiru for long.\n“…Next time.”\n“You’re not willing?”\n“No-not at all.”\n“I see…just think of this place as your hometown.”\n“…Yes.”\nAmane hoped for Mahiru to have a place she belonged, and once he muttered with such intentions, Mahiru clearly showed how elated she was as she gave a sweet smile, burying her face into his shoulder.\nResult of today’s battle: Every reader’s loss",

      "content": "“You’re really going back, huh?”\nShihoko stood at the gantry where she welcomed them back, clearly disappointed as she muttered away.\n“Alright alright.” Next to her, Shuuto coaxed an obviously forlorn looking Shihoko.\nAmane and Mahiru had stayed longer than they planned, and they could not leave their houses empty, so they decided to return…to their current homes.\nNaturally, Shihoko was looking reluctantly towards where Mahiru was. It seemed she was reluctant about leaving her cute daughter (to-be)\n“Apologies, but I do have to return home, and I have other plans…”\n“Don’t mind my mom. The sun’s going to set if we keep listening to her rambles.”\n“You’re really cold towards your mother, dear…”\n“I should be saying that about you, mom. It’s your fault for prioritizing a cute daughter instead of your own son.”\n“Of course. It’s obvious I’ll try to keep the adorable, obedient daughter who may not return anytime soon, instead of my own son who can return anytime.”\nAmane was in no mood to retort once he heard his mother’s flat out rebuttal.\nHe could understand what Shihoko was trying to convey, but he felt mentally exhausted, and that Shihoko’s actions were inappropriate.\nAmane glanced discreetly at Shuuto, whose face was giving the kind\ngoodness gracious\nsmile. He could not hope for the latter to stop Shihoko.\nMahiru gave an awkward smile, one that seemed somewhat bashful, for perhaps she was delighted by this.\n“E-erm, if there is a chance, may I disturb…”\n“Drop by whenever you want! Anytime!”\n“Let her finish her words…but thank goodness Mahiru.”\n“Yes.”\nAmane patted Mahiru, who showed an earnest, delighted smile. Shihoko smirked away, and Amane played dumb.\n“Well, it’s good that Shiina-san has taken a liking to our house. To be honest, I was wondering what to do if she was always too courteous.”\n“I think Mahiru just doesn’t have a chance to refuse since mom’s too enthusiastic, and that’s why she got used to it.”\n“Haha, I guess so. Shihoko-san is always so feisty, for good or bad.”\n“…Are both of you just roasting me now?”\n“I think that is a good point of yours, Shihoko-san, and also what makes you attractive.”\n“Oh my.”\nShihoko immediately went from a pout to a happy smile. Amane gave a wry smile, and lifted his head towards the clock on the wall.\n“It’s about time to leave then.”\n“Yes, I guess it is time…”\nThey wanted to hurry and get some early seats, so they had to go their separate ways even though they were reluctant to.\nIt seemed Amane’s parents understood this. “Do come by next time.” Shihoko’s eyes seemed full of regret when she held Mahiru’s hands, and shook them.\nShuuto in turn gave Shihoko a gentle look, and once again, looked towards Mahiru.\n“Thank you for coming by this time, Shiina-san. I’m glad that the house got livelier.”\n“Sa-same here. Thank you very much.”\n“Fufu. If you argue with Amane, you can just say\nI’m going home!\nand escape here.”\n“You think I’ll hurt Mahiru that much?”\nHow rude,\nAmane gave Shuuto such a glance, and was met with a hearty smile.\n“I don’t, and if you do, I will wonder how I educated you. There will be misunderstandings and differences however…and sometimes, you may want to be alone, or rely on an adult. You may drop by anytime if anything happens. We’ll always leave our doors open to you.”\n“…Understood.”\nYou may drop by anytime,\nMahiru’s caramel colored eyes turned moist for a moment, but were filled with delight the next moment.\nAmane’s eyes too heated up once he saw an earnest, heartfelt smile.\n…I wonder if Mahiru understands a little the happiness of a family\nAmane had always thought that it would be great for Mahiru, who hardly lived with any family, to understand various forms of happiness in the future.\nHe too gave an amicable smile once Mahiru lowered her eyebrows and smile, and gently held her hand.",

      "content": "The day after they reached home, the first thing they did was to clean up.\nAmane felt so tired upon reaching home, and let it be. The house was full of dust two weeks after it was vacated, not much, but it would be better for him to clean up as much as possible since Mahiru would be staying.\nThus, Amane started cleaning the house using the tricks Mahiru taught him. On a side note, it appeared Mahiru too was cleaning her own house, so Amane was putting up a solo fight.\nThanks to her, he could maintain the cleanliness of his house, though he might not be considered adept at it.\nYou do not have to spend much effort if you do this studiously. You will expend much time effort because you let it pile up.\nIt was as she said.\nHe abided by her advise, and a simple cleanup was all it took to tidy the house.\nThere was some dust on the furniture, and it did not take him much time.\nHe deftly wiped away the dust on the furniture, vacuumed it away, wiped the windows, and looked at the time.\nIt was past 3pm.\nThe supermarket he frequented often held their discount sales starting at 4pm. It was about time for him to leave.\nNow that I think of it, I’ve become quite the housemaker\n.\nHe had to visit the supermarket as he had cleared out his fridge before they returned home, and there was no ingredient for dinner. He managed his breakfast and lunch with cup ramen and frozen food, but not for dinner.\nAmane was to buy the ingredients, and share half the cost. It was normal to think of spending less…but still a little strange a high school boy to think of food expenses.\nHe chuckled at this change in him. In any case, he had to change his slightly dirty clothes, so he went to his room.\n“…Hm?”\nAmane was headed to the supermarket with thoughts on his mind, only to spot a familiar looking light colored hair.\nHe instinctively turned around, and naturally, found only a back facing him. The hair was not as long as Mahiru, and he was a different gender to begin with. It was rare to see such natural hair color.\nSo he pondered about the rare encounter as he entered the supermarket. He was putting the dinner ingredients into the basket, “Eh?” only to be met with a familiar voice behind me.\n“It’s rare to see you here.”\n“Ah, Kuju?”\nIt was the boy who he was acquainted with during the cavalry battle thanks to Kadowaki, and like Amane, he too had a basket on his elbow.\nTo wit, he had candy and sweets in his basket, stuff more typical of a high school boy’s purchase than Amane.\n“You stay around here, Fujimiya?”\n“Yeah. I don’t remember you staying around here though, Kuju…”\n“Just staying over at a friend’s place, so I’m out shopping. Wait…dinner?”\n“Yep, ingredients for dinner.”\nIt was obvious on first glance that Amane had stuff that would never be mistaken as tidbits, like raw chicken, carrots, milk and tofu.\n“Speaking of which, you’re living alone? That’s really amazing.”\n“Well, I rely on Mahiru for my meals though…”\n“…I think you mentioned that…that’s an amazing life you’re living.”\n“Yeah. I’m always grateful for Mahiru all this while.”\nAmane’s food intake would probably be in disarray if not for Mahiru. He could at least tidy up the house, but he was bad at cooking.\nWithout her, he would not have this lifestyle to speak of.\nI really got to thank her,\nAmane muttered with a wry smile, and Kuju sighed hard.\n“But well, seriously…you’re heads over heels for her, you know?”\n“Yeah. Same goes for Mahiru.”\n“You sound very confident.”\n“I know she really loves me.”\nAmane was never confident of Mahiru’s feelings towards him before they started dating, but it was different at this point. He knew she treasured and loved him lots, and understood that her earnest wish was to stay by his side.\nHe realized that he was not thinking too much, but that it was a fact. This was proof enough that Amane gained self-confidence.\nThis time, it was Kuju who showed a wry smile at Amane’s deft answer.\n“Well, it’s great that you have confidence, much better than when you two were playing tango even though you two obviously had feelings.”\n“How harsh.”\n“It’s obvious that she liked you. Well, it’s got nothing to me, but I guess it’s best for you two to be happy.”\nKuju shrugged. Amane understood it was praise completely from him, and smiled.\n“…Well, Yuuta accepted this, so I guess it’s a happy ending.”\n“Hm?”\n“Ah, nothing. I’ll go pay up then.”\nWhy Kadowaki?\nAmane wondered, but Kuju hurried off before he could ask. Though curious, Amane turned around, and slipped the dinner ingredients into the basket, as recorded on the phone.\n#JusticeForKadowaki",

      "content": "Amane returned to the apartments, and met the man he had just passed by, looking up at it.\nHe never expected the man to be looking at his own apartment, and stood there, waiting.\nThe hair color remained familiar.\nHowever, Amane saw nothing of him other than his back. He was not too big, and was probably of the same size as Amane, probably a little shorter.\nThe man continued to look at the apartment.\nAmane could not see the expression from this angle, but he understood the man was just looking up.\nCurious he was, Amane was uncomfortable with the idea of talking to a stranger, and merely passed by. He might be suspected if he went forward and suddenly turned his head around, so he probably would be unable to affirm the man’s appearance.\nNevertheless, he remained curious, so he checked the grocery bag, before continuing.\nAmane felt apologetic as he passed the man by, bumping the spoils from the supermarket into him, and accidentally dropped it.\nOn a side note, the contents were snacks and emergency food supplies he had put separately, and thus would not inconvenience Mahiru even though they were dropped.\nAmane bumped into the man and dropped the items, and the man’s attention was directed towards Amane.\nHe picked up the grocery bag, dusted it off, and looked up at the man.\nAs I expected,\nsuch was the feeling Amane had, since he really did.\nThe man was very handsome, one who garnered much attention. He lowered his eyebrows apologetically once he saw Amane, and an obvious look of guilt was in his clear brown eyes.\nHowever, Amane was the one who felt guilty, as he was the one who bumped into the man.\n“Sorry for being careless.”\n“Ah, no, I should be the one apologizing. I should not be stopping here and blocking you.”\nHis voice was poised, calm, gentle and deep. Amane heard the earnest apology, lowered his head once again, “No, my bad.” and muttered so.\nHe was sure of what he wanted to ascertain. There was no concrete proof, but he probably was the person Amane assumed.\nAmane then nonchalantly passed the man by as though nothing happened.\nThe man probably did not know who Amane was, and probably had no suspicion.\nIt happened in a mere ten seconds or so, but Amane was strangely tense, for it involved the girl he loved.\nRelieved, he went to the apartment entrance…and it was at this moment that the girl he loved appeared.\n“Welcome back, Amane-kun.”\nAmane never expected her to welcome him at the entrance, and was flabbergasted. Mahiru stood there, stunned, giving him a skeptical look.\n“What is with that expression?”\n“N-nothing…just that you just showed up,,,:\n“You did send a message stating that you will be home, no? I want to help since you bought a lot.”\n“I-I see.”\nIt seemed Mahiru merely intended to help collect the items. Amane’s heart was heavily burdened when he recognized the man, and his heart raced faster.\nHe worried what would happen if Mahiru noticed that man, and instinctively turned back, only to find that the man, who was standing 10 meters or so away, had disappeared.\n…He’s not here to see Mahiru? He’s just going back once he sees Mahiru.\nThe latter was definitely impossible given Mahiru’s expression; if he was here to see Mahiru, he would would have approached them once she appeared, and had no reason to leave.\nSo, why did he show up?\nFor what reason did he approach Mahiru’s apartment, and looked up at the level she was living at.\n“What is it?”\n“No, nothing at all.”\nLuckily or not, it seemed Mahiru did not notice the man. Amane was a little relieved, handed over the bag of snacks to Mahiru, who wanted to carry them, and took the elevator with her.\nHikaru Mikado, is that you?",

      "content": "It was the night when Mahiru welcomed Amane at the apartment entrance, and Amane glanced aside at Mahiru, seated next to him, wondering if he should mention about the man he met.\nHe was not completely sure, but the man most probably was Mahiru’s father.\nMahiru did not seem very similar to her mother, on first impression, and one might doubt if they were mother and daughter. The man on this day looked very similar to Mahiru, and it was obvious that he was the father.\nThe handsome, kind face, hair and eye colors resembled Mahiru if she was a male and aged. Amane could not simply dismiss him as someone unrelated given how much they resembled each other.\nHowever, he wondered if he should actually tell Mahiru.\nHe knew Mahiru was on bad terms with her parents, and knew that she would often avoid this topic. If possible, he wanted to act as if nothing happened.\nDespite that, Mahiru would surely falter if the man appeared again and met Mahiru. At the same time, he felt she should be mentally prepared.\n“…What is it? You have been looking at me all this while.”\nAmane was frustrated on what he should do, and Mahiru seemed to have sensed the stare as she looked towards him in confusion.\n“Ah, no, erm…”\n“What is it? Are you hiding something?”\n“…How do I put it?”\n“Please say whatever you want. I shall not ask more if you do not wish to say so, but I am all ears if you will talk.”\nOnce Mahiru indicated that she would respect Amane’s wishes, Amane spent 10 seconds wondering what he should do…and slowly spoke up.\n“…Erm, just now…when I went shopping, I met a guy.”\n“Yes, yes, is that so?”\nMahiru might not have understood what Amane was getting at, and nodded first. Amane stared at her eyes intently.\nThe color of those eyes were exactly the same as the man he met.\n“That man was staring out there, staring at the apartments…his eyes really resembled yours.”\n“…Yes?”\n“His eyes and hair colors are just like yours, Mahiru. So is his face.”\nIs he your father?\nAmane cautiously hinted, and Mahiru seemed perturbed, rather than shaken.\n“W-what…are you implying that someone resembles my father?”\n“Probably.”\nSo he said, but he was almost certain the man was Mahiru’s father. The face and demeanor were very similar to Mahiru, so much so that there was no way they did not have any blood relations.\nOnce she heard Amane’s words, Mahiru blinked away, and narrowed her eyes.\nShe probably was dumbfounded.\n“…You must be mistaken, I believe?”\n“Huh?”\n“My father has no interest in me at all. He does have a child with his mistress, although they are not married. I would have assumed he never thought of me. He never contacted me for reasons other than business.”\nMahiru tersely noted, her eyes turning from dumbfounded to aloof.\n“He has no reason to meet me, and if he did, he should have contacted me. That had never happened before though.”\nShe said adamantly, Amane stared at her face, and held her hand.\n“And what does he have to say at this point? He abandoned his daughter for more than ten years, got along well with another woman, and what purpose has he has to look for me?”\n“Mahiru.”\n“Even if they cared about me…I cannot think of them as my parents. Those people are just blood related, and not the parents who raised me. The only parent who raised me was Koyuki-san.”\nShe continued with a monotonous voice, filled with countless thorns in them. Amane had enough, and embraced her tightly.\nThe thorns borne out of the voice were hurting Mahiru herself. She did not seem to be acting tough, but it felt like she was choking herself.\nThe proof was that even though her face seemed devoid of expression, she clearly was hurting. A blank look she had, it looked hurtful.\nMahiru slowly lifted her head towards Amane while in his clutches.\n“…What?”\n“…More intimacy.”\n“For who?”\n“Me.”\n“…I see.”\nMahiru whispered, and sighed as she leaned on him.\n“…I do not mind at all, actually. That man has nothing to do with me.”\n“I see.”\n“…And I have a new home.”\n“Oh, yeah.”\n“…So, I am fine.”\n“Okay.”\nAmane was glad that Mahiru could think of his old place as her home, and once again, he realized her feelings for her own family as he gently patted her head.",

      "content": "“…So, what shall I do if I meet that man?”\nMahiru continued to lean on Amane’s chest, and Amane asked while he gently patted her head. She then slowly lifted her head, and stared back at him with a peaceful look.\nHer eyes showed no pain or hesitation, and he relaxed, looking back at her. Mahiru seemed a little gaudy to be stared at, and lowered her eyebrows.\n“…I think you may do whatever you want, Amane-kun.”\n“You don’t want to ask me what I want to do?”\nHe thought she would not let him interfere, but she slowly shook her head.\n“No…it would be a different matter if we met him together, or if I met him alone. Since you met that man alone, Amane-kun, I shall not say comment on what you intend to do. Of course, I wish you will inform me first.”\n“…I see. So you mean you’re not willing to get involved?”\n“Yes…if he has something to say to me, he should go up to me and say something, and send me a letter. It is strange of him to hide and observe. I shall not do anything if he is not looking for me, and I shall ignore him.”\nMahiru was really skeptical of the man resembling her father, but it seemed she would not take the initiative to look for him. Amane probably would do the same if he was in Mahiru’s shoes, but she chose to ignore him even though she had a chance to be sure, and once again, he understood how grave the dispute between Mahiru and her parents.\nOnce again, she buried her head into Amane’s chest, fawning about. “I see.” Amane merely answered, cupped her knees and back, and put her on his lap.\nHe gently chuckled when she showed a shocked look, and kissed her on the forehead to console her. She quickly turned beetroot, and buried her face into his chest, hiding it.\nShe seemed a little forceful compared to before, probably because she wanted to hide her embarrassment, and it felt like a headbutt into his chest. She looked so adorable that Amane had to chuckle.\n“…Well, I’m not you, and I can’t say much to your family…I think it’s best for me to follow your wishes though, so I’ll support your decision.”\nAmane was still an outsider. Of course, this was merely ‘something happening now’.\nHe would never probe further into her family situation, and would only supporting her silently by the side as long as she wished for him not to go further.\nDespite that, Amane decided to remain by her side. No matter her family situation, he wanted her.\nIf Mahiru said she wanted to flee her family, Amane was adamant about fulfilling it.\n“Yes.” so she nodded and seemingly muttered once she heard his words. He put his hand on her head.\n“Relax, I’ll steal you away if anything happens.”\nAmane muttered with a voice Mahiru could barely hear, and chuckled jokingly. Mahiru then abruptly lifted her face towards him, her face redder than before, and he played dumb as he ruffled her hair.",

      "content": "Five days passed ever since Amane met the man who appeared to be Mahiru’s father.\nAmane did pay attention whenever he went out, just in case he did meet the man, but his worry did not come to pass.\nHe probably came to meet Mahiru, or at least, to check on her, and hesitated at the last moment. Otherwise, he would have approached her.\nAmane asked Mahiru, and she never was contacted by him, nor did she meet him. Perhaps he did not intend to meet Mahiru at this time.\n“…I don’t get it.”\nAmane understood that the man wanted to visit, but not the motive. The strange mystery continued to leave goosebumps in his heart.\nDespite that, Amane could not press the matter too much. He could not do anything until the man actually made contact.\n“What’s wrong with you?”\n“Just something on my mind.”\nItsuki was at Amane’s house, with his summer homework, and looked perturbed as Amane was merely grumbling away, looking at his assignments.\n“It’s rare to see you voice your troubles…alright, tell your big bro here.”\n“Aren’t you born later than me?”\n“Don’t sweat the details. Come on.”\nItsuki probably was sick of doing his assignments.\nHe tossed the mechanical pencil onto the table, slapped his own chest, basically telling Amane to leave it to him.\n…What do I do now?\nOf course, he could not tell Itsuki of Mahiru’s family situation, Even though the latter was a good friend, he could not reveal things Mahiru had decided to keep secret.\nAmane might be able to talk it out if it was his own secret, but he could not be forthfront and inform Itsuki of Mahiru’s secret.\nDespite that, he was quietly frustrated that he could not come up with an answer.\nAfter being silent for a while, he chose his words carefully, and said.\n“If there’s one guy who always never contacted you, and suddenly showed up, what would you think of about that?”\n“Is this about yourself?”\n“No comment.”\n“Oh? Sure.”\nItsuki showed a gaudy look at Amane’s comment, and seemed to have understood something. However, he did not pursue the matter further, and pondered.\n“Got to look at the situation…he never contacted beforehand, right?”\n“Nope.”\n“Hm…is he a stalker?”\n“…Not exactly.”\nThe man appeared at the apartment discreetly, and vanished without a trace the moment Mahiru appeared; he was not exactly a stalker, but there was something suspicious about him.\n“Barely, huh? I’m a little curious about that…hm, he’s probably concerned. I don’t know what relationship they have, but the possibility is that there might be something he had to verbally convey, or something caused him to change his mind, that he had to get involved.”\n“…Change his mind.”\n“I guess that’s the only possibility for those who never made contact, only to suddenly show up.”\nI don’t know how exactly it goes though,\nItsuki shrugged. “I guess it.” Amane noted wryly.\nConsidering what Itsuki had said, it was not strange for the man to appear, though the reasons remained unknown.\nAmane did not know of Mahiru’s father, how his personality was like, how he treated others, and he had no way to deal with this.\nIf there was, perhaps something happened with his mistress, or himself. He could not imagine any other reason why he wanted to meet Mahiru again.\n“I don’t know much, and I can’t say much, but if it’s me, I’ll definitely be curious enough to try and contact him. I don’t like to feel all gaudy and leave it be.”\n“It’s you though…”\n“Since you’re more passive, why don’t you wait for him to show up? I think he’ll show up again sooner or later. If he’s going to give up on making a direct appearance, he would have sent a message, made a call.”\nItsuki said that they could only wait since they did not understand the situation, and Amane too made the same conclusion.\nA major reason was that the man was looking for Mahiru, and Amane was helpless.\n“I guess that’s that.” Amane sighed, and Itsuki’s lips happily curled into a smile.\n“…Yo, you’re working hard for the one you love, young man.”\n“Wha?”\n“You’re easy to read. You would have said it’s about yourself if it’s really about you. Who else but Shiina-san’s matters would leave you so frustrated?”\n“…Shut up.”\n“I don’t have the right to interfere with others, so this is all I’ll go. Work hard for your cute girlfriend then, Amane.”\nItsuki jabbed his elbow at Amane, who looked displeased, and muttered back, “I get that.”",

      "content": "“Speaking of which, there’s a summer festival today. Shall we go for it?”\nOne week till the end of summer vacation, and Chitose suddenly showed up, asking.\n“…Say, you should have asked that a day ago at least.”\nHer words were too sudden, what would she have done if Amane had plans?\nFurthermore, they would need to prepare to go out for a festival. She should have informed them beforehand.\nLuckily, Amane and Mahiru had no plans, and had not decided on what to eat for dinner, so they could easily amend plans.\n“Sorry sorry. I heard from Ikkun that you two are rather busy, so I didn’t want to bother you two, until the day itself.”\n“Well, I’m conflicted by you saying this now, but you should have said this earlier, you know? And it’s a little too sudden today.”\n“I apologized already. I did inform Mahiru beforehand, you know?”\n“Though that was 10 minutes before you appeared…”\nMahiru wryly quipped as she served iced barley tea to Chitose.\n“Chitose-san is coming.” Mahiru suddenly told Amane, which obviously troubled the latter. There were moments when Itsuki would suddenly visit, but Amane never expected Chitose to do the same.\nChitose probably came over with the confidence that Amane was at home, but he hoped she would have said so a little earlier.\nAmane sighed as he saw Chitose happily drink the chilled barley tea, and glanced aside at Mahiru.\nIt seemed Mahiru was not opposed to visiting the festival.\nAmane wanted to bring Mahiru out to distract her, having considered that she was a little distraught about her father. He might appear again, but Amane hoped she would forget about it for the time being.\n“Hm, we can go…what do you think, Mahiru? Yukata for you?”\n“Eh? No, I do not have any with me.”\n“No, erm…I do. I think we have one that fits you.”\n“Why?”\n“Mom.”\nAmane reminded Mahiru of Shihoko’s existence, “Ahh…” who seemed to have understood immediately. To Mahiru, Shihoko was probably one who would want to put any cute clothing on Mahiru, and she would be right to assume so. Amane really could not laugh at this.\nWhen they returned from Amane’s hometown days ago, there were obviously a few pieces of clothing mixed with the delivered Amane should not be wearing.\n“Do get Mahiru-chan to wear them when you have the chance. I’ll leave the photos to you.”\nThis little slip of paper was stuffed together with the yukata and stuff, and Amane recalled himself being stunned speechless back then.\n“Eh, you’re wearing a yukata, Mahirun? I wanna see~!?”\n“Are you not wearing one?”\n“Don’t wanna. It’s cute, but it’s not easy to move in it, and I might not be full with the sash tied around me.”\n“That’s just you being a glutton.”\n“Hey you’re rude.”\nChitose really did not like clothing that bogged her down, and she was the gluttonous type. Thus, she did not wish to wear clothes that required much grace, like a yukata.\n“Anyway, where’s Itsuki?”\n“Hm? Ikkun’s coming over. He’s planning to meet us there.”\n“You’re making it sound like we’re definitely going…”\n“Fufufu, I think Mahirun won’t refuse me.”\n“Man, think about how it’ll inconvenience us…though we really got nothing.”\n“Sorry sorry.”\nAmane narrowed his eyes to a clearly unapologetic Chitose, but that was to be expected.\nAfter all, he did notify Itsuki the past few days that they had nothing to do, and this was probably the reason why they were invited.\nAmane hoped that Chitose would have invited them before dropping by, but it was important to change their mood, and he was grateful for her invitation.\n“So, what about you, Mahirun? Are you wearing a yukata?”\n“…Will I not stand out too much if I am the only one wearing it?”\n“If you don’t like being alone in wearing that, I can wear it…”\n“Eh, you have one, Amane-kun?”\n“Mom’s smart enough to put mine together with yours.”\nShihoko probably planned for Amane to wear them to the festival. He had completely forgotten to check if there was any summer festival because of Mahiru’s father, but in hindsight, Chitose’s invitation might be really appropriate.\nMahiru clearly faltered once she heard that Amane would be wearing a yukata, and Amane muttered quietly to himself that there was nothing to be happy about a man wearing a yukata.\nHe was not being humble; a female would look glamorous wearing a yukata, but not a male. Perhaps there would be a vibe suitable for the occasion, but Amane did not think it would be to a point where he could marvel at it.\nMahiru however was glancing at him, seemingly implying that she wanted a look. Well, he was fine with wearing one if his adorable girlfriend wanted one. A yukata on him might look fancy if he was to walk next to Mahiru with one.\n“I’ll wear it if you want to see.”\n“I-I want to see.”\n“That’s a quick response. Sure, but you don’t have to be too hopeful about it. My yukata’s really normal.”\nHis yukata was a deep blue, with no pattern, a red bean colored sash, a simple color scheme, nothing too fancy.\nDespite that, Mahiru looked really eager. “I’ll try my best to look good in it.” Amane wryly noted as he patted Mahiru’s head.",

      "content": "Amane and Mahiru began preparations an hour and a half before the festival.\nMahiru and Chitose took the yukatas and went home, and Amane started putting on a yukata by himself.\nOne needed to know how to wear a yukata, but Amane did not need to worry about Mahiru. She should be able to wear a yukata easily, given how she wore a kimono before.\nThe problem was Amane. Shihoko did teach him the know-hows, but Amane had no experience of it, so he worried if he could do so decently.\nHe wore it, checked himself in the mirror, and at the very least, it looked decent, not out of shape.\nThe deep blue yukata had no patterns, and the obi was the color of red bean. It was plain. Amane did not like anything fancy, and it was more catered to his preferences.\nHe looked decent in the mirror, especially when coupled with that relatively decent height of his.\nFor good or bad, Amane had a calm looking face, and the poised demeanor he had while wearing it might seemed suited for him.\nIt was for others to decide whether he might look inferior standing next to Mahiru.\nHe was curious as to how others would view and appraise him, but what really mattered at the very end was what he thought, and what Mahiru thought.\nOnce he was done wearing it, Amane lazed around on the sofa.\nHe knew girls needed much time dressing up, and he did allocate ample time, so he was fine with that.\nSurely she would require more time to wear a yukata. She would also have to tie her hair, which would take 30% of her time.\nAnd after that, she would have to put on make up. Amane truly felt that girls were amazing, and respected them.\nWell, Mahiru’s cute even if she doesn’t do anything, but I guess girls look more dazzling with make-up. It’s amazing.\nAmane felt much affection, elation, and an unspeakable sense of happiness as he leisurely waited for her. She probably was done, for there was the sound of the door being unlocked.\nAmane really looked forward to seeing his girlfriend’s attire, but did not turn around to wait for her. “Amane-kun.” a little murmur rang, and Amane was tapped on the shoulder.\nIt was then that he finally turned around…and broke into a smile.\n“It’s cute. It really suits you.”\n“…Y-you are able to determine so quicky?”\n“Of course, it’s obvious.”\nMahiru was a little suspicious, wondering if Amane had prepared his words beforehand, but that was truly all Amane could feel.\nOnce again, Amane was impressed by the keen foresight Shihoko showed.\nMahiru’s yukata was a white based color, probably because she was going to be with Amane, and there were Hydrangea patterns all over it, giving a cheery impression amidst the calm.\nThe Hydrangea were dark blue and mauve, of various shades that looked matured and refreshing. The floral season had passed, but the combination looked harmonious.\nThe obi was a clear purple, emphasizing the simplistic design of the yukata. There was a glass bead at its end, giving a refreshing vibe.\n“Well, you’r usually cute, but this makes you look more innocent, more matured, poised and alluring. Well, I can say you’re cute, but you’re prettier. Yep, it suits you.”\n“I-is that so?”\nMahiru appeared a little gaudy once Amane seriously stated his thoughts, looking uneasy as she fiddled the bangs. Amane had to chuckle at that sight.\nHer hair was tied together with a pin, and whenever she moved, the silver chain on it would sway. This hairpin was decorated with dark blue natural stones, and had a design similar to the obi and the glass bead. It had a striking similarity to Amane’s yukata.\n“Mahirun Mahirun, he’s always like this.”\n“I know that. For a while.”\n“…Are you criticizing me?”\n“Both praising and criticizing you, sorta~?”\n“What’s that about?”\nAmane narrowed his eyes in confusion, but Chitose merely giggled away, and Mahiru fidgeted, looking bashful. He really could not ask what that was about.\nHowever, it did not appear to be anything bad, since Mahiru did not look displeased.\n“…Th-that suits you too, Amane-kun.”\n“Really? Thanks. Glad to hear that.”\nAmane felt that the clothes did suit him, but he managed to get Mahiru’s guarantee. He had a feeling it was his own girlfriend being biased towards him, but he was really glad to be praised.\nHe assumed he was being praised, but for some reason, Mahiru appeared to be a little miffed.\n“…Did I do something?”\n“I guess it’s that ‘it’s unfair that I’m the only one embarrassed’~”\n“Ch-Chitose-san.”\nMahiru was flustered once she heard the explanation, and her expression clearly showed that Chitose was right on the mark.\nIt seemed Mahiru hoped that Amane too would be embarrassed, but he would not be embarrassed from this little thing. He was a little happy, and bashful, but not outright embarrassed like Mahiru.\nMahiru clearly faltered, “You’re so adorable~” and Chitose gleefully noted as she clung onto Mahiru, rubbing all over the latter.\nAmane was conflicted as to whether he should be impressed that Chitose was deft enough to not ruffled Mahiru’s hair, clothes and makeup, or selfishly insist that only he could dote on Mahiru.\nMahiru’s face got increasingly embarrassed, and Amane felt that she was really adorable. He let Chitose off as he felt it was fine for the two girls to be on such good terms, and watched them have fun with a warm gaze.",

      "content": "“Wow, yukatas.”\nItsuki was already waiting for them when they arrived at the station closest to the festival.\nIt appeared Itsuki never expected the couple to be in yukatas, for his eyes widened in amazement once he saw them.\n“It’s been days since we last met. Mom sent both yukatas.”\n“Heh, Shihoko-san’s really well prepared. It’s like she reads your minds.\n“I feel the same. Well, since she prepared them, I wore them.”\nIt seemed as though Shihoko had anticipated an invitation to the summer festival given how the items were packed in there, and in a certain sense, Amane was impressed.\nAmane decided to thank her later by sending over a photo of Mahiru in yukata, and looked towards Itsuki again.\nItsuki was dressed in casual plainclothes, a simple shirt and jeans, but he looked fine in them. It really was a cardinal sin to be a handsome, and one would assume a yukata would suit him too.\n“Yep yep, a beauty in yukata in quite the eyecandy.”\n“Hey Ikkun, what about me~?”\n“You’re always cute though Chii.”\n“…You have a habit of laughing out loud whenever I use facial masks though.”\n“But that’s cute too.”\n“You’re obviously about to laugh here, right~?”\nChitose hammered at Itsuki with some strength, and Itsuki’s shoulders were huffing in laughter, resulting in Mahiru giving a wry smile.\nSpeaking of which, Amane did see Mahiru use facial masks when they returned to his hometown. He remembered feeling very impressed by how difficult it was to maintain one’s beauty, rather than finding it bemusing.\nOf course, he too was nearly dragged into using them too, but he ultimately refused.\nHe reminded himself that her face was so pretty from the effort put in, and stroked her cheek with his finger, making sure not to damage her makeup. Mahiru then giggled from the tickle.\nThe mere sight had many around them gasping. Once again, Amane realized how beautiful his girlfriend was.\n“Cute girlfriends really stand out, huh.”\n“No, it’s just that you two really stand out…”\n“Hm, not many people wearing yukatas at this summer festival though. It’s no wonder you stand out.”\n“That’s the case but that’s not what I’m talking about…ah whatever.”\nSay, you…\nItsuki shrugged, and Amane ignored him as he gently dragged Mahiru to the sight.\nThis little gesture was meant to fend off the onlookers, to indicate that she belonged to him. She blinked a few times, and seemed to realize what he meant, for her blushing face looked delighted as she took the initiative to stand next to him.\nChitose and Itsuki cackled away once they saw that, and Mahiru did not care as she leaned on Amane.\n“We can’t lose now. Come here~”\n“Hahaha, coming in.”\nBoth of them clung to each other excitedly, seemingly in protest. Amane gave a wry smile, and looked down at Mahiru, who was clinging onto him.\nHer eyes looking up at him were filled with trust, and Amane seemingly responded to that trust as he held that little hand of hers.\n“Let’s not stand around already. Shall we go?”\n“The festival’s starting. Righto let’s eat~”\nChitose expressed her priority for her appetite as she clung onto Itsuki’s arm, and happily raised her other hand. Itsuki too smiled, and turned towards the venue.\nAmane glanced aside at Mahiru, and smiled as he firmly held her hand, following behind the other couple.",

      "content": "The festival was in full swing by the time the quartet arrived.\nThe area, usually devoid of crowds, was packed with them, giving a completely different impression from before. The situation was probably a result of a lack of other festivals over the prior two weeks or so.\nOne glance showed that not many were in yukatas, so those who were wearing them were often the center of attraction. The main reason however was because Mahiru was so beautiful.\n“There’s quite a lot of them.”\n“Yeah. Don’t get lost now.”\n“Don’t let go of Amane’s hand now, Mahirun.”\n“…I shall not.”\nMahiru clung onto Amane, and held his hand firmly. Amane clasped his fingers back, swearing never to let go.\nIf he did, many despicable men would try to woo her. Surely they would all come running towards such an adorable girl.\nItsuki deliberately whistled,\nyou’ll be holding hands anyway,\nand Amane shot back a dirty glare, before looking around at the path lined with stalls.\n“Anything you want to look at, Mahiru? Like, food?”\n“It is my first time at such a place. I am not too familiar…”\n“I see. Let’s order something then…”\nAmane was a little gloomy upon recalling that Mahiru never went out with her parents, but he encouraged Mahiru with a smile, and she too chuckled.\n“Ah, I want cotton candy~”\n“Cotton candy’s very filling though, and it gets humid if you leave it for long…”\nChitose could eat, and probably could finish the cotton candy. However, Amane felt it was better to fill their stomachs before having sweets.\nHe wanted to play it safe, and start from yakisoba and takoyaki, but he decided to prioritize what Mahiru wanted to eat.\n“…What does a festival have?”\n“For food, we have yakisoba, takoyaki. ikayaki, frankfurters, and stuff. I guess we’ll probably be eating here, so those stuff I mentioned are more filling.”\n“…It is bad to walk and eat though.”\n“I don’t mind. This is the charm of a festival after all.”\nThey could decide what to eat before buying, and it was an intriguing experience to stroll and view. One might say that would make the experience more enjoyable.\nAmane looked towards Itsuki and Chitose, asked for their opinions, and they all nodded, noting they were fine with it. Amane decided to do so, prompted Mahiru, and ventured into the crowd.\nThey frequented the stalls, strolled about, bought some snacks, and spotted the common shooting.\nThe one stall Amane would have associated with a festival was the shooting stall. It was a rare opportunity, so Amane wanted to play, but he was fine with skipping it if Mahiru had no interest.\nMahiru held his hand and looked around at the stalls, her eyes sparkling. She looked over where Amane was looking, and blinked away.\n“Amane-kun, what is that?”\n“That? A shooting game. You aim for the prizes with toy guns, and shoot them down to take them home. You want to play?”\nAmane felt that one should always try everything to gain experience, so he took his wallet out and shook it. Mahiru looked a little perturbed, but her curiosity probably got the better of her. She nodded.\nHe quietly cheered in his heart, and handed money to the stall owner, received the toy gun and 5 rounds, loaded them, and gave it to Mahiru. He managed to load the gun without the assistance of the owner, and there was no doubt it was because his parents brought him to countless festivals.\n“Alright, done. Which one?”\n“…That. It looks cute.”\nMahiru pointed at a hairpin packed in a plastic box. It had a hydrangea shaped decoration, and was a match for the yukata Mahiru was wearing. It too had an adorable design.\nHowever, Amane’s experience told him that that item was often positioned in a difficult manner to shoot down, and would not recommend any novice to try that as the first target.\nNevertheless, he wanted to respect Mahiru’s wishes, and did not mention that. Instead, he taught her how to shoot it, how to position herself, and the rest was up to her.\nIt’s a toy, but it’s a great sight seeing a pretty girl wielding a gun,\nso he thought as he looked at Mahiru, who raised the gun with a really serious look, and squeezed the trigger.\nA single click, the round was fired…and hit the cloth behind.\n“Uu, it is difficult.”\n“Hm, well honestly, it’s already tough to aim for your first attempt.”\nThe prize was not too far away, but the difficulty was still not to be underestimated.\nShe had to adjust her angle based on the power of the gun, and the firing speed, and ensure that she did not shake when firing. The gun too had its own temperament, and one might not be able to graze the target without taking these factors into account.\nMan, that’s deep,\nAmane recalled the useless skills and knowledge his parents taught him, and chuckled. Mahiru misunderstood in thinking that Amane was laughing at her, I shall hit it this time”, loaded the round as Amane taught her, and fired away.\nShe never hit one though, and all that enthusiasm was deflated as a sigh.\nMahiru looked very dejected as she received the somewhat many participation prize stick snacks.\n“I did not hit.”\n“Well it’s your first time.”\n“Yeah yea, it’s the same first experience for everyone, and Amane will take revenge for you anyway. Heh, I want to see Amane acting cool here~”\n“Don’t make it sound easy when it doesn’t concern you.”\nAmane intended to challenge next if Mahiru did not get what she wanted, but it would be troublesome if he could not, especially when Chitose made it sound so easy.\nMahiru however continued to look at the hairpin longingly, and lifted her head towards Amane.\n“…I want that.”\n“…I guess I have to work hard.”\nMahiru looked so adorable as she stared up towards Amane, and surely this fawning technique was taught by Chitose. “Guess I can’t miss now.” Amane noted wryly, paid the owner, and received the rounds.\nIt had been a while since he last played, and he did not know if he could do well. He felt the gun, relaxed, positioned himself, and squeezed the trigger.\nHe fired in a fluid manner, and soft cork bullet hit the box with the hairpin, grazing it.\nThe box tumbled a little, but did not fall.\n“Ahh, too bad.”\n“No no no, that’s fine. It’s just to see how the bullet fies, the power, and how the gun acts.”\nHe did not think that he had to hit it down on first try.\nIt was a test, and he did merely graze the item.\nGiven the touch, the feeling of the shot, and the hit on the prize however, Amane assumed the gun provided by this shop was decent.\nDue to certain reasons pertaining to the gun, there were moments when he could not shoot the target down, but Amane felt this was fin.e He should be able to shoot down most of the items as long as he aimed and hit them well.\nHe was relieved that his reflexes were not dulled, loaded again, and took aim.\nHe intended to shoot every item in the stall for Mahiru’s sake, whether it was the large toy that was the grand prize, or anything else. Since Mahiru wanted the hairpin however, that was all he aimed for.\nIt’s nostalgic.\nBack during elementary school and middle school, he was often brought out to such festivals. He recalled these moments, and silently squeezed the trigger. This time, he hit somewhat above the center of the box.\nThe box might not fall even if he did shoot it right down the middle. Amane was more concerned with stumbling it, breaking its balance, and fired another shot, which shook and knocked down the box, as expected.\nThere was a slight commotion, for the onlookers probably witnessed it.\nHe felt it would be awkward if he missed it, and used the remaining rounds to shoot down a few snacks that appeared easier to snatch, winning them. The owner smiled, but was cringing a little.\nI guess I’ll ruin his business if I take down too many of them.\nAmane shrugged as he recalled how Shihoko was barred from playing as she won too many prizes, “Sorry about that.” and collected his winnings.\n“This good enough?”\nAmane turned around, raised the hairpin box he received, and Mahiru nodded bashfully.\n“…Th-thank you. I never thought you would be able to shoot it down…”\n“Why are you able to get it?”\n“Well, I’m good at this.”\n“Waahh handsome, you annoy me.”\n“Why…?”\nChitose was the one who prompted, but she ended up grumbling, and once again, Amane felt how unreasonable it was.\n“You’re good at such things, aren’t you Amane? You always get high scores at the arcade shooting games.”\n“My family spent a lot of effort teaching me these useless things…saying that it’ll enrich my life experiences…”\n“But you managed to get what Shiina-san wanted because of this. Isn’t this good?”\n“You’re right.”\nAmane was really grateful to his parents, since it was a fact that he got what Mahiru wanted.\nI don’t know if I’m good enough to call this a skill though,\nAmane chuckled as he took the hairpin out of the box, gently lifted her bangs, and fastened it.\nThe hairpin really suited the yukata, and there was a sense of uniformity, along with the mood.\n“Yep, it’s cute. It really suits you.”\nThe hairpin had a simple, cute design, and was convenient, really suitable for Mahiru. Amane leaned over, smiled at Mahiru, and her face turned red as she went “Thank you.”\nHe realized this was Mahiru being embarrassed, and Itsuki said something of ambiguous meaning, “Man, you’re just dedicated to Shiina-san.” Amane patted Mahiru’s head once he saw how embarrassed and happy she was, ignoring Itsuki.",

      "content": "“Mahirun’s looking happy.”\nMahiru appeared to be really happy once she put on the hairpin Amane won.\nShe was so elated that Chitose had to comment on it.\nHer sweet smile was blooming like flowers, charming everyone around them, and it was so potent, it might shoot into the hearts of many males.\nThe Angel could imprison the hearts of many men in this state, but that smile had a devilish charm to it.\nIt appeared Itsuki had witnessed Mahiru in such a good mood for the first time, for he looked disturbed and gaudy.\nEven Amane, who should have built up some form of resistance, could not stop his heart from beating wildly.\n“Oy Amane, stop her man.”\n“I feel the same. She’s adorable, but us victims are suffering.”\nIt would be bad if Mahiru was to do anything careless. Amane gently held the hand of the blissful looking Mahiru, and brought his face to her ears.\n“Look Mahiru, it’s great that you’re happy, but don’t show this look to anyone else. You may get abducted by a bad guy…and…”\n“…And?”\n“…Show me that cute expression when we’re alone. I want that to myself.”\nThat’s why I don’t want to show it to anyone,\nhe muttered with a voice only she could hear, and her face immediately turned red like a boiler.\nThe earnest cuteness of her frantically shaking her head truly was amazing, but the hairpin she just put on was dislodged.\nAmane tried to stop her as he adjusted the hairpin, and patted her cheeks. This time, she froze, and gently rested her head on Amane’s elbow, covering her face.\nGuess she’s embarrassed.\nso he thought as he held her hand with his finger pads. She reacted, so it seemed it did not exceed her emotional capacity completely.\n“You two there, our eyes will go blind if you two can’t stop flirting away there.”\n“Can’t help it, Mahiru’s cute.”\n“No, it’s your problem, and it’s started because of you…seriously I want to see what those girls calling you gloomy will say now.”\n“What’s with you?”\n“Mahirun’s weak to you after you’ve awakened, huh. You’re getting more destructive now.”\nWhat do you mean, awakened?\nAmane looked dumbfounded towards Mahiru, who was next to him, and found her glaring towards him for some reason.\n“…Amane-kun, I shall return those words back at you.”\n“O-okay?”\n“Definitely.”\nAmane nodded once she said so, and she seemed a little relieved as she pressed her forehead onto his elbow.\nHe let her be, thinking she preferred to make contact like this, and saw Chitose leering.\n“Your natural tendency to dote on Mahiru is the same as usual.”\n“Dote…say.”\n“Well, Mahirun seems to be in a good mood, so I’m not going to stop you~anyway, I’m hungry. Shall we have fried squid there? It’s so sugary that I want some salty stuff.”\n“You haven’t had salty stuff, right…?”\n“That’s not what I’m talking about~anyway, let’s go. Just take it as you being considerate for everyone around us.”\nAmane looked around once he heard those words, and met the blushing onlookers in the eyes.\nBoth males and females were probably fatally shot by Mahiru’s bashfulness and cuteness, definitely so since there were also some looks of jealousy from a few males.\nHe regretted causing Mahiru to be embarrassed at a crowded place, and did as Chitose advised, holding Mahiru’s hand as they went towards the fried squid stall.\n“Nnn~ eating this at a festival really tastes different, though it’s because of the mood.”\nChitose had eaten yakisoba and fried chicken, and at this point, she was joyously chowing down on the fried squid.\nThey were eating at the rest area, slightly apart from the road where the stalls were set up. However, they could sense some passing stares.\nWell, Mahiru and Chitose are pretty girls, even though they’re of different\ntypes.\nMahiru was the cute and innocent, while Chitose was lively and had a boyish charms. They were very different, but they were certain pretty girls, so it was no wonder they garnered much attention.\nThis Chitose fed some fried squid to an excited looking Mahiru. There were many male stares locked in upon seeing these two cute girls interacting with each other.\nMahiru showed a tender smile, probably because it was delicious. Some boys sighed in amazement, probably because the scene before them was like a picture.\n“How cute.”\n“They’re cute, but they got passionate without me.”\n“What, you jealous?”\n“What’s there to be jealous about relationships between girls?”\n“Haha, just look then. I think that’s really great.”\nThere’s something different about pretty girls having fun together,\nItsuki said something rather perverted, but Amane did understand how he felt, somewhat.\nIf he said so however, he would be deemed the pervert. He kept the thoughts to himself as he saw those two chatting intimately…”Eh, Shiina-san?” There was a voice from nearby.\nThey turned around, and found a few male classmates looking at the girls.\nThey seemed to be enjoying the festival too. Some were wearing masks, some holding cotton candy bags, and they clearly were having fun.\nItsuki was the first to respond, giving the usual hearty smile as he waved towards them.\n“Woah, you guys are here too?”\n“You’re definitely here if Shirakawa-san’s here, Itsuki. Oh, Fujimiya should be here too.”\n“Over here.”\nAmane merely raised his hand, and did not wave at them. The boys broke into a commotion.\n“Eh, a yukata?”\n“Can’t I?”\n“No, you look good in that…”\n“Just wearing it like normal clothes.”\nAmane did not do anything other than wear yukatas, and was looking really normal. However, it seemed they felt the yukata gave a little mood compared to usual.\nAmane felt indescribably awkward and ticklish as the boys stared at him, and he started to grimace. He was relieved however when Mahiru leisurely strolled towards him.\n“Ah, it has been a while…or not. I believe we met at the closing ceremony. Everyone looks energetic.”\n“Woah…Shiina-san in yukata…”\nAll the classmates were mesmerized, without exception. It was to be expected, so Amane did not mind as he too looked at Mahiru, who noticed his stare, and blushed.\nTheir classmates froze at this mere sight, and one could clearly see how adorable Mahiru was.\n“S-Shiina-san, the yukata suits you.”\n“Thank you very much. I am glad to hear this.”\nIt seemed Mahiru would only be embarrassed whenever Amane praised her, for she accepted those praises with the beautiful outdoor smile.\n“You wore it yourself?”\n“Yes. But Amane-kun’s mother prepared this for more…”\n“Mom sent it over because she wants to see you in that, don’t mind her. She dotes on you so much that she’ll do anything.”\nShihoko probably would prepare another kimono in the coming year. She had a few at home, and her parents, Amane’s maternal grandparents, had more in stow. Thus, Shihoko would surely pick them to her heart’s content.\nGood going, please continue,\nso Amane quietly thought to himself once he realized that he would be able to see her in more kimonos.\n“But I really do feel apologetic about this.”\n“It’s fine. Our old place’s basically yours.”\nHis parents really welcomed Mahiru, saying that she could take their place as her hometown. They probably would be sad to hear her being so courteous.\nOnce she understood this, she bashfully nodded away, and put her head on his chest. He stared at her with happiness, and then looked over at the one who approached them.\nIn hindsight, he was the one who questioned Amane during the sports festival, but it did not matter to Amane at this point.\nAfter all, they were mere outsiders to Mahiru, and there was no room for them to interject.\nMan, have I gone rotten for feeling superior about this?\nSo he wondered, but he had no intention to budge.\n“We’ll be leaving soon then. Sorry for disturbing your fun.”\nAnd Chitose’s done with the fried squid,\nso he added as he looked towards the latter, and found her staring at him excitedly.\nHe nonchalantly pulled Mahiru over by the waist, and gave them a smile reserved for strangers. Mahiru appeared shocked, but was obviously bashful and delighted as she instinctively clung onto Amane.\n“See you at school then.”\n“Ah, ye-yes…bye.”\nMahiru said with a smile, and the boys could not follow, giving conflicted expressions as they saw the group leave.\nThe group then went onto the road filled with stalls. Itsuki then stood on the other side, away from Mahiru, bringing his face close.\n“You did that on purpose didn’t you, Amane?”\nThe voice was soft enough for Mahiru to not hear amidst the buzz and the music.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Like, your current posture, and the hometown thing.”\nItsuki was smart, and had good instincts.\nHe clearly pinpointed Amane’s resolve and plans.\n“Maybe?”\n“…You’ve gone stronger.”\nItsuki muttered, looking either dumbfounded or impressed, so Amane took it to be the latter, giving a smile that spoke volumes.",

      "content": "“Time for some shaved ice next~!”\nThe four of them began strolling again, and they stopped upon hearing Chitose’s words. They did pass the shaved ice stall, and there should be one before them, but since they did not know where that would be be, it would be a little quicker for them to retract their footsteps.\n“What kind of stomach is capable of storing that much…”\n“This kind~”\nChitose slapped at her tummy, but one could only see the slender waist that was somehow comparable to Mahiru’s . It was amazing to think a stomach of this size could store yakisoba, fried chicken and fried squid.\nWhere did the food go\n…so Amane wondered as he stared at the belly with a serious look. It appeared Mahiru too had the same thoughts, for she showed a wry smile.\n“You do not get fat, Chitose-san. I am really envious of how slender you are.”\n“It’s skinny thin. And the skin’s tight.”\n“Ehehe~ praise me more, you two.”\n“Chii’s really skinny…and it really feels like it when I hug her.”\nItsuki was often touchy-feely with Chitose, so he would know how thin she was. He was of middle build, and was not that fat, but Chitose was glaringly thin whenever they were together, and she really stood out.\nAlso, she had some muscles on her, but they were thin, and were not too taut. Clearly those were proof of her hard work.\n“You’re not fat even though you eat so much.”\n“I have good metabolism.”\n“Well Chii isn’t the type to get fat easily, though this meansother parts can’t grow.”\n“…Ikkun, come here.”\nItsuki heard Chitose’s monotonous voice despite her beaming smile, and instantly realized he spoke too much.\nAfter all, she was fuming as he mentioned the part she was sensitive about, moreso especially since it was her boyfriend who mentioned it.\n“Sorry I misspoke so please don’t kick my calf.”\n“But you always say that even after I tell you so, right~? Shall we have a chat there?”\nA smiling Chitose dragged Itsuki by the elbow, and Amane merely gave Itsuki his respects.\n“You had to open your mouth…”\n“You said anything?”\n“No-nothing.”\nAmane did not want to incur her ire, flatly denied so, and turned to awkward Mahiru next to him, and deliberately smiled at her, hinting to her to ignore Itsuki’s plea for help.\n“What flavor of shaved ice, Mahiru?”\n“Eh…s-strawberry…?”\n“Okay sure, let’s go buy some. Chitose, we’ll be off for some shaved ice. Just have fun there…”\n“Okay~”\nChitose intimidated Itsuki with a smile, and turned back, answering with a smile. Amane smiled back, tugged Mahiru by the end, and went down the road they came from.\nThey bought the shaved ice, and returned, but Chitose’s lecture did not end.\nFrom afar, Amane saw the duo interact earnestly, and shrugged. He then looked towards Mahiru, who was wryly smiling, still clinging onto his elbow.\n“…They’re not done yet?”\n“They really are on good terms.”\n“I guess that’s how they flirt, just that Chitose’s a little angry.”\n“Ah-ahaha…”\nAmane knew that Chitose was not really outright angry, and did not stop those two. He handed the cup of shaved ice to Mahiru.\n“Here Mahiru.”\n“Thank you very much. Your shaved ice…is a little bitter.”\n“I wanted ujikintoki, but they don’t sell those.”\nOn a side note, Amane chose matcha.\nHe would have bought ujikintoki if there was, but it was difficult for the store to prepare red bean paste and shiratama dango, so he could only compromise.”\n“So you do eat such sweets. I do remember that you do not normally eat them.”\n“Well, I don’t dislike them, just that I don’t really go out of the way just to eat them. I like the bean fillings though, especially those with full red beans.”\nAmane simply would not do that, but if there were sweets, he would eat them. The only desserts he would crave were custard types, but he hardly ate them, and thus he did not really have any impression of liking them.\nHe liked those with bean fillings however, for red beans really went well with matcha and green tea. The bitterness and sweetness would mesh with each other very well, and he was rather fond of it.\n“I see…but it is troublesome to cook beans, and tiring to make anything, no?”\n“It’s amazing how you started thinking about cooking beans, Mahiru. We can just buy some…”\nOne typically would not think of starting from the red beans. Red bean bags were sold out there, and most would choose to buy them, considering the labor and time required.\nIt appeared Mahiru’s first thought was to make some.\n“I want people to eat delicious food. I cannot control the sweetness of what is sold out there, and most do not necessarily preserve the texture of the beans.”\nMahiru smiled, saying that she wanted Amane to have delicious food. Amane felt sorry and overwhelmed with love once he heard those moving words, and did not know whether he should relax or tense up.\n“…I’ll have some matcha pudding with red bean paste then. And dorayaki.”\n“Fufu, sure~, leave it to me.”\nI can do anything as long as it is for you, Amane-kun,\nshe said these words that might not seem an exaggeration from her, and had a mouthful of shaved ice. Amane was indescribably embarrassed, and too put the shaved ice to his mouth to hide his shame.",

      "content": "“Matcha pudding sounds good~”\nAmane was eating his shaved ice, and it appeared Chitose had eavesdropped while having her heart to heart talk with Itsuki, and approached them enviously.\n“Done punishing Itsuki?”\n“Of course, Ikkun’s too rude here, right~?”\nChitose gave a thumbs up, while Amane and Mahiru grimaced away, looking over to where Itsuki was…and found no one there.\n“Where’s Itsuki anyway?’\n“Went off to buy shaved ice and chocolate banana.”\n“There’s more…”\n“That’s compensation~”\nChitose then turned her head aside. Amane thought to himself that Itsuki was going to spend all his money, but he did not sympathize, since the latter was at fault.\nItsuki had stepped on the landmines a few times, but never learned his lesson. This might be an interaction, skinship to them, but him angering someone was nothing praiseworthy.\nIt appeared Chitose kicked up quite a long fuss this time, for she continued to pout away.\n“I don’t want them this small~ mean prefer Mahirun’s size after all~.”\n“Wh-what are you saying…”\nMahiru quickly covered her chest. She clearly had a larger rack than Chitose, and Amane felt hers was bigger than average, but he never really paid attention to them, for she would be ashamed if he was too bothered.\n“I’m not jealous, just a little envious of Mahirun. Mahirun has many things I don’t have, she’s pretty, nice body, athletic, good at studies, can do housework, elegant…she’s a man’s ideal.”\n“This is not.”\n“Yes yes. Daiki-san will definitely tell Ikkun to pick girls like Mahirun if he meets her.”\nChitose gave a somewhat devastated smile, and Amane realized why she went to visit him and Mahiru alone.\n“Did Daiki-san say anything to you?”\n“Hmm~didn’t really, but his expression wasn’t really welcoming.”\nDaiki was Itsuki’s father.\nHe did not approve of Itsuki and Chitose’s relationship. Amane had a chance to chat with Daiki when he visited Itsuki’s house, but Daiki did not really seem fond of Chitose, partially because he could not deal with a personality like Chitose’s, and also because he wanted Itsuki to get a good woman.\nOne would say that he felt there were better women out there, rather than say that he disliked Chitose outright.\n“Daiki-san doesn’t hate you actually.”\n“But if you bring Mahirun to him, he’ll definitely choose Mahirun.”\n“Th-that’s…”\nOf course, Chitose had her own charms, some of which Mahiru did not have. Daiki probably wanted a Yamato Nadeshiko like Mahiru however, which Chitose was not.\nIt was not anything Chitose lacked, nor was it her fault, just that they did not get along in interests and personalities.\nIt appeared Chitose was bothered by how Daiki was not fond of her, and she sighed hard.\n“But…I don’t feel comfortable about being like Mahirun. Ikkun told me not to mind, but I do have to be the daughter-in-law though? I want to ensure this relationship goes well.”\n“…That’s tough. It’s not something that can be solved immediately.”\n“Hm, I think it will take years. I’ll try~but some things are just difficult. We’ll have to see if we can get along.”\nChitose gave an awkward smile as she noted,\nit will be great if we’re accepted like you two.\nShe clung onto Mahiru, who shared some of her shaved ice. Amane really did not know what to say.\nMahiru probably did not know what to say either, for she merely caressed Chitose gently.\nChitose too fawned and rubbed herself onto Mahiru, asking for more shaved ice.\nThen, they spotted Itsuki through the crowd, holding the items Chitose wanted in both hands.\n“I’m not depressed, so don’t tell Ikkun.”\nChitose reminded them, and showed her usual smile as she went towards Itsuki. Amane and Mahiru watched her leave with conflicted looks.\nTN: Let’s be blunt, if you have to choose between Mahirun and Chitose, you’ll obviously choose Mahiru. Why else are you reading this story?",

      "content": "The trio met up with Itsuki, who returned from his shopping trip (as a gopher). They ate the food, and went with the crowd as they enjoyed the stalls.\n“But seriously, there’s a lot of people around here.”\n“This is the closest festival we have here. We got many stalls, lots of space, and it’s common for us to bump into our classmates.”\nBut they just retreated in dismay though,\nItsuki quipped happily, and Amane merely shrugged.\nMahiru looked stunned to hear that, probably because she was skeptical about the word ‘retreated’.\nShe never paid attention to them, let alone show concern for them, and Amane had a small sense of superiority in his heart.\nI dare say though, they’re trying to attract Mahiru’s attention even though I’m here.\nAmane assumed that the whole school would know Mahiru would never pay attention to anyone other than him, after how they acted in school, but it appeared the others had not given up.\nHe did understand how they felt however.\nAn innocent, adorable girl who was a male’s ideal was right within range. They might find it unacceptable for a countryside kid to suddenly pop by and abduct her.\nHowever, Mahiru clearly treated Amane differently from the others, and he really wished they could understand this.\n…She really loves me.\nNaturally, he already knew about this, but this understanding was reinforced recently.\n…She really treasured and doted him.\nOf course, he had the same amount of passion towards her as she did to him, but he felt ticklish in this awkward yet proud emotion he felt.\n“…You really love Mahirun, Amane. Your face is shown.”\n“Eh?”\n“You’re looking friendlier than before, your eyes, your expression, they look a lot kinder…basically, you’re being gentle.”\n“…I know that I’ve become friendlier, but if I have to say gentle…”\nIt was one thing to say that he had a gentler attitude, but he did not really comprehend her saying that his eyes and expression looked gentle.\nHe was relatively aloof, or so he felt, and could not comprehend her saying that he was gentle.\n“Say Mahiru, is it as she said?”\n“Eh, e-erm…yes.”\n“Really? Anyway, what do you mean, a gentler expression…?”\n“I shall take a photo next time so that you will understand.”\nIt is amazing after all,\nso she said, and he had the notion to stop doting on Mahiru before everyone else, but he had no confidence since she was that adorable.\nShe blushed, and looked towards him infrequently. For the time being, he caressed her cheeks with his fingers, and did his best to exert tension onto his face.\n“…It’s useless to try and look tense before us now.”\n“Shut up.”\n“Mahirun prefers to see your doting side, Amane.”\n“Eh, e-erm…I do like Amane-kun no matter how he is, dashing, gentle, sexy…”\n“Heh~ so you’ve seen Amane looking sexy~?”\nChitose leered away, but Amane did nothing to be guilty about. He scowled, but he did not panic.\nThey had been dating for at least two months, but all they did was to kiss, and nothing more. For the time being, he decided to endure for a while.\nHe would feel that he had obtained her body if he suggested to do that immediately after dating, and he hated that. Mahiru would be the one burdened after all, and he could not simply force the issue.\nHe could consider doing so if Mahiru wished for it, but it appeared she had no such intention, so that was a long shot.\n“We’re not doing what you think of.”\n“You said it out huh? Are you just keeping your urges to yourself, or just being platonic?”\n“But you’ve kissed, right?”\n“…Nothing to do with you.”\n…You told her, didn’t you?\nAmane gently pinched at the hand he held, reproaching Mahiru, who blushed and apologized meekly.\nShe probably mentioned it during their girls talk, so he did not grumble much, but it was embarrassing to have this pointed out.\nChitose might have felt they were way too late at this stage, to be just kissing.\nYou two are really innocent, or Amane’s too timid,\nshe noted, and Amane frowned.\n“…Nothing bad about that, right? We’re going at our own pace.”\n“Hm, sure sure, but I want to say, if you keep a girl waiting, she’ll get anxious, so be careful.”\n“Chi-Chitose-san…?”\n“You should be honest now, Mahirun, instead of discussing things like Amane-kun wouldn’t kiss me.”\n“Ahhhhhhh do not say this!”\nMahiru hastily covered Chitose’s mouth, and Amane widened his eyes. Chitose quickly darted aside, grinning as she enjoyed the sight of Mahiru.\nMahiru was athletic, but so was Chitose, and the former was wearing yukata, which was inconvenient to move in. It appeared Mahiru could not catch Chitose.\n“Hmph hmph, Mahirun will get embarrassed, but I find it cute to see her like this. I’m stunned to see you so passive though, Amane.”\n“…I-if you keep saying, I will not help you with your remaining assignments.”\n“That’s troubling. Okay, I’ll watch my mouth then.”\nChitose looked all the more delighted to hear the cute threat, and she smiled as she dragged her finger past her lips, showing that she would be zipping it.\nMahiru was shivering in shame, and Amane stared at her. Her face turned redder once she noticed, and she tried to escape, but Amane hastily caught her.\nHe hugged her from behind, and gently patted her back to calm her down.\n“It’s not convenient to meet up if we get lost, and others will try to woo you. Don’t run away now.”\n“…Uuu.”\n“I won’t look, okay?”\nAmane said he would not look, but he could feel her shivering from shame in his clutches. So he thought, but if he said it out loud, Mahiru might really run away, so he did not. Mahiru then earnestly remained in his clutches, and obediently shook herself.\nOnce again, he realized how adorable her earnest self was. Itsuki and Chitose stared at them dumbfoundedly.\n“This is what we mean by that gentle expression of yours.”\n“We hate that you don’t have any self awareness at all.”\nThey appeared to be whispering, but they said it loud enough for Amane to hear, and his face winced.\nMahiru remained in his clutches however, so he could not reproach them, and merely conveyed his unhappiness on his face.",

      "content": "“Fuah~, full full~”\n“Where in the world did all that suff go…?”\nAfter a stroll around the stalls, Chitose patted her revealed belly, and look relaxed and satisfied.\nThat belly was a little puffier compared to before, but Chitose remained thin. One either had to amazed or dumbfounded at how much food she could store.\n“Phew~ sure feels different eating at a festival.”\n“Good that you’re happy…but don’t overeat it.”\n“I don’t usually eat this much~ I’m controlling this~”\nChitose did have a slender body, and what she said was plausible. Amane was still worried that she might have overeaten. Since she was fine with that, he had nothing to lecture her own.\n“Anyway, you sure you full, Amane? I don’t think I’ve seen you eat much.”\n“Hmm…I intend to eat a little once I get home. Mahiru cooled some stock, so I probably will pour some onto instant rice and make some cold chazuke.”\n“Sounds delicious.”\n“You still can eat…?”\nThe stalls looked good, but Mahiru’s cooking was a better choice to end the day with. Amane intended to make some rice with the stock she made, and did not eat too much, but he did not think Chitose would still have some appetite.\nPlease eat it next\ntime,\nMahiru noted wryly once she saw Chitose’s appetite. They saw her eat yakisoba, fried chicken, frankfurters, a fried squid she bought with Mahiru, chocolate banana, and shaved ice. Any boy would be full by now, and Mahiru was probably worried for Chitose’s stomach.\nAmane stared at Chitose’s slender waist, wondering where the food went. “You perv.” Chitose noticed that stare, and squealed as she turned aside, so Amane gave her a blank stare.\n“We’ll observe more of Chitose’s appetite next time. Let’s leave that aside.”\n“Woah, you’re cold.”\n“What are you plans? It’s about time to head back now, right?”\nThey did go through the entire place once, and nights arrived late during the summer, but the sky was darkening. It was going to be 8.30pm, Amane and Mahiru’s places were far away, and it should be time for them to leave considering the travel time.\nEven though Itsuki was around, it was a bad idea to have Chitose out late at night.\n“Hm~ we can go back now, but I’m staying over at Mahirun’s place tonight, no?”\n“Eh?”\n“I did put my stuff at her place~ and she already agreed, you know?”\nRIght~?\nChitose grinned at Mahiru, who nodded with a wry smile.\nOn a side note, Amane did not have to worry as Mahiru did not look displeased, but he hoped Chitose would have informed beforehand. After all, Amane would be the one buying ingredients, so he would have to buy three persons’ worth.\nChitose continue to show a triumphant look,\nI should have asked Amane beforehand,\nand Itsuki lamented so. It was pitiful to see Itsuki return home alone, but he had no change of clothes, and Amane could not help him there.\n“…Mahiru agreed, so that should do it, right?”\n“Oh my Amane-kun, you don’t like it that Mahiru’s taken away~?”\n“Why should I be jealous of a girl? I know she’s mine, so it doesn’t matter.”\nHe was instead jealous that those of the same gender could come and go into the same house as they pleased, rather than not wanting Chitose to be so clingy.\nHe did agree to visit Mahiru’s house, but he had to will himself, and was jealous that Chitose could come and go as she pleased.\nHe did not rue the fact that Chitose would be visiting, so he shrugged, and MAhiru continued to blush as she scampered towards Chitose.\n“…Chitose-san, that is what I mean. Amane-kun has been like this recently…”\n“Oh my~ looks like you have it tough, Mahirun~”\n“What’s with that face?”\n“Nothing~?”\nRIght Mahirun~?\nChitose leered in a different manner from when she sought Mahiru’s opinion. The latter nodded silently as she clung onto Chitose, looking towards Amane bashfully.",

      "content": "“Amane~, come~ play~”\n“What are you doing before bedtime?”\nChitose was spending the night at Mahiru’s place, so Amane spent his time alone after the festival ended. She gave a video call before bedtime, and Amane naturally frowned.\nHe did not dislike the fact that she called him, but that he found it a hassle to get up when he was already lying down, and a little fatigued.\nShown on the screen was Chitose’s beaming face.\nHer face is noisy enough,\nhe had such a rude thought about her, and moved the phone next to his pillow.\n“Say, I want to sleep now.”\n“Yeah, I know. You’re looking like you’re going to school.”\n“Can I hang up now since you know that?”\n“No please~ hang up only when Mahirun returns~”\n“Where’s Mahiru anyway?”\n“Bathing~ she’s not bathing with me today.”\nChitose made it sound like a pity, but Mahiru’s choice to bathe alone was the correct one. Otherwise, Mahiru would probably be worn down during this time she should be relaxing.\n“Mahirun’s disappointed that she can’t say good night to you, so I’m calling over~don’t hang up on\nme.”\n“…You expect me to hang up now?”\n“You would have hung up if I didn’t say so, right?”\n“You’re too much~”\nshe giggled, and suddenly sheathed away that cheerful look as she looked at Amane through the screen.\nShe did not appear to be joking like she was before, and looked poised as though enlightened. The sudden change left Amane confused.\n“Say Amane, can I ask you something?”\n“Ask what?”\nAmane knew that Chitose would ask serious questions whenever she made such a face, so he did not ignore her. Once he answered, Chitose stared at him intently.\n“How much do you like Mahirun?”\n“Like, as in…?”\n“Since you treasure her so much, I want to ask how much you like her.\n”\nIt was not an easy question to answer. Amane lowered his eyebrows, and Chitose’s expression did not change.\n“…I think it’s just me being biased, but, well, high school students in relationships are usually in the spur of the moment right? They don’t seem serious, they’re just fooling around.”\n“Did Daiki-san tell you that?”\n“Oh my~ you’re a smart one.”\nChitose laughed. She did not have any of her usual sharpness, and looked devastated.\nShe took the phone, laid on the bed, and sighed gently.\n“…I’m not intending to fool around, but I’ve never taken things seriously, and he didn’t think I am. I guess that’s why…I don’t know how many actually look into their own futures.”\nShe did show signs of such worries during the festival, and probably was wondering how she could get along with Itsuki’s father Daiki in his own way. Itsuki’s mother did not care about this, so it appeared she would have to pass that hurdle.\nAmane slowly spoke up in response to her question.\nHe knew how to answer even without thinking.\n“…Hm, it’s hard for me to say…but I want her to accompany me forever with a smile.”\nHe could not express how much he liked Mahiru, and did not know how to describe it.\nThe one thing certain was that he wanted Mahiru to be happy, and wanted to treasure her, that she would continue to accompany him with a smile for all of eternity. That was what he truly thought.\n“I see.”\n“You aren’t the same, Chitose?”\n“Of course not. I want Ikkun to laugh forever.”\n“Hm, that should be good enough. If you say so, I think that’s fine. It’s not going to change no matter what others say.”\nAmane replied with a laugh once he heard her unhappy reply. On the other end,Chitose looked timid.\n“…It’s annoying how good a person you are.\n”\n“I have to when I have such a great girlfriend.”\n“Woah that’s smooth…you annoy me~”\nChitose might have smacked Amane in the back if she was present. She grumbled unhappily…but sounded a little delighted,\nMahirun’s really doted on,\nshe added, and burst out laughing.\nShe then turned her head around.\n“What are you talking about?”\na familiar voice could be heard from behind, and it seemed Mahiru was done bathing. She stood behind Chitose, wearing a Negligee that exposed relatively little.\nA trail of flax color swayed, probably because Mahiru went next to Chitose.\n“Hm~? I’m saying that your boyfriend is a good man, Mahirun.”\n“What about Amane-kun?”\n“Ah, just talking about life with him.”\n“Life…?”\n“Yes yes.”\nChitose gave a really vague answer, and beyond the screen, Mahiru sighed.\nChitose was a little perturbed as the atmosphere got a little gaudy, and then, Mahiru sat next to Chitose.\n“…Is he not going to talk to me?”\nChitose was stunned to hear such pouty words, and at the next moment, moved the phone aside.\nThe phone screen spun, but one could hear a cute\n‘kya’\nfrom Mahiru. It appeared Chitose was doing some skinship on her.\n“…You’re so cute Mahirun! I’ll keep talking with you until you have enough!”\n“Chitose-san…it is dangerous to leap over.”\nMahiru’s reproach sounded really happy, and it seemed she probably did not dislike it.\n“Eh~”\nso came Chitose’s reply. The front camera turned black, probably because it was buried under the bedsheet, but one could imagine Chitose getting on top of Mahiru.\n“I like you Mahirun~”\n“I like you too.”\n“Hehe~ I stole Mahirun’s like from Amane~”\n“Ehhhh, A-Amane-kun, is, special…”\nMahiru picked up the phone and explained with a frantic voice. Amane chuckled.\n“Well I know that.”\n“…Uuu.”\n“You second gen bakauple.”\n“Shut up first gen.”\nChitose and Itsuki were no better, and Amane did not want to lecture them.\n“Alright, go to sleep now, girls. Staying up late’s not going to be good for your skins.”\nAmane said as he had a look at the time, since the topic was ending.\nIt was past 11pm, and Mahiru usually did not stay up late, so she probably was tired enough to sleep, especially since she went around in the yukata, which she was unused to wearing.\nIn fact, even though Mahiru was blushing as she snatched Chitose’s phone, she clearly was looking tired, and it was not good to chat for long.\n“I never thought I would hear these words from Amane~ but I guess so. Hanging up now…you okay Mahirun?”\nMahiru probably understood why Chitose contacted Amane when prompted, and she widened her eyes in shock, before giving Amane a gentle smile.\n“Eh…ahh, good night Amane-kun. See you tomorrow.”\n“Oh, night. See you tomorrow.”\nI would have patted her head if she’s next to me,\nso he thought, but he wanted the two girls to have fun, so he did not express his thoughts, and instead smiled back at Mahiru, who wanted to enjoy this stayover.",

      "content": "“Save me Amane.”\n“Nope.”\nChitose held the mechanical pencil, and grumbled as she faced the table. Amane refused her, and blatantly rolled his eyes at her.\nIt seemed shes stayed over at Mahiru’s place because she had to finish her assignments, and naturally came over to Amane’s place to do her assignments, probably to pull him along for the ride. However, Amane was done with his assignments a month ago, was left with revision, and had no need to panic.\nHe had no need to anxiously study on the table, so he sat on the sofa, looked at the magazine, and stared down at Chitose.\n“Your fault for not finishing your assignments until the last moment. Mind planning a little? How about you suffer a little at the start and finish your assignments, rather than end your summer vacations in a poor mental state and mood. You’ll enjoy the rest of your time if you do that.”\n“Uuu~”\n“You did your assignments with Itsuki the last time, right? Now he’s done. He did it little by little every day, and you wouldn’t be like this if you learned from him.”\n“Ugh.”\n“Anyway, why do you think things will get solved if you ask others for help? You’re the one who has to do the assignments. You’re suffering because you’ve been lazy all this while. Stop struggling and do your assignments. That’ll get things done faster.”\n“Mahirun~ Amane’s bullying me~!”\nAmane felt he was right, but Chitose begged Mahiru for clemency.\nIt so happened that Mahiru returned with Chitose’s share of fruit juice, the glass of orange liquid on the tray.\n“You cannot be too harsh on her, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru coaxed with a wry smile, and handed over some juice to Amane. “See~?” Chitose got gleeful, her eyes basically hinting that Amane should be more like Mahiru.\nHowever, Mahiru did not appear to side Chitose completely; she appeared to be more biased towards Amane. It was for this reason that she had long finished her assignments, and started her own revision.\nMahiru was one to prioritize doing things little by little, but she had already finished her assignments. She once said that it was bad to hurry and finish them at the last moment, so she did all she had, and revised regularly to ensure she would not forget what she studied.\nAmane was a little relieved that she had the same thought process.\nWith a gentle smile, Mahiru placed Chitose’s orange juice on the table, and gently placed her hand on Chitose’s shoulder.\n“Chitose-san, do your best.”\n“You too Mahirun!?”\n“After all, I did ask you at the start of summer vacation if you want to do assignments together, but you wanted to play first…”\n“Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu~”\n“You reap what you sow.”\nMahiru invited Chitose, but the latter chose to play. There was no need to pity the latter.\n“Chitose-san, with me around, you should be fine even with many assignments.”\n“Mahirun…”\n“Anyway, you should be able to finish half of it before dinner if you keep at it…no?”\n“NOOOO~”\nMahiru naturally severed off Chitose’s lifeline. driving the latter to despair.\nShe’s pitiful,\nAmane thought callously as he stared at Chitose, drinking the orange juice Mahiru served.\nAmane did plan to take over if they had trouble, or if Mahiru was too tired to teach, but Chitose would get too cocky if they pampered her too much, so he chose to be harsh in moderation.\nDon’t wanna,\nChitose moaned away as she started on her assignments unwillingly, and Amane stared at her sidelong face, thinking that he should buy some sweets later.",

      "content": "“I’m~ tired~”\nChitose kept writing her assignments, took a little break midway through, and at this point, she was rolling on the carpet, fawning around. It seemed she was really tired.\nChitose was wearing shorts, so it was fine, but he would have seen her panties if she was wearing a skirt. Amane clearly looked bewildered.\n“What happens if you roll about and spill your juice?”\n“I’ll just get down and beg for mercy.”\n“Better not spill it instead of sacrificing this much of your dignity. It’ll be troublesome to clean up the carpet and your clothes if you spill it.”\nMahiru cautiously removed the two glasses that were on the table, so that was not an issue. Nevertheless, a mishap could have happened if it continued.\nAmane would not be angry even if the juice was spilled onto the carpet, but he really hoped this would not happen, considering the effort required to clean it.\n“Be honest, you.” Mahiru too reproached.\nThe wry smile showed that Mahiru had no intention to actually stop Chitose, for she knew that the latter would be worn out if she had no breaks.\n“Uuu~~ I’ll just go to Mahirun’s lap since there’s nowhere to go to.”\n“Hold it. That’s my place.”\n“Wahh, you miser. Can I, Mahirun~?”\n“…If Amane-kun says no, then no.”\nMahiru lowered her eyes and shook her head, acting somewhat stiff.\nChitose did not look displeased by Mahiru’s gesture, and instead showed a happy smile.\n“I don’t get a lap pillow, but as long as you’re happy, Mahirun.”\nMahiru appeared to be more bashful than delighted, but her face started to blush and relax, so Chitose was probably right.\nPerhaps Mahiru was delighted to hear the word ‘my place’.\n“Go enjoy it in my place then~ I’ll be motivated to write seeing you enjoy yourself.”\n“Like hell, I know you just want to joke around. She’s not going to run away because she’s mine, and I’ll do it when you’re not around.”\n“So you’ll do it?”\n“I have the privilege Ah whatever, I’ll buy sweets for you, so hurry up with your assignments.”\n“Really!?”\nChitose suddenly jolted with sparkling eyes, and once again, Amane was painfully aware of how realistic she was.\nI’ve been waiting for these words.\nShe chuckled, causing Amane and Mahiru to smile wryly.\n“So, a reward’s a reward. I’ll go buy some if you get serious.”\n“Goody goody~! You really are magnanimous Amane~! The usual shop I go to then! Cheesecake! Souffle!”\n“That’s a tall order…though it’s not that far…”\nThe shop was a little further from the nearby patisserie, and more expensive, but they were about the same. Mahiru too seemed fond of that shop, so Amane was not opposed.\n“What about you Mahiru?”\n“Eh, me…?”\n“How about Mahirun go with you?”\n“Nope, you’ll definitely slack. I don’t want her walking out there in the heat.”\n“How little do you trust me…but since you’re a gentleman Amane, I’ll endure for now.”\n“I don’t feel like buying yours then.”\n“Then what is the point of the reward…?”\n“So shut up and do your assignments.”\nAmane ignored Chitose’s doubtful look, and asked Mahiru what she wanted.\nChocolate cake\n, so the response, and he stood up.\nCakes would not sell well in the summer, but there was always a chance that they would be sold out, so it was better to hurry out.\n“Now then, let’s go.”\nAmane took his wallet, left the living room, and Mahiru discreetly followed.”\nIt appeared she intended to send him off, and as he sat the entrance and put on his sneakers, Mahiru knelt down on one knee next to him.\n“What?”\n“Erm, I apologize for making you go out in this hot weather…”\n“Ah it’s fine, I’m the one who said it anyway. More importantly, keep an eye on Chitose.”\n“Fufu, she may usually act like that, but she is very serious if she has to, you know?”\n“I know that I know that, just keep an eye on her. Make sure she rests adequately, and get her to work hard.”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru nodded with a smile, and Amane too smiled as he stood up.\n“I’ll be leaving then.”\n“Ah, Amane-kun, please wait a moment.”\nAmane turned around as Mahiru called for him, and she suddenly latched onto his chest.\nThe sudden situation had him stunned, and she gently reached her arms around his back, hugging him.\nThe faint fragrance and softness left him stifled. He resisted the urge to cry out, patted Mahiru’s head for the time being, and she narrowed her eyes in a ticklish manner, lifting her head.\n“…I am a little tired from studying. Please give me some extra.”\nShe muttered softly, and Amane could not help but hug her. Her eyes looked bashful, but there was a smile on her face.\n“…I’m not letting go if you say so.”\n“That will not do. Chitose-san will be sad.”\n“…Until she returns home then, okay?”\n“Of course.”\nMahiru nodded, and buried her face into his chest. Amane made up his mind to settle this quickly and return home.",

      "content": "After buying cakes for Chitose and Mahiru, Amane returned to his apartment, and found that thing inside the letterbox at the entrance of the apartments.\nAn anonymous letter was mixed amidst the usual adverts.\n“To Amane Fujimiya” so the fine handwriting on the letter. Amane had no idea who delivered it, casually flipped it, and doubted his eyes.\nThe sender’s name was on the back.\nAsahi Shiina.\n…Mahiru’s dad, huh?\nAmane knew that Mahiru’s mother was named Sayo, and not the name listed on the letter.\nAlso, that man was probably the only one who knew of Amane.\nHe probably witnessed Mahiru welcoming him back then, and a simple investigation would show how intimate Amane and Mahiru.\nHowever, Amane did not understand why the man purposely delivered a letter to him. It was one thing to deliver to his own daughter, and he did not think it was necessary to deliver it to his daughter’s boyfriend.\nMahiru said that her father was callous towards her, but if that was the case, he would not have dropped by to observe.\nAmane could not understand the father’s intentions at all.\nCaught in a dilemma, Amane decided to return home and open the letter once Chitose left, so he slipped it into his bag.\n“You seem amiss after returning home. Did something happened.”\nChitose returned home after grumbling and finishing about 70% of her assignments, so Mahiru leaned over to look at Amane.\nAmane intended to open the letter once Mahiru went home, but it appeared the latter noticed that he had been hiding something from her.\nHowever, it would be more appropriate to say that Amane did not know what was written on it, rather than outright trying to hide from her. He felt it was best if Mahiru would not realize so easily, but since she was suspicious, perhaps it would be more appropriate if he never hid this matter to begin with.\n“Ah, erm, well.”\n“Hm…ah, it is not that I have to know, if you do not wish to inform me.”\nMahiru clearly respected Amane’s opinion, and Amane put his feet on the floor, looking at her.\n“Not that I don’t want to tell you…but you may not want to listen.”\n“What I do not want to…ah, is that so?”\nShe probably noticed it involved her parents, and showed a faint, wry smile.\n“Is that man still nearby?”\n“Not at all…I received a letter.”\n“A letter? From who?”\n“…The name’s Asahi Shiina.”\n“That is my father.”\nMahiru nodded tersely, not looking as rattled as Amane would have imagined. She seemed blase rather than shaken by it, and a little taken aback.\nHer eyes looked a little colder however, probably because of how her parents had treated her.\n“Anyway, I am curious as to why he sent a letter to you, Amane-kun, and how did he know of our relationship, but that has nothing to do with me, I believe.”\n“You’re not concerned about what’s written on it?”\n“I do not have an interest in peeking at others’ letters. The sender may be my father, but the recipient is you.”\nAmane felt that he was too concerned about her, given her adamant reply, and she ended up worrying about him instead.\nHowever, it seemed that Mahiru would rather not get involved, rather than accept the situation.\nHer eyes drifted aside slightly, and did not look as calm as usual. “You may read, shall I move away for now?” She asked with an icy tone, and Amane shook his head with a wry look.\n“Hm…well, I hope you’ll stay by my side. I don’t mind if you don’t like this idea, but I’m a little nervous to read a letter from my girlfriend’s parent.”\n“I shall remain here then…it is up to you to decide whether to read the letter’s contents to me.”\nMahiru started reading the textbooks on the table. Amane sighed, and look the letter from the bag next to him.\nThe letter was sealed really tightly. He opened it cautiously, and read the contents.\nSimply put, the sender wanted to meet Amane face to face to have a chat, and included his contact.\n…Why me? Is he not going to check on Mahiru’s situation?\nAmane had no idea why he, someone who was completely unrelated, was invited out.\n“…Looks like he wants to meet me.”\n“Not his own daughter, but you, Amane-kun? I see.”\nMahiru’s voice became more frosty, and Amane instinctively patted Mahiru’s head, who felt ticklish and narrowed her eyes.\n“No, I am not angry…I simply do not understand what he means, why he wants to meet you.”\n“…I guess it’s because a guy’s approaching his daughter.”\n“That is impossible. Why would he ask now given that he ignored me all this time.”\n“…How shall I deal with this?”\n“I shall not stop you from meeting him.”\nIt seemed Mahiru really intended to leave it to Amane, for her reply was very blase.\n“Ah, but I do not think you have to worry. He is a failure as a father, but he is not someone to threaten others…I should not be saying this as someone who do not understand my father however.”\n“…Mahiru.”\n“I do not know what he is planning, but rest assured, he is not the kind to harm others. You are free to meet him, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru said, and leaned onto Amane. “I see.” Amane gently muttered, and looked at the letter again.",

      "content": "It was the last day of summer vacation.\nAmane found the person he wanted to meet at a cafe not too far from home, and straightened his back.\nStanding before Amane was a man with a familiar looking flax-colored hair, caramel-colored eyes, white skin, and a poised demeanor.\nAmane once brushed him by, and chatted. They never gave their names, but Amane had already heard of the man’s name from Mahiru.\n“Asahi Shiina-san.”\nHe called out, and the man, Asahi Shiina, turned his eyes towards Amane, showing a faint smile.\n“This is our first encounter…or not, though I shall say this is the first time we are meeting while knowing each other.”\n“…Oh, yes. I heard from Mahiru.”\nThe man did not seem to falter when Amane mentioned her name directly, and he probably had this investigated thoroughly.\nAsahi then showed a faint, wry smile once he heard that.\nHe did not have a feeble impression, but a gentle one, and on first glance, he did not seem like one who would mercilessly abandon MAhiru.\n“I suppose this saves us some explanation. May I have some of your time?”\n“That’s the reason why you called me out, I suppose?”\n“Yes, I am very grateful that you would accept my hasty request. I suggested it, but I never expected you to agree.”\n“Well, I’m very curious as to why you would call me out…but I think you shouldn’t be looking for me, but Mahiru instead.”\n“You say so…but that child might not wish to meet me”\nAsahi showed a wry smile, filled with regret, it seemed.\nAmane was furious about Mahiru’s situation, and found Asahi unforgivable, but he did not think Asahi was not an compassionate man, for the latter would not have silently tried to approach his own daughter otherwise.\nAnd thus, Amane was increasingly skeptical.\nAsahi tickled his cheek, looking perturbed, perhaps because he had noticed Amane’s probing eyes.\n“You have lots to ask me, I presume? Let us enter that cafe first then, and not ask so much here.”\nAmane nodded in agreement, since they should not stand too long near a cafe, and entered it along with Asahi.\n“Order as you wish. It is the last day of summer vacation after all, and I troubled you by inviting you out.”\nAmane did occasionally visit this cafe, which had suite rooms for booking. It seemed Asahi had prearranged a booking, for they were ushered in.\nThey sat down, face to face, and the genial looking Asahi smiled as he recommended dishes to Amane.\nI shall accept your graciousness then.\nAmane replied, and ordered the coffee and daily cake special on the menu. Asahi too requested for the same from the attendant.\nHis face remained serene, and he was silent until the dishes were served.\nAsahi was silent, probably because he did not want the attendant to overhear them, but Amane found it awkward to be facing a man of similar age to his own father.\nAmane sorted out the things he wanted to ask, wanting to alleviate this awkwardness. After doing so three times, their orders were finally served.\n“So, what do you want?”\nOnce he made sure the attendant left, Amane spoke up.\nIt was rude of him, but Asahi did not seem to mind, and smiled away.\n“Hm, I heard you are dating my daughter, so I want to ask you how that child is doing…probably.”\n“…Nothing special.”\n“You are really wary of me.”\n“Of course.”\n“Yes, it is strange if you are not wary of me.”\nAsahi nodded understandingly, and Amane bit his lips, not knowing what to do.\nHe could have acted defiantly if Asahi was as aloof to his own daughter as the mother, and various others means.\nHowever, the impression he gave was one who was worried about his daughter, and really unlike someone who abandoned her. By this conversation alone, Amane would have assumed him to be a kind father.\nAmane was curious as to why Asahi abandoned Mahiru.\n“I really want to ask, why are you making the effort to approach Mahiru right now?”\nRight now?\nAmane spoke with a bemeaning tone, for he saw how hurt Mahiru was.\nThe thorns on her had never fallen off for years, and caused her much suffering.\nThey finally fell off recently, and the wounds were healed, but if new wounds were inflicted, how would he find it bearable?\n“……You really do treasure that child.”\nAsahi did not retaliate with harshness, and merely looked impressed, and yet delighted, at Amane.\n“I have no intentions of taking that child away, and do not intend to do anything you worry about, anything to affect that child’s life.”\n“…Really?”\n“Naturally…at the very least, I have no right to interfere with that child’s life, and I do not intend to.”\n“Then why did you try to look for Mahiru?”\n“…You ask that, but I do find it difficult to explain. I just want to meet her.”\n“Even though you abandoned Mahiru?”\nAmane knew he should not say this as an outsider.\nBut despite that…he could not forgive Mahiru’s parents for what they did to her.\nAmane showed clear hostility, which he hardly did, but Asahi was not angry, and merely took on that glare with calmness.\n“That truly is direct from you…yes, I do feel that at this point, I have no right to be that child’s father. I doubt that child really thinks of me as her father, probably just an outsider who is merely blood related.”\n“…You know that’s what she’s thinking, so I guess you understand what you did.”\n“I cannot shun away from what I have done…Sayo I have not done anything that a parent should do, and we basically abandoned her. It is to be expected that we would be reproached.”\nAmane bit his lips hard once he saw how Asahi calmly and gently analyzed what they did in an objective manner.\nWhy, didn’t you do so earlier…\n…Why did they not reflect on their actions earlier?\nIf that was the case, Mahiru might not be so hurt. She might not be able to get the love from her mother, but there was a chance she could have received it from her father, and could have been smiling happily.\nWhy did he only regret it at this point? Amane did not know to whom he should be outraged at.\nAmane might not have the right to be outraged, and his fury might seem unreasonable.\nBut despite that, he had this notion.\nWhy did he not help her out a little earlier.\n“‘If they found it inconvenient, they should not have given birth to me.’…who do you think said that? That’s Mahiru herself. You drove her to that extent.”\n“……Yes.”\nAmane tried his best to stop his voice from shaking, and finished with a poised voice. The response he had was an expression that accepted everything, which infuriated him further.\n“Why didn’t you have such an attitude in the first place, rather than abandon Mahiru and regret it now? Mahiru wouldn’t be that hurt if that happened.”\n“You are correct…I do know that I did the worst thing possible as a father.”\n“…But seriously, why do you want to meet Mahiru right now? I don’t want to let you two meet if she’s going to be hurt from seeing you. I know that I’m talking too much as an outsider, but if Mahiru’s going to be hurt, I’m not letting you meet her.”\nLogically speaking, he should not be preventing a father from meeting his daugther, but Mahiru refused to meet her father, and Amane’s tone was increasingly forceful.\nAsahi sheepishly took on Amane’s harsh glare, and showed a bitter smile.\n“Why I want to meet that child, you ask…why exactly?”\n“Are you avoiding the topic?”\n“I am not intending to, but, it is difficult to convey in words…well, I want to meet her while I have the chance.”\n“You mean you won’t get to meet her again, or that you won’t intend to meet her again?”\n“Yes.”\nAsahi affirmed, and bitterness spread in Amane’s mouth.\n“…That is selfish.”\n“Yes, it really is. I do not intend to change this, and I can no longer do so. I do not intend to inflict more unhappiness on that child however, so I think it might be better for me to hate me instead.”\n“I don’t understand what you’re saying.”\n“You will understand one day.”\nAmane understood from Asahi’s distant looking eyes that the latter was not prepared to mention anything more, and stopped asking.\n“Is there anything you wish to ask?”\n“…Nothing, that’s it.”\n“Hm…shall I ask a question then?”\n“Please do.”\n“…Is that child happy now?”\nAmane, not knowing what Asahi would have asked, postured himself, and Asahi asked with a gentle look.\nHis voice and expression seemed to imply that he was wishing happiness for his daughter, so Amane let out a little sigh of relief.\n“…You need to ask her, but I do wish I can ensure her happiness, I have confidence that I will, and that I will make her happiness.\nIt was his wish, his confidence, and his determination.\nAmane had no intention of abandoning the kind, delicate girl who yearned for love more than anyone else.\nHe hoped for her to maintain a smile the entire time, and wanted to personally grant her happiness. He made up his mind to give her happiness, and had no intention to change this will of his, no matter what others say.\nAmane’s voice was not too loud, but it was indomitable. Once he affirmed so readily, the caramel-colored eyes opposite him widened, and at the next moment, relaxed in relief.\n“I see. I am glad to hear you say that.”\nThe gentle smile was really reminiscent of Mahiru’s.\n“…I have no right to ask of you, but I shall entrust that child to you.”\n“Obviously, I’ll make her happy.”\n“I see…thank you.”\nAmane’s voice and attitude were truly vulgar, and he would have expected to be reproached, but Asahi was smiling happily. Feeling inexplicably conflicted, “There’s nothing to thank me for.” Amane retorted with a tone that was not as blunt.\nTN: Mahiru means middle of noon, Sayo (mother) means little night, Asahi (father) means morning sun. They’re never meant to meet.",

      "content": "Amane returned home after bidding farewell to Asahi. Mahiru was seated on the sofa, looking calm, as normal.\nUsually, she would welcome Amane at the door if she was at his place, but this was the one day it did not happen.\nMahiru was being strangely uneasy, and seemed to be forcing herself to relax, if anything. She did not let down her guard, and looked towards Amane.\n“I’m done talking.”\n“I see.”\nThe frosty sounding voice was not directed at Amane, but rather that she was working hard to remain calm.\nAmane tried his best to show a kind expression, and silently sat next to her.\nOnce he did, Mahiru gently nudged her body towards him. She was not acting sickeningly sweet like usual, but of one who need solace.\n…She’s probably feeling uneasy.\nShe might try to look nonchalant, but the fact remained that the father who abandoned her for years was looking for her boyfriend. She did not think her father was one to be overbearing, but she was somewhat worried.\n“Nothing that you’re worried about…he’s a lot more composed than I imagined.”\n“Is that so?”\n“…Do I talk about what we chatted?”\n“As you wish. Please do tell me if you think it is better for me to know.”\nSo Mahiru said, but it seemed she was terrified of hearing those contents. Amane held her hands that were about to shiver.\nHe felt he should inform her after all.\nHe did not understand what Asahi was thinking, why he did not meet his own daughter, but the boyfriend, but at the very least, he should inform Mahiru that Asahi was not intending to inflict further pain on her.\n“Well, I can be sure that Asahi-san’s not going to do anything to you. He said he’s not going to break up your current life.”\n“…That is good.”\n“And also, he didn’t tell me all the reasons why he didn’t want to see you, just that he’s not going to see you again, so he wanted to have a look at you one last time until that happens.”\nUpon hearing that, Mahiru muttered, “Why did he have to appear when he never did?”\nHowever, her voice was filled with bitterness, rather than condescension.\n“…I don’t think Asahi-san feels that you’re unimportant…and it looks like he really wishes for your happiness.”\nAnd it was for this reason that Amane was perplexed.\nWhy did Asahi only wish for his daughter’s happiness at this point? Why did he not abandon her to begin with, rather than regret it? Mahiru would not have to be so lonely.\nAmane finished his words with much difficulty, and Mahiru gently sighed.\n“…To be honest, I do not understand how my parents are like.”\nHer voice was soft as she tried to form words, yet it was clear.\n“My impression of my parents is that they could just pay someone to raise me, that they are outsiders who are just blood related.”\nMahiru flatly noted her true thoughts, looking stiffer than usual, and a little devoid of life.\n“They never cared for me no matter what happened, no matter how obedient I acted, and never held my hands no matter how I tried to reach out…it is to be expected that I will never reach out to them, that I no longer have hope.”\nAmane had a feeling that Mahiru never had hope for her parents for she never received care and concern.\nHe did not think this was a wrong judgment. She understood inside her childish heart that her parents never loved her, that she could not hope for anything, and it was to be expected that she stopped desiring for them, out of self-defense.”\n“…I know my father’s capable at work, and is a decent person, but the fact remains that he never cared about me. I do not know how to deal with him, and truth be told, I am very conflicted about him suddenly showing care for me again.”\n“Yes.”\n“…Really, why did he show up again?”\n“Yes.”\n“If he had appeared a little sooner, I…”\nMahiru did not continue.\nAmane could only hear her quivering breath. Soon, she closed her mouth.\nShe pursed her lips nervously, and blinked frequently, looking on the verge of tears. She did not cry however, and it seemed she was quietly waiting for the turmoil inside her heart to pass.\nShe looked so weak and fleeting, and Amane embraced her, burying her face into his chest.\nBack then, Amane covered her with a blanket when she met her mother.\nThis time, he had nothing to cover her, so he embraced her, accepting her.\nThe slender body in his clutches shivered, but there was no sobbing.\nShe probably had no intention to lift her head, and leaned into him, burying her face into his chest for a while.\nShe lifted her head, and her eyes were not red.\nShe probably did cool down a little while in his clutches, and while her eyes appeared to falter a little, she did not seem to be in much pain.\n“…What do you want to do?”\nOnce Amane saw that she had calmed down, he asked, and she lowered her eyes.\n“…I do not know, but I think this is for the best. Given that he only showed up now, I cannot ascertain him correctly to be my father.”\n“I see.”\n…Is it strange for me as a daughter?”\n“Everyone has a different interpretation of this, and I can’t really conclude for all. I think though that it’s not weird for you to have such thoughts, and I won’t deny it. If you think so, that’s good, I’ll support your decision.”\n“…Yes.”\nIt was not up to Amane to determine if it was strange.\nPersonally looking, it was no wonder that Mahiru could not view her parents as her parents, for they never did anything a parent should do. They never gave Mahiru love, and it would be troubling for her if she had to treat them as her parents.\n“I support your decision. I’m just an outsider, and I can’t really interfere with your family issues, but I’ll respect your opinion, and support you no matter what happens.”\n“…Yes.”\n“I’ll always stay by your side, so if there’s anything you’re unsure of, you can always rely on me.”\nAmane had made up his mind, that he had no intention of abandoning Mahiru, and love her with all his mind.\nHe once heard from his parents’ friends that the Fujimiyas had overflowing love, and he found that he too was no exception, so he chuckled.\nHe felt that his feelings for Mahiru would never disappear.\nIt was not a prediction, but a belief.\nHe never was one to change his preferences, so that too should apply for the one he loved.\nOnce the adorable girl heard Amane’s words, she frowned, wrapped her arms around his back, as though implying that she would never let him go.\n“…Will you really stay by my side.”\n“Of course.”\n“…I will not go back then. Please do no leave me alone…will you accept me if I say that.”\nUpon hearing the depressing mutter, “Of course.” Amane flatly answered.\n“If you’re willing, you can stay here forever. We’re going to be staying together in a few years away, so how about we practice it?”\nMahiru probably understood Amane’s intent in that joke of a question, and her face, on the verge of tears, immediately turned beetroot.\nAmane too felt awkward as he knew what he had just said, but once he saw Mahiru’s eyes roll around, her face freezing in embarrassment, he felt at ease.\n“…Don’t worry, you’re not going to be alone. Give up on that notion.”\nAmane muttered as he concealed his heartbeat, and Mahiru teared up for a different reason, nodding away.",

Slept well?”\n“…Somewhat. I am bothered because of you though, Amane-kun.”\n“You hate that?”\n“…Please do not ask me so when you already know.”\nMahiru blushed as she dope slapped him with her gloved hand, and he started laughing without a shred of conscience, went to the washroom, and tidied himself.\n“…Why are you looking at me?”\n“Well, I think you’re so adorable when you’re embarrassed.”\n“I think it is bad of you to tease me more.”\n“It’s fine if it’s just you.”\nMahiru remained embarrassed at the dining table. Amane stared at her, and she started to pout a little…or rather, a deliberate act to hide her embarrassment.\nShe still recalled the events that transpired the previous day, “baka.” and muttered before taking a bite of omelette. She was reproaching Amane, but it sounded so adorable.\nThe slightly pursed lips were probably because of Amane’s attitude.\nShe was miffed, but she remained elegant in how she ate breakfast, which was comforting. Amane gave her a warm stare, and she seemed to have noticed it as she gave him a reluctant look.\n“…What is it?”\n“Nothing. I just feel blessed to be able to have a good breakfast together with you.”\n“…I do feel blessed too, but you are deliberately saying so now, are you not?”\n“That’s for you to figure out.”\nAmane said, and Mahiru gently kicked at his feet under the table. Amane stopped teasing her as she continued to eat with a bashful look, and slightly continued with his breakfast.",

      "content": "“I believe you did not forget anything, no?”\nAmane sorted his clothes again after breakfast, and was about to head out when Mahiru called out to me.\nHe probably did not forget anything, since he did prepare beforehand.\nThey would be in school for half the day, no need for textbooks, and probably only indoor slippers, stationery, assignments, and some forms to be submitted. He did put them all in a bag, checked through them, and it should be fine.\n“I don’t think so.”\n“Really?”\n“Why are you not trusting me at all?”\n“…Did you not forget this?”\nMahiru said, looking somewhat dumbfounded. She showed Amane the designated school tie, which Amane found it too stuffy to wear, and intended to do so later.\nAhhh,\nhe instinctively blurted, and heard Mahiru sigh.\n“You are participating in an after holiday assembly. You should take note of your appearance.”\nMahiru grumbled as she got ready to put the tie on Amane, who was strangely apologetic as he bent down.\nAmane would put on his tie every day before summer vacation, and could do it on his own, but he had no intention to refuse her help when she wanted to do it.\nMahiru put on the tie with a grim look, and amane smiled.\n…She’s going to be embarrassed again once she realizes what she’s doing.\nMahiru took the initiative to act like a newlywed, and he was glad.\nAmane was really grateful that she was willing to do so, showing concern for him, and actually doing it naturally. What he would be most delighted with was that he could see her looking embarrassed once she realized what she did.\nHe saw her passionately put on his tie, and she probably noticed something amiss in his expression, for she gave him a doubtful look.\n“…What is it?”\n“No, it’s nothing. Just thinking that you’re cute, Mahiru.”\n“It does seem you have assumed that you can bluff you way through by calling me cute.”\n“Nope, but it’s a fact that you’re cute.”\n“…Even if you keep saying so…well, it is fine if it is only directed to me.”\nMahiru said somewhat enthusiastically, and quickly latched his tie. Amane controlled his smile, and did not intend to keep teasing her again.\nInstead, he patted her head, and held her hand.\n“Let’s go then.”\n“…It feels like I have been misdirected once again.”\n“You’re overthinking it.”\nAmane played dumb, slung his bag, picked up Mahiru’s, and went for the door.\nMahiru wanted to carry it herself, but Amane could not leave everything to her. He might really be relying on her thoroughly if he could not do this much at least.\nAmane showed no intention of budging, and Mahiru’s cheeks relaxed as she looked somewhat happy, before she gently ribbed her head onto his elbow.\n“What?”\n“…it is nothing.”\n“Doesn’t feel like it.”\n“Since you said it was nothing, it is the same for me.”\n“You’re making it difficult for me to ask. Ah whatever, it’s nothing, alright?”\nAmane chuckled, put on his shoes at the door, and left home together with Mahiru.\n“I’m leaving.”\nHe muttered to himself, and Mahiru stared at Amane for a while, before imitating him, “I am leaving.”\nAmane’s cheeks relaxed in joy as he quietly noted to himself that this was the home Mahiru would return to, and Mahiru did not ask further.\nThe reason was that Mahiru herself was blushing a little, smiling away. There was no way she could nitpick about Amane at this point.\nSo Amane held the hand of the blissful Mahiru, who grabbed it in return.",

      "content": "The heat had yet to dissipate in September. The heat waves rumbled on in the morning, and the sun was too dazzling.\nHowever, Amane did not feel that hot, for he saw Mahiru walking next to him, looking refreshed.\nThe hand holding his was colder, and felt comfortable to touch.\n“It’s hot huh.”\n“It is considered Autumn, but it does seem like it will take a while to cool down.”\nMahiru fanned herself with the hand not holding Amane’s. Her expression remained cool and collected despite what she said, and Amane’s face in turn was distorted from the heat, given that his black hair was hot due to the sunlight it absorbed.\n“Hmm…I don’t like hot days though.”\n“Is that so?”\n“I’m better with the cold. Besides, you don’t like the smell of sweat, right?”\n“…I do not mind if it is yours.”\n“Alright, so I hate it. Got to take note of it.”\nAmane could not expect himself to simply give off a nice fragrance, but he definitely did not want to give off a foul smell, so he had been paying attention to it. Moreso when he had to live together with someone.\nAmane quietly decided that he would wipe himself dry with body paper at school, and use some odorless deodorant. Mahiru then brought her nose to his elbow.\n“…Your original scent is nice, Amane-kun.”\n“…Thanks. You smell great as usual too.”\n“Th-that is because I have been taking care of myself. I do not want to make you suffer too, Amane-kun.”\n“I feel the same. Do understand.”\nUltimately, both of them felt the same. Amane chuckled as he felt the cooling air in the heat, slowly walking towards school along with Mahiru’s pace.\n“……You two trying to blind us early in the morning?”\n“Blind what?”\nAmane and Mahiru chatted away once they sat down, and found some reason, Itsuki greeted them with a cringing face.\nThe air conditioning was switched on in the classroom, and it was cooling. Every classroom had one, and they would not be bothered by the outside heat.\n“Like…you two are making out so much, it’s blinding.”\n“What’s blinding? We’re just chatting.”\n“Yeah, you’re definitely talking like serious students, but well, the mood and attitude and eyes…”\nOnce they arrived at the classroom, they greeted their classmates, sat together for some mock test revisions, and it seemed this sight felt so passionate to the onlookers.\nAmane was simply revising seriously, and had no idea how it looked so passionate.\n“Say, can you please stop acting sweet instinctively with Shiina publicly?”\n“We didn’t do anything. We’re just checking what we’re tested, quizzing each other.”\n“…Say, Amane.”\n“I don’t know what you’re getting at.\nWhatcha saying?\nSo he gave such a look, but Itsuki was giving the same look back at him.\n“Look around you.”\nAmane did as Itsuki said, looked around, and saw the boys giving him murderous looks, the girls looked elated, and somewhat envious.\nKadowaki, Hiiragi and Kuju, who were chatting away, gave them wry looks, and Amane’s face cringed.\n“You two have been really dazzling recently, you know?”\n“…Aren’t you the same with Chitose?”\n“What do you mean? We’re deliberately doing it openly. It’s not like we’re acting like you two, giving off all that newlywed vibe.”\n“It’s weird hearing you said that.”\nAmane felt it was weirder for Itsuki to say that his frolicking till this point was deliberate, but apparently to the entire class, it seemed the fault was with Amane.\nMahiru’s cheeks turned red once she heard Itsuki say so, and it seemed she was in discomfort, for she might have realized so. Amane really hoped that Mahiru would have said so earlier.\n“Anyway, be careful…it’ll be dangerous if you two do what you did back during the summer festival.”\n“What do you mean, dangerous?”\n“…I too feel it is a pity to show Amane-kun to others.”\nWait, is it that ridiculous?\nAmane answered once he heard Mahiru mutter, and patted her head. She pursed her lips slightly, seemingly pouting as she said, “This is where you are hopeless, Amane-kun.”",

      "content": "It was the first day of the school semester, and the school assembly ended, their homeroom teacher ended the session, and they could return home.\nHowever, it was also because they had tests the next day.\n“I don’t wanna have tests~”\nOnce class was dismissed, Chitose said next to Itsuki, sprawled on the table, and grumbled in frustration.\n“Really? I think it’s easy if you do your revision normally. We have it easy here since we can go home earlier during exam period.”\n“You and Mahirun get to say this since you’re elite students~ ordinary students hate tests~ isn’t that right, Yuu-chan?”\n“Ahahaha, well, I understand what you two are thinking. I feel a little lonely since I don’t have club activities, but a rest day is a luxury to me. I don’t really have any thoughts about tests.”\n“Ughh, you’re an elite student too Yuu-chan…?”\nKadowaki was the ace of the track team, but he was not all brawns. His studies were good, and in fact, he was in the upper echelon.\nChitose did not participate in any clubs, but she used to be on the track team, and preferred to be physically active rather than studying, which was why she was bad at the latter. Truth be told, the biggest reason was that she hated studying.\n“Ikkun~, everyone’s bullying me.”\n“No point looking for me. Well, just work hard, Chii.”\n“Ikkun you traitor. You’ve been secretly studying during summer break.”\n“I don’t get my freedom if my grades are too poor.”\nItsuki laughed. According to him, his parents demanded that he improve his greats.\nHe was capable to begin with, smart, but he always prioritized Chitose, resulting in his grades being average. His father was probably unhappy about this.\nGuess that guy has it tough with his family,\nso Amane pitied as he prepared to go home. It appeared Mahiru was done, for she approached him while holding her bag.\n“My apologies for keeping you waiting. I was talking to the teacher…”\n“Ah it’s fine, I’m just chatting with them. Chitose’s just rambling stuff like tests tomorrow, and such.”\n“I cannot help you there.”\n“You’ve forsaken me!?”\n“We will be having them tomorrow, and it is too reckless to remember everything that is to be tested, impossible even…and besides, what is the point of the long break?”\nChitose, who looked up pleadingly to Mahiru, collapsed onto the table again once she heard this rational take.\nYou reap what you sow,\nAmane gave a look of pity, and he was really powerless to help with her lack of memory and hard work.\nHowever, once Mahiru said those harsh words of concern, she showed a conflicted smile, took a file from her bag, and handed it over to Chitose along with the documents.\n“I expected this, so I have sorted out likely areas that will be tested. You probably will not fail.”\n“Mahirun you Angel!”\n“I have told you many times not to call me that…”\nChitose leaped and hugged Mahiru, causing the latter to frown.\nOn a side note, Amane did contribute to this file full of notes that could possibly be tested in this exam.\nAmane and Mahiru both understood the habits of the teachers setting the papers, and chose points that they might choose. They would be sorry if they did not manage to pinpoint the teacher’s habits, but the crucial points should allow for Chitose to get just enough marks to pass.\n“Amane-kun did help too. Do thank you.”\n“Amane…”\n“What?”\n“Which one do you want, a photo of Mahirun happily eating crepes with cream on her face, or a teary, shivering Mahirun while watching a horror flick?”\n“Chitose-san!?”\n“Why not both?’\n“Amane-kun too!?”\nMahiru frowned, blushing furiously, for her photo was taken without her knowledge. Amane burst out laughing.\n“Just joking.”\n“…Really?”\n“I’ll keep it if you send me.”\nThe photos were not at fault, and Amane was naturally glad to receive the photos of his girlfriend’s adorable side, as seen from her friend.\nMahiru looked displeased to hear Amane say so, but she was not angry at him, for Chitose was cackling away. “Chitose-san no baka.” She cried out loudly.\n“Say Mahirun, it’s good that you’re on good terms with Amane, and it’s a dream for him to have his lover’s photos, you know?”\n“That is a completely different matter.”\nMahiru said adamantly, and turned her head aside. Both Amane and Chitose laughed, and she pouted away.",

      "content": "“So you took it?”\nMahiru remained peeved once they got home, asking Amane.\nShe did not mind the fact that her photo was taken, but it seemed she did not want Amane to see it, and her eyes seemed spiteful as she looked at him.\n“Hazard a guess.”\n“I shall add lots of tsuyu sauce and wasabi to your soba noodles, Amane-kun. It shall be so delicious, you shall tear and snivel .”\n“Sorry, I didn’t take them actually.”\nThe soba noodles for lunch were taken as hostage, and thus, Amane confessed honestly as diverting the topic was not effectual at all.\nMahiru was the one on the photos, and Amane did not take them willing since she was unhappy about it. Of course, he did intend for Chitose to send them over, assuming that Mahiru allowed for it.\nMahiru clearly looked relieved once Amane said so, and was a lot happy, “That is good.” She tied her hair, and got ready to cook.\n“…Are you that unwilling?”\n“No-not that I am…just that the expression are too embarrassing…I do think they will definitely not look adorable.\n“You don’t look embarrassing at all. Actually, you’ll definitely look adorable.”\n“I do think it is bad of you to say so, Amane-kun.”\n“What’s bad about that?”\n“Bad for my heart.”\nMahiru turned her face aside, tied her hair into a bun, put on the apron, and started washing.\nAmane too intended to prepare the condiments and wash the plates, so he stood next to her, washing his hands. He glanced aside at Mahiru, and found her face blushing slightly.\n“…What will you do if Akazawa-san is to send over an embarrassing photo of you?”\n“Well, depending on the kind of photo. I’l probably forgive him unless it is something that’s not to be shown into the light of day. Itsuki won’t send over anything anything outrageous, and he won’t take them to begin with. I don’t remember embarrassing myself that much before him.”\n“…Are cat ears forgivable?”\n“If it’s about those forced on me during the karaoke session, that’s fine.”\nMahiru was probably referring to the time when the three boys went for a karaoke session together. For some reason, Itsuki had cat ears with him, stuffed them onto Amane, and took photos of him. Itsuki and Kadowaki stifled their laughter, and Amane immediately pulled them off, but it appeared a photo was taken.\nMahiru awkwardly lowered her head once Amane accepted it.\n“…I am the one sorry for accepting the photos without your permission.”\n“I blame Itsuki for sending it over suddenly. Next time, I’m asking hamburgers from him.”\nItuski probably had other photos lying in his folder, which scared him somewhat, but there probably was nothing too overboard.\nAmane wiped his hands with the soft towel, and smiled at the guilty looking Mahiru.\n“Alright, don’t worry about it. How about you prepare more condiments and sides instead of feeling guilty? I’ll be happier.”\n“…Wasabi too?’\n“In moderation please.”\nAmane answered with a serious look, and Mahiru seemed a little relieved as she smiled, put her head at his elbow, “…this is what I like about you.” and muttered so.\n“We’ll have three days of tests starting tomorrow, but nothing major.”\nAmane patted his stomach happily after he was done eating the soba noodles, and muttered so.\nHe liked to study, and would usually put in some effort, so he did not have to worry about exams. In fact, he was more concerned about his friend’s grades.\n“Yes, we simply need to perform normally as usual.”\n“Chitose’s going to pout and say that elite students can say this if she hears this.”\n“Fufu, Chitose-san is saying so because she does have something she is bad at. I shall teach her properly next time.”\nAmane had a thought that Chitose might end up screaming, but he kept it to himself, and looked over at Mahiru, who remained nonchalant on this day before the tests\n“So, what about the reward this time?’\n“Eh, a reward?”\n“You’re definitely going to be first, but you should have a reward. I’ll do anything as long as I can do it.”\n“Your last reward was a lap pillow, I believe. Assuming so, I should reward you again this time.”\n“Your happiness is my reward, Mahiru.”\n“…I feel the same though. It is sleazy of you to say so.”\nMahiru pursed her lips, clearly looking displeased. She slapped at Amane’s thighs gently, and he held her hand with a wry smile.\n“I want to do something for you. let me do it this time.”\n“Uuu…e-erm, there is something I want.”\n“Something you want?’\nMahiru actually had little to none materialistic desire, and hardly had anything she wanted, but she was asking Amane for one. He looked towards her caramel colored eyes, wondering what it was, and she awkwardly averted her eyes.\n“…Erm, I believe there is a cushion in your room, Amane-kun.”\n“Ah, yes.”\n“I want that.”\nAmane blinked a few times, for what Mahiru wanted was really unexpected. She might be really embarrassed, for she did not hide the redness on her face, fidgeting waay.\n“I’ve used that for a long time. You sure?”\n“It is fine since you have used it a lot…erm…your scent comforts me, Amane-kun.”\n“…Wait, you have a scent fetish, Mahiru?”\n“N-no at all! I like your scent because I like you, Amane-kun, so I am glad if I have you next to me…”\n“O-okay.”\nAmane had a feeling that she just said something embarrassing.\nIt embarrassed him more than if Mahiru had simply said that she loved him. He scratched his cheek, recalling the cushion in the room.\nIn hindsight, Mahiru would always hug the one cushion whenever she visited Amane’s room. He thought it was because she would feel at ease hugging something, but perhaps it was because the cushion belonged to him.\n“…But speaking of which, a cushion?’\n“N-no can do?”\n“Ah, I don’t mind that. You’re saying that you don’t need the actual person?”\nI think it’s better than the cushion scent,\nhe muttered, and heard a murmur.\n“B-but I cannot bring you back, Amane-kun.”\n“You’re right, but I can bring you over.”\n“……”\nMahiru was clearly flushed red. Amane too felt his face turning red, and smiled,\n“If you’re going to stay overnight here, I’ll just…”\n“E-erm, eh, uu…well, I think, I, may, ne-need, to, prepare.”\n“I’m not forcing you. You can drop by whenever you want, and it’s fine if you don’t want to come.”\nThey were lovers, but surely Mahiru would be worried about the prospect of staying overnight, timid even. They did share the same bed several times, but Mahiru never stayed over at Amane’s place as a lover, without anyone disturbing.\nAmane did not plan to do anything, but it was no wonder that Mahiru was really rattled at the prospect of staying over, excited, and terrified. Thus, Amane hoped that Mahiru would visit only when she wanted to.\n“So you sure you’re fine with just the cushion?”\n“Eh…y-yes.”\n“How about this. We can buy some cakes. Since you always work hard, some reward is important.”\nAfter all, it was not good to discuss about something Mahiru had no desire for, so he retracted his words heartily. He frisked his phone, and started searching for cakes Mahiru might like.\nNext to him, Mahiru clearly looked a little flustered. Amane patted her head, and for some reason, she headbutted him, “Amane-kun no baka.” and insulted in an adorable manner.",

      "content": "The tests ended in the blink of an an eye.\nAmane and Mahiru easily dealt with them as they never slacked on it, and the tests were finally over.\nChitose, who became a corpse after the hellish period, “I’m free~” burst out with joy, hands raised, on the last day of the tests.\n“Ahh, I’m so tired~! I survived thanks to you two!”\n“Wait for the results before you say that you survived.”\n“Don’t be a debbie downer~ I feel completely released~! Mahirun Mahirun, let’s go enjoy ourselves with a tea party at the cafe~!”\n“I do not mind. Erm, Amane-kun…”\n“I’m planning to go out with Itsuki, so you two can enjoy yourself. Give me a holler if you’re returning home late. I’ll pick you up.”\nChitose, who was all weary from the last minute cramming of topics, regained her joy, and Amane was not going to stop them.\nThough he and Mahiru were lovers, they should respect each other’s time. He was not so petty to nitpick about her interacting with her friend, and should probably let her enjoy her time.\nMahiru seemed relieved when Amane heartily nodded and agreed.\nI shall do so then,\nshe smiled courteously, and decided to go out with Chitose.\nA beaming Chitose led Mahiru out of the classroom by the hand. Amane watched the latter’s back, and Itsuki smiled as he slapped Amane’s back.\n“When did you say you have plans with me?”\n“Right now.”\nThey never did, but Amane said this so that Mahiru could enjoy herself. Itsuki probably noticed what Amane was planning, and did not comment.\n“Alright alright, nobody’s at home anyway, so I don’t mind.”\n“And I want you to treat me to a burger.”\n“Why?”\n“The cat ears at the karaoke.”\n“You know about that? Shiina-san actually blurted it out huh.”\nItsuki chuckled without remorse, and Amane slapped at Itsuki’s back with a little more force, glaring at him and implying that while it was fine for him to show Mahiru that, Itsuki should have informed Amane.\nHe was unwittingly surprised, rather than furious. He doted on Mahiru, and felt that this trivial thing was nothing as long as Mahiru was happy.\n“I’ll tell you next time. What kind of photo shall I use next time.”\n“You’re not reflecting on your actions, oy.”\nIt seemed Itsuki had more photos of Amane in his phone. Amane frowned at the former’s leer, but did not reproach further, and instead let him off with a little glare.\nMahiru and Chitose were probably having tea at the cafe. Amane and Itsuki arrived at the burger shop.\nIt was a fast food restaurant often frequented by chit-chatting high school students, and besides Amane and ITsuki, there were others of the same school uniform, along with students from other schools.\nAmane made his order, took the served food, sat at his seat, scanned around, and shrugged.\n“There’s quite a lot of people here.”\n“Hm, I think it’s not just us. The other schools are done with tests it seemed. Got some friends from other schools who told me this.”\n“Well, there’s always a mock paper right after vacation. They’re rather active though.”\n“Say Amane, it’s weird how you’re being so casual about this…ah whatever, let’s hurry and eat first.”\nItsuki looked a little dumbfounded, but it seemed he might have given up as he quickly said these words, eating the french fries.\nAmane too followed suit as he unwrapped the burger that was Itsuki’s treat, and took a bite.\nThe taste was familiar, but Amane felt something was lacking. Perhaps a year’s worth of Mahiru’s cooking made his tongue all picky. Of course, there was value to junk food, but he felt Mahiru’s cooking was the best.\n“…You’re the one asking me for a treat, but it looks like you’re yearning Shiina-san’s cooking.”\n“Actually…yeah. This is decent, but there’s the best cooking out there. I’m grateful to be treated to though.”\n“Okay okay, since you two are on such good terms…just get married already.”\n“When the time comes. I can’t get married when I’m 16 now.”\n“You’re being so serious. I knew this was the case. Shiina-san’s giving the same vibe too.”\n“Shut up. It’s not a bad thing right?”\n“No, I’m just relieved. It’s encouraging to me how there’s a couple next to me who’s planning to get married.”\nItsuki and Chitose were in a relationship with a plan to get married. Amane was a comrade in this sense.\nThe only difference was that Itsuki’s father opposed. Itsuki hoped to get his father’s approval, and happily get married with Chitose.\n“…Anyway, how’s it going on your side?”\n“Same old same old. I did brush up my scores so that he won’t nitpick about it. I’ll continue to insist on it, and this is something only I can do, not like I got a choice. How’s it going on your side then?”\nYou two went to your hometown right?\nItsuki leered as he tapped his foot at Amane. Amane too did likewise, and sipped at some orange juice.\n“Nothing special.”\n“What did you two do in the summer…you spend days together, doing nothing? Aren’t you too lax about this?”\n“We’re going at our own pace.”\n“So you mean you kissed and nothing more. It’s fitting how innocent you two are acting.”\nItsuki’s voice remained neutral, relieved instead of dumbfounded. Amane felt a little angsty, and kicked at Itsuki again.\n“…I invited her over for a night, though she didn’t drop by.”\n“You haven’t done it yet? Visited your hometown, didn’t spend the night together? That’s amazing.”\n“Shut up…I don’t plan to do anything…just sleep with her.”\nIt would be a lie to say that he did not wish to do such a thing, but Amane preferred the comfort of sleeping peacefully with her under the same blanket.\nIt appeared Mahiru too liked the company, and she should probably be more than glad to sleep with him.\n“I don’t think this is very normal for a couple. Actually, maybe Shiina-san wants to spend the night with you like this?”\n“She’ll panic if I mention this, so probably not.”\n“She’s still like that even though there’s no way you’ll do anything. You’re the kind to get timid once you see someone looking scared, and definitely stop once you see there’s a chance of getting rejected.\n“Shut up.”\nAmane was peeved to be told that he was timid, but he knew that to others, he was a passive coward, and could not deny so.\n“…It’s fine for you not to do anything. Shiina-san’s definitely going to work hard based on Chii’s suggestion.”\n“Oy, control your girlfriend already. I feel she’s going to teach my Mahiru way too much unnecessary stuff.”\n“I think she’ll say some necessary stuff. It’s no wonder since you two are so passive with no progress.”\nMaybe she’s suggesting (teaching) some stuff now.\nItsuki grinned, and Amane frowned as he looked aside at the unavailable Chitose,\ndon’t give Mahiru any funny ideas.",

      "content": "Mahiru did not contact Amane, and returned home at evening. Thus, Amane did not pick her up.\nHe did not mind that, but one had to say that Mahiru clearly looked strange.\n“What did she teach you.”\nChitose definitely taught Mahiru something, so Amane asked as he stared at her intently. Mahiru, sitting at the side of the sofa, turned her head gingerly like a rusted machine.\nBingo.\nAmane did not intend to let her off, so he sat next to her, put his face close, and Mahiru tried to physically escape.\n“Nothing.”\n“Obviously there’s something. You would’ve told me if there is.”\nYou would have done that at least,\nhe whispered, but Mahiru did not look at him.\nHe wrapped his arms before her, with her back turned her him, and brought his lips to her ears.\n“Mahiru.”\nHe gently called her name, as though breathing into it, and she clearly shivered.\nHe deliberately did so, knowing she was sensitive to voices at her ears, and it was super effective. He continued to embrace Mahiru, seemingly wrapping her, and called for her again, and her body became loose and limber, melting away.\nHe looked down at her as she leaned on his chest, and her face became increasingly rd, her damp caramel-colored eyes staring at him unhappily.\n“…It is sleazy of you.”\n“How so?”\n“You know my ears are my weakness. It is despicable of you to do so.”\n“I don’t think it’s just your ears right?”\nAmane knew that Mahiru was ticklish, but he did not do so, for her mood might be ruined further if he did.\nHe decided to attack with his voice this time, to coax out the answers from the dishonest Mahiru.\nHe smiled impishly, and she pursed her lips.\nShe leaned on him, and insistently turned her head aside, as though she was not going to say anything.\nShe would have\n“Alright, if you’re not saying, I’ll pinch your mouth open.”\n“…P-pinch?”\nMahiru was flushed red for some reason, and the moment she met Amane in the eyes, she lowered her eyes bashfully.\nAmane only intended for a little joke with Mahiru. Perhaps she took it as sexual harassment?\nHe felt it was not advisable to keep teasing her as she was pouting away, so he put his hand on her back. She then turned around completely.\nHer eyes looked a little moist, and for a moment, Amane had an urge to groan. Instead, he decided to pat her head.\n“Just joking. I won’t force you.”\n“…Joking?”\n“I’m not going to do stuff you hate. You don’t have you say it if you want to, but don’t take Chitose’s words seriously.”\nChitose definitely was prompting Mahiru to be proactive, but it would be horrible if they got too enthusiastic and Amane could not control himself. Mahiru should pace her herself.\nHis mental state and body aside, they would be together for a long, long time, and there was nothing to be anxious above…so he implied, but she frowned a little.\n“…Chitose-san did tell me some benefits of romance.”\n“Heh, how so?”\n“I-I cannot say so…but Chitose-san has a lot more dating experience, and told me lots of useful things.”\n“…I think that’s unnecessary knowledge.”\n“I shall decide if it is unnecessary.”\nAmane could not refute that, but even though, he felt that it was better to let things progress little by little, rather than ingrain Mahiru with strange knowledge that would leave her tense and try to do some strange challenge.\nNow what do I do?\nHe shrugged, and she lowered her head slightly.\n“…Is it unnecessary for me to of ways to improve the bond with the one I love, to love more than before?”\nAmane then understood from the disappointed voice that he misspoke.\nMahiru’s perspective was to improve her relationship with Amane when she sought out Chitose’s advise, but that was deemed unnecessary, which devastated her.\nHe did not want to hurt her nor make her sad, but it was a fact that his words hurt her.\nHe wanted to reach out to her in apology, but at the next moment, he felt an impact.\nHe tumbled onto the sofa as it was too sudden. For some reason, Mahiru was on top of him, or to be precise, pining him down.\nA pair of mischievous eyes were looking down through the dangling bangs falling due to gravity.\n“…Chitose’s idea?”\n“She said i am not proactive enough.”\n“Oy that’s on a physical basis. Was that an act just now Missy?”\n“No, I am sad.”\nAmane felt guilt in his heart once he heard the remark accompanied with a wry smile, and inadvertently wrapped his arms around her back.\nMahiru’s face fell onto his clavicle.\nWoah,\nshe called out, but he continued to embrace his adorable girlfriend.\nThe softness excited him from inside-out, and the shampoo fragrance summoned his heartbeat. His doting tendencies still outweighed them however.\n“Sorry, I shouldn’t have said unnecessary stuff. I’m just worried that Chitose said something too suggestive.”\n“I-I think it is not that bad, for now.”\n“I’m worried about this ‘for now’ part, but more importantly…it’s your choice to accept Chitose’s suggestion. Personally though I think it’s a pointless suggestion.”\n“Pointless?’\n“It’s just me…but I want to understand each other little by little, and progress. It doesn’t feel right to just look into the future and not enjoy the present time and mood.”\nYou can say I’m a coward though.\nHe quipped wryly, and sighed.\nHe understood that Mahiru seemed to have taken Chitose’s suggestion as the trigger, and understood that Mahiru really loved him. He was glad about that.\nHowever, he felt that it was not right to ascertain their love physically.\n“Sorry. it’s embarrassing for me to say that, but I’m just a coward.”\n“……No, I understand that you love and treasure me, Amane-kun…er, personally…I am not exactly looking to escalate things that quickly. I am just worried…if you hate me.”\n“Hate you?”\n“…Erm, fo-for making you wait.”\nMahiru clung onto Amane, fidgeting and seemingly a little embarrassed. Amane understood what she wanted to say, and showed the most bitter of all smiles.\nIt was not directed at Mahiru, but to himself, who had little patience.\n“Not at all. Of course I have many thoughts as a guy, but it’s not like I have to force my way. Also, you’re scared, aren’t you?”\n“…Yes.”\n“It doesn’t matter then. Let’s just go at our own pace.”\nAmane patted Mahiru’s head, and she smiled in seemingly relieved, before shushing his lips.\nAmane blinked away, and Mahiru smiled.\n“…Little by little, I think I can take the initiative to kiss you.”\nHer smiling face was redder than usual as she said impishly. She really was more adorable than ever, once he accounted for how much courage she had to muster despite her frustrations.\nMahiru bashfully kissed Amane, and he responded with a gentle kiss on her lips.",

      "content": "A week later, the test results were announced.\nMahiru’s name remained at the top, as expected. She was not being prideful as she looked at it, and smiled once she noticed Amane’s stare.\nShe was giving the Angelic smile shown to outsiders, but one could see the trust and love she had for him.\n“Yep, congrats for getting first.”\n“Thank you very much.”\n“You’ve always getting the results because you work hard. That’s great.”\nMahiru had always been taking care of Amane, but she seemed so casual about getting first. Obviously it was due to the knowledge she built up, along with her relentless hard work.\nShe often did revision and supplementary questions whenever she was with Amane, and memorized her flashcards. She never slacked in her studies as far as Amane could see.\n“You say so, but you are fifth this time, Amane-kun.”\n“Thanks to you for teaching me well.”\n“Fufu, thank you for the thanks. I do enjoy teaching you when you understand things so well.”\n“Well thanks…how is your student usually like?”\n“She is amazingly focused when she is in the mood, but she does seem to be worried about what she is bad at…”\n“That’s so Chitose.”\nOn a side note, Chitose was ranked around the middle. It seemed the personal notes did come in handy.\nItsuki too had a better rank than usual, around twentieth or so, which showed how much hard work he put in. He might usually look frivolous, but he was capable if he put in some effort, which he did.\n“I believe she is relieved for the time being.”\n“We’ll check the answers once we get our papers back. Better to find the mistakes and correct them before they become habit.”\n“Of course. It is a good thing to be so studious.”\n“I don’t want to embarrass myself while being next to you.”\nAmane had no outstanding athletic ability, and was not capable of creating a mood like Itsuki. He was relatively handsome, but not as outstanding as Mahiru’s god-given looks.\nThey loved each other, and dated after understanding each other. Others however might not be able to accept this.\nThus, Amane was working hard as much as he could, to shush the talking heads around them, and to be able to stand up right next to him. Studying was part of it.\n“And the higher our scores, the more opportunities we’ll get.”\n“Opportunities?”\n“Hm…like, the kind of jobs we’ll like to do?”\nGrades were not everything, but the better the grades, the more opportunities to choose an environment suitable for himself.\nHis parents had him study to get good grades, to ensure that he had more options, that when he had things he wanted to do, he could develop in that direction…assuming he could. Once he met this condition, he would not suffer or regret it in the future.\nAmane’s parents understood that he was studying on his own volition, and knew that he knew that more opportunities would arise with better grades. That was why they did minimal reminder. Despite that, they did teach him to seize the opportunity, to pull it towards him, and to study well and not regret in the future.\n“I see. You have the pragmatism and foresight.”\n“You should. Think about it…I’m a guy.”\n“Hm?”\n“My pride’s gone if i ended up being raised by you even though I want to support you.”\nAmane’s life was completely reliant on Mahiru, but his little dignity would crumble if this would include financial need.\nHe hoped to have more than excess funds to support Mahiru.\n“My hard work has meaning since the one I’m working for is that outstanding.”\n“Erm, so-sorry…?”\n“Ah no, just remain as you are. I’m telling myself to work hard.”\n“…I shall tell myself to cheer you own.”\nWe will be going through the answers, no?\nMahiru chuckled as she gently pinched at Amane’s hem, and he nodded, returning to the classroom with her.",

Mahiru was explaining the mistakes when Amane suddenly asked.\nOnce she heard the word cushion, she looked up from the notebook, and her eyes started fluttering around.\n“…Uuu, I want that cushion.”\n“Well, if you want it, here.”\n“An-and, also…”\n“Anything else you want?”\n“N-not really…erm.”\nMahiru seemed to have difficulty spitting it out, so Amane gently patted her head, hoping to get her to calm down for the time being.\nShe would never stubbornly ask for anything, so since she had something she wanted, it was natural for him to oblige.\nMahiru showed a relaxed smile while being comforted, only to bashfully lower her head.\n“…E-erm, are you free on Friday?”\n“Hm? I don’t have anything special planned.”\n“…In that case, erm…I-I wish to do, what we talked about.”\n“Talked about?”\n“…To stay over.”\nThe slightly trembling voice betrayed something completely unexpected. Amane unwittingly widened his eyes, and stared at Mahiru.\n“…Chitose’s idea?”\n“N-not at all. I was the one who suggested to stay over, and Chitose-san merely gave me a nudge…I am saying this because I want to be with you, Amane-kun, not because someone has told me to.”\n“I-I see…uuu, stayover?”\n“…Yes.”\nMahiru shriveled and embraced the cushion tightly, for what she might say next seemed to be too embarrassing, and Amane scratched his cheek in joy and embarrassment.\nTaken aback he was, Amane did not dislike it, and instead yearned for him. He was more than glad to imagine the bliss of embracing Mahiru to sleep.\nThe problem however was to what extent he could endure this.\n“…Well, I’m glad, but…you never thought about what I will do?”\n“E-Erm…I will accept it if you wish to, Amane-kun…y-you will bear responsibility.”\n“Of course. I’ll take you in even if it’s not.”\n“Th-thank you…erm, so…this is a trial run…for us to sleep together, in the future.”\nThey were already cohabiting, somewhat, but sleeping on the same bed was a little different.\nMahiru was to spend a night at her boyfriend’s place for the first time as the girlfriend, so she was really embarrassed to mention this.\n“…We, cannot?”\n“T-that’s not it. Why do you think I’ll refuse…I’m more than happy.”\nAmane was shocked as it was too sudden of Mahiru to mention it, but Amane intended to agree. He was glad that Mahiru needed him, and that she could accept him.\nOf course, he did not intend to do anything. He was more than content that Mahiru was willing to entrust her all to him.\nMahiru was clearly delighted and bashful about being accepted. Same as usual, she cupped the cushion, and lowered her eyes.\n“…I-I am, looking forward.”\n“Y-yeah.”\nThey nodded stiffly.\n…Friday, huh?\nThey were just going to spend a night together, and they did sleep together, but his heart was still pounding wildly, and he felt so nervous. Perhaps it was because they were determined to do this as lovers, to sleep on the same bed.\nHe was embarrassed even though he did not intend to do anything, and the passive Mahiru might be moreso.\nMahiru blushed, but did not retract her words. Amane quietly swore to himself that he would train his sanity a little before Friday.",

      "content": "She was staying over at his place, but it was nothing too different from their daily lives, just that Mahiru was not returning home.\nIt was Friday, the day Mahiru would be staying over. Everything went normally, other than the fact that Mahiru was a little overconcerned.\nAs usual, they went to school, the supermarket on the way home, and then home. Everything remained the same until dinner.\nBut once they were done with dinner, it was different.\n“Mahiru, go take a bath. I’ll handle the rest.”\nMahiru was going to stay over.\nUsually, she would return home after they chatted away. On this day however, he intended to have her bath first.\nThe reason was simple; Mahiru needed a lot of time to clean up, and it would benefit her to get an early bath.\nShe clearly stumbled once she heard the word bath. She probably was concerned about that.\n“Uu, that.”\n“You’ll take a long time to wash your long hair, right? I think you should go first.”\n“Th-that is the case…eh.”\n“Anything inconvenient?”\nMahiru stammered, and Amane made sure to sound as gentle as possible as he asked. She bashfully lowered her eyes.\n“…E-erm…Shihoko-san, and Shuuto-san, both bathe together, yes?”\n“Well, yeah.”\n“…I-I do not mean for anything else. Nothing else, erm…but I, want to, bath, together.”\nFor a moment, Amane could not react to the trembling teeny-weeny voice of his lover, and stared at her.\nTogether, as in…\nOf course, they would not be wearing anything in the bath.\nNaturally, she meant that they would expose everything to each other.\nAmane would really lose control of himself if they did this. He believed he would enjoy her tender skin.\nMahiru was being more aggressive than usual, and Amane could not hide how perturbed he was. He scratched his nearly searing cheeks, his eyes wavering around.\n“N-no, erm, won’t anything happen if we’re naked…?”\n“Ah, erm…I_I brought a swimsuit. It is fine.”\n“…You already planned that?’\n“P-please do not make me say so.”\nIn other words, one part of the plan to stay over was to bath together. There was a 80-90% chance of it being Chitose’s idea.\nMahiru would refuse to do anything she hated, so this request was something she wanted.\nShe admired how Amane’s parents really got along with each other, and probably hoped to experience the manner they naturally bathed together.\nAmane was obviously glad to hear her intentions, and that she trusted him.\nDespite that, it burdened his heart and sanity too greatly.\n“Erm, you mean…you know I’ll be touching your body quite a bit, right?”\n“…We will have to do so when we scrub each other’s backs.”\n“O-okay…”\n“And, I always wanted to touch yours, Amane-kun…I always wanted to care for your hair seriously.”\n“…I see.”\nHe had been wondering why she took too many belongings. It seemed she brought care products for Amane’s hair.\nShe always wanted to use beauty products on him, like face masks, nagging at how he let his hair dry. Her thoughts were not exactly unexpected.\nHe never expected her to actually think of bathing with him.\n“…Erm, I’ll wear a swimsuit too. Make sure it’s all peaceful. Is that okay?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“…You sure?”\n“A lady does not need to be told twice.”\nA guy should be saying\nthat, so Amane thought, but he did not want to ignore her intentions, since she suggested so after having made up her mind.\nSimply put, Amane just had to endure.\nHe had discovered this side to her, and he too admired how his parents got along so well. He thought that bathing together was a good start, and they should be about to bond better as long as he could control his impulses.\nHe had stuffed the swimsuit deep into his closet, thinking that he would not be wearing it again after summer vacation ended. He recalled where it was, suppressed his pounding heart,\ngot it,\nand answered so.",

      "content": "Amane put on the swimsuit, entered the bath, and felt so tense and restless.\nMahiru said she would need time to put on her swimsuit, so she had Amane go in. The more Amane waited, the more his heart pounded.\nHe did see Mahiru in a swimsuit before, but it was the first time they would be alone in a cramped space, making contact. He was more nervous than delighted in this sense.\nIn any case, would not a couple bath together only after they did the deed\n…so Amane wondered, and felt ticklish and embarrassed inside.\nHis body was already hot before he could soak in the hot water.\nHe yearned for Mahiru to arrive earlier, and yet hoped for her not to arrive. He felt so conflicted, not understanding why, and pursed his lips. Then, he heard the door creak open behind him.\nHe turned his head around gingerly, and his lover with a dazzling skin was staring at him timidly.\nHe froze the moment he caught sight of her, but that was to be expected.\n…Is this what Chitose talked about…?\nHe remembered Chitose mentioning that Mahiru bought two swimsuits.\nThe one worn this time was not the type seen when they went to the pool.\nShe was wearing a black bikini which formed a stark contrast to her glistening white skin.\nThere was no excessive decoration on it, just a simple cloth covering her skin. It was not particularly risque.\nDespite that, she just looked so sexy, probably because of her fine body.\nAfter all, the only word to describe her was, exquisite.\nNo excessive fats, fine slopes on the lumps, smooth curves on the waist, and taut, tender thighs. Such were the ideal of a girl.\nShe looked so alluring even as she bashfully covered her front with her arms. They were gathered at the cleavage, forming a wondrous sight to a male, but it looked so awkward to him in this situation.\n“…Is it strange?”\n“No-no, not at all. It suits you, but…”\n“But…?”\n“…Well, it’s too stimulating.”\nAmane eked out this voice, and Mahiru clearly blushed.\n“…This is why I did not wear it at the pool. It is embarrassing showing this to others.”\n“So why did you buy it?”\n“B-because, Chitose-san said…that Amane-kun will not fall if I do not go this far.”\n“What do you want to fall…?”\nIf his sanity fell, Mahiru would be the one in trouble. It seemed Mahiru did not understand these words from Chitose, put a hand on his forehead, and looked towards Mahiru again.\n…Anyone will fall in the face of that thing.\nMahiru was so destructive in such a state, and Amane was about to get down on his knees, going all see no evil.\nHowever, he could not do so, of course. He took a deep breath, trying to regain his calm, and looked towards Mahiru’s face, not down below, which could allow him to calm down further.\n“…So…erm, now what? You’re going to take care of my hair?”\n“Y-yes. I brought all the equipment.”\n“I-I see…erm, just do as you please…but it’s still embarrassing.”\n“E-erm, same for me…and I was the one who suggested this.”\nMahiru did not manage to hide the blush on her face completely, and her eyes too wavered due to the sight of Amane in his swimsuit. She seemed to have made up her mind, for she took out something appearing to be a haircare product from the waterproof bag.\n“A-anyway, shall we start?’\n“Y-yes. Please do.”\nAmane too would feel awkward if he kept staring at Mahiru, and it would be great if she could move out of his sight.\nHe obediently sat on a chair, his back turned towards Mahiru, and heard a little groan. Perhaps this too was awkward.\nHowever, she did not stop her preparations, and there was some rustling heard from behind.\n“…First, we comb the hair.”\n“O-okay.”\nMahiru sounded a little hesitant. Once she said so, she waited for Amane’s response, and then slowly inserted the comb into the hair.\nShe was very delicate, as far as he could feel.\n“It is very important to start off with combing to remove the excess dust and grime, and wash off with hot water.”\n“I see. I don’t like the hassle though, so I never comb the hair before then.”\n“Your hair is short, and does not tangle together easily. That is why you will not think of combing first. For us girls, we have to do this first.”\n“Guess you definitely put in lots of effort to have such pretty long hair.”\nMahiru’s hair grew past her waist, had no split ends, and was glossy. The silky smooth surface was so beautiful, many a girl would have admired so.\nIt’s definitely tough to maintain hair like this,\nAmane felt impressed, and heard a wry chuckle from behind.\n“I already have good hair to begin with, so I do not need to spend that much effort…but I do pay some attention. A pretty person remains so no matter what she wears after all.”\n“…Well you’re a girl after all.”\n“I want to be proud of myself.”\nMahiru said, finished combing, and picked up the shower head. Amane glanced aside, understood that she was going to wash his hair with hot water, and gently closed his eyes.\nI shall begin,\nshe muttered, started the hot water, and rinsed Amane’s hair.\n“I shall soak it once through. It is best to do so before styling your hair.”\n“So the lecture begins.”\n“You already have good hair to begin with, Amane-kun. It will be better if you spend some effort to care of it.”\n“…Why does it feel like a hassle to do this every day.”\n“…You cannot lax on this.”\nGoodness,\na dumbfounded voice came.\nThe tension and shame might have faded a little during this hair wash, for neither of them were being stiff, and they were conversing as normal.\n“We’ll be doing so when we bath together in the future. Let’s just ignore this for now.”\nAmane found it a hassle, and was too lazy to do so, thus his comments. However, Mahiru froze with the shower head in hand.\nAfter ten seconds or so passed, Mahiru finally recovered, and switched off the water.\nShe then silently rubbed the shampoo in her palms, and this sight flashed by on the mirror.\n“E-erm, Mahiru-san?”\n“…You speaking of this so naturally is a flaw, Amane-kun.”\n“Eh….?”\nMahiru summoned bubbles, and rubbed his hair. Her face was really red.\nAmane sensed that she was not acting as delicately as before, but wondered if he was overthinking it.\n“…I am glad, but you cannot nitpick at Shihoko-san anymore.”\nAmane had a vague idea of what Mahiru was getting at, and was a tad later in understanding what he did, so he too blushed.\nHe did see his parents bath together, and was dumbfounded that many times. At this point, he said they would be bathing together every day once they got married. Truly he could no longer laugh at his parents anymore.\n“…I will feel awkward if you do not zip your mouth, Amane-kun.”\n“…I’ll pay attention.”\nThe shame that finally subsided blared up again. Both parties were left red faced, and silently focused on washing their hairs.",

      "content": "Once the hair was thoroughly cared for, Mahiru seemed a little hesitant as she took out the bottle labelled as shower cream.\n“…Erm, well…same for the body.”\nAmane understood what Mahiru meant, and sensed his body getting tense.\n“…Err, well, I-I’ll handle the front…ju-just the back.”\n“Th-that is fine.”\nIt would be really awkward if he let her wash the front. Thus, he allowed her to do as she wanted, and did not refuse her offer to wash the back as she said she wanted it.\nHe saw Mahiru nod bashfully in the mirror, and for the time being, lowered his head.\nMahiru kept forming bubbles behind him, and there was the sound of fabric being rubbed.\nHe was painfully aware that it was awkward and unbearable to have only breathing sounds and scrubbing noises in the bathroom.\n“…Let us, start then…”\nMahiru probably was done lathering bubbles, for she said timidly, and a soft, bouncy sensation returned his back.\nAmane knew it was the shower cream that was lathered, but it was a male’s instincts to wonder if they touched, especially when she was up close, wearing a bikini.\nThe feeling of the bubbles spread gently on his back, feeling ticklish.\nAmane felt anxious partially because of Mahiru’s delicate movements, but more importantly, because the bubbles were applied gently.\nHe usually would not spend the effort doing so himself, so he was not used to it.\n“…You back is unexpectedly big, Amane-lkun.”\nAmane heard a teeny-weeny voice as she washed the back and scrubbed away the grim.\n“Unexpectedly, you say…but mine’s definitely bigger.”\n“It is this big because it is you…I am relying on your back after all.”\nHe felt a palm gently pressed near his shoulder blade.\n“Do you remember? You carried me when I twisted my ankle.”\n“Yeah, I do. When you got hurt saving a cat.”\n“…I was really happy back then, though I did not express it out.”\n“Well, you had nowhere to go.”\n“…You always find me…till now, I do think that you will always find me, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru’s palms slid on his back, and wrapped around onto his chest.\nThe distance between them became zero. Mahiru continued to stick onto Amane, and put her lips on his shoulder.\nAmane felt the incomparable softness and mass covered in bubbles, and sighed.\n“I’ll carry and support you however you want if you wish for it. Besides, I promised to keep an eye out for you. I won’t let you run away.”\n“…Yes.”\n“But it’s bad for me to carry you now, especially with what we’re wearing. If possible, please move away?”\nAmane hinted that they touched, and Mahiru shivered a little, but she showed no signs of letting go.\n“…I wish for you to be by my side. You not have to carry me. I will not burden you entirely…we shall move forward, side by side.”\n“…Sure.”\n“And it is said you will be happy, Amane-kun.”\n“Chitose⸺!”\nHer and her stupid ideas again,\nAmane instinctively groaned, “Ch-Chitose-san merely suggested, but I wanted to do this.” but Mahiru said as she latched onto Amane’s body with both hands, ensuring that he did not frown anymore.\nInstead, Amane pried away her arms for the time being.\nHe turned around, and saw Mahiru widen her eyes, seemingly taken aback. He embraced Mahiru up front instead.\n“Ah, e-erm?”\n“…Chitose suggested that you hug me, right?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“I’ll add on to that…guys prefer to be hugged from the front.”\nThis alone should be fine,\nAmane convinced himself as he embraced Mahiru’s soft, silky limbs that were covered in bubbles, whispering into her ears. She instantly turned limp, and tumbled.\nShe blushed, and he took the bubble net she used, lathering it next to her.\n“E-erm, Amane-kun…”\n“We’re going to scrub each other’s backs, right?”\n“…E-erm.”\n“I think I have the right to do that to you. What about you?”\nHe deliberately hushed his voice, and she shivered,\nI did,\nshe answered with teary eyes. Amane made sure not to betray his own embarrassment as he chuckled, “That’s fine.”\nMahiru was being extraordinarily aggressive, and seized the advantage. Amane could not remain passive.\nHe knew she would run away if she hated it, so he gently put the bubbles onto her back.\nAs expected, her back was more delicate than his. He was impressed by how she took care of her own back.\n“Ah…i-it tickles…”\n“…I think your entire body is a weakness.”\nAmane knew that Mahiru’s ears were a weakness, but he did not expect her back to be one. It seemed that she was weak on every part with a skin. She would shiver on mere contact with the neck, and she probably was the overly sensitive type.\nHe touched her back, and at most the waist, through the bubbles, but Mahiru pursed her lips as she shivered, and at the next second, glared at him.\n“…Yo-you are too much.”\n“I wouldn’t have done this if you didn’t say to scrub each other’s back.”\n“B-but…”\n“But?”\n“Shihoko-san, and Chitose-san, both did…”\n“Don’t compare us to those with kids and experience…though it’s too late to say that.”\nMahiru invited, and stated it. Amane merely did the same.\nTry looking from the side of the one being pushed around\n, Amane scrubbed Mahiru’s back, and she gave up on resisting, her face was completely red as she obediently leaned on Amane.",

      "content": "“Sorry about that.”\nAmane leaned on the bathtub, and Mahiru was on the other side. Amane apologized, and she pursed her lips, looking completely unbemused.\nAmane cautiously washed her back thereafter, and she probably found it unbearable, for she slipped away while he was doing so. She would not say anything while he washed her hair.\nAnd even after they were done, she remained silent while they soaked in the water. It seemed Amane overdid it.\nMahiru escaped from Amane, cupped her knees, and sat on the other side of the bath tub. There were a few little rubber duckies floating on the bath, which she probably brought along.\nShe clearly expressed that she was in a really bad mood, and Amane scratched his cheek.\n“Sorry for overdoing it.”\n“…You were not being kind to me.”\n“Your reactions were too adorable, so I accidentally patted you too much. I’m really sorry.”\n“And you played with my ear.”\n“That’s because you’re cute…no, saying that I played with your ears sound so wrong.”\n“You bit on my ear. Please reflect on your actions.”\n“I’m doing so.”\nMahiru kept shivering as he washed her back, capitalizing on her weakness that was her back. Amane was really sorry about it, but he could not resist once he saw her look up at him with teary eyes.\n“…I do not want such a mischievous person.”\n“Sorry. Erm, I’ll be very gentle next time, so please don’t be angry, will ya?”\nAmane made up his mind that he would tell Mahiru he would dote on her, and though Mahiru looked somewhat unwilling, she cautiously leaned onto him.\nHer eyes wavered for a while, as though wondering where they should go. She seemed to have made up her mind however, and sat between his legs.\nShe then leaned her back onto his chest, and pursed her lips. Amane smiled once he saw this.\n“Please use me as a chair, princess.”\n“Certainly…Amane-kun no baka.”\nMahiru said, still a little peeved, and then she seemed to be deflated as she leaned onto him.\n“…It is unfair that I am being teased by you. I want to do something to you.”\n“Like what?”\n“This is what I am wondering. You do not have any real weakness, Amane-kun.”\n“Unlike you, who’s weak everywhere.”\n“It-it is not that ridiculous. It is only because I am touched by you, Amane-kun.”\nAmane unwittingly smiled once he heard such complimentary words.\nShe hasn’t realized that her words are so cute.\nThe only way to show one’s weaknesses would be trust and love. Her telling him that it was because of him made him ever so relieved.\n“…It feels like you are having it easy. How despicable.”\n“It’s really not.”\n“Really? You seem to be coping well.”\nMahiru turned around, put her face on Amane’s chest, and he gently smiled.\nHe might be able to look calm, and could dismiss the flushed face as him being in hot water, but the heartbeat could not be disguised.\nThe heartbeat that was much faster than usual had her blinking, and she lifted her head.\n“So I say…I’m not handling this well.”\nHe was bathing with the first and only girlfriend he had, and there was no way he had no thoughts about it. He wanted to touch, and even pry apart the coverage.\nHe did not do so as he did not want to hurt her, for the sake of their future, and immediate action might not be appropriate.\nThat might be the reason as to why Itsuki called him a coward. Amane however wanted to be overly cautious, given his personality, and take it step by step. It was to be expected of him.\n“…I thought you would be used to it.”\n“What used? I want to touch, do this and that, I’m just enduring.”\n“D-do this and that.”\nMahiru’s face immediately turned red, and one had to wonder what she was thinking. Amane showed a wry smile, was about to pat her head, and found her staring at him.\nShe sat down once again, leaned her back onto Amane’s, pulled his elbow from the edge of the bathtub, and wrapped it around her.\nThe unexpected embrace posture had him stiffened, and she turned around, showing a meek yet impish smile.\n“…This little bit is fine.”\n“…I see.”\n“…Is it not enough?”\n“More than enough…I’ll start then.”\nOnce he got her permission, Amane took the initiative to embrace her.\nHis arms and body felt her slender figure, and he let out a little breath.\nHe put his chin near the whorl of her hair, “Please do no put all your weight onto me.” and Mahiru said with a little smile.\nI know,\nAmane quietly noted, and gently patted her little shoulder. She then let out a little breath, feeling ticklish.\n“…It is warm.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Your clutches feel so peaceful.”\n“Your heart isn’t racing?”\n“It is a given.”\n“Is your heart racing now?”\n“Yes, it always has been.”\nIt would be bad to keep touching. Amane already knew that Mahiru’s heart was beating wildly. The moment he thought she was being aggressive, she would shrivel in embarrassment…and her heart would palpitate whenever she showed such a side.\nMahiru earnestly admitted her current situation, and Amane smiled, leaned forward slightly, and clung on.\nShe did not evade, and merely shivered in slight embarrassment.\n“…Will you heart race faster if I do this?”\n“I-it will, but…”\n“But?”\n“…At this point, I wish for you to hug me more.”\nMahiru’s face was flushed red as she said these words. Her head was lowered, and she seemed really flustered.\nThe request was too adorable that for a moment, Amane felt his blood boiling. He gently wrapped his hand onto his lover’s belly, to fulfill her adorable wish, and embraced her further.\nHe knew why she was shivering, but it was to be expected.\n“…Is this fine?”\n“…Yes.”\n“Can I let go now?”\n“N-no need…I wish to be in your arms, Amane-kun.”\nOnce she said these adorable words, she gently touched the arms wrapped around her stomach.\n“Erm…actually, I do not dislike it when you touch me, Amane-kun. I like it, in fact. But, I too…do not want to be overly enthusiastic in doing so…is it not contradicting?”\n“…No.”\nAmane had a vague idea of what Mahiru wanted to say.\nShe probably would have accepted it if Amane wanted to do anything. However, she did not actively desire to bond, and merely wanted to feel the warmth and touch.\nAmane too had his own desires, but that desire was thoroughly satisfied with such mere contact.\nHe was unexpectedly satisfied to be able to spend such peaceful days with the one he loved.\n“…Look, I’m not really actively looking to do something. This will be enough.”\n“Really?”\n“…Yeah, but I want a kiss.”\nThey were in a fine mood, but a kiss should be fine since they were already in such a dire state.\nMahiru tensed up for some strange reason the moment she heard the word kiss though.\n“…Erm, can we not, do it now?”\n“You don’t want to?”\n“N-not exactly…but, I-I think I will pass out from heatstroke if I kiss you here, Amane-kun.”\nHave you not been kissing me for a longer time recently?\nOnce he heard Mahiru mutter,\nIs that that case?\nAmane recalled the past moments, and sank into deep thought. At this moment, Mahiru slapped his shoulder.\n“…A-anyway, once we are done bathing.”\n“Understood. I’ll dote on you all day along, okay?”\n“It seems like you are trying to melt me instead of doting.”\nAh busted.\nAmane chuckled at Mahiru’s somewhat rigid retort, and his arms were slapped at by a peeved looking Mahiru.\nHowever, she seemed to be pouting rather than fuming, and he embraced her once again, ensuring that she would not notice him laughing at her.",

      "content": "Once they were done bathing, Mahiru chased Amane out to the living room, wanting him to get changed.\nAccording to her, it would take her a lot of time to care for her skin and change clothes, and she did not want to show Amane that.\nAmane could only obediently abide since she said so, and steadied his uneasy heart and body as he got changed. He waited for her at the living room.\n…Everything was fine till this point, but half an hour passed.\nAmane opened the notebook with the notes on it, and started reading his notes with the TV sounds as background. He wanted to call out as Mahiru really took her time, but the moment he lifted his head, Mahiru appeared on the corridor.\nIt was to be expected, but she was wearing her nightwear.\nIt was Autumn, but the heat still lingered, and the air conditioning remained a must. It was to be expected as to why she seemed to be baring more skin.\nShe did not reveal that much, and the black bikini did show more than this.\nHowever, the fact that she did not reveal much instead gave an alluring side.\n“Wh-what is it…? Is it really strange?”\nMahiru fidgeted as she was stared at. She was wearing a one-piece nightwear, or a negligee.\nAmane did see the negligee during the initial stayover, but there was comparatively little fabric. The sleeves remained the same, just that they were slightly shorter, revealing the knees slightly, along with a wider collar that could show the neck.\nIt was not especially transparent, and the curves were not particularly emphasized.\nShe looked so strangely alluring at this moment, for she had just came out of the bath, along with the fact that she had no extra fat, which made her look so innocent.\n“…No, it really suits you. Very adorable.”\n“R-really? I guess I did not pick the wrong one.”\n“You chose it for me?”\n“Erm…I feel that you probably would prefer this simple, cute one…”\nIt seemed she understood Amane’s preference of clothes after having been together for so long. Amane knew that anything would look good on Mahiru, and would not instruct her to wear anything in particular, but he preferred the innocent type.\nMahiru understood this, and chose a very conservative looking clothing that revealed little.\n“E-Erm, Chitose-san recommended one that exposed much…but that, is a little embarrassing.”\n“…You have that?”\n“I-it is because…days ago, she demanded that I buy it.”\nIt seemed they bought it after exams ended. This proved that Mahiru had planned to stay over, or rather, she planned to stay over from that point.\n“I-it is a little too early. Uu, I cannot do so.”\n“…Oh? That means you’re going to wear it for me one day?”\nAmane asked mischievously, and Mahiru turned red immediately, lowered her head as she shivered, “…If you wish to look.” she whispered.\nShe would shrivel for a short moment whenever he bullied her too much.\nJust joking,\nAmane shrugged and chuckled, and Mahiru kept her head low as she scampered towards Amane, sitting next to him.\nHe looked aside, and found the red faced Mahiru looking at him with moist eyes.\n“…N-not that I am unwilling. I-it is just awkward.”\n“I get that. You don’t have to be so desperate. You’re making it sound like I’m the one causing you to cry.”\n“…I am not crying. It is just awkward.”\n“I get that…you don’t have to push yourself.”\nSo Amane thought, but if that happened, Mahiru would surely shrivel and shiver, but that was fine. He personally felt that she could wear it for him when she wanted to.\nMahiru let Amane pat her head and console her for a while.\n“…But really, you spent quite some time in there.”\nHe asked once the redness on her face faded. Mahiru lifted her head, and her eyebrows dropped a little.\n“…I need to take care of my skin and dry my hair.”\n“I see. Your hair’s very long after all.”\nHer hair was beyond waist length, and needed a much longer time to dry compared to Amane’s. Furthermore, she had to care of it, which would require more time.\n“…You say that, but you have not dried your hair.”\n“…Got mesmerized with studies.”\n“I have told you many times that you will damage your hair if you leave it be. I did bring my hair dryer over so that we can use it separately…goodness.”\nMahiru sighed with dismay, covered Amane’s hair with the towel dangling on his shoulder, and rubbed off the moisture. The hair was mostly dry however,\nYou have to dry your hair well,\nso she coaxed.\nShe carried that bag with her each other the bath, took out some unknown fluid, and brushed it through Amane’s hair. She then continued to rub the liquid in her hands, and spread it inside out of his hair.\n“Your hair may be fine since it is so smooth, but you can be prettier if you care for it a little more. It is a pity…are you listening?”\n“I am, you’re really amazing Mahiru.”\n“Say, you are not listening.”\nShe went behind him, cutely scolded him, took a dryer, and blew it on his hair.\nAmane gently chuckled as he felt the warm, not too hot wind.\n…I wonder if she’ll be angry if I say that I’m waiting for her to do this.\nHe was not complaining about the hassle, but he knew that she was very dedicated to it, and hoped for her to do so on such days.\nBut if he were to say it out, Mahiru might really be incensed, in a cute manner. He kept those words to himself, closed his eyes, and enjoyed Mahiru’s gentle artistry.",

He did not do anything more.\n“…You are very patient during times like this, Amane-kun.”\n“So that means I usually don’t?”\n“I-I do not mean that…but you do dote on me whenever I fawn around, and I am especially glad.”\n“Then go ahead and do so. I’ll be more than happy to spoil you.”\nSpoiling the always hardworking Mahiru was truly enjoyable.\nAfter all, this overnight stay was a requested reward, and Amane could not help but pet her.\nDo you want me to pat you a little more?\nHe gently whispered, and she shyly lowered her eyes, putting her forward on Amane’s elbow, rolling about.\n“…I did experience that sufficiently during the bath. Any more and I will melt.”\n“It’s fine for you to melt.”\n“No worries. Lest I be unable to stand up.”\nBecause you do not know how to hold back,\nso Mahiru said somewhat emotionally, and Amane instead felt nonplussed, numb to it.\n…I think I’m holding back somewhat.\nAmane assumed he had been controlling himself from going overboard, or Mahiru from crossing the line.\nThere were times when he got too carried away, resulting in Mahiru pouting away. He however did not go all out.\nHe gave a wry smile as she butted with her forehead, and lowered his head to kiss her.\n“I want to pet you more, and turn you into water.”\nAmane felt extremely agitated as he imagined Mahiru melting away, still unused to fawning around, showing a sweet face.\nHe had nothing else in mind, and all he wanted was to see Mahiru looking happy, which would make him happy. However, a red faced Mahiru shook her head vehemently.\n“I will die. Especially, when you say, such words, Amane-kun…”\n“Especially?”\n“…Nothing, please do not mind.”\n“But I mind.”\n“I am fine…either way, I am glad to be doted on, but please do not overdo it. It is stressful to my body.”\nMahiru inched her body away, and turned her head aside. She probably wanted to look away from Amane, for she stared at the TV that had been running the entire time.\nOnly the news was airing, which was pointless. She stared intently at it however, for she might really be embarrassed.\nTruth be told, he really was delighted to see her so bashful and fidgety.\nShe would never say that she hated Amane’s affection for her. It was really adorable to see her resist so thoroughly.\n“…You’re easy to understand.”\n“Please be quiet.”\n“Will you do it for me?”\nAmane asked with a teasing intent, and Mahiru turned her head around gingerly.\n“…Er-erm, I did say that we will do so after bathing…but, eh…once more before we sleep.”\n“…Alright.”\nAmane felt it might be awkward for Mahiru to do so before they slept, but he was not bothered in the slightest. He remained silent, and laughed it off.\nIt seemed Mahiru had not considered that they could continue to do so on the bed, and with nowhere to escape. He patted her head, and she gave him a pout.\n“…Why are you giving such a lecherous leer?”\n“You’re overthinking it.”\n“I am not. There is something to your leer.”\nShe slapped at him, and he lifted her by her back and knees to shush her, putting her on his knees.\nHe touched the stiffened Mahiru,\nYou are definitely treating me like a\nchild, she said somewhat spitefully, and headbutted his chest.\nShe would never hold back before the one she loved. He knew of her naive personality, and that gesture looked ever so adorable to him.\nSo cute,\nhe muttered as he cuddled her again, and Mahiru murmured away as she earnestly leaned on him.",

      "content": "11pm, and Amane carried Mahiru into his bedroom.\nHe just wanted to go to sleep, as it was soon to be bedtime, but Mahiru appeared tense in his clutches, and her body was a little stiff.\nDon’t worry, I won’t do anything,\nAmane whispered, put Mahiru on the bed, and she looked up at him with a blushing face.\n“Y-you do not need to carry me over.”\n“You look sleepy. It’s almost bed time.”\n“…You say so…but, I always do wonder, am I not heavy to you?”\n“How weak do you think I am…?”\nAmane did at least do some muscle training and jogging, and trained so that he would not embarrassed himself. He could at least lift Mahiru.\nHe might have difficulty lifting her back when they first met, not because she was heavy, but because he was weak.\n“I still need to carry you. I’m not that weak.”\n“…Yes.”\nI can’t carry you over my shoulders though,\nAmane joked. Mahiru widened her eyes, and smiled.\nOnce he saw Mahiru’s lack of tension, he gently sat next to her on the bed. Her cheeks were slightly red, but she did not panic, and instead leaned over towards him.\nAmane knew it was her way of welcoming him, so he too showed a faint smile, and gently embraced her up front.\n“Anyway, you’re not nervous without Kuma-san?”\nThe teddy bear he gave Mahiru was not part of her belongings on this day.\nIt seemed she cuddled it to sleep every day, but one had to wonder what made this day special…so he looked at the caramel-colored eyes, and they dropped bashfully.\n“…I do not need it, for I have you today…and you will be jealous?”\n“Yeah, I’ll feel awkward if you’re looking at something else even though you have me…so just look at me.”\n“…Yes.”\n“…But you aren’t looking at me.”\nHer eyes were fixated near Amane’s throat, and she probably was not looking at him.\nShe lifted her head once she heard that.\nThe slightly reddened cheeks were reminiscent of a fresh fruit, and Amane had the urge to bite.\nHe might infuriate her if he really did so, so he merely kept the thought to himself, and stared directly into the faltering caramel-colored eyes.\n“…How about a kiss?”\nMahiru might jolt in his clutches if he was too sudden, so he asked for her permission. The faint red intensified, and Mahiru’s eyes wavered.\nHowever, she timidly nodded, probably having recalled their conversation at the living room.\nIt seemed she did not dislike it to begin with. She closed her eyes, and entrusted everything to Amane.\nHowever, she was shivering a little, probably because she was not used to it.\nThe manner in which she shivered was as adorable as a little animal, and once he realized this, he smiled, exhaled, and with a slow movement that would not agitate her, he brought his lips onto her sealed lips.\nMahiru was so soft and tender all over.\nSo too were her lips, and they were damp, soft, bouncy, more vibrant than his.\nMore importantly, there was a slightly sweet fragrance, probably coming from Mahiru herself.\nHe gently pecked at the pink lips, and enjoyed that softness slowly, really slowly.\nWhenever his lips grazed by and held hers, her body would shiver, but she never tried to escape nor show disgust, which showed that she probably accepted him,\n…So cute.\nHe looked at her face as he kissed her, and saw a fine reaction. One moment she was ticklish, and the next she was comfortable.\nShe might feel embarrassed, but it seemed she liked kissing. Amane did not show any worry, and kissed her successfully.\nHe licked her lips, and she quivered. However, he did not reach his tongue in, and merely savored the sweetness, which caused her to relax, and lose all tension.\nHer body and expression softened, and she was so adorable, Amane pecked at her lips once again.\nOnce he savored her lips sufficiently, Mahiru slapped at his chest, seemingly indicating that she was at her limit.\nUpon being told to stop, Amane obediently moved his lips away. Mahiru was blushing, slightly panting as she glared at him. However, she remained somewhat dazed, and was not looking intimidating in the slightest.\n“Th-that was a long time.”\n“…Can’t I?”\n“N-not that you, cannot…”\nAmane got carried away as Mahiru had accepted this so comfortably. He would not have done so if she appeared unwilling. Truth be told, she would have escaped if she hated it.\nIn other words, there was no way she did not enjoy it, since she accepted so.\n“…May I say something?”\n“Say what?”\n“You are so sleazy.”\n“What sleazy?”\n“W-why are you…so skilled at this?”\n“…Your reaction tells me it’s good.”\nIt seemed Mahiru assumed Amane had it easy, and she raised her eyebrows slightly, but Amane himself did not.\nHe could count the kissing experiences he had, and gauged his actions based on her reactions. Even if he did not ask, it was clear that she would turn limp whenever he did so. He did pay attention whenever he kissed her.\nHe wanted to indicate that he was paying attention to her when he kissed her, but she widened her eyes, and her face was red like fire.\n“W-were you watching me while kissing?”\n“Eh, yeah. It’s really, really, really getting cuter…I know you’ll feel comfortable like this, and I’m glad.”\n“…”\nMahiru started whacking at Amane’s chest with some strength, probably due to the embarrassment of being observed.\nHowever, it did not hurt at all, and it seemed she was not being serious.\n“…Pl-please do not say such a thing, fool.”\n“You don’t feel good?”\n“…I feel blessed, but please do not make me say it.”\n“There are some things you need to say.”\n“Y-you are teasing me now, no…I-I say.”\n“Ow ow ow.”\nAmane could not tease her any more as she was hitting him vigorously. He did not intend to tease her,a actually, but Mahiru might have assumed so.\n“…Please do not bully me.”\n“Sorry…don’t be angry.”\nAmane patted her head, and she looked up at him, somewhat seething.\n“Are you assuming that my mood will improve as long as you pat my head.”\n“It’s not?”\n“…It is, but I am not letting this slide.”\n“Too bad.”\nAmane shrugged, and Mahiru looked miffed as she leaned onto his chest.\n“…Hug me, or I shall pout.”\n“Affirmative.”\nIt seemed that Mahiru wanted Amane to pamper her gently, rather than being miffed.\nShe headbutted him, and leaned on him while acting angry. Amane was more than glad to oblige, and hugged her.\nThis time, he did it gently, and earnestly…\nHe cautiously patted her back, and hugged her. She buried her face into his chest for a while, and slowly lifted her head.\nAfter a few minutes, he checked to see if the face appeared pouty, and was a little relieved.\n“…You are sometimes mischievous.”\n“Sorry…I just want to dote.”\n“Just do it normally.”\nGoodness gracious,\nMahiru responded in such a manner, straightened her back, and wrapped her hands on Amane’s neck.\nShe then kissed Amane,\nit is unfair if I do not have a go for once,\nand whispered so to a dumbfounded Amane.\nFaced with the impish smile and voice, Amane buried his face into Mahiru’s neck with a wry smile.\n“You got to understand how destructive you are right now.”\n“It is unfair for you to do so alone…it is ticklish.”\nMahiru took the initiative to fight back, and Amane immediately panicked. He then kissed her neck to hide how rattled he was.\nA little whiff, and he scented upon an indescribable milky scent.\nThey used the same shower cream, so this meant that this scent belonged to Mahiru in the first place.\n“…So fragrant.”\n“I do use some body lotion to keep myself moist. Maybe that is is.”\nIt seemed the fragrance came from that body lotion, but Amane felt it contained some of her own scent.\nEven without doing anything, Mahiru would give off a sweet scent. She never laxed on taking care of herself, and her skin moisture remained.\n“You’re going to keep your skin smooth?”\n“I do pay attention to many other things, which is why I can maintain such a nice skin.”\n“Girls really have it tough…spending so much effort.”\n“…I am doing it for myself.”\n“You’re right, Girls like to dress up and make themselves look better after all.”\nMahiru was trendy, and liked to dress herself. Even if she did not date Amane, her insistence towards beauty might never disappear.\nAmane had no illusion of wanting a girl who would dress up for a boy. He understood that Mahiru did so for herself, and could agree with what she said.\n…This is one reason.\nBut it seemed that was not the only reason as Mahiru whispered.\n“You mean there’s something else?”\n“…Erm, well…it feels better to touch, right?”\n“Well, it’s your own body.”\nShe would be the one touching herself most, so it would be great if her skin felt nice to touch.\n“No, not that…when you touch me, Amane-kun.”\nAnd it was because of his prior conception “Eh” that he blurted out when he heard Mahiru’s reply.\n“…I do not want my skin to be so parched when you touch it, that you will be disappointed…it feels comfortable to touch smooth tender skin, no?”\n“…Y-yes.”\nAmane clearly faltered, not expecting her to have thought of letting him touch.\nHer face remained red, but Mahiru did not intend to retract her words. She latched onto Amane with more force, and shivered.\n“…P=please do not be mistaken. I am doing it for you, Amane-kun, and also for myself…erm, it is my wish to let you touch me more…”\nTouch me more,\nthe moment she uttered those words, Amane instinctively rolled onto the bed with Mahiru.\nKya,\na cute voice came from the lips, and Amane shush the lips, a faint groan coming through the gap.\nHe pried through the lips, as though sucking, and the sound was hoarse, delicate and sweet.\nMahiru might be at a loss as to what to do, and was hapless as she flailed her hands, seeking something to grab.\nAmane held her flailing palms with his, which seemed to calm her down, relieving the tension from her body.\nOr perhaps it was more accurate to say that she was limp, at a loss due to Amane’s sudden actions.\nAfter savoring Mahiru who had become so sweet for some reason, Amane moved his lips away.\nMahiru was dumbfounded, gasping away, and looked up with a sweet expression. Amane looked down at her, and narrowed his eyes.\n“…You understand the consequences of saying this on the bed, right?”\nI’m really nervous too.\nAmane uttered these words that could be read as sexual harassment or a reminder, and Mahiru’s face turned completely red as she covered it with her hands.\n“You know I want to treat you well, to treasure you well, right? You know I want to spend some time to get used to it slowly, right?”\nAmane loved Mahiru, wanted to treasure her, and hoped to make her happy.\nAnd it was because of such thoughts…that he endured, even though he knew he would not be hated if he acted. His sanity did not break even though they were clinging together in swimsuit. He did not push her down onto the bed even though the atmosphere seemed ripe.\nBut Mahiru’s words alone caused him to nearly bury himself headfirst into her.\nRather than her being bad, it was Amane’s fault for not being capable of enduring. He however hoped that Mahiru would not do anything that would flip his switch.\nMuch kindness and uncontrollable passion were invoked in his eyes and voice. After coaxing her, Mahiru nodded away while still covering her face.\n“That’s good…sorry for doing that so suddenly. You’re shocked right?”\n“I suppose so, yes. My heart was beating really fast.”\nThe sudden french kiss took Mahiru by surprise. She was still blushing, and would not show her face.\n“…Amane-kun.”\n“Yes?”\n“…Next time, please, be…a little less intense.”\nMahiru did not refuse, and instead intended to do so a second time. Amane quietly pried aside her hands.\nAs expected, she was red like a ripe apple, and he silently put his lips onto her.\nHe gently and carefully doted on Mahiru, as she wished.\nThe previous one was an impulsive deep kiss, and this kiss was to comfort the shriveled Mahiru, one gently wrapped around her lips, filled with much affection, melting her more than before.\nHe slowly moved his lips away, looked down, and Mahiru glared at him with teary eyes, her face still limp as she gasped away.\n“…I did not say now.”\n“…I want it now. That’s not good?”\n“…You may, but you warned me just now.”\n“I did.”\n“Goodness.”\nBaka,\nso she pouted, but Amane knew she was hiding her embarrassment, so he chuckled and laid down next to Mahiru.\nHe took the remote control by the pillow, switched off the lights, and clung onto her. Her fine body quivered, but only out of shame, and she instead took the initiative to lean her face into Amane’s chest.\n“Thank you for treasuring me that much.”\n“…Yeah.”\nClear bliss seeped through her soft whisper, and Amane too gave a gentle smile as he embraced Mahiru once again.\nPerhaps they could take another step one day, but this would be enough for the day. Within his clutches was something he yearned to treasure, rather than act on impulse.\n“…Good night.”\n“…Good night.”\nAfter this little murmur, Amane embraced Mahiru, and closed his eyes.",

      "content": "Amane woke up in the morning, found Mahiru sleeping in his clutches, and exhaled a little.\nHe turned his head towards the clock at the edge of the bed, ensuring that he did not shake, and saw it was 7am.\nIt was a rest day, and he did not need to wake up early. He intended to sleep an entire morning, and most definitely woke up a little early on this day.\nHe did not think it was a bad thing however, once he thought of how he had the time to see Mahiru, who had been sleeping blissfully.\nMahiru was sleeping soundly, looking so innocent.\nShe looked completely relaxed, probably because she was in Amane’s clutches. Anyone seeing that adorable sight would be healed.\nSo happy.\nAmane recanted the blissful moments only he could savor as he embraced and enjoyed her warm, soft body.\nHe wanted to sleep just like that.\nHe naturally felt his face relax as he looked at the face of his dear lover, and maintained this expression. Then, Mahiru twitched.\nIt seemed she was not awake however, and merely inched a little, changing positions, and returned to his chest. She looked so adorable, and he quietly gulped.\nIf only it’s like this every day.\nSurely it was a blessed thing to be able to spend time together with the one person who mattered to him.\nHowever, the damage to his sanity would be abnormal if they were to remain together in this situation. Perhaps an occasional stay overnight would be fine.\nIf she were to visit every day, Amane had no confidence that he would not love her all over.\nIf possible, he wished to make contact only after they got used to it, when they got more intimate, and when Mahiru hoped for it, and not to act on impulse.\nHe endured with all his might, stroking her smooth hair silently with his fingers. Mahiru twitched once again, probably because the touch cause her to regain consciousness, and she lifted her head.\nThe originally sealed eyelids were half opened, and caramel-colored eyes were revealed.\nShe showed a sleepy look, and looked towards Amane’s face in her delirious state, gave a fluffy smile, and buried her face into Amane’s chest once again.\nShe’s definitely sleepy,\nAmane quietly laughed, patted her back, as though coaxing her.\nShe laid comfortably for a moment, and finally regained consciousness as she looked towards Amane once again, her eyes widened compared to before.\n“…Good, morning.”\n“Morning. You enjoyed your sleep.”\n“…Yes.”\nHer face turned red immediately, and it seemed she remembered herself fawning with Amane even during her groggy state.\nMahiru was so adorable, and Amane was more than glad to have her fawn, so he was fine with that. It seemed that she was embarrassed to show how numb and careless she was.\nAmane hugged her once again to console her, kissed her on the forehead, and the redness on her face intensified.\n“…A-Amane-kun, you do not seem that embarrassed recently.”\n“It’s just us two…can’t we?”\n“No-not that you cannot, but it too stimulating after I just woke up…erm, embarrassing, and awkward…”\n“I won’t do that in the future then.”\n“Ah, e-erm.”\n“You’re not feeling awkward?”\n“Uu…n-not that.”\n“You don’t want me to do this again because you don’t want to feel awkward?”\n“Not that…y-you know what I mean, right?”\n“I don’t want to do anything awkward that you hate.”\n“Goodness…I-I want it.”\nMahiru was red faced, shivering as she answered hesitantly, and Amane rubbed her head with a smile.\n“Sorry for teasing you too much…so you mean I can do it anytime as long as it’s not right after you wake up?”\n“No-no…you are correct.”\n“Is it a yes or a no?”\nAmane retorted mischievously, knowing what Mahiru wanted to convey, and kissed her on the forehead again.\nHe was not exactly unashamed, but his endearment of her was strong, and he would act accordingly. Mahiru was one to easily feel uneasy, and it was better to express his love.\nHe thought it was adorable how she was shivering away, so he cuddled her, and she wanted to escape the bed in embarrassment.\nOf course, Amane could not possibly let her leave, and locked her in his clutches.\n“Erm, I want to prepare breakfast.”\n“Stay here a little longer.”\n“But.”\n“…No good?”\nI want us to be together for a little longer\n, so he implied as he stared at her face, and her cheeks turned red, her eyes swimming.\n“N-not that you cannot…”\n“Nn.”\nOnce he was allowed, Amane embraced Mahiru gently once again, and she murmured away, burying her face into his chest once again.\n“…How sleazy.”\n“Sleazy, how?”\n“In various ways.”\n“You can push me off.”\n“This is what I mean.”\nYou know I cannot do so,\nMahiru whispered with a pout, and rolled her forehead about on his chest. It seemed she was fawning around rather than pouting though.\nAmane gently combed his fingers through Mahiru’s hair, and she leaned over comfortably, her throat making a deep rumble.\nNever thought she likes it when I fiddle with her hair,\nso he thought as he continued to do so. Mahiru let Amane continue for a while, and then lifted her head.\nShe looked relaxed, relieved, but her lips were curled into a mound.\n“…I will be in trouble if you turn me into a good-for-nothing, Amane-kun.”\n“Best if you can become that only to me.”\nMahiru was always on alert outside.\nAt this point, she was showing a little of her usual personality, but she had yet to discard her angelic actions. It was to be expected that he wanted to dote on her and melt her into a puddle of water.\n“…Same to you, Amane-kun.”\n“I’m already one…just that it only happens when I don’t have you.”\n“…That is good. I too will become a good-for-nothing without you, Amane-kun.”\n“Yes.”\nEither way, Amane did become a good-for-nothing thanks to Mahiru, and vice versa.\nAmane smiled at Mahiru, who was in fawning mode, and cuddled Mahiru as he closed his eyes, hoping to drag on this little moment a little longer.",

      "content": "They spent the night together, but after they woke up, they spent the time no differently from their usual weekends.\nLike usual, Amane had Mahiru’s breakfast, washed his clothes, tidied up, swept around, and relaxed.\nCleaning up had become a habit to him thanks to Mahiru, so his room was often clean, and he did not need to spend much time doing so, which he was grateful for.\n“What’s for lunch?”\n“Hmm, we had some leftover meat sauce from the pasta, and I intend to use a little container to make lasagna.”\n“Another tedious dish?”\n“I shall make some white sauce. Is there anything else you want?”\n“Just do what you want. Everything you cook is delicious. Looking forward to them.”\n“Such a sweet talker.”\nMahiru giggled, but truth be told, her dishes really were delicious. Amane felt an ordinary high school girl would not be able to accomplish that much, and her dishes were better than any poor restaurant out there.\nOf course, this was his bias as her lover, but her cooking really was delicious, so much that Amane had no desire to go out to eat, and wanted hers.\nLooking forward to it,\nhe marveled, and Mahiru gave a perturbed smile.\n“…I guess I have to exhibit my skills now that you say so.”\n“Just the normal will do.”\n“I shall do my best since you are looking forward to it, Amane-kun. Please look forward to it.”\nHe was delighted to hear her say this, but Amane was sorry about having her work so hard, so he patted her while she sat next to him, getting her to relax.\nMahiru, who was suddenly patted on the head, started to murmur,\nhave you cultivated a habit of patting heads for no rhyme or reason,\nbut she did not look unwilling, and let him play around.\nAfter patting for a while, Mahiru naturally leaned over, and he too cuddled her naturally, putting her on his lap, and she gave him a strange reproaching look.\n“…Why are you pampering me again?”\n“Because I want to…I want to cuddle something like this.”\n“I shall lend Kuma-san to you.”\n“I prefer Mahiru.”\n“Goodness me.”\nThis is special,\nso she said, and comfortably leaned on Amane, who chuckled as he pulled her to his chest, beginning to pat her head again.\n“…Don’t ever show this those guys at school.”\n“I do not wish to let them see. It is only for you, Amane-kun.”\n“Thanks for that.”\nThings would really got rowdy if the boys saw Mahiru completely melted and fawning away. Amane was the only one allowed to see this.\nMahiru would never go to them, even if they did see it, but he would be peeved about them imagining her acting like that, so he had no plans to show.\n“…Speaking of which, everyone knows that I’m your boyfriend, but there are some still trying to woo you.”\n“They are asking if I was threatened, wondering what kind of person you are.”\n“Those that don’t understand me will think that I’m unimpressive.”\n“…I will be angry if you say this again.”\n“That’s what they say. I’m working hard to stay by your side, so that they won’t say anything. I have confidence.”\n“That is good.”\nJust as Amane patted Mahiru on the head, so Mahiru repaid the favor.\nI wish to spoil you too,\nsuch was the attitude she showed, and Amane showed a wry smile as he let Mahiru pat his head on his lap.",

      "content": "Dozens of minutes passed until Mahiru, who loved to fawn and be pampered, retreated from Amane’s lap.\nHer face was flushed once she realized that she took a bold position. Amane found her adorable, and was comforted by her.\nTruth be told, she was not exactly on both his legs, just one, but the posture and distance had her increasingly embarrassed…once he saw Mahiru take on his shame and panic, he felt a little relaxed.\n“…You could have told me to stop.”\n“Ah no, I just accidentally…you’re fawning so hard over me, there’s no way I can tell you to stop.”\n“You should have reminded me at least.”\n“Don’t put me in a spot.”\nAmane’s heart was really beating wildly as he enjoyed her embrace, so he too was powerless. However, he really should be not saying this to him.\nMahiru frowned a little once she saw Amane play dumb, but she was the one riding on his lap, so she could not say much.\nGoodness.\n“…I am unwittingly doing something so bold because I love you. Please limit yourself.”\n“Be careful. Those words are dangerous enough.”\n“…I cannot help it. You know the extent of my feelings for you.”\n“Well, yes yes…it’s a little embarrassing hearing you repeat how much you like me.”\nIn a certain sense, these words caused him more shame than the posture just now.\nAmane thoroughly understood that Mahiru would instinctively do something very bold, but pinpointing this fact caused him an unspeakable sense of shame.\nMahiru too blushed as she gently hit Amane. It seemed both sides got hurt.\n“…You are not doubting my intentions, are you, Amane-kun?”\n“Of course. I know I’m the only one next to you, and you’ll only care about me.”\nAmane was confident about this one point.\nIt was likely that Mahiru would not care for anyone other than him.\nSuch was her personality, and Amane was confident that she was fond of him, and even planned to pledge her future to him. She would always treasure him unless he did anything to annoy her, and she would continue to accompany him.\nHe said it so confidently, and Mahiru’s face got redder. She headbutted him,\nthat’s a violent way of hiding your\nshame, Amane chuckled as he let her be.\nTruth be told, he too found it embarrassing, but Mahiru’s actions allowed him to disguise his mood.\n“…Good that you know.”\nMahiru stopped headbutting, and leaned her forehead on his elbow as she grumbled.\nOf course\n, Amane too answered as he gently held the quietened Mahiru by her hand.",

      "content": "After the exams came the most important event of the year, the cultural festival.\nAmane’s school had a heavy focus on this event that required the participation of all students, and thus each class was given an ample budget, and there were exciting events every year.\n“So let’s decide what our class will be doing!”\nOf course, all the students would decide what their class would do. The atmosphere certainly was lively.\nStanding at the podium excitedly was Itsuki.\nHe, who loved such festivals, would obviously volunteer to be part the festival committee, but one had to be amused by how he actually got chosen.\n“Hm hm, so, what we’re doing for this culture festival. Before that, I’ll like to point out that there’s a fixed number of classes allowed to do food stalls. Basically, every class is planning to do food, so competition will be intense. We better get ready for it.”\nOf course, there was a fixed number of food stalls to be allowed.\nF&B stalls were very popular, for they often were good chances to run a business, and every class might want to run one. This would mean there would only be food stalls, and thus a limit was imposed.\nAlso, there was no way to satisfy the demand fully, due to hygiene concerns and space in the cooking classrooms.\n“So check out the documents passed down. There’s quite a few things listed that we might need to spend on, but we actually have them. Check through everything, even those that aren’t written that can be suggested. Anyway, let’s suggest stuff that can be done under this budget…hmmm, if there’s anything to suggest, let’s raise hands and speak up.”\nOnce Itsuki said so, the students started raising hands frantically.\nTheir eyes were dazzling, and the importance of this activity was obvious.\nAfter all, the culture festival was a highly anticipated grand event.\nBut I just skipped it last year.\nAmane was not as enthused as a student should be, and went through the cultural festival just like that. Back then, his class elected to sell handmade products, so he did as asked, and tended to the stall during his time.\nHe stared at the exuberant classmates from afar.\n“Me me! I I recommend a cafe that’s always a must for this festival!”\n“Hmmm, that’s expected. Just an ordinary cafe?”\n“How about a maid cafe?”\n“Think about it, Shiina-san’s in this class…it’ll definitely suit us.”\nThe voices started to trail off at the end as they all looked towards Mahiru. Amane was a little peeved, but not to the point where he wanted to say something.\n“Hahaha, I wonder if you guys considered the budget, but that’s the enthusiasm I want. Let’s add it to the list then.”\nThe boys got active at the idea of Mahiru in a maid outfit. Amane gave them a dumbfounded look, and then met Itsuki in the eyes.\nThe latter answered back with a ‘is this fine’ stare, and Amane looked unwilling.\nHe did have issues, at the very least.\nMahiru usually stood out, and was often the center of attention.\nHer cuteness had risen to another level recently, and her in a maid outfit would surely garner crowds, which she would have trouble dealing with.\nOn the other hand, this would guarantee sales. Mahiru’s existence was a sufficient advert, and the boys would surely swarm in just to have a look.\nAs for the person herself, she showed an awkward, unspeakable smile once she was talked about.\nIt was to be expected, for it was not a comfortable feeling to be taken as the center of attention.\nIt was merely a suggestion however, and a courtesy to not nitpick at it. Amane would refuse if Mahiru really disliked it.\n“A maid cafe is really more male oriented, but we have to consider the budget before that. Alright, next…”\nItsuki led the class further, and everyone suggested a haunted house, curry and udon, stalls that sold the usual stuff for a cultural festival. The blackboard was gradually filled with white words.\nBut everyone’s…or rather, the boys’ interest seemed to be on the maid cafe, for there were some hushed chatter.\n“Shiina-san in maid uniform though…”\n“But that Fujimiya’s around…”\n“Don’t worry, Fujimiya’s a guy too. He’ll definitely want to see his girlfriend in maid clothes.”\nAmane heard that, but unfortunately, he disagreed.\nIt would be a complete lie to say that he did not want to see that at all, but he did not wish to parade her around as a trophy. He did not want to insist on her wearing it, knowing how tired she would be.\nAmane glared at them, and they hastily looked away once they noticed.\nMahiru giggled as she probably noticed, and Amane’s eyes relaxed a little.\n“Say Amane, any suggestions?”\nItsuki suddenly asked, and Amane looked over in annoyance.\n“Why me?”\n“You look like you have something to say.”\nAmane did have something to say, but not to him. Nevertheless, the mere mention had his classmates looking at him, and he would ruin the mood if he did not.\nAfter wondering what he should do, he chose what seemed the easiest to him.\n“…If I have to put it, maybe we can investigate some local history and create an exhibit.”\nThe class quieted down once he said his idea.\nIt was awkward, like a dampener.\n“So why?”\n“…I think it’s good though. Once we investigate all we have, we’ll show a little exhibit, and then we get the free time to go around and enjoy the festival. We don’t have to worry about the time, and can visit any class we want.”\nI see,\nsuch a sentiment echoed in the class once Amane changed his explanation.\nAmane did not think the students would be interest in local history, and he just wanted some free time after their preparations.\nA food stall would be popular, but it would definitely require lots of time, manpower and labor. Money would be involved, and they had to tend to the stall, which would make things difficult.\nAn exhibit for example could be set up during the preparation phase, and only one or two persons would be needed.\nA cultural festival had two days, one for each person, would not take up an hour, and manpower and time-wise, would be very efficient.\nThe most important thing however was that it would not generate revenue. Visitors could stand wherever they wanted.\nAn exhibit would be easier for those who had no confidence in their service skills, looks, and culinary expertise. Amane was completely aware of this as an example.\n“Say, it’s really just like you.”\nItsuki did not hold back on how dumbfounded he was, and Amane merely stated his thoughts, turned aside, and shut up.\nMahiru too looked over, her eyes basically stating,\nit really is just like you, Amane-kun.\nAmane felt awkward, but he could only sigh as he could not retract the words he said.\n“Ehh, so the top vote goes to the maid cafe, so it’s decided alright?”\nFor the time being, they decided on the maid cafe, which got the most votes from the boys.\n“I’ll report our decision to the student council, and we’ll draw lots. If don’t win, we’ll choose the haunted house that came second. We’ll also have to find someone who can get us the clothes, since the budget definitely won’t be enough. You can ask anyone who knows about such stuff. Just remember that if we can’t settle this, we’ll just set up a normal cafe.”\nThe host Itsuki exhibited his natural cheerful personality and capabilities as he swiftly stated what was needed, before leaving the classroom, probably for the student council.\nThe mood in the classroom seemed upbeat, buzzing. Amane sighed as he had a hand under his chin, and then he noticed Mahiru approaching me.\n“What about you?”\n“You say…but we’ve decided. Not like we got a choice here.”\nMahiru showed a wry smile, and Amane felt angsty even though they had no choice.\n“Remember to voice your unhappiness if you don’t want it.”\n“Not that I am unwilling…but Amane-kun, you dislike maid uniforms?”\n“Not exactly like or dislike, and I think it’ll suit you. The apron already does.”\n“I-I see…I shall do my best.”\n“You don’t have to force yourself.”\n“I shall wear it to make you happy, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru then showed a beautiful smile. The boys behind started giving victory poses behind, and Amane made sure not to give a numb smile.",

      "content": "“…You don’t look happy, Fujimiya.”\nKadowaki joined in after school as it was a rest day from club activity. Amane then realized that his feelings were clearly shown on his face.\n“…Is my face that obvious.”\n“Nope, about the same as usual. it just feels like there’s a little change from your usual demeanor.”\nThey were at the bookshop at the station, about to leave after buying their textbooks when Kadowaki mentioned so. Amane instinctively reached for his cheeks, found his face to be stiffer than usual, it seemed, and his eyebrows were raised by a few centimeters.\nHe did not wish to show his expressions excessively, but it seemed he was unable to control it completely. Feeling a little embarrassed and useless, he sighed.\n“Well sorta. I don’t feel so good. I don’t want her to be an exhibit, just to keep her to myself.”\nOf course, there was no reason he would be happy to have his dearest girlfriend be the center of attention. There would be curious stares, along with some urge to covet.\n“Mahiru doesn’t look like she hates it, and i can’t just oppose the class by asking for preferential treatment for her. That shows my immaturity, that’s unfair on my part, and I can only shut up. There’s something called peer pressure after all. I know how much Mahiru will contribute to our sales after all. I’m just unhappy that the risk might be way too much compared to the payoff.”\n“Sorry about that.”\n“It’s not about you. It’s my fault for not being able to explain what’s good about my plan.”\nKadowaki did not need to apologize at all. Amane however could not bring himself to blame the boys who suggested this. There was a lingering, nauseating anxiety.\nGuess we got no choice since it’s decided,\nAmane gave a long sigh, and Kadowaki showed a conflicted smile.\n“I did vote for the exhibit. It’s risk-free if we take a pragmatic look at it, and there’s high return. At this point, i probably will be assigned to receive the customers…”\n“Ah.”\nThe reputed prettiest girl in school was asked to serve, and similarly, so would Kadowaki, who was very popular with the girls.\nKadowaki hoped to stay at the back, but it seemed unlikely. That really rare handsome face was a detriment in this situation.\n“…Are us guys supposed to wear maid outfits too?”\n“I don’t think we’ll be forced to do that…but since the girls are in maid uniform, the boys will be dressed as butlers, right? If only we can deal with the clothes.”\n“Ah, well…I heard someone in class knows of a person who manages a cafe…maybe they can prepare clothes for the boys too.”\n“Oh dear.”\nIt was the worst intel for Amane, who wanted to avoid the maid uniform.\nSince they had no issues, Mahiru would surely serve food in a maid uniform.\nFortunately, it seemed clothing was prepared for the boys too, and there was nothing to cause a tragedy of gender bias.\n“Why is the class so united at such moments…but well, if the guys have to dress up and serve, you’ll suffer too Kadowaki.”\nKadowaki would certainly suffer given that he, the popular one, would have girls flocking to him.\n“Don’t make it sound like it doesn’t concern you. You probably have to step up too.”\n“Eh?”\n“You know how to cook?”\n“…No.”\nAmane could not answer.\n“And besides, you can’t relax if you aren’t keeping an eye on Shiina-san. It’ll be bad if anyone suspicious is to eye her.”\n“That’s right…but what’s the point of me wearing that?”\nIt would be convenient for him to serve, in order to keep an eye out for anyone suspicious near Mahiru.\nHe did not mind the shame since Mahiru too would be dressing up, but he felt it was pointless to dress up as a butler.\n“It’ll be significant to Shiina-san. She’ll be happy.”\n“Yeah.”\n“And also, lots of people are keeping an eye on you after you changed your image.”\n“Wait, I never heard of that.”\n“Well you just care about Shiina-san after all.”\nAmane felt awkward once this was pointed out.\nIt was true that he focused his attention on Mahiru, and never noticed the looks from the other girls. Ultimately, he never expected such stares directed at him, so he never realized so.\nAmane gave Kadowaki a look of disbelief,\nyou never noticed,\nand the latter shrugged, showing that he was not lying.\n“You should notice the stares around you once in a while, Amane. Well, it’s more like they’re looking at you like some warm thing, so it’s nothing dangerous, probably.”\n“That’s annoying too.”\n“Just give up already. It’s your fault for being flirty.”\n“…We’re not being that obvious.”\n“Ahaha.”\nKadowaki giggled, clearly not believing Amane in the slightest, and the latter’s face twitched.\n“It’s a good thing though, better than a hassle, you know? I don’t want to see it end up like what happened to Shirakawa-san.”\n“…That love rival thing?”\nKadowaki’s voice was a little heavy, and Amane too frowned.\nHe never mentioned so to Itsuki, but Amane did consider the former as a close friend. It was said that there were lots of hardships and turmoil before Itsuki dated Chitos, resulting in this relationship.\nIt was hard to imagine that when she first met Itsuki, Chitose was so aloof, blunt, and callous.\nShe was a standout as a track club member, but she had a dispute against a senior because of Itsuki, and was forced to leave.\nOne could understand, even unwillingly, that the senior jealous of her might have caused her trouble. The senior was jealous that the boy was wooing a girl, and the girl treated the boy coldly. That senior probably escalated matters further, and one could understand her actions, even though they were not justified.\n“Yeah. There was a conflict, and she gave up on track. I really hate those who just find fault like that…just relieved that you two are acknowledged as a couple.”\nKadowaki probably was worried of Amane and Mahiru’s relationship as he had witnessed such an unpleasant situation.\n“…Oh.”\n“You two better be all lovey-dovey during the cultural festival. Don’t let her be taken away.”\n“I don’t intend to.”\n“Hahaha, are you kidding me?”\n“Who’s kidding?”\nAmane frowned at Kadowaki, who looked relieved as he laughed in bemusement. Amane snorted, and left the matter at that.",

      "content": "“Welcome back, Amane-kun.”\nAmane returned home, went to change, and returned to the living room. Mahiru was home, smiling as she slapped at her thighs.\nA nonplussed Amane instinctively stared at Mahiru’s face, and she continued to slap her thigh again, with a gentle smile.\nIt seemed she was implying for Amane to head over to her, but he could not sit on her…the reverse would have been understandable at least.\nAmane gave her a perturbed look, and her smile became a wry one.\n“You appear to be in a foul mood.”\nIt seemed Mahiru had realized it. Since Kadowaki could, surely Mahiru too could.\nAmane did not want her to know. Whenever she saw through him, he would scratch his cheek awkwardly, and as expected, Mahiru giggled away.\n“I expected that you would not refuse, Amane-kun, but you are really unwilling. Am I correct?”\n“…Well you are.”\n“That is why I am going to cheer you up.”\n“You sure you can say it directly to me?”\n“Fufu, you dislike it?”\n“…You know the answer. Who taught you that?”\n“You.”\nAmane was speechless to hear that, and could only twitch his lips slightly.\nMahiru giggled, and slapped her thigh once again.\nTempted by the soft thighs beneath the poised looking burgundy skirt, Amane sat down hesitantly, a little distant from Mahiru, laid down horizontally, and placed his head on it.\nHe looked up at Mahiru, who smiled down at him.\nThe fine white fingers slipped through the black hair.\n“…Are you unwilling for my sake?”\n“Sort of…but actually, I just don’t want to show you off to others.”\n“Jealous?”\n“Jealous or possessive, to put it bluntly…I don’t really want this though.”\nAmane knew he was just being childishly stubborn, and felt a little embarrassed after expressing his thoughts. He then turned his face towards her tummy.\nMahiru exhaled at the sight of that, and then seemingly giggled as she gently combed through the hair, seemingly consoling as she coaxed him.\n“I do not wish to dress up as a waitress either, but we have already decided.”\n“…Yes.”\n“And I already promised them beforehand.”\n“…Promised what?”\n“You will be the first to see me, Amane-kun.”\nAmane unwittingly turned his face towards Mahiru. There was an impish bashfulness on her face.\n“You shall be the first to see me, Amane-kun, and…there may be quite a few customers (masters), but there is only one, customer, for me.”\nShe stuttered hesitantly, probably being bashful at the very end, but she did say these words, and Amane’s face turned hot.\nNevertheless, he did not avert his eyes, and continued to look at Mahiru. She finally had enough, took the cushion by the side, and stuffed it onto his face.\nShe did it gently, and did not affect his breathing, but clearly she intended to conceal his eyes. The looming dissatisfaction in his heart then dissipated, but then came another…one of embarrassment.\nPerhaps that was a feeling of endearment.\n“…I’ll endure then.”\n“…Yes.”\nMahiru continued to cover Amane’s face with the cushion, to prevent him from looking, but he could imagine her expression. He chuckled, turned aside, and buried his face onto her tummy.",

      "content": "And so, it was decided that Amane’s class would be doing a cafe for the cultural festival.\nThe excitement the boys showed back then had Amane grimacing. They were most likely looking forward to seeing Mahiru, Chitose, and the other pretty girls as waitresses.\nIt was bad to changing the itinerary after it was decided, so Amane decided to go along with it, but for some reason, he started resisting when they discussed their sizes.\n“No, it doesn’t suit me.”\n“You won’t know unless you try. Alright, just give up already. Let us measure our heights and shoulder widths, otherwise we can’t borrow clothes.”\n“Fujimiya…just give up…”\n“You’ve already given up Kadowaki…?”\n“It’s the expected result, more or less.”\nThe negotiator did say that the matter of borrowing clothes was almost resoled, and decided to start measuring the sizes of all students to ensure that they had enough clothing…Amane was designated as a waiter, and was peeved by it.\nIt was a consideration by Itsuki to assign him in the same timeslot as Mahiru, just in case, but Itsuki should have mentioned this beforehand.\n“But anyway…aren’t you fatter than before?”\n“How rude. I don’t have fat, I’m just force to live a proper life.”\n“Haha, your wife really manages you well.”\n“Stop it.”\nAmane coldly retorted in shame as he was told that Mahiru was his wife, and Itsuki gave his usual mischievous smile.\n“Hmm, not fat, just a little more muscle, right?”\n“That’s possible. I’ve been training using Kadowaki’s methods.”\n“I want to know what that is.”\nAmane handed over to Kadowaki as Itsuki was suddenly interested, and then looked towards the other boys who were measuring themselves.\nThey were whispering away, and he was curious as to what they were talking about.\nHe pricked his ears, and heard some excited voices. It seemed they were talking about Mahiru.\n“Shiina-san in a maid uniform…that’s great.”\n“She’s measuring in another classroom, right? I imagine they’re amazing.”\n“They’re big after all.”\n“The contrast is so great, especially when she’s always with Shirakawa.”\n“Itsuki will kill you if he hears that.”\n“Actually, he admits that they’re small…that they can fit his hand…”\n“I’m just jealous that Fujimiya gets to keep Shiina-san to himself.”\nYou guys are giving my girlfriend strange looks, and Itsuki’s going to suffer, not the guy saying that,\nAmane quietly retorted as he gave him a completely flabbergasted look.\n“…Keep your voices down. I heard that.”\n“Ack, you’ve been listening, Fujimiya?”\nAmane hoped that they did not fantasize about his girlfriend’s body proportions, but it would be childish of him to get angry over it, so he endured. Either way, no matter how they fantasized, only he had the chance to personally witness, and that was why he was very calm about it.\nItsuki gave a wry smile, probably because he did overhear this conversation. It would be bad to let Chitose hear it, and since he had no intention of disclosing it openly, it probably was just some private chatter.\n“But seriously…what else can we do?”\n“That’s the Angel. She always hides them under her blazer or vest, so…oy Fujimiya, how are they like anyway?”\nSuch an indecent conversation arose as there were only boys present.\nAmane withheld the urge to frown as he met their expectant looks, and shrugged.\n“What else? It’s as you see.”\n“Don’t try to pull a fast on.”\n“What do you want me to say?”\n“Like, are they apples, melons, or anything?”\n“The same fruit can vary in sizes.”\n“You’re being difficult!”\n“You’re the one making it difficult for me!”\nWhy do I have to tell others what my girlfriend’s sizes are?\nIn any case, Amane did not know. Ah actually, Amane did know of her bust size, due to an accident back at his hometown when he saw her laundry. However, he could not say it.\nAnd besides, what could he do about it?\nHis classmates were being so aggressive, and he faltered a little. They continued to loom passionately.\nAmane gave a pleading look towards Itsuki, who shrugged, and seemed to have no intention to help.\n“Anyway, I don’t know.”\n“Stop lying.”\n“Who’s lying?”\n“Ah, actually, Amane really isn’t lying.”\nLeft with no choice, Itsuki gave a helping hand, and giggled in the face of the looming boys and Amane.\n“Because Amane never did anything to Shiina-san even though they spent a night together. There’s no way he’ll know.”\nThe whole classroom went silent once Itsuki said this.\n“…I’m wondering if you’re a guy, Amane.”\n“That’s why you aren’t interested in those gravure magazines?”\n“Like hell it is! Hey Itsuki, don’t make it sound that way! I’m just respecting Mahiru’s wishes!”\n“That’s what people call cowards.”\n“Say.”\n“No, but actually…she’s willing to spend the night with you, right? Girls aren’t stupid. They’d would thought about that.”\n“But well, they’re more of an innocent, pure couple that’s a rarity these days, and they think such things are too early. Just watch these fluffy creatures by the sidelines, you know? Don’t talk too much.”\n“Hey Itsuki, whose side are you on?”\n“I’m always on your side.”\n“I don’t believe you…!”\nOnce Itsuki said this, all the boys gave looks of pity, and some even gave warm, gratified smiles, which had Amane’s face twitching.\n“I’m not innocent, and I would have done so if I could, but I’m just thinking of the future…”\n“Oooooooooo…”\n“Oy why are you guys smiling…what are you looking at?”\nAmane felt so awkward, and gritted his teeth, and the gratified looks of pity increased in numbers. He had enough, and for the time being, threw the measuring tape at the culprit Itsuki.\n“…Erm, Amane-kun, the boys are giving us really warm looks. Do you know why?”\n“Nope.”\nThe girls too were done measuring, regrouped with the boys, who gave Mahiru strange stares. She was intrigued by them, and quietly asked Amane.\nThe girls too gave Amane warm looks, and he wanted to ask Mahiru the same question.\n“The girls are giving me strange looks too…did you say anything, Mahiru?”\n“N-nothing. I did not say anything that will affect your reputation.”\n“So you mean you said some things that will not affect my reputation?”\n“P-please be at ease. I simply mentioned what I usually do with you, how we spend our time together.”\n“…To be specific?”\n“…You really are amazingly gentlemanly.”\n“You too!?”\n“Too?”\n“Ah, no, nothing.”\nAmane could not mention that he was criticized for not being a man. He quietly panicked, but answered nonchalantly, and patted away at a dumbfounded Mahiru on her head.\n“…Don’t talk about that stuff again. I’m embarrassed.”\n“Y-yes, but I did…learn a lot from everyone, and benefited much.”\n“Say, I’m worried about what you’re being taught.”\nChitose had imparted lots of useless knowledge to Mahiru, and it was likely the other girls did weird things. Amane had a feeling Chitose would have held back somewhat, but he hoped to ascertain what Mahiru was taught.\n“…I do not think there is anything making you awkward, Amane-kun?”\n“The girls are doing that with their eyes.”\n“I-it…is to be expected.”\n“I don’t think so.”\n“Hey hey, you two over there, it’s fine for you to flirt, but we should get down to serious business, so stop flaunting.”\nThe committee member Itsuki was at the podium, looking around, and shrugged.\nAmane had no intention to flirt, but it was pointless of him to say so in this situation.\n“Those two aside, let’s decide on the café menu. We should have done so earlier, but I think would have trouble if we didn’t reserve our clothes. Ah, the classmate in charge of renting clothes has made measurements out of everyone, and is now contacting the supplier. The boys’ data is here. Don’t misuse it.”\nItsuki, a capable leader himself, swiftly gave instructions and handed over the measurements to a girl who was strangely enthused, asking her to rent clothes.\nAmane thought with a wry smile that they probably wanted to see Kadowaki as a waiter.\n“First of all, raw foods are a no go. We only get a certain amount of time to use the cooking classroom, and we’re going to focus mainly on pastries and drinks, because of the expiration and hygiene purposes. No issues so far?”\n“None~”\n“And don’t add anything weird Chii.”\n“Rude.”\nChitose did do so during Valentine’s, but that was a select few. She probably would not do so this time.\n“Drinks-wise, we can use coffee, tea, and juice. Anyone with other ideas can raise their hands. I’m just suggesting common stuff.”\n“Let’s see, how about ice cream? i want some cream soda.”\n“That’s a nice idea, but how are we going to keep it? We can buy, store them in the cooking classroom and then bring them over, but since it’ll take up freezer space, we’ll have to check with the student council. I’ll take it down as reference and ask them when I hand over our plans to the council.”\n“What about snacks?”\n“Thought about it, but it’s too much work, and will take much time, so I don’t recommend. Too much effort to make our own stuff instead of serving premade stuff. The only snacks I can suggest are hot dogs and sandwiches, and other classes are doing hot dogs. They’ll hate us for stealing their business. if we do too much, it’ll make it difficult for us to handle, and we can’t balance the finances. We can just ignore it if there’s no real demand. What do you think?”\n“Guess we got no choice then.”\nItsuki quickly went on a spiel to summarize the discussion. Amane realized that Itsuki really had talent for leadership,\nhow reliable,\nand Mahiru too probably felt the same as she giggled so.\n“Anyway, this is all we have for now, and I’ll just sort this out before heading it over to the student council. About how we’re going to get drinks…like coffee, I know of some who sells coffee beans, so I’ll go chat with them, take it as promotion for them, ask them if they can sell to us at a cheaper price. We got this chance, and it’ll be great if people will talk about the taste.”\n“Woah, so reliable.”\n“Don’t fall for me man, I don’t swing that way.”\nItsuki joked, but he did do what he needed to, decently even, and that was what he was amazing at.\nAmane was really impressed by the cheerful personality and leadership he could not imitate. He thought of the itinerary that would follow, and sighed.\nI just set up a haunted house last year after all.\nOn one hand, Amane felt it was a hassle to serve customer, but on the other, he was really impressed by the fact that he was participating in such a student-like activity.\nHe, already on the gloomy side, felt cultural festivals were just a waste of time and effort…but with Mahiru next to him, he felt it might not be a bad thing to create some memories.\n“What is it?”\n“Nothing, just that we should work hard for the festival.”\n“Fufu, yes. Erm, I am looking forward to seeing you serve customers, Amane-kun.”\n“I have a bad attitude though.”\nHe coldly responded to Mahiru’s teasing, and the latter showed a happy smile.",

      "content": "Preparations for the cultural festival proceeded successfully under Itsuki’s lead.\nPart of the reason was that it was their second year doing so, and everyone was used to it. More importantly, the boys and girls of this class were clearly united for selfish purposes.\nThey were naturally busy, as they had to tend to their studies and prepare for the festival, but Amane was numb to the hustle, and felt strangely fulfilled.\n“Oy, there’s a mistake on the flyer. Redo it before it gets sent for printing. How can we make a mistake on the school address?”\n“Where’s the tablecloths? I heard they’re bought but I can’t find them!”\n“Our profits will drop if we buy it at usual price…”\nThe students finished their assignments, and Amane and others heard the buzz while being guided on how to serve their customers.\n“…Fujimiya-kun, erm, smile.”\n“…Smile.”\n“Too stiff, too stiff.”\nThe girl in charge was a part-timer at a cafe, Ayaka Kido, and she was giving a wry smile at Amane, who was giving a fake smile.\nIt was not that Amane could not smile, but to her, his smile was a little rigid.\n“Hmmm, just smile as you usually do. A forced smile makes it stiff and unnatural. Relax a little more.”\n“But that’s how I am since I’ll be serving customers.”\n“Just think of the customers as potatoes.”\n“Potatoes”\n“Amane-kun, you can assume them as eggs.”\nMahiru, who too was being guided, quipped jokingly.\nShe understood that Amane liked eggs, given their interactions over the past year or so, but Amane did not want to smile at customers like they were egg dishes, and it did not matter to him.\nThis isn’t the problem,\nso Amane thought, but he deliberately chose not to retort since Mahiru looked so happy, and scratched his cheek.\n“Anyway, many people say that it’s better for you not to force a smile, make it normal. Try and get him to relax.”\n“Who said I look better when I look natural?”\n“…The girls in our class? I heard that’s the feeling they get whenever they see you with Shiina-san.”\n“I don’t feel comfortable to be seen.”\n“You’re not flexing?”\n“I’m not.”\nHow’s that deliberate?\nAmane glared at Itsuki, who stared back dumbfounded with a\nthis guy has no self-awareness\nimplication. “Shut up.” Amane retorted.\nMahiru blushed a little, and showed a faint smile. She gave him a comforting, bashful look, and her face was a little redder, so it seemed she had some self-awareness. To be precise, she might have finally noticed it, given her personality.\nThe other girls led by Kido started nodding away.\n“I think you’re most relaxed when you’re with Shiina-san, Fujimiya-kun.”\n“What’s that about…?”\n“Well, the aura or sort.”\n“Hm?”\n“Sometimes it feels like that.”\nAmane was clueless, but it seemed Mahiru had some inkling as she tried to hide her own shame.\nHer eyes contained some shame, and along with some uneasiness. Kido noticed it, and started laughing, waving her hands to deny it.\n“Don’t worry don’t worry Shiina-san, I have a boyfriend. I’m not interested in stealing someone else’s.”\n“Th-this is not what I am worried about…”\n“You don’t have have to hide it. You’re worried that your boyfriend is attracting attention, right? I’m more interested in muscular ones though, and Fujimiya-kun is too skinny for me to consider.”\n“You’re making it sound like I’m a beansprout.”\nAmane assumed that he had gained some muscle mass, so the ‘too skinny’ left him in some despair. Itsuki had once boasted that Amane had more muscles, but it might be hyperbole compared to how the latter was once like.\n“…A-Amane-kun is not a beansprout. His skin is a little white…but erm…o-once he removes his clothes…he does have some muscle.”\n“Oh, so he looks amazing when he strips?\n“You’re making it sound wrong! Don’t say anything that they’ll misunderstand, Mahiru!”\n“…But they are sturdy.”\n“Alright now, you’ll be the one embarrassed later.”\nAmane hoped that she would realize that whatever she said would have implications, that she had seen and touched his body.\nIn fact, they merely clung onto each other in swimsuits, and it was nothing indecent per say, but it would not be strange for these words to be understood as something else. Mahiru did mention that Amane was gentlemanly, and everyone probably knew that they did not do it.\nMahiru quieted down once Amane said so. Feeling relieved, Amane looked around, and there were warm stares around.\nTch,\nhe clicked his tongue, mainly at Itsuki.\n“Eh, why are you giving me that look?”\n“Your smile annoys me.”\n“You’re pushing too much blame onto me. Alright, stop flirting and start practicing.”\nAmane left his issues aside, and clicked his tongue at Itsuki again as the latter prompted him once again. He then gave Kido a displeased look, and Kido laughed.\n“I know you two are really close, don’t worry. Just smile and serve the customers. Your gestures are gentlemanly anyway, so you should be fine as long as you follow what I taught you.”\n“I don’t think I’m ever elegant.”\nHe did not think he was a brute, but he did not feel that he was elegant anyway. He was perplexed to hear her say this, but Mahiru smiled understandingly.\n“I suppose it is because of your parents’ influence, Amane-kun. They are very graceful.”\n“I can’t call mom that, but she doesn’t do anything to cause discomfort.”\n“So you spent time with Fujimiya-kun’s family, Shiina-san”\n“K-Kido-san…”\n“Sorry sorry.”\nAmane frowned at a giggling Kido, which caused her more amusement. Thus, he and Mahiru ended up basked in the warm smiles of many the entire time.",

      "content": "Two weeks to the cultural festival, they were notified that their requested clothes were delivered.\n“Hm, these are the delivered clothes. Please wait a moment, I’ll distribute them one by one! There’s further instructions once you get your clothes, so please wait~”\nKido smiled as she distributed the clothes to her classmates. Once she looked towards Amane,\nhere,\nshe beamed as she went over to Amane, and handed the clothes to him.\n“Ah, Fujimiya-kun, there’s a classroom for you to change clothes in. Do go there alone later.”\n“Why alone?”\n“Hmm…special situation.”\n“What’s with this situation?”\n“It’s a little wish from Shiina-san, and I think we should fulfill it for her. She says she wants to show you first, Fujimiya-kun…”\nOf course, everyone else agreed,\nKido then said something to assure him. Amane felt sorry about that, and was grateful to Kido for being willing to do this for Mahiru’s sake.\n“Thanks.” so he said to Kido and the girls who heartily accepted this turn of events.\nDuring this allocated time, Amane waited before that classroom, for he heard that Mahiru was changing inside.\nOf course, the curtains were pulled up. Everyone was supposed to head to their changing room, but they borrowed a classroom to practice serving their dishes. Also, the fluffy maid dresses would garner much attention if they went out, there was lots of stuff, paint on the corridor, which could have dirtied the classes. This might be a major reason for this arrangement.\nWhy am I so nervous.\nHe felt strangely, indescribably awkward once he thought of how there was a girl changing beyond the door, It’s his girlfriend, and he did see her in her undergarments, practically, but his heart remained restless.\nHe leaned on the door, and waited silently.\nYou can come in,\na tense reply came.\nMahiru might have been nervous herself, and Amane chuckled as he did as she told him to. She was standing some distance away from the door.\nHe closed the door behind him, and stared at Mahiru before him.\nShe was dressed in a long sleeved waitress dress that reached her ankles, a classic dress that had suitably blended into modern times. There were lumps at the elbow sleeves, as though there was air packed inside. It was a blue one-piece dress accompanied with an apron.\nKido once said that when wearing miniskirts, they would wear another skirt underneath to prevent it from fluffing up. Mahiru was wearing a long dress that was not too big, and formed a neat, fine silhouette.\nThere were frills on the apron as decoration, and hardly any exposed skin, cultivating a prim, innocent image. Beneath the hem of the dress were ankles covered by black socks.\nOn a side note, the black socks belonged to Mahiru. She would wearing socks all year long, so as to not expose any skin. This too was the situation.\n“How is it?”\nMahiru tilted her head slowly, and the hair falling by the side fluttered.\nShe would have to serve customers, and deliver their orders. The flax-colored hair was tied in the back to avoid inconvenience.\nA white brim headdress ornamented her head, emphasizing her vibe as a maid.\n“…Suits you more than I expected.”\n“Is that so? Thank you. It is my first time wearing such a thing…”\nAmane’s earnest praise was received with a bashful reply.\nIt suited her so well partially because of her beautiful face, and moreso because her demeanor meshed with it better than expected.\nMahiru herself was one who liked to serve others, and to be blunt, she was servile, and thus it seemed to suit her so well.\nAmane saw her fluffy smile, and naturally had the urge to withhold her from serving customers.\n“…Amane-kun?”\n“Ah…ahhhh, sorry. It suits you so well that I don’t want to show this to anyone else. It’s too damaging.”\n“Fufu, what does it damage?”\n“My sanity?”\n“I shall pat your head later, so please endure for now. I too do not wish for others to see you in a butler uniform…”\n“It’s alright, nobody’s going to throw themselves at me.”\n“It does matter.”\nMahiru was fuming for some reason, so Amane apologized. It seemed she too realized that she overdid it,\nI should be the one apologizing,\nand softly apologized.\n“…You are more approachable ever since you changed your image. Erm, I do hear other girls praising you.”\n“I never heard of that though.”\n“They will not say such things to you. It is simply chatter between girls…and they will not approach you boldly with me around.”\nAmane did not know what the girls chatted about him amongst themselves, and felt a shiver up his spine. Their views were mostly good-natured, according to Mahiru.\nHowever, he did not think he received their goodwill, and at most, some warm stares.\nAfter all, he felt that those girls who would approach him even though he was attached unacceptable, and had to refuse. He did not recall meeting such a girl, and was numb at Mahiru’s words.\nIt seemed Mahiru was aware that Amane only heard half her words, for she pursed her lips cutely.\n“I say, females will be more honest amongst themselves, you know? How is the relationship like, how is his personality like, what are the experiences, and so on. We do also talk about things we will never allow boys to hear.”\n“What in the world did my girlfriend get involved in?”\n“This is girls talk. There is no fluff, and it is all earnest talk…they do say that you are outstanding, Amane-kun, so I am starting…to worry.”\nMahiru’s hesitant look resembled an adorable maid, which riled a sense of guilt within Amane, along with a little sadism.\n“So, what did they say?”\n“…They did say that you are gentlemanly…and that you are not used to dealing with girls, which they are fond of.”\n“I-I don’t think they’re praising me…”\n“…And that you won’t fall for anyone else once you have someone.”\nIt was expected of him to only care for the one he loved. It would be rude to woo other girls while he was still dating, and also dishonest.\nAmane did not date Mahiru half-heartedly like that. The Fujimiyas were often said to be devoted, ull of love, and truth be told, AMane had no intention of caring about anyone other than Mahiru.\n“You’re the same right? Will you cast aside glances at other guys?”\n“Of course not!”\n“There’s nothing to worry about you then…you’re my only one, and I’ll only care about you. That aside, I don’t want others to give you coveting looks, and that’s why I don’t want others to see you in this getup.”\nThey reverted back to their initial topic, and Mahiru frowned slightly, before rubbing her forehead onto his upper arm several times.”\n“…Let us endure for now.”\n“Yeah.”\n“…That aside, I want to keep you to myself.”\n“Same here.”\nAmane gently patted Mahiru’s back while she continued to rub her forehead onto him. She then lifted her head, and stared at him intently.\n“…I want to see you in butler clothing sooner, Amane-kun.”\n“Time for the guy to borrow this place and show off. Just wait a while.”\nThanks to Itsuki, Chitose and Kido’s goodwill, Amane got to see Mahiru in this state earlier. It was originally meant to be shown to everyone.\nSoon it would be the boys’ turn to wear their rented clothes.\n“…Let’s say this first though, it’s nothing fancy.”\n“No, I am looking forward to it.”\nMahiru smiled, indicating that her words were not out of courtesy, but earnestness. Amane felt an indescribable tickle in his heart,\njust wait, don’t hope too much about it,\nand scratched his cheek.\n“How about it?”\n“What do you mean, how about it…it suits her.”\nThe boys in charge of serving were done changing, and were all riled up as Amane had just seen Mahiru in maid uniform.\nAmane, upon being asked so, could only answer thusly.\nHis classmates were obviously disappointed to hear his dull reaction. He stared at them dumbfoundedly.\n“Say, I don’t think that’s all you’re thinking right now, right?”\n“What else can I say…there’s no way it doesn’t suit her.”\n“Well yeah, it’s Shiina-san after all.”\n“I want her service too.”\n“I want her to smile and say ‘goshujin-sama’…”\n“I’m never letting her serve you guys.”\n“Miser…miser…let us dream.”\n“Better to shatter the dreams that can never happen.”\n“Ouch.”\nOver this period, Amane got along with the classmates who were laughing out loud (though a minority was really despondent), and they could joke along. He started to interact with the other boys;\nI’m so envious\n. there were some who would occasionally say so while patting him on the back, and he would respond in kind.\nAmane deliberately answered mercilessly as he casually interacted, wearing the clothes prepared for him.\nThe boys were dressed in navy blue jackets that were close to black, slacks, dark gray waistcoats. It was a simple, lanky design that exuded elegance.\nHe did not feel tight, and had no issues moving in it. He should be fine.\n“It’s amazing. Itsuki looks like a playboy butler, the comedic type commonly seen in manga.”\n“Eh, why roast me?”\nItsuki was done changing, and was teased by the other boys.\nAmane glanced aside, and as they had commented, the newly dressed butler looked cheerful, to put it nicely. To be blunt though, he looked frivolous.\n“Yep, you look frivolous.”\n“You too Amane!? You though…uh oh, it’s the serious look that can be Shiina-san.”\n“What nonsense are you saying.”\nAmane would naturally dress well since it was for Mahiru to see. He combed some of his hair back, and looked more refreshing than usual.\nHe did not want to do the all back hair commonly seen in illustrations, but he would do this much without hesitation.\n“He’s serious…this guy’s serious…”\n“He was so unenthusiastic before this, and now he’s so motivated…”\n“I don’t know why Shiina-san’s looking forward to it, but I’ll definitely get serious if I’m him.”\n“They’re flirting…they’re flirting…”\n“No well, if your girlfriends are looking forward to it, you guys will be enthusiastic too, right?”\n“Stop it Fujimiya, it’s super effective against singles.”\n“Ehhh…sorry…”\n“Don’t apologize man. It hurts…”\nThe classmates said so as they nonchalantly put Amane in a head lock. He took it silently this time, and shrugged at a smiling Itsuki, who was a little devastated to be called frivolous.\n“Well, Chitose will be happy to see you like this, Itsuki.”\n“Yeah, and she’ll go all\nIkkun’s so frivolous.\n”\n“Yep.”\nAmane imagined Chitose answering so, though not maliciously, and quietly chuckled. Itsuki jabbed at Amane’s flank, and the latter slapped the back in return.\n“Speaking of which, I think Kadowaki’s going to be the center of attention again.”\n“Not really. The girls said that the prince-type, frivolous, aloof and shotas are all in demand.”\n“Kuju has it rough to be called a shota. Also, you’re obviously the frivolous one.”\nKuju was forced to serve due to his looks. He was short compared to the other boys, and fit an archetype in a certain sense. He was often displeased to be called cute, moreso this time it seemed.\nAmane glanced aside at Kuju, who looked displeased while having changed clothes. For good or bad, he was diminutive, had a baby face, and might satisfy a certain need.\nOn a side note, his buddy Hiiragi was in the back, the reason being that he was burlier than expected. He was sturdier than the other boys, and the decision was made that he should contribute as labor instead of serving customers.\n“…Damn you Kazuya…you traitor…”\nAmane heard a curse from the cute babyface, but he chose to pretend not to hear it.\n“Ohhh, it really suits you Ikkun~! Frivolous though!”\nThe students in charge of serving were gathered in the classroom, and it was time for the reveal. As expected, Chitose leered away as she appraised him as frivolous.\nItsuki too knew that he looked the part, and did not deny so, but he looked into the distance,\nis it that ridiculous?\nHe muttered so. It was to be expected though, since he was usually like this.\nChitose too was to serve customers, and was dressed in a maid uniform.\nPerhaps there were two kinds, for she was not wearing the conservative dress Mahiru wore. It was one focused on cuteness and decorative purposes, one that was several centimeters above the knees.\nOne could see the frills beneath the hem, and white knee socks on her long slender legs. The short size complimented the fluffy apron, giving the vibe of a modern maid.\n“Anyway, how is it? Does it suit me?”\n“Of course, anything suits you Chii.”\n“You say that, but you were rolling on the floor laughing when I wore Mahirun’s clothes and showed you.”\n“Ah, that’s a size…”\n“Ikkun.”\n“Sorry.”\nThe frivolous (so-called) Itsuki too would be obedient in the face of his girlfriend. It was his fault for touching at her sore point, so Amane did not retort.\nBesides Chitose, there were a few other waitress girls in maid outfits. Amane chuckled in amazement at how they would be carrying out this event.\nKido, in charge of hosting, was wearing the same uniform as Mahiru, and approached him with a smile.\n“Ahh, you look handsome when you put in the effort to dress up, Fujimiya-kun.”\n“Mahiru’s looking forward to it.”\n“Fufu, such a good boyfriend. Shiina-san, your boyfriend’s dressed like a butler now.”\nKido whisked Mahiru over with a hearty smile and wave, and Mahiru did not do so for some reason. He thought she was unwilling, but it did not seem to be the case since she was blushing and fidgeting.\nShe’s so nervous looking forward to it, I guess she’s overimagining it,\nKido giggled, and returned to Mahiru.\n“Alright Shiina-san, it’ll be a pity if you don’t have a look up close. You two will be doing your shifts together, so you should get used to it.”\nItsuki and the others had arranged for Amane and Mahiru to be in the same shift. It was partially to ward off any harassment, and also to allow for them to tour the school together during their off period.\nKido nudged Mahiru’s back, and she approached him hesitantly.\n“It doesn’t suit me?”\n“N-not at all! It is wonderful, so unlike you, Amane-kun…”\n“Is it that ridiculous? How do I look?”\n“…More alluring than usual.”\n“I’m wearing more than usual. I don’t usually wear this much, let alone at home.”\n“Sometimes it is better to wear more!”\nMahiru emphasized for some reason, leaving Amane perturbed, but the other girls nodded with understanding looks, and the atmosphere could not allow him to deny so.\nAs usual, Mahiru looked up with blushing cheeks, fidgeting as she killed off the boys with cuteness. There was no stopping her.\n“…Mahiru, don’t show others such a look. It’ll kill.”\n“Same to you, Amane-kun.”\n“Sure sure sure.”\n“T-that is casual of you…”\nMahiru looked displeased, but Amane’s face was so unlike Mahiru’s prettiness, and there was no way he would have charmed both boys and girls.\nYou don’t have to worry about it,\nAmane brushed it off with such an implication, and Mahiru gently nudged at his upper arm in seemingly disbelief.",

      "content": "“Welcome.”\n“Ugh…”\nAfter the showoff, it was time to practice, but they could not.\nMahiru’s work smile immobilized all the boys. They, who had volunteered to be customers, crumbled before the smile. The Angel’s smile truly was terrifying.\nThose that managed to survive the initial attack were led to their seats, and were shot down by another smile. Amane felt it would be terrible if she was not under control, and his face twitched.\n“The Angel is really scary…Amane, go stop Shiina-san.”\n“That smile isn’t at full power though.”\n“Wait, she’s not going all out yet…”\n“Stop watching the fun. This isn’t a joke here.”\nAmane watched from the sidelines, and Mahiru’s smile remained a little pretentious to him. It was truly because she was giving a business smile to appeal to customers. If she put in a little more effort however, the boys would surely crumble.\nThe girls too were mesmerized. The Angel’s smile was super effective.\n“…We can’t practice service like this.”\nKido could only give a wry smile as she observed on.\nAmane was used to it, and might have underestimated the smile’s probably because they were always together, Mahiru herself had a beauty and disposition that would mesmerize anyone, and he should have expected this beforehand.\n“I think the serving part is fine…but we cannot cause our customers’ heads to numb there.”\n“Sorry.”\n“No, this isn’t your fault or Shiina-san…”\nKido said, and gave a thousand yard stare. Amane was really apologetic, but he was hapless.\n“…We should have ordered some cold drinks.”\n“Yeah…make it all cool and icy here.”\nThe classroom might be boiling thanks to Mahiru, and they decided to pay attention to the air conditioning.\n“But seriously, it’ll be troublesome if we don’t control her.”\n“Yeah, the victims…”\n“Ahh no, its partly because of the victims…but mostly because I’m annoyed.”\nKido gave Amane a dumbfounded look once she heard these true thoughts blurted out.\n“I don’t want my girlfriend to start smiling at other guys, even if it’s a business smile. Look, I’m petty alright.”\n“…Say, I thought you’re rather matured.”\n“Hm?”\nThe sudden change of topic had Amane widening his eyes this time. Kido smiled, and looked up at him.\n“I used to think you’re more calm and poised, more adult-like compared to the other guys. To be honest, you seem a little inapproachable…but you’re rather cute.”\n“Are you roasting me here?”\n“No no no, I’m just praising you. You seem to act your age now. Uuu, like, I get that you’re a guy since you’re acting all jealous, and you really like Shiina-san, so I’m relieved to see that. Yeah, anyway, it’s good…I’m not falling for you. Don’t worry.”\n“What’s that at the end?”\n“Eh, Shiina-san’s stare.”\nShe’s looking at us.\nThe nonchalant words had Amane noticing that Mahiru was look.\nMahiru was not giving a suspicious look, but rather, a little displeasure. Amane felt that she probably was not doubting his fidelity.\nAnd just as Amane felt conflicted about Mahiru smiling to everyone, so would Mahiru be peeved that Amane was getting along well with other girls.\nIt seemed Mahiru liked Kido as a person however, so the stare seemed a little anxious.\n“You really are loved, Amane.”\n“You’re really loved, Fujimiya-kun.”\nItsuki appeared to have eavesdropped as he joked, and Kido too happily imitated. Amane frowned for a single moment, but he gave Mahiru a gentle smile.\nThe girls practiced serving the customers, and it was the boys’ turn.\n“I want to be Kadowaki-kun’s customer.”\n“Ahh no way, me too!”\n“Hey, don’t decide! Anyway, me too!”\n“Since when is it on a by name basis?”\nThe girls frantically volunteered to be Kadowaki’s practice partner, and Amane watched from afar, thinking that these girls were really amazing. Kadowaki was available, which was one reason for the skirmish.\nThe highly popular Kadowaki seemed a little conflicted, and yet weary as he smiled away.\nPopular guys sure have it tough\n, so Amane pitied.\n“It’s amazing.”\nKido did not join in, and watched on.\n“Kido…you have a boyfriend, right?”\n“Yep, I do. He’s from another class. I’ve known him since young, and he has decent muscles.”\n“That’s quite the introduction. You boasting?”\n“Ah, I don’t just like the muscles of course. He’s a klutz, but he’s kind and poised.”\nI’ll introduce him to you if I get the chance\n, Kido giggled, and Amane nodded.\nThe skirmish for the customer’s position became slightly chaotic. Kido smiled away as she clapped hard to gain everyone’s attention, quelling this conflict.\n“Alright alright, we’ll go by order for who’s to practice with Kadowaki-kun. Once you decide on the order, I’ll come up with a namelist. We’ll get several tries, and I think everyone should be able to experience this once, given the numbers. That’ll be fair, right? Anyway, do your job Akazawa-kun. Show us what the guys can do.”\n“No well, we don’t need to get the guys to perform. I think Yuuta should be fine.”\n“We can’t leave it all to Kadowaki-kun! And Chii-chan, stop watching already!”\n“Ehh, but”\n“No buts. Anyway, those who want to volunteer for practice, decide on your order and tell us. See, the other guys are all so free. Get practicing!”\nKido was obviously more reliable than Itsuki, who was supposed to lead. Amane gave a wry smile, and Mahiru approached quietly, standing next to him courteously.\n“…I shall be your first customer, Amane-kun.”\n“Alrighty. Anyway, why is everyone picking people?”\n“…Because everyone is dressed well?”\n“Hmm, well, Kadowaki’s a handsome butler. That’s probably an ideal one.”\nKadowaki showed a perturbed smile while surrounded by the excited girls. His butler outlet looked decent on him, form fitting.\nHe already was handsome to the point of being called the Prince, and the clothes too suit him. Anything would probably suit him unless the clothes looked outlandish.\nThe handsome aura he oozed was so dazzling, and Amane felt that if he were to stand next to Kadowaki at this point, people would likely compare them, which would trouble him.\n“It does suit Kadowaki-san…but he is not my type.”\n“Well yeah, I’ll be in trouble if I’m not your type…it’s a lot better for me.”\n“Naturally.”\nAmane felt a little awkward to hear Mahiru’s insistence.\nYou are the best,\nso her expression implied, and he could not say anything.\n…This is proof that she likes me, right?”\nHe felt gaudy and yet elated, and it was no wonder that his lips were slightly raised.\nHe covered his lips with his white gloved hand to hide his embarrassment. Mahiru showed an elegant smile, as though she had seen through him.",

      "content": "After the war over Kadowaki ended, Amane and the others began to practice their service. Needless to say, Amane was to practice with Mahiru.\n“Welcome. Please have a seat here.”\nHe made sure to make a natural smile as he welcomed Mahiru, who was acting as the customer. For some reason, she froze.\nHe was not giving the smile he usually showed at home, but a smile usually reserved for strangers. Her eyes looked rather rattled however.\n“Dear customer, may I know what’s the problem?”\n“N-nothing. Nothing at all.”\nMahiru shook her head frantically, and her tied long hair swayed like a whip. Amane served her just as a waiter would serve a customer. Her hair did not touch him, but it could have if they were as close as they usually were.\nHis heart surely was calm enough for him to think about these things. He heaved a sigh of relief, and led Mahiru to her seat. Also, he did check with the door staff of their numbers, and thus there would not be a case where there was no available seat even though he led her in.\n“Please have a seat here, and wait a moment.”\nAmane pulled the chair out, smiled, and Mahiru sat on it gingerly.\nShe probably was reacting out of shame and nervousness, but the nervous one should have been Amane, the one smiling at her like a customer. He did not understand what’s there for her to be embarrassed about.\nHe deliberately ignored her reaction since they had to practice, memorized her order, and went to the indoor curtain that shielded the simple kitchen they had.\n“…What’s this, some ambush?”\n“What do you mean?”\nThe practice continued on after her order, and only ended when he saw her leave the shop.\nOnce he was done practicing with Mahiru, he went to Kido, who was in charge of guiding them. Kido nodded away, looking impressed. On a side note, Mahiru was restless the entire time, and Amane was worried if he had omitted something.\n“Ah, your service and gestures are fine.”\n“But Mahiru’s like that though?”\n“That’s because you’re handsome, right? You’re doing decently. How about working at the cafe I work at? The owner will be happy~”\n“I’ll think about it when I need the money for myself.”\nAmane hinted that he had no intentions to do so for the time being, and Kido gave a regretful smile. She then glanced aside at Mahiru, who was fanned with a file by Chitose.\n“Shiina-san will have it tough during this cultural festival~”\n“Well, there’ll be many customers after her.”\n“That’s not what I mean.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“She’s worried because her boyfriend may attract attention. I feel that you’ll be really popular if you keep smiling like that.”\nShe poked at Amane’s face with a ballpoint pen, and he gently flicked it aside with his finger.\n“I don’t think that’ll happen.”\n“Do you know, Fujimiya-kun? People do judge others based on appearances initially, but appearances don’t just mean looks. There’s also the sense of purity, vibe, gestures, and so on on. People do observe that. To be honest, there are guys who are more handsome than you if we’re just going on looks…but I don’t think it’s enough to gain goodwill.”\n“Well, I get that, and I do think so too.”\nAmane and Mahiru were not on good terms when they first met each other. He found her pretty, but did not have feelings for her, partially because he had no real interest in the opposite gender.\n“You should agree that you’re popular. Your smile is great.”\n“If I agree with that, doesn’t that make me a narcissist?”\n“Ahaha, but it’s true that you’re smiling better~ not as good as my boyfriend though.”\n“Guess what I’m feeling after I just got flexed on.”\n“I think you want to check out how good my boyfriend is.”\n“Ugh…probably.”\nEven though they spent a short time together, Amane could tell that Kido was an honest, cheerful, amicable person who loved to care for others. He was actually curious about this boyfriend she was so fond of, but all he knew was that the boyfriend’s personality and body was fine.\n“We’ll talk about that next time. Anyway, you pass. Here’s a little red flower.”\nFrom her apron, Kido took out a little red flower sticker, as though it was proof that he passed, and handed it to him.\nOn a side note, Itsuki, who had been observing, had a ‘failed’ sticker on his head, which he asked Kido to paste.\nAnd the reason why Itsuki failed was that he was grinning away the entire time. He was reminded not to leer too much.\n“Anyway, I got to check on the others. Go to Shiina-san, Fujimiya-kun.”\n“…Yeah.”\n“And if you say any lovey-dovey stuff…”\n“That’s not going to happen.”\nHow can I do it in front of everyone?\nAmane’s expression betrayed his displeasure, and it was dismissed by her usual hearty smile.\nThe little displeasure he had was gone, and with an inexplicable ticklish feeling, he scratched his cheek and went towards Mahiru.\n“Mahiru.”\n“Uu, A-Amane-kun…”\n“Ah, the reason for Mahirun’s blood rush is here.”\nThe blood rush Chitose spoke of probably referred to Mahiru’s searing face. Her white face was a little red when he was serving her.\nThe blushing maid with slightly reddened eyes leaned on the chair, and looked up towards him, which was bad for his heart.\n“Amane, you really are Mahirun’s killer, so don’t bully her so much.”\n“What’s with this characteristic…”\n“Well, a special attribute that activates only on Mahirun.”\n“…I think Amane-kun’s target is not just me alone.”\nMahiru muttered so, and Amane smiled wryly as he sat next to her, which caused her to shiver.\n“Am I that handsome?”\n“…Yes.”\n“I’m honored as the boyfriend then…anyway, understand that I don’t care about anyone other than you.”\n“I-I know this…but I do feel a little conflicted.”\nMahiru wriggled, seemingly feeling unbearable, so Amane patted her to calm her down, but she ended up blushing more than before.\n“…Is this a special attack on Mahirun, or an AOE attack? It’s like a chain reaction that causes more victims from Mahirun’s embarrassment.”\n“You said something?”\n“Nothing~”\nAmane glared at Chitose who went off tangent, and the latter played dumb as she evaded that look.",

      "content": "The cultural festival at Amane’s school was not fully opened to the public; it was limited only to family and friends. They had to request for an invitation,\nOf course, there was a limited number of tickets per person.\nThis measure was simply because it had not been peaceful recently, and there were incidents of visitors being violent in school. A student’s safety was priority, even though it was a festival, and thus the decision.\n“I do not have anyone I can invite.”\nIt was after dinner, and Mahiru flatly muttered as she looked at the invitation list distributed by the school.\nShe was dubbed the Angel, adored by the masses, but she hardly went out to make friends. Even in middle school, she had no one she could call an intimate friend.\nThe other option besides friends was her parents; her father aside, she definitely would never invite her mother. Truth be told, she came to the conclusion that there was no one she could invite, simply because she was unwilling to invite her parents.\n“I do not have anyone on close terms that I can invite out, so this has nothing to do with me. The people I am better terms with are all at school, so you do not have to worry.”\n“Same here…ah wait, mom’s going to yap a lot if I don’t mention this…”\n“Will Shihoko-san and Shuuto-san be attending too?”\n“I hid it from them last year, and got yapped at for so long.”\nShihoko made quite a ridiculous fuss when she found out.\nGiven her personality, she would definitely go all out on the skinship with Amane, even in public, and it would be embarrassing for him to have a clingy mother even in high school. Also, he did not want to let others see how lovey-dovey his parents were.\n‘It’s the cultural festival soon’\n, it seemed she remembered about it this year as she sent this message. She was definitely asking for tickets.\n“I reminded them not to be so open about that before inviting them.”\n“Ah-ahaha.”\nMahiru too knew full well how Shihoko and Shuuto would flirt openly, and gave a wry smile.\n“Hmm, I’ll be inviting them. It’s quite some distance from my hometown to here, and I don’t really have anyone I’m on really good terms with.”\n“I see.”\nMahiru had no intention to continue further, for she understood part of the past history Amane had.\nAmane paid no attention to it however, and got on fine with the friends he made in high school, so it turned out well. It seemed she was still concerned however.\nHe was more concerned about Mahiru’s parents.\nMahiru’s father Asahi was fine, but neither side had any intention to meet. Mahiru had no intention to meet her mother, and Amane could tell through the one conversation they had. There was no way Mahiru would invite her mother to the cultural festival.\nDespite that, Amane did not know about Mahiru’s life before high school, and assumed there was nothing he could say,\n“…Anyway, you say that you can’t call anyone, but what about the housemaker?”\nHe then remembered that though her parents ignored her, there was a woman who imparted love and knowledge to Mahiru.\nThat housemaker appeared to be the one who taught Mahiru’s housemaking and culinary skills, and Mahiru’s eyes looked blissful whenever she recounted about the housemaker. It would not be hyperbole to say that the housemaker raised her in her parents’ stead.\nShe widened her eyes once she heard so.\n“You do remember about Koyuki-san? I probably mentioned a few words.”\n“It’s about you after all. You’re not calling her?”\n“…I cannot do so.”\nAmane felt he had a good idea, but Mahiru writhed, looking a little forlorn, despondent, and he realized he misspoke.\n“…Sorry.”\nSomething happened to the housemaker Koyuki, and he carelessly suggested to invite her. He frowned once he realized this, and Mahiru then realized what he was imagining, hastily waving her hands, telling him not to worry about that.\n“This is not what I mean! Koyuki-san stopped being the housemaker when I was in middle school…she had waist issues.”\n“…Ahh.”\n“It was part of her work, but she had to tend to such a massive house alone, and I felt sorry for her for putting her through with such hardship.”\nAmane felt it was no wonder then since Koyuki’s had an injured waist.\nEven when recovered, the old ailments could flare up again. It was akin to tying a bomb onto the waist. She could not work, and could not get careless.\n“She is staying with her daughter and son-in-law. I do not wish to call her over because I am worried about her. There are not many places for her to rest in school, and she does stay far away. I really cannot bring myself to have her make a trip here.”\n“I see. That’s a pity.”\n“Yes.”\nIt was obvious from Mahiru’s face that she really admired the housemaker.\nAmane too wanted to meet the person who shaped Mahiru’s living ability and personality, to thank her. It was unlikely to happen however due to health issues.\n“I find it a pity too that I can’t greet the person who took care of you. Maybe I should give her a holler in the future?”\n“Eh, gr-greet?”\n“Yes. She is like your mother, right?”\n“…Yes.”\n“Then I should pay her a visit.”\nAmane had basically declared to Mahiru’s father that he would take her in, and was recognized for that. He should also pay attention to the mother who took care of her.\nMahiru herself was under the great care of the housekeeper, who went far beyond her duties to love Mahiru. It would be rude to the magnanimous person to sweep away the daughter without informing her.\n“We’ll think about it in the future then. It’s rude to make a sudden visit, so let’s get the chance to write a letter…Mahiru?”\n“N-nothing.”\n“Doesn’t feel like it from your face.”\n“It is is nothing.”\nMahiru stuffed her favorite cushion onto Amane’s face, blocking his sights,\ngoodness me,\nand he chuckled as he let her be.",

      "content": "Running a cafe during a cultural festival was really tedious, but there was more progress than Amane had expected.\nThe crux was that someone lent them clothes. Once this issue was resolved, they chose to run a cafe.\nFollowing that was the interior decoration and the beverages and foods to be served. For the former, they simply needed to arrange the desks and chairs, and make it presentable. The latter part was the troublesome one. The cultural festival would last two days, and they would have to estimate the amount of food to serve, and also to pay attention to hygiene while serving.\nDespite that, it not such a problematic issue this time. Due to hygiene and the efforts required, they decided to purchase wholesale this time.\nTo be precise, as Amane’s class was hosting a maid and butler themed cafe, the core entertainment should be the appearance and atmosphere. Thus, they could only compromise on food.\nGiven that many classes requested to use the cooking classroom, one would see that choosing a wholesaler was a wise choice.\n“But I’ll be a bit more serious about drinks.”\nSaying that was Itsuki, still the committee member, giving a harmonious smile as he winked and told them.\nHe said he had contacts that could provide him low prices for coffee beans. He happily slapped the bag onto the table, and it contained grounded beans.\nThe best beans would be freshly roasted, but there was no time for this as high schoolers would be running the shop temporarily. Thus, the coffee beans were prepared, and so were the tea leaves. Everything that was to be provided was available.\n“That’s better than expected.”\nChitose muttered as she looked at the somewhat decorated classroom.\nThere was a limit to how much they could decorate a classroom. Tablecloths, cushions, and little locker ornaments were place on the desks, ensuring that they did not seem like desks, creating an atmosphere.\nIt might not be an orthodox maid cafe, but it should suffice for a student activity. The most important aspect was still the dressed students.\n“Hmm, I think this much should be enough.”\n“Yeah. A change of curtains and decorations changes lots.”\n“Good work, you guys. The curtains really suit the mood.”\nThe borrowed curtains had yellow knots, and looked grand. Amane pointed at the curtains,\nwill be bad if we dirty them,\nand Chitose muttered so.\nThere were a few seats set next to the windows, and if they got dirtied, it probably would ve really costly to wash them.\n“I guess this much should be enough. Let’s just hope that the customers will come here.”\n“…I think they’ll be baited with Shiina-san as the maid. Might have too many coming after all that we can’t handle.”\n“My girlfriend isn’t bait. Also, the other girls are dressed nicely too. Isn’t it rude to the other girls if they’re going to charge towards her.”\nAmane only focused on Mahiru, but objectively speaking, the other girls in maid outfits looked decent, and the clothes matched them. His bias aside, Mahiru’s cuteness was otherworldly, but it did not mean she was the only one suited for this.\n“Ikkun, I think you should take pointers from Amane.”\n“O-owie, you’re cute too.”\n“Your praise is too insincere. If you don’t praise me more, I’ll punish you by bringing to to that last we last talked about for a tea course.”\n“Wargh that’s expensive!”\n“Every table is assigned a butler. You can go learn from there.”\n“That’s way too expensive a lesson!”\nSo Amane ignored the bickering two friends who were happily deciding on their next date plans, and looked towards Mahiru, who sat next to him silently.\nFor some reason, she was giving an inexplicable look.\n“Mahiru?”\n“…Amane-kun, do you think, I-I am the cutest?”\n“What’s with this out of a sudden? You worried that I just praised the other girls…isn’t it obvious? What’s there to ask? It suits you best, and you’re the cutest.”\n“Y-yes.”\nFor Amane, the one golden rule was that ‘Mahiru was special’, but it seemed Mahiru would feel concerned.\nHe softly praised the somewhat jealous Mahiru, and that alone delighted her as she smiled happily.\nShe would not cling onto him as they were at school, but she bashfully tugged at his sleeve. This little gesture was eyecatching enough, so Amane was a little frustrated by how cute his girlfriend was.\n…There’ll be a lot more stares on that day.\nWarm stares were emitted from his classmates, and though conflicted, Amane was fine with them.\nThe problem was the day itself.\nHe foresaw that some would give rude looks, and some would be unruly.\nI’ll try my best not to leave her then.\nAmane was quietly grateful to Itsuki and the others for assigning him and Mahiru in the same slot. He looked back and forth between Mahiru, who was smiling bashfully, and the bickering lovebirds Itsuki and Chitose, before giving a wry smile.",

      "content": "They were blessed with clear weather on the day of the festival.\nThe weather started to cool, and they were sufficiently dressed to the point that they could keep warm. Even with ties, they would not sweat much.\n“We’re in the first shift. I’m a little nervous.”\n“We’ll change shift at noon, so let’s work hard until then. I get the feeling it’ll be crowded with you and Mahiru around.”\n“Sorry about that, but I really can’t bring myself to do this. I’m about to give up.”\nThe first event was the opening ceremony for all students, so after they attended it at the gym, Amane was in the changing room with Kadowaki, who was in the same shift, and they chatted away as they got changed…Kadowaki however gave an enlightened smile.\nHe was already used to having stares upon him, and probably gave up and accepted even though he was just changing.\nHandsome guys sure have it tough\n, Amane instinctively gave a look of pity, and Kadowaki chuckled once he saw that.\n“Be careful. Shiina-san will get jealous too.”\n“Don’t worry. I won’t stand out much with you around.”\n“What are you saying now…but well, you might have more instances of getting jealous than her.”\n“Jealous? I’m in cold sweat.”\nMahiru was cute, and was really suited for a maid’s outfit. One might worry if there would be any strange man harassing her, or even sexually.\nLots of students would swarm towards Mahiru then. As the boyfriend, Amane was peeved to imagine so, and was worried if there would be any insolent stares.\nIt seemed Kadowaki understood what Amane was thinking,\ndo your best then,\nfor he frowned slightly and made a wry smile, patting Amane on the back.\nThey got changed, returned to the classroom, and their classmates were already waiting for them there, appearing to be all ready. The students that were not present might be at the cooking classroom.\nItsuki’s shift would begin at noon, and thus he was dressed in school uniform. Once he saw his classmates here, he stood at the podium, showing the usual hearty smile.\n“It’s the first day of the festival. Honestly, I’ve no idea how many people will be here. It’s not like we don’t have any past references, but we have some popular people here.”\nItsuki glanced aside at Kadowaki and Mahiru, who gave wry smiles, probably having steeled themselves.\n“Anyway, we’ll sort it out in our way. It’s not often that we get a cultural festival, and no point if we don’t enjoy ourselves, even if there aren’t any customers here. We don’t have that much time next year, so our second year will be the time we’ll enjoy ourselves most. We’ll only be thinking about exams next year.”\n“That’s a downer.”\n“Sorry sorry, let’s sweep the gloom aside! We’re going to enjoy ourselves this year!”\nIt seemed the class was gloomy for a moment, but Itsuki’s smile soon cheered them up. It was the right choice for him to step up and lead.\n“Ah right right, some business intel, or rather, a reminder. I guess everyone understands that we don’t allow photos to be taken in the shop. We’ll remind them at the entrance that no photos can be taken. If anyone asks for it, just refuse and tell them that we don’t provide such services. Otherwise, it’ll get really troublesome.”\nThe specialized shops at the electronics street often provided such services, but not here, of course. It was after all a student’s cultural festival, and the selling point was not the appearance of the attendants.\nAlso, there was a notice pasted in the shop, forbidding photos. A similar notice was written in the corner of the menus.\nAlso, no footage was allowed to be taken during the festival. Students from another school had uploaded their activity footage onto video sites and apps, resulting in cases of girls being stalked, which was why the school had new rules forbidding this.\nTimes changed, resulting in these new restrictions. Amane was impressed yet bewildered thinking about it. In any case, there would be some who would not follow rules, and they had to pay attention.\n“That’s about all we have to pay attention to. We’re starting soon.”\nThe moment he finished, a noise blared through the speakers.\nFollowing that was the principal declaring the start of the festival.\n“Let’s work hard over these two days then! We’re aiming for top sales for our year!”\nItsuki raised his fist and boasted of something a little reckless, riling the class up. It seemed they were already riled up.\nAmane straightened his back again, and Mahiru, listening next to him,\nlet us do your best,\nsoftly muttered so.",

      "content": "And as expected, there were customers at Amane’s classroom since the opening, mostly students.\n“The Angel’s effect is really amazing.”\nMuttering so was the male classmate Yamazaki, who was in the same shift.\nAll the seats were filled minutes in, a rarity for a student activity. He might be dumbfounded, or even thunderstruck by the passionate customers.\nIt was really difficult for a restaurant to hold so many customers at once, so they limited the numbers. It was no wonder that he was intimidated by the overwhelming numbers.\nThe male gazes would be on Mahiru whenever she went past them. Amane was reluctant, impressed, and peeved, his face on the verge of collapsing.\nHe already expected so, and gave up, but he was really peeved about this matter, which he was already happy with. These words might be applicable to Amane however, from Mahiru’s perspective. Vice versa.\n“I guess that’s expected. That aside, we got customers.”\nAmane informed Yamazaki, and led the new customer to the seat.\nUsually speaking, the customer was to be served by anyone available, but some would specify certain persons to do so, which was awkward. This shop did not provide such services, and if needed, they could go to those shops.\nThe female student he just served appeared to be headed for Kadowaki, but he so happened to be serving another customer, so unfortunately for her, Amane had to serve.\n“Please have a seat here.”\nAmane pulled the chair, and showed the smile Kido taught him. The girl who seemed distraught that Kadowaki was not serving her was seemingly taken aback as she looked towards Amane.\nToo bad if she starts running elsewhere,\nso he taught as he informed her of the basket to put her belongings, before brandishing the menu before her.\n“The recommended item for the day is set A. Is that fine with uou?”\n“I-I shall have one then…”\nOn a side note, though it was a recommended item, there were only three sets of snacks and drinks, A, B and C. They were sold as sets, to prevent customers from merely ordering drinks.\nThe entrance receptionist did remind them that they had to inform of an allergies, so there probably should not be any issues.\nThe girl ordered with some hesitation,\ncertainly, please wait, we shall serve immediately,\nAmane bowed politely, and went off to inform the counter staff.\n“One A. Orders are starting to pile up. Do your best.”\nSome classmates were behind the counter, serving the desserts on the plates, some were hurrying between the cooking classroom and the classroom, and a certain idle classmate lifted his head slowly\n“Woah…it’s ridiculous out there.”\n“Don’t die now.”\n“We can handle for now since we prepared lots beforehand, but…”\n“But what?”\n“…I guess you guys will really have it tough.”\n“Really? Well, Kadowaki’s a hot commodity. We’ll be busier.”\n“I’m not talking about that.”\nHe sighed, but did not mention why. Amane was confused, but it probably should not be too much of a problem.\nThis is ridiculous,\nsuch was the look Amane gave, but he was in turn pitied.\n“…And also, Shiina’s been looking here the entire time, looking a little unhappy.”\n“What now?”\n“I think you’re the cause.”\n“I need to serve. Not like I got a choice.”\n“That’s one thing, but I don’t think that’s the reason.”\n“I don’t get what you’re trying to say.”\nAmane felt that he was gently rebuked, but he could not understand, and frowned.\nThe implication probably was that Mahiru was jealous, but it seemed that Mahiru was pouting because of something else.\nAmane decided to ask Mahiru later, and ended the conversation there as he served the prepared dishes to the table.",

      "content": "An hour and a half passed since the opening, and the customers did not seem to dwindle in numbers. It increased instead.\nMore people entered as time went on, and the queuing crowds kindled the curiosity of many.\nMost of the initial customers were students, and later, one could see visitors.\nThey were not as passionate as the students, but there were instances of visitors being amazed by the many good looking students.\nSome younger visitors wanted to seize the chance to woo, but the issues were calmly resolved by the service staff.\n“You’re really cute Miss.”\nOf course, some tried to speak to Mahiru, who showed a faint smile, thanked them, and went on her way.\nShe did not intend to continue the conversation,\nhave you decided on what to order?\nand cut off any male attempts to woo her.\nThis universal retort reminded the customer that he was merely a customer.\n“I have, but I want to talk about you…”\n“If you have, please place your order.”\n“Erm, if it’s convenient later…”\n“Apologies, but we do not provide such services. Please place your order if you have decided.”\nThis customer appear to have intended to continue further, but Mahiru responded with a standard smile. The customer noticed a few staff members staring coldly at him, and deflatedly placed his order.\nIt happened a few times, and Amane could only show a wry smile.\n…Guess I’m not the only one being overprotective.\nHe could sense that none of his classmates was going to let Mahiru be hurt.\nMahiru truly was adored by his classmates, but he never expected them to show such concern for her.\n“I know you’re worried, but we’re paying attention too. Don’t be too tense.”\nWhile Amane was surprised by this, Kadowaki showed a wry smile as he approached Amane, having some available time.\nOn a side note, he too was often approached by the ladies, but one could often see him dodging them artfully, probably out of habit.\n“We know you’re restless about how popular your girlfriend is, and you can’t always keep an eye on her, right? We’ll chip in when we can.”\n“Kadowaki…”\nAmane realized then that Kadowaki and the other classmates were so kind, and he felt a warmth spreading in his heart.\n“We don’t want a friend to be hurt…or to be honest, we don’t want to see someone wrecked again after being healed.”\n“Healed?”\n“The whole class is basically going, don’t ruin the sweet and sour mood between you two.”\n“Sorry, I don’t get what you mean.”\nWhat’s this guy saying?\nIt was no wonder then that Amane showed such a look.\nHe cringed, having heard Kadowaki say something so unlike him. The person who said such vague lines grinned away, and could not help but burst out laughing.\n“Anyway, just take it that Shiina-san’s really doted on, that everyone in class is being friendly to you two.”\n“So you mean everyone’s looking at us?”\n“No, just think about it. Everyone’s definitely looking when you two are flirting so naturally.”\n“Since when were we flirting?’\n“No no no no no.”\nWhat are you saying?\nKadowaki gave Amane such a look, and Amane pursed his lips.\nHe had no memory of flirting openly.\nDespite that, one could assume it was the atmosphere caused when he unwittingly touched Mahiru from time to time.\n…I got to be careful.\nOtherwise, he might carelessly ruin something one day.\nWell, as long as you two are happy,\nKadowaki giggled at the silent Amane, looking completely relieved. Embarrassed, Amane pursed his lips harder than before.\n“Amane-kun.”\nAmane returned to the back counter, and met Mahiru, who happily went towards him.\nHer smile was different from the business smile she showed. It was a sincere, heartfelt smile shown only to him. He felt his heart jolt, and welcomed her with a smile only to her.\n“You’re not tired?’\n“I am fine. Everyone is concerned about me…but I was shocked to see everyone intimidate the person with the camera through smiles.”\n“Ah, we did say that cameras are forbidden, and reminded them before then. Can’t help it when they ignore it.”\n“It does seem that everyone is extremely motivated…”\n“Well, yeah.”\nAmane did not mention that it was because everyone was gently watching over them, and brushed this matter aside. Mahiru gave a bell-like giggle, and it seemed she had not noticed it.\nOne had to wonder if she really did not notice, or that she was used to it. She was worried about the cafe, for she had a glance at the shop.\n“There are more customers than expected.”\n“I think people are just hopping onto the bandwagon. Just join the long queue.”\n“Perhaps it is. Of course, there is…”\nMahiru then turned her eyes towards Aane.\n“…I think people will come in with eyes for a certain person. I overheard chatter outside that this seems to be the case.”\n“Yeah, most of the students will come for you…”\n“…Amane-kun, I have lots to say to you after this festival ends.”\n“Sure, what are we talking about?”\n“Many things.”\nMahiru seemed displeased, and frowned as she tried to keep her emotions to herself. Amane felt that he might have stepped onto a landmine, so he hastily looked towards her eyes, only for her to avert.\nIt seemed she was not trying to convey her anger, but rather, she was bashful, for her face was red.\n“…Your attire is too sleazy.”\n“Ehhhh…you should get used to it. You had enough of it during practice, right?”\n“I cannot do so. Your eyes towards me are different from when you look towards others.”\n“There’ll be trouble if it’s all the same…”\nIt was natural that his expression directed at his girlfriend would be different from one directed at the customer. No matter how cute the female customer was, he would serve her in the same manner.\nTruth be told, he did not think there was anyone cuter than Mahiru before him. To him, the bashful, pouting expression shown only to him was more adorable than anything else in the world.\n“You do not understand, Amane-kun…I shall not hand you over even if others see how good you are.”\nMahiru suddenly changed topics, and Amane was confused as to what this was about. She did not continue on however, and hammered at his chest, as though venting away.\n“You said you’re not going to flirt.”\n“It wasn’t on purpose.”\n“So you say.”",

      "content": "During the period Mahiru was being the waitress, what worried Amane most was not her captivating looks.\nNeither was it when people would harass her for her beauty and try to converse.\nThe most worrying was when someone would try to impose one of Man’s three great desires upon her.\nIt happened at noon, ten minutes before their shift ended.\nA male customer had been eyeing the female workers the moment he entered. It was not uncommon as there were pretty girls serving them.\nHowever, Amane saw that the customer was sizing them up, and had a feeling that he had to keep an eye out.\nHe served the dish, took the tray, and was about to head for the counter…when the customer reached out for Mahiru.\nMahiru had just served the man some food, and turned back. It happened right at that moment, and of course, she could not see what went on behind him.\nThe customer reached for the waist beneath the skirt, no, the buttocks. Amane took a step forward.\nAmane had been nearby, and the customer was slow, which was why Amane had a chance to reach out.\n“Dear customer, please do not casually touch our staff.”\nHe slid the tray between Mahiru and the customer’s hand, before the latter could touch, and reminded with a calm expression.\nCalm as he might appear, it was the opposite within. He was a little miffed that his cute girlfriend was being wooed, and he was further incensed about this act of sexual harassment.\nMahiru turned around once she heard that. She determined what the customer intended to do as the tray blocked the hand, and her cheeks shuddered as she took a step back.\nAmane strafed to protect Mahiru, and did his best to show a tender smile.\nThe shop quietened down unwittingly. Amane sensed the stares upon him, but he was so furious, he did not care.\nAt the same time, he remained calm.\nThe customer failed in his attempt, and could possibly excuse himself.\nThe surrounding customers might have noticed so, for they were staring at the hand. The customer however did not do anything, and Amane could only let it be if he said it was a coincidence.\nThe customer did not commit the cardinal sin of touching Mahiru, but Amane noticed something the former could not absolve himself of.\n“Dear customer, may I know where your entrance permit is?”\nThe sudden change of topic caused the man to widen his eyes.\n“And also…how did you enter? You are not wearing the band indicating your entrance permit.”\nAll visitors entering this school had to wear a band indicating that they were allowed into the school. It was a one time use, but was extremely sturdy.\nThere were dangerous cases and thefts in recent years. Thus, the students needed to wear a band indicating their names on their necks during this cultural festival, colors differing by year. Ordinary visitors had to wear a band.\nThe school imposed restricted access to certain areas, a measure to prevent visitors from entering.\nU-uh, it caught water, and\nbroke\n, the man was speechless once this was pointed out, and Amane chuckled.\n“How strange. The band is waterproof since there is a likelihood of sweat. The pamphlet did mention that if you lost your band, you may register at the main office. Which student from which class requested for your permit? You should be able to answer so, no?”\n“W-well.”\n“…Enough nonsense.”\nAmane stopped smiling, and turned towards the staff that was observing.\n“Sorry, may someone please call for the student council or a teacher? I don’t think it’s good to have an unwelcomed outsider loitering around.”\n“Already done. Our patrolling homeroom teacher is coming here.”\n“Good work.”\nAmane heaved a sigh of relief as Kadowaki had quickly responded and acted swiftly. He shrugged, sorted his attitude, and turned to smile at the man who failed to molest.\nNaturally, Amane knew that his eyes were not smiling.\n“Dear customer, the issue at hand is not the act, but the matter of an outsider entering without permit. Apologies, but the people at the main office shall question you.”\nAmane calmly narrated what would happen to this man, and the homeroom teacher arrived, and went to the man. Amane pulled Mahiru back by the arm, and sighed.\nThe pervert’s failed attempt might be reported too, and he probably would be expulled. It was amazing that he did not know why a permit had to be requested.\nThere would be records of which student invited whom during the request phase, and thus they would invite those whose identities were ascertained. They could trace someone if the matter was out of hand, and the student who invited the man might be slightly punished; hardly anyone would do anything illogical.\nWooing was still a grey area, and they would not be warned if they were not harrassed.\nAmane was curious as to how the man got in, but the main office probably would interrogate further. Perhaps in the coming year, or even tomorrow, all personnels had to wear a band before entering.\nThe man said something, but it had nothing to do with Amane, so the latter ignored it.\nAmane saw the man leave the classroom with the homeroom teacher, and acted as though nothing happened as he smiled at the customers looking at him.\n“Dear customers, apologies for the disturbance. Please continue to enjoy your meals.”\nHe bowed gracefully, and the other staff members followed soon, clearly indicating that the ruckus ended at this point.\nOnce he heard chatter like before, he quietly held Mahiru’s hand next to him, and pulled her to the back.\n“Eh, A-Amane-kun?”\n“Our shift’s ending soon, so go a rest. Wait inside. I’ll get changed with you later.”\nAmane felt it was fine as he had a look at the surrounding classmates, who waved their hands, basically shooing him away. He lowered his head slightly, brought Mahiru to the back, and had her sit on the chair.\nShe remained a little dumbfounded, probably still shocked by the prior events, so Amane patted her head. Nevertheless, it was not good for two to leave their positions, even though it was near the end of their shift, so he returned to the shop once again.\nHe went to the back once it was time for a changeover. Mahiru silently waited as she sat on the chair formally, holding a paper cup of coffee. A concerned student probably served this to soothe her.\nShe seemed relieved once she noticed Amane’s return, and her eyes softened. Once he saw that, Amane too eased his expression.\n“Welcome back.”\n“I’m back. You feeling better?’\n“…There is no need for everyone to worry.”\n“Normally speaking, we will be.”\nAmane pulled her here given that she looked a little rattled. He felt he made the right decision.\nHe patted her head once again after seeing her look a little displeased. She lowered her eyes bashfully, and tried to brush it off by drinking coffee.\nOnce he was sure the paper cup was empty, Amane took his parka, which he had placed at the back, and put it on Mahiru’s lap.\nThe school’s air conditioning regulated the temperature, but many wore coats as it was getting a little chilly. He brought it for Mahiru to wear, however.\n“Put it on. You’ll stand out too much in those clothes.”\nThere would be stares on her if she wore a maid uniform, and photos were allowed outside. Amane prepared this so as to not cause unnecessary mayhem.\nConsidering the difference in height, the clothes could reach the thighs, and she would not stand out if she removed her apron and headpiece. She already stood out to begin with, and it was to be expected that her beautiful face would attract many gazes.\nShe removed her apron, obediently put on the parka that was handed to her, and buttoned the front. One could sense that she was feeling better.\nShe frantically rolled her overly long sleeves, and even pulled her nose towards it, blew her nose, and smiled. Amane hoped she would stop. That dazzling smile was bad for his heart.\nItsuki, who was working the afternoon shift, seemed to have noticed it, for he sorted his tie and leered away. Amane frowned hard, and the leer grew.\nAmane felt that he lost something, and was increasingly displeased. Mahiru blinked away, and smiled. Left with no choice, Amane could only take their stares.\nHowever, Amane did not want to be basking under their stares, so he took his bag containing his uniform from the locker in the back. All he had to do was to remove his jacket and waistcoat, put them into the locker, and he would not stand out even if he walked down the corridor.\nMahiru too knew that he was going to change, so she stood up, stored the apron and headdress into the locker, and took out her school uniform.\n“We’re out. Leaving the rest to you guys.”\n“Alrighty, flirt all you want.”\n“Shut up. Don’t flirt around in the shop.”\nAmane frowned again once he heard this casual answer, but Mahiru held his hand, and it would be bad on him to give an ugly look. He gave an indescribably contorted look as he left the classroom along with Mahiru.\nThey walked down the corridor, and saw that it was buzzing out there. Even though visitors had to request for entry, there were a lot of them. The corridor was usually not this noisy, and it felt so jarring, but that was to be expected.\n“There’s a lot of them.”\n“I heard there are more visitors compared to past years.”\n“It’s no wonder suspicious people got past the security when there’s so many people here.”\nThe cultural festival of this school was a lot fancier and grander in scale compared to others, which was why many external parties wanted to visit.\nSuspicious people,\nMahiru lowered her eyes once she heard so. Amane realized that he misspoke, and he exerted a little more strength in his palm.\n“…You alright?”\n“I-I am fine. It shocked me, but luckily he failed.”\nIt seemed Mahiru had noticed Amane’s worry, for she hastily shook her head. She would not give such a look however if she was really fine.\n“Sorry, I should have been more careful.”\n“But you were busy. It was simply because I was too careless…”\n“Careless or not, such guys will always be on the prowl. That’s why we have to pay attention and stop these guys.”\nShe might be more wary, but there were some instances that would simply occur. After all, there was no stopping these molesters.\nShe seemed to be blaming herself for being careless, but anyone could have done it if they wanted to. She did not do anything wrong.\n“You didn’t go anything wrong. The weird ones are those who think that those with pretty faces and nice bodies deserve it for being too attractive. Anyone should be respected, no matter their genders.”\n“…Yes.”\n“So don’t say it like it’s your fault.”\nAmane muttered, and Mahiru lowered her eyes, looking a little perturbed, before she leaned onto his arm.\n“…You never touched me much, Amane-kun. I do not wish to be touched by anyone else.”\nMahiru shivered as she whispered, and Amane held her hand again to encourage her.\nThey did this while walking, so the surrounding stares were vexing, but everyone in school knew that the Angel was dating, so it did not matter. Amane was uncomfortable to be looked at, but he started to get used to it.\n“Not much? I don’t remember doing anything like that.”\n“You do occasionally cling onto me when I wake you up.”\n“Can you please don’t remind me now? I’m not a pervert, you know?”\nAmane inadvertently looked towards Mahiru when the shocking truth was revealed, and sensed that some life was creeping back onto her devastated face, for she gave an impish smile.\n“I do not think you are a pervert to touch your girlfriend’s body.”\n“So you say…”\n“I do not mind.”\n“Don’t pamper me. I’ll do it.”\n“Are you not wanting to now?”\n“I’m a guy. Of course I’ll want to, but it’s too early.”\nOf course, Amane had his own desire to touch, but he knew how fragile a male’s sanity was, so he made sure not to touch too much.\nHe also knew very well that Mahiru would not dislike it, and instead would like to be touched. She said that sharing the warmth was a comfortable feeling, and said that she would feel blissful to be touched.\nBut if he really could do so, he might overdo it, so he had to endure.\nMahiru might have noticed what Amane was thinking while the latter looked aside, for she giggled, and firmly latched onto his arm.\n“Please understand that I do not mind.”\n“…I know that.”\nHe knew she was agreeable to this as she liked him, but his heart was besiege as she said so once again.\nHe quietly swore to himself to touch all he want when he could bear responsibility. He saw her smiling happily next to him, and rubbed his palm upon hers.",

      "content": "They got changed, kept the clothes in the classroom locker, and strolled around, wanting to enjoy the festival together.\nA while had passed since lunch, but the setup food stalls remained bustling. Many students would change shifts at this point, and the customers might increase in numbers.\nAmane was worn out as he was not used to serving customers, and hungry. He went around wanting to get something to eat…and as expected, Mahiru really stood out.\nWow, it’s that maid,\nsuch chatter could be heard from time to time. One could say that the class shop was doing well, and there were a lot of visitors.\nAmane was a little uncomfortable with this, and Mahiru seemed to have given up, or rather, used to it, for she ignored her surroundings. Amane thus decided not to mind too much.\n“What do you want to eat, Mahiru?”\n“Hmm, I guess I will prefer something that I do not usually eat.”\n“I don’t know what you don’t usually eat…yakisoba maybe? Or takoyaki?”\nWhile Mahiru did cook yakisoba before, she did not like food that were too heavily flavored, and if she were to, she would either make it salted flavored or ankake. Takoyaki was even more unlikely as they did not have the machine.\nMahiru hardly ate outside, and did not know much of food sold at such events.\nIt was a rare chance for them, so Amane decided to go for the sauce flavored yakisoba they hardly ate. He went to a class selling them, only to hear a familiar voice on his way there.\nIt came from the stairs leading to the roof. Amane had assumed it would be locked as he went up the stairs, looked at the landing…and spotted a classmate he had been chatting with reently.\n“Eh, Fujimiya-kun? Shiina-san?”\nKido called their names incredulously, and Amane blinked away.\nIt was not shocking for her to be here, as there was no place to actually sit around in school…but Amane was shocked by her posture.\nA boy was next to Kido, chomping down on yakisoba. She leaned on him, her hand lifting his chin, as though she did not want him to drop the yakisoba.\n“…What are you doing here?”\n“Eh, it’s obvious, isn’t it? Lunch, lunch. Come on Socchan, this is the Fujimiya-kun I talked about.”\n“Nm.”\nThe boy’s voice sounded vague as he had not finished chewing; he looked up at Amame, and swallowed…perhaps he was too impatient, for he frowned, and slapped his own chest.\nYour fault for not chewing properly,\nit seemed Kido had expected so, and handed him a PET bottle of tea.\nShe had uncapped it beforehand, and the boy immediately drank it down.\nHe downed a third of it or so, and the choked item might have fallen down, for he looked relieved. Using a wet tissue, Kido wiped his mouth, which was full of the yakisoba sauce, and the tissue turned brown.\nYou mind not treating me as a kid?\nThe boy looked a little displeased after his mouth was wiped, but Kido continued to wipe with a smile. One might assume their relationship was of sufficient mutual trust, for he looked gaudy, but did not refuse.\n“Eh, Kido’s boyfriend?”\n“Oh, correct. He’s my childhood friend and boyfriend. Come on Socchan, introduce yourself.”\n“You think I’m a kid who won’t do anything unless prompted…?”\n“Well it’s because you’re shy. Come on, he’s not a bad person.”\n“You wouldn’t introduce him to me if he’s a bad person…I’m Souji Kayano.”\nHe lowered his head, and Kido patted his head as though praising him, only for him to shake it off.\nKido did not seem to mind at all, but this might be because of habit. In a certain sense, Amane was impressed with Kido’s feisty spirit, and looked towards Kayano.\nAll he knew from Kido beforehand was that her boyfriend had amazing muscles. Amane had assumed he would be more physically imposing…in fact, though he looked taller than Amane, he did not look impressive beyond the uniform. Instead, it was Hiiragi who looked muscular.\nAmane gazed discreetly while trying not to be rude, and Kido seemed to have noticed Amane’s eyes, for she laughed jokingly.\n“Socchan’s amazing when he strips.”\n“A-amazing when he strips…?”\n“Yep, Shiina-san, my boyfriend’s amazing. Ufufu.”\nKido leered for some strange reason. Amane felt it might be better for Mahiru not to hear, but the one interrupting was Kayano.\n“Alright, stop boasting. It’s embarrassing…say, what did you say when I wasn’t around? Boasting about muscles again?”\n“I said my boyfriend’s muscles are amazing.”\n“Please stop it already…there’s nothing to boast.”\n“There is something to boast! Yours are the best to me!”\n“What? Weren’t you salivating watching the bodybuilding special episodes that had been airing on TV recently…?”\n“Ahh, that’s just some occasional snack…you’re my favorite main dish, Soochan. I can’t do without you! You’re special!”\nKido said it so earnestly, and Amane was so focused on the bodybuilding special that he omitted the flirty words before him.\nShe really likes muscles huh…I don’t get her world\n.\nTruth be told, Mahiru had a smell fetish, and Amane had a feeling that she could get along really well with Kido. However, he might feel conflicted hearing about what they liked about their boyfriends, and if possible, he hoped they would not talk about it before the ones they were talking about.\nHe was astounded in many ways, took a step back, and observed Kido. Kayano might have noticed what Amane was thinking, and clearly looked dumbfounded as he slapped hard at the back of Kido’s head.\n“Enough already. You’re scaring him.”\n“It’s because you said something weird, Socchan.”\n“…I apologize for our Ayaka here.”\n“You’re blaming me!?”\nKido gave Kayano a look that clearly showed that she disagreed, but it seemed they were just fooling around.\nSay, you\n, she pouted her lips, and appeared to be reproaching Kayano while nonchalantly touching his muscles. Amane was left gobsmacked at this sight.\nKayano did not look displeased, and left Kido be, for they seemed to have done so every day. He lowered his head towards Amane, who in turn inadvertently lowered his head.\nMahiru, who had been silent the entire time, seemed to be considering something. For some reason, she suddenly clung onto Amane, and gently caressed his tummy.\n“…Amane-kun is amazing too when he strips.”\n“No need to fight over that. And I don’t have much. I’m not the type to gain much muscle.”\n“It is sufficient for me.”\nIt seemed Mahiru remembered about the bath, for she blushed as she touched Amane, who naturally showed a wry smile, wondering how it turned out this way.",

      "content": "“Anyway, have you two eaten?”\nAmane was coaxing Mahiru when Kido suddenly thought of something.\nThey were in the same shift, and were out at the same time. Kido quickly got changed and got out as she had her boyfriend waiting however, and her classmates in the same shift probably would not have the time to eat this early.\n“Nope, we’re about to buy some yakisoba.”\n“Ah, yakisoba? This is good. Socchan’s class did this.”\nSocchan ate most of it though\n, Kido giggled,\nyou’re the one who forced me to eat more,\nand Kayano retorted so.\n“Anyway, that’s how it is. Here, since you want yakisoba.”\nShe smiled, and gave Mahiru a voucher listing a hundred yen discount on it.\n“It’s a promo for internal use, and Socchan says he can give this to those he’s more familiar with…can I?”\n“Just give if you want to. It’s not going to affect our sales anyway.”\n“Yippee!”\nKido grinned and handed over two vouchers. Amane felt grateful and sorry for this, and looked towards her face once again, finding her beaming away.\n“Ah, don’t mind. We’re sick and tired of eating yakisoba now. We won’t be using this again. Actually, I want some sausage instead.”\nProteins are better than\ncarbs, so she chuckled. Amane felt that a sausage would have more fat, but he did not mention so,\nthanks,\nhe answered sincerely, and decided to use it.\n“Thank you Kido-san. I shall repay you one day.”\n“Ah, don’t worry, I’m not doing this as a favor…ah yes, Shiina-san, Shiina-san.”\n“Hm?”\n“How are Fujimiya-kun’s muscles?”\nAmane was wondering why she was making such a serious face, and was dumbfounded by whatever she said. Mahiru in turn blinked a few times, and started panicking for some reason.\n“N-no, Amane-kun belongs to me.”\n“Woah, how cute. Relax, I love Socchan most though? I’m just a little curious.”\n“You still have eyes for others?”\n“Th-that’s not true! Trust me Socchan!”\nKido too started flailing her hands, but it seemed she knew Kayano was half joking, for she clearly puffed her cheeks.\nSocchan no baka,\nshe muttered with a sweet voice, and then showed a genial smile towards a somewhat wary Mahiru.\n“I don’t mean that. Since you have such fine ingredients…well, I just want to help out in training him…otherwise it’ll be a pity? Fujimiya-kun’s so tall and thin, it’ll be better if he gain more muscles.”\n“…I will be in trouble if he is more dashing.”\n“Ah, he performed well today. His popularity might skyrocket.”\nKido seemed to have understood so, for she nodded away, and Mahiru pursed her lips.\nAmane wondered if he should be elated that Mahiru and Kido were getting along well, or that he should retort that Mahiru was being strangely jealous.\nHe probably would not be as popular as she was worried about. If any girl was to approach him after he dressed himself well, they would have lots of chances to do so. Of course, they could not open his heart however.\nThere were lots of people who were more handsome than Amane, and he did not think he was as handsome as she assumed.\nHe gave a wry smile once he saw how worried she was, and ruffled her hair.\n“Relax, I’m only interested in you, and if any girl likes me, she’s just getting in the way of our happy relationship. I won’t fall for her.”\n“…I do find it unbearable though.”\n“It’s normal. I feel the same too. Anyway, you don’t have to be that worried. It’s fine.”\n“…I do think you do not understand…”\nAmane wanted Mahiru to relax, but she frowned unhappily for some reason. While he remained confused,\nyou really have it tough too, Shiina-san,\nKido teased.",

      "content": "Once they received the discount tickets from Kido and Kayano, Amane and Mahiru left, hurriedly bought their yakisoba, and went to the backyard to eat.\nThere was no space available at the designated rest area, and they could not stay for long in the waiting room. By elimination, the backyard was the only available location, so they arrived.\nThere were a few students there, but as outsiders were not allowed in, there was space for them to eat.\nAmane laid out a towel for Mahiru to sit, and sat on a bench under the shade, straightening his back as much as he could.\n“Seriously, there’s too many people around, and I can’t calm down.”\n“Fufu, you do prefer quieter places after all, Amane-kun.”\n“And I hate it when people just keep ogling you. It feels like I lost twice.”\n“It is not that bad…”\n“It is, for my sanity.”\nAmane endured so as it was unavoidable, but he was quietly peeved. Mahiru was in her school uniform, and there were fewer surrounding stares compared to when she was in her maid outfit, but pretty girls still would stand out.\nMahiru had given up and got used to it, so Amane really had nothing more to say, except to grumble a few words.\nMahiru might have understood this, for she gave a perturbed, wry smile, patting Amane’s head to coax him. Amane took it, and sighed.\n“There’ll be more people tomorrow. People have rave reviews about our shop, and we’ll be in the afternoon shift.”\n“We shall have to hang on until then…speaking of which, what about Shihoko-san and Shuuto-san?”\nThey did mention in their excitement that they wanted to see Amane and the others in such clothing, but they were nowhere to be seen, so it seemed Mahiru was confused. Amane scratched his cheek, shrugged, and said,\n“They said they took leave, and will be here tomorrow. Two days.”\n“Really!?”\n“Why are you so happy?”\n“Shuuto-san promised that he will teach me how to cook with that motherly taste. I did not expect the opportunity to arrive so soon.”\n“Guys have a motherly taste…well, I guess I’m more used to dad’s cooking.”\nShihoko and Shuuto would take turns deciding on who to cook, and they split duties. Amane was very familiar with their styles, but Shihoko’s dishes were more masculine in taste, servings and ingredients, so while it was home cooking, it did not feel like it.\nShuuto’s culinary skills were better, delicate, and more comforting. One would say his cooking were more suited to be called home cooking.\nHowever, Mahiru’s culinary skills were supreme to begin with, and there was no need for her to learn…it seemed she was very motivated, for she was concerned about learning the Fujimiyas’ style of home cooking.\n“I’m happy with your cooking, you know?”\n“These are two separate matters. I wish to cook for you when you wish to eat.”\n“I see…well, I feel that your cooking is kind of like ours. You don’t have to force yourself to learn.”\n“……And you carelessly blurted out these words.”\nOne day, or rather, at this point, Amane’s stomach was taken captive by her cooking. He knew he could get good dishes from her every day, and her cooking was undoubtedly his family’s. It was one beloning only to them, distinct from the Fujimiyas.\nIt was not the season of bloom, but her face bloomed like the cherry blossoms. She took the used wet wet tissue, and used it on Amane, wanting him to have the same color.\nAmane saw that the yakisoba on the lap was about to fall, so he moved them aside, and patted her head.\nHer hair formed a gentle gradient as she had tied it the entire morning. The hair was loosened, and so her face ballooned.\n“…Do you assume that you can fool me through headpats?”\n“No, but I think you’ll be happy.”\n“This is no good either.”\nShe pretended to be aloof, but her face was wrecked by redness. Amane quietly chuckled as he gently patted her head, combing her hair.",

      "content": "After lunch, Amane and Mahiru toured around the school again. There were often voices and stares as they went on, and it seemed to have tired Mahiru out.\nPart of the reason for the attention was that they held hands to avoid getting lost, but it seemed Mahiru did not want to let go. Her fingers were wrapped gently yet firmly on his, indicating that she did not want to let go.\nWhenever a passing classmate in his first year gossiped from time to time, Amane would look at Mahiru, who would smile elegantly and lean her body over. She probably did not intend to distance herself, and was clearly indicating her intent.\n…Well, doesn’t matter. The whole school knows that we’re dating.\nIt was likely the entire school knew that Mahiru was dating Amane. She had declared Amane to be the most important person to her during the sports festival, and after a weekend, they announced that they were officially dating.\nMahiru’s fame was far beyond their school year, so the seniors and juniors knew, and news spread fast. The boys were really distraught, and Amane was questioned by unfamiliar seniors without Mahiru knowing.\nBut when Mahiru heard of such news from other classmates, she finished them off with a smile.\nThey went through such incidents, and at this point, no boy would naively think that they had a chance. Even without declaring outright, it was obvious when they walked alongside each other.\nIt seemed Mahiru had some plan however, and did not leave his side. She continued to cling onto Amane even though the student left.\n“…Something wrong?”\n“…You are very stylish now, Amane-kun.”\n“How so?”\n“The hair, and your disposition.”\n“…The hair’s because of the cafe though.”\n“So I say.”\n“I don’t really get you…”\nIf he could be popular just from a change of hairstyle, that would have happened when he started dating Mahiru, and there was no reason for her to cling onto him. Personally, he was glad to have her cling onto him, but he hoped she would ease off a little during their intimate contact.\nHe however let her be, for she was willing to do so. It was to be expected that he found it slightly unbearable.\nMahiru’s being more enthusiastic than before\n, Amane avoided reality and the surrounding gazes as he slowly strolled through the school.\nHe checked on the itinerary every class had from the distributed pamplhet, but Mahiru walked before him, as though leading him to a haunted house.\n…I remember Mahiru’s bad with horror though.\nThere were times when Amane watched a horror flick, and Mahiru would hold his hand, looking all pale, yet acting tough. The words she said were incongruent with her expression, and it seemed she could not take such stuff.\nHowever, the haunted houses created by students were within budget, and clearly would not be as intricate as those created on TV. Perhaps she was fine with that.\n“You really want to go to the haunted house?”\n“Eh?”\nMahiru immediately stopped, and timidly lifted her head at Amane, clearly showing that she had not thought about it. It seemed she was just wandering around, and was not thinking too much.\nThe rigid expression she showed was akin to a creaky machine, her eyes wavered around, and clearly she had no intention to visit a haunted house.\n“…I-I do not intend to.”\n“I thought you want to go. Guess there’s no way since you’re scared of this.”\n“…I am not scared.”\n“Look into my eyes and tell me that. Why are you looking away?”\nMahiru tried to pull a fast one, probably because she did not really wish to reveal her weakness, but her attitude and expression explained all. Amane was not so naive to believe her when she clearly was looking flustered.\nThere’s nothing to be embarrassed about having a phobia of scary stuff, right?\nInstead, he found that cute, but she seemed unwilling.\nIt seemed Mahiru realized that Amane was enjoying himself, for she looked up at him with a somewhat displeased look. Her eyes were slightly moist and lifeless however, probably because the shock had yet to fade away.\n“I am not scared. I shall visit the haunted house.”\n“Not scared huh? Shall we watch a horror movie next time?”\n“…I-I am more than glad to.”\n“Your voice is shaking this much.”\nAmane intended that to be a joke, but Mahiru stubbornly agreed, which left him conflicted.\n“…You’re putting up a front. I don’t care if you can’t sleep alone.”\n“I am not, and just in case…I shall have you bear responsibility.”\n“…The living’s scarier than the dead.”\n“You are not scary at all, Amane-kun. We slept together a few times after all.”\nMahiru leaned onto Amane’s arm, looking up at him. He gently shushed her mouth with his finger, and sighed.\nIt was true that Mahiru once slept overnight at his place before they actually dated, and days ago, she stayed over at his place for the first time after they officially began dating. In a certain sense, they did spend nights together.\nHowever, these words would cause much misunderstanding, and the surrounding students started buzzing. They did not have that sort of relationship yet, and he felt conflicted to be misunderstood.\n“…It sounds like you’re inviting me out.”\n“Please do not misunderstand in a strange manner. You are inviting me out now.”\n“I don’t mean anything else. I just want to see you shiver.”\n“You do mean something else after all.”\nMahiru started jabbing at his waist, and he grabbed her hand to stop her.\nPerhaps she was delighted to have her hand held, for her displeased face became tender. He smiled back, and raised her hand.\nOf course, they were headed to the haunted house.\n“…Erm?”\n“You said it before, didn’t you. A woman does not need to be told twice.”\nHe remembered her saying so when she stayed over.\nSince she declared these words that were supposedly said by men, she surely would not regret this.\n“I-I did say so…ho-how mean…”\nMahiru fidgeted, and looked towards Amane with moist eyes. Amane chuckled, and led her by the hand towards the haunted house without hesitation.\nAmane decided to preserve Mahiru’s honor, and not inform Chitose and the others that Mahiru clung onto him the entire time they were in the haunted house.",

      "content": "They left the haunted house, and Mahiru seemed a little worn out from fear, so he supported her by her back as they went to the rest room. He then noticed a familiar silhouette, and could not help but blurt out.\n“…Daiki-san?”\nHe did not have a deep impression of the man, so he timidly went to the man’s back, and greeted him. The man turned his head around, his back still straightened.\nAmane heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing the face identical to the one in his memories, knowing that he did not identify the wrong person. He too straightened his back. Next to him, Mahiru looked up at Amane in confusion,\nhe’s Itsuki’s dad,\nso Amane explained quietly to her, without the man hearing.\n“It has been a while. I know it might be hard to recognize me because of my hairstyle change, but I’m Fujimiya.”\nItsuki’s father, the man called Daiki, sized up Amane’s face, and the somewhat unwelcoming face eased slightly.\n“Ah Fujimiya-kun? You look different.”\n“Ahaha. Well, I used to be gloomy.”\n“I don’t mean that…I mean it’s great that you’re showing self-confidence on your face. You don’t have to be so humble.”\nItsuki often complained about his father for being naggy, but Daiki seemed fond of Amane, and took the latter’s change positively.\nAmane too felt that Daiki was a little rigid when talking about his son, but aside from that, he was normal, and kind, and Amane definitely did not think it was a chore to chat. Truth be told, Daiki was a nice person to talk to.\nThe words and expression of praise left Amane a little awkward, and Daiki turned towards Mahiru.\n“And this pretty lady is?”\n“Ahh, erm, the girl I’m dating now.”\nAmane’s introduction of her was a little strange as he had yet to grasp the distance between him and Daiki. It was to be expected that there would be some difficulty in meeting a friend’s parents.\nHe could sense her freezing up due to embarrassment and awkwardness, but she showed an angelic smile as she bowed gently.\nDaiki was a stranger to Mahiru, so she acted as though he was a stranger. Given his personality, this was the appropriate reaction.\n“Nice to meet you, I am Mahiru Shiina. I am dating Amane-kun now, as he has introduced.”\n“How courteous of you. I am Itsuki’s father, Daiki Akazawa.”\nDaiki too bowed formally, and glanced aside at Amane.\nThat’s impressive of\nyou, so Amane sensed from the look, but he played dumb and responded with a genial smile.\n“I see…well, I didn’t expect you to be dating a girl now, Fujimiya-kun. It shocked me since I haven’t heard anything about it.”\n“Nothing from Itsuki?”\n“Maybe he’s in the rebellious phase, but he’s ignoring me. Perhaps he thinks there is nothing to talk to me about.”\n“Hm, maybe he doesn’t deem it necessary to talk about how his friend has fallen in love.”\nItsuki’s still on bad terms with his dad huh?\nso he thought, and nearly sighed, but he kept it to himself.\n“You are going out with Fujimiya-kun…I suppose my embarrassing son has been in your care. You really have it tough.”\n“No, I have been under his care.”\n“You say so, but he has been troubling you.”\n“No no. He really has been considerate for my sake, and I am often assisted by him. I hope to continue this friendship with Akazawa-san.”\nHe’s a busybody sometimes though,\nAmane resisted the urge to retort, while Daiki marveled.\n“…It is great that you found such a wonderful lady, Fujimiya-kun.”\n“Well, our Mahiru’s a good girl.”\n“E-enough with the jokes for now…”\nMahiru probably did not expect Amane to praise her in front of her friend’s father, and her white cheeks were clearly red.\nShe lowered her eyes bashfully, and nonchalantly slapped Amane in the back without Daiki noticing. Amane quietly gave a wry smile. It was not too forceful, not painful or ticklish, but he curled his lips, for he had the urge to laugh.\n“You two are on good terms, but you will blind those around you. It is something to rejoice over however.”\n“Sorry, we’ll take note. Anyway, are you visiting our class later?”\n“…No. I intended so…but well, I do not think I should enter such an atmosphere.”\n“Ahhh…”\nDaiki had no interest in service clothes, nor was he the type to profess interest in manga and games. It might be difficult for him to enter Amane’s classroom.\n“Do you want to visit with us? It’s our class, but I want to visit as a customer.”\n“…No, I shouldn’t be getting in your way. You have some free time as lovers now after all. And…she’s definitely in the classroom, no?”\n“…Yes.”\n“I don’t want her to feel awkward and lifeless after seeing me. I might say that she is rude if we do meet.”\nDaiki gave an awkward smile and Amane too frowned, but he did not ask further.\nAmane did not know much about the issues between Chitose and Daiki, but he knew the latter was not being malicious, that the latter rejected Chitose due to his own considerations.\nHe knew that, and yet hoped that their issues would be resolved. That was his thought as a friend.\n“Apologies for disturbing. I shall visit somewhere else.”\n“But…”\n“I don’t want to ruin the mood. Have fun.”\nDaiki then left before they could stop him, and Amane gently sighed.\n“…Does he still, have issues with, Chitose-san?”\n“Yeah…to be honest, Daiki-san isn’t a bad person. Some people are just incompatible, and his demands are a little higher. He’s not being malicious by demanding more of Chitose…and that’s why they just can’t get along.”\nDaiki would have acknowledged Chitose if he could.\nWhile it was not encouraged for parents to dictate who their children date, but it was understandable that they would hope their children would choose better partners.\nItsuki might not say so, but the Akazawas were well off, which was another reason for this stalemate.\n“It will be great if he acknowledges them. They hate it tough.”\n“Yes…they do match, and are on such good terms. I do feel sad to pull them apart…I really do not wish to do so.”\n“Yeah…I guess Daiki-san feels the same too, so he’s trying not to interfere. There’ll be a staleness until they relent and compromise.”\nAmane sighed once again, and Mahiru lowered her eyebrows reluctantly, leaning on Amane’s arm,\nif only we can do something for them,\nas she muttered so.",

      "content": "Amane bought some gifts that could be left for a while, and did as Daiki said as he went to his classroom to rest. There was a queue far longer than any other class.\nHe had an occasional look outside during his shift. It was hotter than it was in the morning, This might be due to the good reviews they had.\nIt was his class, but he was still a customer, so he queued obediently alongside Mahiru. His classmate hurriedly scanned through the namelist at the reception.\n“Ah, Fujimiya and the An…Shiina-san. You’re not here to help, right?”\n“Too bad we aren’t. I want to be a customer for once. Also to check on Itsuki and Chitose.”\n“They’re very lively now. Yeah, sorta.”\n“Why are you sounding so vague?”\n“I guess it’s because Itsuki’s look frivolous.”\n“That’s his signature.”\n“Hey.”\nItsuki’s cheerfulness and geniality was something everyone was used to, and his personality would not be erased completely unless something major happened. He would surely participate in such an event seriously, and exhibit his personality. That frivolous attitude was here to stay.\nSome students liked how frivolous he was, and he was relatively popular as a butler. After all, it was a student event, and they did not have to act as proper butlers.\n“Table for two? It will take a while.”\n“Can’t be helped when there’s so many people. We’ll wait…you fine with this Mahiru? Are you tired?”\n“I am fine. I-I was just worn out because of that, mentally…”\n“You’re the one who stubbornly entered.”\n“…I was not stubborn.”\nAmane saw the eyes avert him, and had the urge to bully her given how sheepish she was. However, she might pout if he overdid, and thus, he did not continue on.\nit’s a promise, we’re going to watch a horror movie,\ninstead, that was what he said. Mahiru faltered, and glared at Amane, who in turn played dumb this time.\nEven the reception boy next to them glared at Amane, and said,\ngo somewhere else.\nAmane however could do nothing about it, and evaded his eyes all the same.\nThis little interlude passed, and it was finally their turn. The duo followed the staff to their table…and Amane frowned lazily once he saw the two familiar faces before him.\nItsuki and Chitose were in charge as the receptionist had sounded the alarm, surely.\nThey were beaming, looking a lot more serious than usual. Their cheeks quivered slightly as Amane looked a little displeased.\nAmane saw from their expressions that their little prank worked, and his face and lips shook. Of course, he was cringing.\n“Welcome back. Sir, Madame.”\n“Oy Itsuki, that’s not what it says on the manual.”\nIt was a maid and butler cafe, but they were to address all visitors as ‘customers’. Amane’s face cringed once he heard them clearly addressing incorrectly.\nMahiru lowered her eyes bashfully, for it seemed the term Madame left her embarrassed.\n“No no no, there’s a page customized for you two in this top secret manual. It’s written there.”\n“Don’t reject reality and substitute it with your own.”\n“Alright alright. Have a seat here.”\nAmane gave a reproaching look, indicating that Itsuki should not give me some fancy, special treatment, but the latter ignored so.\nIt was pointless to say more, so Amane could only sit down begrudgingly.\nMahiru naturally sat on the sat Itsuki pulled out, and the elegance of her actions captivated Amane’s look.\nHad fun during your break?\nChitose giggled as she handled over the menu Amane had memorized, as per the manual.\n“Well, sort of. Got some places we haven’t visited. We’re planning to go there later.”\n“That’s good. I was hoping Mahirun would drop by to rest earlier.”\n“Really?”\n“Of course. Didn’t she say she want to go out?”\nAmane glanced aside at Mahiru,\na set A please,\nwho blushed a little as she tried to change the topic by ordering so.\nShe did not show much enthusiasm for the cultural festival at home, but it seemed she really looked forward to spending the time with Amane, in her own way.\nAmane smiled at the adorable Mahiru, swore that he would question her later, and ordered the same. Mahiru glared back, probably knowing what Amane was thinking, but she did not seem displeased, so he heaved a sigh of relief.\nFufu,\nonce she heard that, Chitose showed no attempt to hide her glee, and went to place the order at the counter. Amane then remembered to hand over a bag of donuts, which was on his lap, to Itsuki.\nEach donut was mouth-sized, fried in a round shape. One could use it as a snack during their breaks, and it could be shared with the other staff.\n“Oh yeah, this is from another class. Just a reward for you guys, get them to eat while having their breaks.”\n“Oh, thanks thanks!”\n“I just thought of buying it, so go ahead. If they want to thank, they should be thanking the guy who’s being like a butler…”\n“Thank you for your graciousness milord…”\n“Forget about it, and stop with that play.”\nI’m hungry after lunch,\nAmane chuckled at the annoyingly cheerful Itsuki, and felt apologetic about what he would say, for this might affect the latter’s mood.\n“Say Itsuki.”\n“Hm?”\n“I met Daiki-san.”\nIt was obvious that Itsuki froze up upon hearing that.\nAmane said it at this point as he did not wish to tell Itsuki with Chitose present, but this might affect Itsuki’s motivation. He did not want to say anything.\n“Ah, he didn’t say anything about Chitose. I’m just reporting in. He said it’s inconvenient for him to be here, so he went elsewhere.”\n“Ah…yeah, dad doesn’t really come to this place, and it’ll leave Chii awkward. Maybe it’s better for him not to come by.”\nI never heard him say that he’ll be here,\nso Itsuki shrugged and muttered.\n“I’ll ask when I get home. I doubt he’ll be looking for me today.”\nHe gave an inscrutable smile, held the gift in one hand, and went to the counter. Amane sighed.\n…If only things go well.\nIt might not be easy, and it might be slow, but it would be great if this would eliminate the friction between them, so Amane prayed.",

      "content": "The matter about Daiki left both Amane and Mahiru a little depressed when Chitose served their food, and she quizzed once she saw their faces.\n“Eh, what’s with you two? Had an argument?’\n“You think we will?”\n“Normally speaking, there’ll be quarrels even in love…but I can’t deny what you said since you two are willing to listen to each other. It’s amazing.”\nChitose sounded dumbfounded and yet impressed as she praised them, but Amane did not think it was anything weird.\nMahiru was usually gentle, magnanimous, and hardly got angry, only doing so for others. Even if it was the case, hardly anything would rile her, given her personality.\nIf he really argued with Mahiru, the fault would usually be on him, who angered her, and even then, it would become a discussion over where the problem was, why she was angry, and how they should resolve this.\nAmane had never gotten to this point with her, and if he did, he would apologize profusely.\nThus, they hardly argued.\nIt was the same for Mahiru, who seemed numb to the concept of arguing as her caramel colored eyes blinked away. It resonated with Amane’s thoughts, and the latter chuckled.\nShe never was furious at Amane.\nShe lashed out once at him when he was down on himself, but she was critical of him, rather than furious, and only did so for his sake.\n“I say, we aren’t arguing. We’re just frustrated by something. Don’t know what to do.”\n“Oh, it’s good that you aren’t arguing. Your parents aren’t coming, Amane?”\nAmane froze the moment he heard the word parents; Chitose closed in on him, not noticing his gestures.\nIt seemed she had completely forgotten about Daiki, and he was relieved.\n“Well, Mahirun said that your mom will really get along with me, so I’m curious. Just want to say hello to your mom.”\n“More than get along, I guess. You two are so similar that Mahiru will be the victim of your antics.”\nThey loved cute things, were aggressive with their skinship, and really loved Mahiru. These were the three similarities they had, and it was likely they would dote on Mahiru so much, she would become their plaything.\nIt seemed Mahiru easily imagined that sight, for her lips twitched, and Amane pretended not to notice.\nThey’re going to shove a bunch of clothes onto you, or go for some skinship. Do your best.\nIf there was any consolation, it was that they would not hurt Mahiru. The latter gave Amane a pleading look for help, but Amane alone could not deal with this, and could only pray that she could hang on.\n“Anyway, that’s enough. You sure it’s fine for you not to go back?”\n“Woah really, Makochin’s glaring here~”\nTheir classmate Kuju seemed to have some choice words for Chitose as he looked over, and it was inappropriate for her to keep chatting.\nChitose stuck her tongue in apology, and was met with a cold look from Kuju. Amane prompted Chitose to hurry back to work.\nHe saw her back as she reluctantly returned to work, and sigh.\n“I can only support you mentally. Do your best.”\n“You seem rather hands off.”\n“Actually, I’m not going to stop those two passionate idiots. Do your best. If you really can’t handle them, just reject them outright.”\n“I-I do not mean that…er…I suppose they will put all kinds of onto me.”\n“I guess so.”\nShihoko loved to dote on Mahiru and dress her up, and she would be all the more enthusiastic with Chitose around. After all, Shihoko had taken Mahiru as her daughter, and would probably take the latter to fashion shops to try various clothes, and have her try them on. One could expect Chitose to join in enthusiastically.\nAmane could not forcibly stop Shihoko, for she wanted a daughter, and took a liking to Mahiru.\n“Well, if you’re willing to dress up, I don’t think I have to stop her.”\n“You know this means that I cannot refuse, no?”\n“Actually you can refuse them both. I’m more than glad to dress you up.”\nAmane did not actually have any clothes in mind, but he thought it would be fun to have her wear clothes he felt would be suitable to her.\n“…I do plan to dress up as you like, even without considering them.”\nMahiru softly muttered, and lowered her eyes bashfully.\nYou are the one I like, and I’ll like anything you wear.\nAmane was unable to say this however, and took a sip of coffee, smiling at how adorable she was.",

      "content": "Amane waited for the embarrassed Mahiru’s cheeks to calm down as he drank his coffee. Looking around him, he realized the impact a reputation would have on customers.\nThey prepared more seats than usual, but there were no empty seats available. It was the same during their customer, for there was an endless influx of customers, and it was packed full.\nTo be blunt, the most likely targets would have been Mahiru or Kadowaki, but there were lots of customers even during their breaks. Perhaps it was due to the clothes.\nYoung boys and girls were usually dressed in school uniforms, and it seemed the sight of them in service clothing were tantalizing to some.\nAs for Amane, he merely felt that it was something he was not used to.\nFor example, he never imagined Chitose to wear clothes that were used to service others.\nShe served the customers with a cheerful smile. Amane had a glance, and did not notice her being deft as befitting her clothes. However, her liveliness and approachable attitude were coupled with the short maid miniskirt, which seemed fine.\n“…Is there anything wrong with Chitose-san?”\nWhile Amane looked at Chitose and marveled at her positivity, Mahiru quizzed so, having successful stopped her embarassment it seemed.\n“It’s nothing…I didn’t feel anything when we’re working, but when I look at it now, our classmates aren’t exactly comfortable in these clothes. We should be at the point where we’re used to it.”\n“Fufu, we do hardly wear such clothes after all.”\n“It’s rare to see that many customers here too. They say we’re all cute and handsome, but well, it does suit us all.”\nThere were students and visitors, and most of them might be active staff from elsewhere. One could hear them squeeing away at who were the cute ones, who were the handsome ones.\nTheir passion was understandable, but the staff members could only give wry smiles given how loud they were.\nAmane glanced aside at the toiling staff, and then towards Mahiru. She seemed to be exerting more strength in her eyelashes.\n“What is it?”\n“Nothing…you do think they…the girls, are cute, no?”\n“Just normal.”\nAmane had an inkling of what Mahiru wanted to say, so he smiled, and hid his lips behind the joints of his fingers.\n“In terms of beauty and etiquette, I find them cute, but don’t worry. You’re the only one who makes me want to dote on for being cute.”\n“…A-Again with such words…”\n“Looks like you want me to explain. You’ll be jealous if I don’t say this.”\nThis time, Amane whispered so softly that others could not hear. She frowned, pursed her lips, and bashfully lowered her eyes again.\n“…I feel like a fool for being restless.”\n“You can check as many times as you want.”\n“I will be embarrassed though.”\n“I’ll dote on you again. You happy with that?”\n“Are you intending to kill me?”\n“That’s hyperbole.”\n“It is not. You are always torturing my heart…it causes me much burden.”\n“You hate it?”\n“Not that I do…but erm, please show some mercy.”\nMahiru’s shoulders shriveled, and Amane’s desire to tease her was piqued, but at the same time, he remembered that she might pout if he overdid. Some moderation would be fine.\nI’ll see\n, so he answered, but she glared back at him unhappy. It seemed he was not trusted on me.\n“…I shall retaliate if you bully me next time.”\n“Interesting.”\n“…I shall ignore you if you do so again.”\nMahiru turned her head aside, and she was so adorable that Amane chuckled. She then snatched his cookie unhappily, turning her head further aside.",

      "content": "There were too many people, and it was inappropriate for them to chat. Amane sought an opportunity to end the conversation, and left the cafe. He sighed, not knowing where to go.\nThe festival was open until 4pm. It would be half an hour until the day ended.\nThey would have to tally their sales revenue, report in, and prepare for the next day. Amane wanted to tour around once again before then, but they had visited the main attractions.\n“Anywhere else you want to go to?”\n“Actually…we have visited many places. Shall we have a look at the gym stage?”\n“Stage? What’s over there now?”\nThere were stage activities starting from the afternoon, and students volunteers would perform various shows. He remembered there were skits and performances.\nHe had a look at the pamphlet, and noticed the light music club was having a live show.\n“It’s a live show. Are you interested?”\n“I do not really listen to music. Perhaps I should use this chance to.”\n“Well yeah, you don’t really play BGM. Western music at most.”\nMahiru was aware of the current trends, but not music. In fact, she preferred the classical Western music to the trending Japanese music, out of personal likes.\nEven when there were some popular male idols who often appeared on TV, she could only match the faces and names.\n“Since you want to go, let’s do it. I’m rather curious myself.”\n“Yes.”\nThere are no shops they wish to visit, so Amane held Mahiru by the hand, and led her to the gym to kill time.\nMost of the lights were switched off, and the remaining ones shone upon the stage.\nThey could hear music outside, and it got a lot louder after they entered, which jolted them. Amane felt ticklish as he gently closed the door to avoid disturbing others, and quickly sat down at an empty space.\nHe lifted his head, and spotted the volunteer team singing on stage. There was one familiar face there, and Amane narrowed his eyes at that person.\nStanding before the microphone was the person he often saw since morning.\n“…Eh, Kadowaki? He never mentioned he’s performing.”\nAmane knew that Kadowaki could sing, as they had been to karaoke a few times, but he never expected the latter to be on stage, or even heard rumors about it.\nThe vibrant vigor to prepare for club, cultural festival and live performance on stage really astounded him.\nHowever, it was all the more surprising, given that he hated to stand out.\n“Kadowaki-san really can do everything.”\n“You of all people shouldn’t be saying that, Mahiru.”\nMahiru seemed rather impressed, but she was capable of everything. Studies, sports, housework; few were as capable as her.\n“…There are things I am bad at too.”\n“Like?”\n“Swimming.”\n“I guess. You still couldn’t swim at the end.”\n“I will be underestimating it if I feel that I can learn it in a day. I just cannot grasp it no matter how I tried…”\n“Sorry.”\nMahiru might seemed a little peeved to hear Amane say that she still could not do it, and she started flailing fists at his arm. He gave a wry smile, and looked back at the stage again.\nHe hated the attention, but it seemed he was used to it, for he showed no fear before the masses, and truly imposed himself on it.\nHe even eagerly waved back at a few fans.\nCoincidentally, there was a space that did not obstruct his vision much. His face cringed a little once he met Amane in the eyes.\nIt seemed he did not expect the latter to appear.\nWe’ll chat later\n, so Amane implied as he waved and approached. Kadowaki blinked, and showed a different smile from before.\nThat smile triggers squeals from the girls. Amane and Mahiru burst out laughing at this usual scene.",

      "content": "“You never told me that you’re performing.”\nAfter the live show, Kadowaki went to the wall, and showed up before Amane and Mahiru. Amane snarked, and Kadowaki put on the tie as he had undone it for the concert, giving a troubled smile.\n“They didn’t plan for me to go up there, but the vocalist got an injured leg a week before, during the club activity…the doctor wouldn’t allow, so i showed up.”\nThe live show required the performers to move their bodies, and an injured person could not do so.\n“I see. How’s the guy anyway?”\n“Fine. He’s upset for not being able to go up there, and I feel a little sorry. From the looks of it though, he’s rather happy with how the performance turned out.”\n“Well, I guess it can’t be helped…didn’t expect you to sing that well as a substitute. It’s perfect.”\n“Really? That’s good.”\nAmane already knew that Kadowaki had great vocal skills during their karaoke sessions, but he never expected that. Kadowaki was not overwhelmed by the crowd, and even captivated them.\nAmane was amazed at Kadowaki’s ability, having heard the girls shriek. It seemed Kadowaki had seen this too, for he scratched his cheek in embarrassment.\n“…it’s still a little embarrassing to be seen by friends while doing this.”\n“Is it better for us not to see?”\n“N-not that actually. I was a little relieved to see you two act normal. I feel more relaxed seeing those I’m familiar with.”\nI really got to thank you two for this,\nKadowaki said, looking awkward. The girls peeking on him discreetly started murmuring.\nAmane gave a wry smile in his heart, noting that Kadowaki was still the center of attention.\nDon’t sweat it,\nso he joked back once he saw Kadowaki’s awkward yet proud smile.\nGood work,\nMahiru merely gave a calm smile, and did not go beyond what Amane had said.\nIt probably was to prevent any unnecessary envy. While everyone knew that Mahiru and Amane were dating, there would be a bad impression if she was too close to Kadowaki at such an open place.\n“But it’s a pity. It’s not often that we get this everyday. I really wanted Itsuki to see this.”\n“Eh no thanks. He’ll probably begrudge me for not telling him, or laugh at me.”\n“Just hang on then. It’s your fault for keeping this a secret.”\n“What can I do when it’s decided so suddenly? I don’t have a choice.”\nStop it\nman,\nso Kadowaki joked. Amane made up his mind to mention this during the class meeting later,\nlol nope\n, and his face relaxed as he patted Kadowaki on the shoulder.\n“Everyone worked hard on the first day! Good work!”\nAmane spent time with Mahiru and Kadowaki until the live performances ended, and they returned back.\nThe first day of the festival ended, and gathered there were the students on the prior shift, along with the rested. They probably had enough fun themselves, for they looked really happy.\nItsuki the committee member praised them, and they voiced out their joy.\nOnce the commotion subsided, he coughed a few times, bringing their attention back.\n“Now then, a little round up for tomorrow. Accounts team, please tally if our sales revenue match our orders and report to me. Put the money in the specified bag, and hand it to me. I’ll pas it to the committee. Backend team, prepare for tomorrow; receptionists, clean the classroom. Once done, backend, sort out what we need tomorrow.”\n“Okay~”\nOnce they were assigned their work, the students obediently got down to business.\nAmane was in charge of cleaning, so he rolled his sleeves, filled a bucket of water, and hurried to get it done soon.\nHe had no inkling of the concept of cleaning just a year old. Through Mahiru’s guidance and experience, he was at average level, if not adept, or to be precise, he could at least keep a place neat and tidy.\n“…You’re good.”\nKido noted in amazement once she saw Amane working alongside Mahiru.\n“No no, Mahiru’s a lot better than me. She’s somewhat my master, and I really didn’t know anything about this at first.”\n“I didn’t expect this, Fujimiya-kun. I thought you would be more disciplined.”\n“Amane-kun is reliable whenever he is not at home.”\nMahiru, who was removing and folding the dirtied tablecloths, joked so as she looked towards them.\nAmane could only remain silent even as she hinted at how horrible he was at home. Facts were facts, but he really disliked being teased.\n“Well, that’s how it is for a guy living alone.”\n“But that was too much. I had no place to stand on when I entered.”\n“…That’s how it is.”\n“Really? Well, our Socchan’s not living alone, but his room is neat, you know? He said he keeps things packed up because I’m entering, and there’s nothing under the bed.”\n“Don’t look for those things.”\nA girlfriend looking for those things would be a bonechilling experience for any male. One had to hope that all girlfriends in the country would never try to rummage for such things.\nAmane felt nothing of it, for he did not have any even if anyone was to look, but most would always have some personal possessions they were hiding.\n“Ah, I’m not finding something actually. I’m just wondering if it actually happens. Like those scenes in manga.”\n“You read too much manga.”\n“Yeah. Socchan laughed at me and said that I got carried away…what about you, Fujimiya-kun?”\n“I got nothing, and I don’t want to be suspected.”\n“Ahaha.”\nKido burst out laughing, and Amane started to pity Kayano.\nMan, that was a tragedy…\nMahiru in turn looked confused.\n“What are you talking about?”\nIt seemed she did not hear fully as she was working. Amane tried his best to act natural given her curious look, and averted his eyes.\n“Nothing really important.”\n“Hm, Fujimiya-kun, you mean you don’t need them since you have Shiina-san?”\n“Kido.”\nDon’t say anything weird now,\nAmane endured the overflowing embarrassment as he glared at the leering Kido.\nKido’s grin grew bigger, but ultimately, Mahiru grew increasingly skeptical. Amane had enough, held Mahiru’s hand, and pulled her away from Kido.\n“What were you talking about?”\n“Nothing at all.”\n“Your face seems to imply otherwise.”\n“As I said, nothing at all.”",

      "content": "They returned home after preparing for the next day, and Amane went to buy ingredients for dinner before heading home. For some reason, Mahiru welcomed him in a maid outfit.\n“…Why are you wearing that.”\nit was expected that they would bring their outfits home, given that they were responsible for what they loaned. Amane wondered why Mahiru was wearing it however, and narrowed his eyes.\nOne could say he was stupefied to see the strange sight of a maid appearing before him at home.\nShe said she wanted to head home earlier, and I expected her to plan something.\nThey usually returned home together, and on this day, Mahiru had Amane do the shopping while she went home. He was mystified by it, but he never expected her to welcome him in maid outfit.\nMahiru welcomed him home with the usual smile, dressed in the clothes he saw at school.\n“I returned home to wash the clothes…it is not often that I get this chance, so I wore it.”\n“Well, I guess people usually wear a maid outfit once in their lives, or not at all.”\nThey usually would not wear this unless it was for cosplay purpose.\nHe however never expected her to wear this, and was perturbed.\nFor the time being, he removed his shoes, got changed, and went to the living room. Mahiru was waiting for him there, preparing to serve tea. Her gestures were no different from a real maid, if one did not look at the interior decors of the room, and Amane felt unbearable.\n“…So, how long are you going to remain dressed up like that?”\n“Hm, until dinner is cooked? I have prepared the side dishes yesterday, so I have to do is to take them out of the fridge, or fry them.”\n“I see.”\n“…Is this, bad?”\nMahiru might be sensitive about how Amane looked bewildered, and lowered her eyebrows sadly as she observed him.\n“Not that I don’t like this. I just can’t calm down.”\n“Really? I do feel motivated to take care of you in this.”\n“Take care…well, you’re taking care alright.”\n“And, you will not touch me unless we are both alone.”\nMahiru said with a smile, sat silently by the side, leaned on Amane’s stiff shoulders, and latched upon his shoulder.\nWhat she meant was that Amane would never hug or hold her hand while she was wearing these clothes.\n“Contact with maids usually are forbidden, right?”\n“…It is fine, since you are the master of the house, Amane-kun.”\nShe stammered and eked out this bashful voice, looking really adorable. Amane really had the urge to hug, but he held back, and instead grabbed the hands latched upon his arm.\nHe was not too interested in those clothes, but she was wearing such adorable clothes, giving such an adorable look, which was enough to knock his sanity off balance.\n“…You say that, but what will you do if I force myself onto you unreasonably?”\n“…You are not being unreasonable, and not forcing yourself onto me. I want to devote my utmost to you.”\n“You’ve always been.”\n“It is not enough. I have gained lots and lots from you…and I wish to give you lots.”\nIt seemed that to Mahiru, Amane had given her lots, and one could imagine that she was referring to human relationships, love, warmth and such.\n…I gave her these not because I want her to owe me. I just want to do something for her.\nAmane did out out of his own intense emotions, rather than for Mahiru’s sake, and she really did not need to worry about it. After all, her smile was sufficient compensation, and he really hoped for her to not be bothered.\nBut she would not accept this explanation.\n“…I’ll gain lots of things from you in the future. I don’t need that much now.”\nAmane expressed that he would gain lots from Mahiru in the future. She widened her caramel colored eyes, blinked, and seemed to understand what he meant by gain, for she immediately boiled over.\nAmane gently chuckled once he saw his cute girlfriend look up at him flusteredly, let go of his arm, and put her on his lap.\nHer face turned redder immediately, and her eyes swam about, the rigor she had from before gone elsewhere. He huffed his shoulders, quietly giggled to himself, and put his lips near the fiery cheek.\n“That’s why you should wait a while until you call me husband, right?”\n“Y-yes…”\nMahiru nodded hastily, and moved her white headdress aside. Without saying anything, Amane bit on her pink lips.",

Still the same as before, it’s all renovated, but the mood hasn’t changed.”\nShuuto stood before the entrance, smiling as he looked up at the campus, muttering to himself. It was summer the last time he met Amane. Next to him, Shihoko clung on firmly,\nwe haven’t been here since the opening ceremony\n, showing a poised smile as she said so.\nThey were as lovey-dovey as before. Amane was used to it, but the surrounding stres were fixed upon them. Amane really had the urge to pretend to be unrelated, but of course, Mahiru latched onto his arm, stopping him.\nHer caramel-colored eyes became warm, as though imploring for him to give up, and he was pressurized by this.\n“…Erm, can we don’t walk around together?”\n“Oh dear, you’re saying this when we haven’t met after a few months? You’re a bad boy.”\n“We don’t go around with our parents in this era.”\n“Of course no…ah, I guess it’s the common rebellious phase if you say you hate to be with your parents.”\n“Not that I hate it…it’s that you two stand out too much.”\nThey already were.\nBias aside, both of them looked rather young, and gave the vibe befitting a couple. It was uncommon to see an old couple being so passionate till this point.\nIf their classmates saw it, they might end up teasing Amane later, and if possible, he really did not want to be seen with his parents.\nMahiru in turn was the opposite. Her parents never attended a school event, and it seemed she was delighted by Shihoko and Shuuto’s arrival, that she wanted to stroll around with them.\nAmane would feel a little guilt to ignore her little wish, given that he knew of her background. He was willing to let her be happy, and endure so……but shameful things were shameful.\n“…What do you mean, stand out? You two are already standing out, no?”\nShihoko muttered as she looked at Amane and Mahiru leaning onto each other, smiling away.\nAmane had a vague feeling that the smile was an encouragement, joy, urging him to moe on, and his face cringed.\n“…But the parents stand out more if both parents and students are walking together.”\n“Well, you already stand out. Not much difference. Anyway, you two are already flirting, no?”\n“No we aren’t…ah whatever, you probably want to visit some mockup shop. Better hurry up though, our shift starts at noon.”\n“Eh, you’re following along?”\n“I’m applying the brakes.”\n“Maybe not. You two might be the more flirty ones, you know? Right Shuuto-san?”\n“Ahaha. Yes.”\nShuuto gave a gentle smile, and Amane sighed while putting his hand on his forehead.\nShuuto was unlike Shihoko in that he would never tease others, but he was hard to deal with as he never would oppose nor deny vehemently. Amane would be deemed boorish if he continued to refuse, and in fact, he really could not refute.\n“…So, where do you want to go?”\n“Well, we’ll only get to see you work in the afternoon? If we exclude that, hmmm…it’s a rare opportunity to be here. Maybe we can go to the arts and crafts shop? The pamphlet says that they’re open.”\n“We’ll bring you there. Is that alright?”\nIn any case, the best resolution was to satisfy his parents demands as soon as possible.\nThey would gain attention for nothing if they remained, so Amane compromised, put his hand on the back of the giggling Mahiru, gently nudged her as a reminder, and entered the campus.",

Kido the salesgirlgiggled away.\nAmane did not really know which clubs his classmates belonged to. It seemed Kido was in this crafts club, and being the salesgirl.\n“I thought you would be a sports club manager or something, Kido…”\nAmane subtly kept his distance from his parents, and looked at Kido, who was wearing an apron, probably handmade.\nKido had openly proclaimed her love for muscles, so Amane assumed that she would be a sports club manager or something, as there were boys there, and she would have opportunities to see muscles. He did not expect her to be in the crafts club.\n“I can enjoy the sight of muscular guys, but I’ll be doing so alone, and if actually join ed one, Socchan will pout.”\n“Kayano?”\n“He doesn’t mind me watching those trained professionals on TV or in the photos, but he told me not to drool at other classmates.”\n“I don’t think he’s being jealous. He’s more worried about your reputation.”\nNobody would want to see a cute girl staring dumbfoundedly at muscles, drooling away, let alone a girlfriend.\nKido however seemed annoyed at Amane’s opinion, for she puffed her cheeks.\n“How rude. Even I would choose who I will drool at.”\nI won’t space out at those with so-so muscles.\nKido put her hands on her hips and puffed her chest, not denying that she would drool.\n“Actually, I joined the crafts club because dad asked me to act more like a girl…and another important reason is that I want to personally make clothes for Socchan, and also measure him.”\n“Woah you’re hardcore…”\n“D-Don’t run away. S-Shiina-san too will definitely make clothes for you if you strip and let her measure.”\n“Don’t give my Mahiru any weird fetish idea.”\nMahiru herself would feel really awkward. She was unwilling to see him bare his shoulders, and obviously would not want him to strip. Amane would have a headache if she ended up having a muscle fetish like Kido.\nAmane made no attempt to hide his bewilderment as he looked at a crestfallen looking Kido. Mahiru, who had been accompanying Amane’s parents, came over, looking perplexed.”\n“What are you chatting so excitedly about?”\n“Eh, we’re talking about you being happy if Fujimiya-kun strips.”\n“How’s that possible? Right Mahiru?”\n“I suppose…not.”\n“What’s with the weak denial?”\nAmane had assumed Mahiru would blush and deny fervently, but she seemed strangely hesitant, which shocked him.\n“Eh, because I told Shiina-san about how amazing muscles are?”\n“Don’t do anything unnecessary. You don’t have to teach Mahiru anything strange.”\n“I’m saying how good muscles are. Don’t take human beauty as some strange knowledge. it’s the final result of training the body. You describing it as that is rude, you know?”\n“Ah yes I’m sorry.”\nAmane instinctively apologized once he was unexpectedly given a serious lecture.\n“…No, what if Mahiru awakens to that?”\n“Can’t you just strip?”\n“No way.”\nAmane would never do so as he could easily imagine Mahiru overheating. She barely managed to endure when they bathed together, and if he stripped as he usually did, she surely would look away from him for quite a while.\nNot everyone will want to see exposed shoulders\n, Amane gave Kido a dazed look,\nShiina-san does though,\nand she did not mind as she muttered so.\nOn a side note, Mahiru was shaking her red head flustered. Kido probably had a delusion, wanting to increase the number of muscle fetishists.\nShe clearly was going to steam, for her lips quivered as she muttered,\nI have thought of that shameless thing, just a little.\nShe might clam up if he retorted about her saying just a little, so he pretended not to hear. Mahiru’s thought was probably out of an interest pertaining to her lover, and not due to a fetish like Kido.\n“Oh my, you two are chatting happily.”\nAmane was wondering how to coax the flushed Mahiru when Shihoko and Shuuto seemed to have bought something they were fond of. They slipped the item into a bag, and walked over with leisurely smiles.\nKido blinked away, and showed a proper smile that was directed to outsiders, with nary a hint of the girl who was chatting about muscles.\n“Ah, Fujimiya-kun’s parents? Nice to meet you, I’m the classmate of Fujimiya-kun and Shiina-san, Ayaka Kido.”\n“How courteous you are. I’m Shuuto Fujimiya, and this is my wife Shihoko.”\nShuuto introduced himself and Shihoko, and Kido bowed with a smile. The obedient facade had Amane chuckling.\n“What were you talking about?”\n“…About Kido’s interests.”\nShuuto asked Amane, who averted his eyes as he gave a neutral answer. Shihoko blinked away, and seemed interested.\n“Eh, what kind of interest?”\n“Erm, human observation…I guess? She also likes to see others work hard, and cheer for them.”\nThe human observation (marveling at muscles) aspect was not wrong, and neither was the part about cheering on people who were working on their muscles, though it was not right either.\n“What do you think about our Amane? is he working hard?”\n“Hmmm…I think he is. I don’t really know though, since I haven’t chatted with him for long…”\nAmane had a feeling she was definitely talking about muscles, but he did not retort in front of his parents, for it would be bad if this led to more issues.\nMahiru probably understood as well, for she remained silently. She discreetly rubbed Amane’s belly while his parents were busy talking, and it seemed to be Kido’s influence.\nWe’ll talk at home\n, so Amane pried the hand away. Mahiru probably noticed what she just did, for she immediately blushed.\n“Fujimiya-kun looks happy and hardworking whenever he’s with Shiina-san. I think I want to observe up close.”\n“Ah, is their relationship good at school too?”\n“Yep, ridiculously good. Everyone’s blinded by them.”\n“Oy Kido, enough with the nonsense.”\n“But really, I’m not wrong. It’s the truth. I always feel you two are a match for each other, you know?”\nKido leered and praised, probably as retaliation for him taking her muscle fetish as some strange knowledge. His parents too smiled happily, and he had the urge to get away immediately.\nAmane had a feeling he was blushing as hard as Mahiru just now, so he glared at Kido, who did not mind.\n“It feels like everyone in class has given their blessings. That’s good.”\n“Shut up.”\nShuuto gave a kind smile full of joy. Amane felt he had nowhere to go, so he pouted and turned his head aside.",

      "content": "“Why do you look so gloomy, Amane-kun…?”\n“Why exactly…”\nShuuto and Shihoko left the exhibition sales of the crafts club, and started touring around again. Mahiru leisurely followed them while latching onto Amane, not letting him run away.\nAmane concealed his pouting emotions as he stared at the back of his delighted parents, looking completely unmotivated.\nThe stares hurt.\nHe could feel stinging stares upon him, for he was moving along with his parents who gained much attention.\nHe did not like the attention, but he started to get used to it, especially as Mahiru’s boyfriend.\nThe stares this time were different, for they were neither jealous nor malicious, but curious. The familiar looking faces had everyone all the more interested.\nHis parents flirted around as they went to another shop, and Amane could only trudge along behind them.\nHaving witnessed this, Mahiru lowered her eyes awkwardly.\n“…We can split from them if you are that unwilling…”\n“Not that I’m unwilling. It’s just, a little awkward…seeing my own family like this…”\n“…It is hypocritical of you, Amane-kun. I think you are very similar to Shuuto-san.”\n“How so?”\n“…Well recently…erm, you will instinctively give that ‘you belong to me’ possessive vibe…”\nYou started holding my hands, grabbing my shoulders.\nMahiru’s cheeks turned increasingly red, and she pursed her lips slightly. Amane was silent, and kept his mouth shut.\n“…To be honest, I think it is good to be forthright, and…my heart does jump. You have the self-confidence now, and I am glad for you, while also starting to panic. You do pay heed to the strangest of things however…and occasionally timid.”\n“…The last part is unnecessary, right?”\n“It is true though…but that is good, since you are not you if you are not timid.”\n“Oy what do you think of me.”\nIt seemed Mahiru felt that Amane was uselessly timid, which frustrated him. They had been dating for four months, and stayed over, but did not gain any experience. Perhaps it was right to say that he was timid.\nBoth sides had a mutual understanding, and Mahiru understood that it was a choice made because he wanted to cherish her.\nHowever, he was a little miffed that it was taken as his standard.\n“…Since you find me timid, we’ll see at home then.”\n“The-they will be staying over tonight, right?”\nDespite that, it would be boring to have Mahiru underestimate him completely.\n“…Then can I stay over at your place?”\nHe said partly to tease her, and partly to visit her house even if they could not stay over. Mahiru was stunned, and then looked down.\nShe stopped, reeled in her shoulders, and lowered her head. Amane sensed that he overdid it, and was about to apologize when she timidly lifted her head.\n“E-erm, yo-you may, uuu…I-I will do my best, to clean up.”\nIt was a joke, but she seemed to have taken it seriously, for her fists were shaking, and her face was so red, Amane worried if she was fine. It seemed he really could not overdo it, so he swore to control his hands.\nWhether he could do it however was another matter.",

Mahirun’s so charming…and I’m really knowing more and more of her cute points.”\n“Don’t mix these two dangerous thins together.”\nShihoko and Chitose got along well on the first day they met. Amane saw them dote on Mahiru, and sighed hard.\nItsuki and Chitose were both in the same shift as Amane, so they were free that morning. They coincidentally met Amane’s parents, and Amane had no choice but to introduce his parents to them. It all went relatively well until this point.\nThereafter was the problem. Chitose initially acted obedient, but once Shihoko started doting on Mahiru, she could not help but join the fray instead.\nThey immediately got together, and because of their continued praise, Mahiru blushed and shivered.\nThe caramel-colored eyes were overflowing with shame as she looked to Amane, pleading for help, but there was no way he could defeat their passion. He could only let them continue, and gather amongst the men instead.\n“Our child has been under your care.”\n“No no.”\n“…Ugh.”\n“What, Amane? You’re not denying it?”\n“…Well, I did, but it’s a matter of whether you’re a busybody.”\nItsuki was really a busybody sometimes, but mostly speaking, Amane really was under his care, and caused him trouble. Amane was grateful to him, and though he usually would not say so, he really felt so.\nAmane and Mahiru would not have deepened their relationship this much if not for Itsuki, and one could say that Itsuki and Chitose really influenced his own relationship.\nAnd it was because of his gratefulness that Amane did not deny what Shuuto said. for some reason, Itsuki averted his eyes.\n“You’re rather honest at such moments.”\n“You’re saying that my personality’s twisted? You wanna fight?”\n“You’re obviously twisted if you can infer that. Anyway, you still have self-awareness?”\n“Shut up.”\nYou bastard,\nAmane slapped Itsuki on the back, but they were merely fooling around, and Itsuki did not mind as he grinned away and observed Amane.\nShuuto too smiled as he watched on. Amane had enough as he looked aside, only to hear the former chuckle.\n“Actually, I think Amane’s rather eccentric. He’s dishonest, but rather straightforward.”\n“He’s always like this. He’s not the most approachable, so it’s really great that he has a friend that understands him.”\n“No no, I think it’s great to have such a great friend.”\n“…Mind not talking about this in front of me.”\n“But…”\n“I suppose. We shall message you later then…”\nAmane meant for them to not mention that in front of him, and for some reason, Itsuki and Shuuto started talking about how they should contact each other, which troubled him. He had a feeling that they would discreetly report, and really hoped this would not happen.\nBut even if he stopped them at this point, Chitose and Shihoko might collaborate over something. He had a really strong feeling that it was pointless to stop them.\nMahiru and I are going to be teased anyway.\nIt was mostly friendship and parental love, but the one in the middle found it unbearable.\nHe wanted to remind them later, and turned his eyes aside……but in a corner of his eyes, he spotted Daiki, whom he met the previous day.\nIt was not weird for Daiki to appear as the guardian, but he merely watched from afar, and did not approach them. He was giving a conflicted look, which troubled Amane.\nDaiki was looking at Itsuki, and probably worried about his son.\n“Amane, what…”\nItsuki noticed Amane’s frozen stare, and looked over, only for his handsome face to tense up.\nAmane knew that both father and son were not on good terms, but the reaction was so obvious that he found it awkward as a friend.\nHe looked over at Itsuki, not knowing what to do. Itsuki’s lips shook, not knowing what to say, and turned his back on Daiki, went to the chatting Chitose, laughing away.\n“Hey, it’s about time to buy lunch, right? If we don’t queue up now, we’ll be hungry in the afternoon.”\n“Ehh, that’s no good~ ah, sorry, we should go now.”\n“Really? We’ll be at the cafe later. See you then.”\n“Yes.”\nChitose bowed politely, and was gently prodded by Itsuki to leave. The latter did so probably to avoid having Chitose look unhappy if she met Daiki, but it was too brazen to Daiki.\n…Why did this happen.\nAmane sighed as he watched Itsuki ignore Daiki’s existence completely.",

      "content": "“I caused them trouble.”\nDaiki, who had been observing from afar, approached with a wry smile once he was certain Itsuki and Chitose left.\nAmane too felt very awkward and apologetic, but he was not one to press the matter pertaining to the affairs of others, and could only watch them leave helpless.\nShihoko noticed the approaching Daiki, and approached alongside Mahiru.\n“Ah, the father of Itsuki we just met.”\n“Why, greetings. Our son has been under your care.”\n“No no, I was…”\nFirst was the common greeting. Amane’s parents and Daiki introduced themselves. Amane was peeved to see so.\n“…Ah, erm, Daiki-san, that was…”\n“It was to be expected. I was too harsh on her, and it is expected that Itsuki would avoid me.”\nDaiki seemed to have given up, rather than feeling despondent, and took it as fact. Shuuto and Shihoko seemed to have realized that Daiki was on bad terms with his son’s girlfriend (Chitose), and lowered their eyebrows worried. They probably remembered their conversation with Amane, that a friend had fallen in love, but was not approved by his parents, and it troubled them.\nDaiki did not seem to mind the expressions of Amane’s parents. He then seemingly recalled something as he looked diagonally upwards, and smiled.\n“Speaking of which, Shiina-san, you do seem to be on very good terms with Fujimiya-kun’s parents. It shocked me.”\n“Thank you for your compliments.”\n“She’s my future daughter, and she’s so obedient that I want to dote on her.”\nShihoko and Shuuto’s personalities were such that since they had approved of Amane and Mahiru to date, Mahiru would be their daughter, and this relationship seemed so natural. This might sound like a dig to Daiki however, so Amane did not express further…Shihoko however did not mind, and flat out stated.\nAmane felt that Shihoko already intended so, and since she wanted to, Shuuto had no intention to stop.\nShihoko clearly stated her interest in Mahiru without any malice, and Mahiru was embarrassed. Daiki widened his eyes in shock, and then showed a wry smile.\n“I suppose. Both of you surely do not have anything to be unhappy about, since it’s her.”\n“Yes. She is the one my son chose. She’s pretty, and after meeting her, we feel that we can leave Amane to her.”\nAmane was peeved that to his parents, they would be entrusting Amane to Mahiru, and not the other way around. However, they were showing their care, and he did not have anything to really complain about.\n“I’m envious. That foolish son of mine however is hopeless.”\n“Do you not trust your son?”\n“Well, he’s not as good as your son. He’s young, and doesn’t know stuff.”\n“Oh? I don’t think so, you know? I heard from Amane that he’s kind and cares for others.”\n“That…”\nDaiki stammered, and Shihoko gave a poised smile.\nShe probably felt something as a fellow parent. Usually, she would not press the matter, but she was not holding back this time.\nThe crux surely was because she witnessed Itsuki escorting his girlfriend away from his father.\n“I know parents have their own thoughts about who their children choose…but boys do quickly grow independent, and they will resist if you impose too much. Since you raised him into such a fine boy, you should be able to trust his choice of partner. I do think an adult should watch on silently.”\nShihoko gave Daiki a smile, and the latter responded with the face of one who took a bitter pill.\nHe was not doing so out of disgust, but that it hit a sore point.\nShuuto showed a faint wry smile once he saw that Shihoko did not intend to continue further.\n“Alright, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to lecture since we just met…but since the child has not clearly strayed off, and intends to walk his own path, he’s not going to accept the fact that you’re stopping him.”\nShuuto surmised, and smiled just as Shihoko did. Amane scratched his cheek, and gently sighed.\nHe did not think he should interfere, but he understood that for good or bad, Daiki was a stubborn man. He knew that parents would look at things differently compared to their children.\nDaiki understood that Chitose was not a bad person, so all that was left was the difference in perspectives and expectations.\n“Daiki-san, please let me say something as well. Erm…you might not like Chitose…but she’s not a hopeless person. Recently, she’s been wondering how to get your approval, and she’s working hard on it. I don’t mean that you should accept her…but please look at her for who she is.”\nGiven his high expectations, Chitose might seem unacceptable. Nevertheless, she was not completely dumb, was observant in crucial moments, and knew how to care for others.\nTruth be told, Amane hoped that Daiki would not reject her outright just because of their difference in ideals.\n“…I too wish to resolve this. Even so, it is best if she works hard. She’s going to bear our family name, so she needs the appropriate mettle for this.”\n“You’re right. I’ll tell her that.”\nI’ll compromise depending on the situation,\nso the implication, and Amane quietly shrugged, heaving a sigh of relief due to the small step of progress.",

      "content": "“…You’re usually aloof to Akazawa-san and Chitose-san, Amane-kun, but you were being protective of them back then.”\nAmane and Mahiru had lunch, and broke away from Amane’s parents for the time being, got changed, and prepared to start their afternoon shift. They would wait in the rest room for 20 minutes before heading out.\nMahiru tied buns on her hair on this day, and her fingertips were on the white headdress she was going to wear as she smiled.\n“…Well, he’s a friend.”\n“You are dishonest.”\n“Shut up. I’m being honest to you.”\n“Honest? or direct…you do scare me from time to time, and caused my heart to jump.”\n“Great, your heart’s jumping.”\n“Goodness, you.”\nMahiru started whacking at Amane, giving a dumbfounded rather than displeased look. Amane shrugged, and said,\n“I really won’t watch over them in ways they can see though, so that they won’t worry. I know what Daiki-san wants to say.”\n“What does he wish to say?”\n“Hm…he’s a really great guy. You probably never visited him before, but it’s a rather small mansion.\nAmane was shocked the first time he visited, for he never saw a house that different.\nItsuki awkwardly stated that it was just some run down house, but there should be some history to it, and it was nothing to be ashamed of.\n“Yeah, it seems like Itsuki’s from that kind of family. Daiki-san’s basically saying that though Itsuki has an older adult brother who’ll take over the house, he wants his younger son to have an outstanding female befitting of the family heritage.”\n“…I see.”\n“Itsuki said that he’s the younger son with no expectations on him, and that he should decide for himself. Daiki-san though wants him to have a better marriage. Well, I can understand both sides.”\nPersonally speaking, Amane was more biased towards Itsuki, but he did not think Daiki was completely in the wrong.\nIt was not that Chitose was bad, but that the bar Daiki set for her was too high. Since they had family prestige, there was a certain demand, which an ordinary person like Chitose could hardly reach.\nAmane did not intend to side with Daiki, but it was never good to not hear out the parties involved.\n“Personally, I think that tearing them apart will cause friction and turmoil. It’s better for their futures and relationship to let them be.”\nI can say this since I’m not involved though\n, Amane shrugged as he concluded. Mahiru stared at him, and lowered her eyes.\n“…I am a little envious of Akazawa-san.”\n“Envious?”\nAmane naturally widened his eyes once he heard this completely unexpected word.\nMahiru in turn showed an awkward smile,\nit might be careless of me to say so\n, so she prefaced, and sighed before continuing.\n“They might find it unbearable, I think. Itsuki-san’s father is interfering because he is worried about his son, no? I cannot deny that he has imposed his ideals into this…but it is still his love as a parent.”\nOnce Mahiru started talking about parents, Amane tensed up at an angle she would not notice.\n“Ah, you do not have to worry about it.”\nIt seemed Mahiru had noticed Amane’s worry, for she showed a faint smile, fiddled with her fingers, entangled them in her bundled hair, and slowly looked down.\n“I do not have any thoughts about my parents now, but I see such a close family bond, which makes me envious since I feel lacking in his. Even if my parents care for me, I shall not deal with them.”\nI have nothing to do with them,\nso she gently quipped, and gently twirled the buns on the side of her hair.\nAmane did not press on about the stress-relieving gesture, and instead removed the untied hair from her fingers, before his fingers slid down to her white face.\nShe looked up.\nHe noticed how shaken her eyes were, but he did not point it out, and instead smiled silently.\n“Yeah, we got my parents, so you should be able to experience that. They said they’re entrusting me to you.”\nThe Fujimiyas had practically taken Mahiru as a daughter, and treasured and doted on her more than their own son. They doted her all the more, knowing that she lacked love.\nHe was dumbfounded however when they said that they would be burdening her, and told him not to let go of her.\nShe blinked away a few times once he said so. His words seemed to have reached her heart, and she slowly broke into a smile.\n“…Fufu. Of course not. You are so wonderful.”\n“Thanks…a lot of people care about you. You don’t have to think too much about it.”\n“Yes.”\nMahiru shyly leaned upon Amane, and he smiled.\nIf the experience isn’t enough, do I have to stick with her as I want for the entire night?\nSince they would spend the night together, he should cling onto her, or perhaps they should sleep together, creating an environment of close contact.\nHe would then tell her often how much he treasured and loved her. She would be uneasy at certain intervals, and it would be best if he would convey his feelings to her.\nDon’t lose control though,\nso he swore to himself. Mahiru seemed to have noticed something, for she shivered, but she clung onto him. He took her in, and remained with her like that for a short while.",

      "content": "“Oh my, such a cute attire you have, Mahiru-chan.”\nAmane’s parents arrived early by the time it was their shift. Amane welcomed them alongside Mahiru, trying to force a smile on his numb, cringing face.\nShihoko in particular was being excited as Mahiru was dressed in maid outfit; she excitedly observed the clothing, and even touched it.\nMahiru could only show a wry smile, probably because she was used to it, but by the rules, she had to refuse. Even if it was an acquaintance, if anyone was to set a precedent so openly, those who misunderstood might attempt to do the same, which Amane did not want.\nMahiru might have difficulty refusing, for she let Shihoko touch to her heart’s content. Amane sighed, and reached out to stop.\n“Dear customer, please do not touch our maid.”\n“Of course, it’s your personal maid, Amane.”\n“Normally speaking, the maid belongs to this shop!”\nShihoko seemed to understood Amane’s intent that Mahiru belonged to him, and his face twitched. Nevertheless, she did not seem to mind.\nAmane too understood that it was pointless to posture, and decided to serve as usual.\n“Goodness me, this waiter’s rude…well, is it because you want her to yourself?”\n“Of course not. Rules are rules, no touching, we don’t provide this service. Do stop, or it’ll be a bad example to other customers.”\n“Even if it’s mom?”\n“Nope, and you’re not her mom.”\nShihoko might have deemed herself as Mahiru’s mother already. She was already acting more like a mother than Mahiru’s actual mother, and doted on her more than her own son, but Mahiru nevertheless was her son’s girlfriend.\nAmane was more anxious to get his parents seated, rather than retort about this. A few customers, and even the students, had been casting glances here, which was really embarrassing.\n“What’s bad about that? It’s no difference.”\n“So I say…ah whatever, let’s bring you to your seats.”\n“Of course, there are other customers here. Lead me there then, waiter.”\nShihoko’s genial smile had Amane’s lips quivering, and a silent Shuuto gave an apologetic look. Amane quietly sighed to himself, and turned to look at the customers.\n“Excuse me, I shall lead you to your seats.”\nShihoko stifled her giggles due to Amane’s professional attitude. Amane ignored it, and led them to the empty seat. Mahiru must have went off to serve another customer, taking orders.\nWhy do my parents have to see me like this?\nAmane felt embarrassed, and wanted to sigh, but held it in as he showed his parents the menu.\n“This is the menu of our shop. Please take note that all the items are sold in sets.”\n“Oh, I see. What do you want, Shuuto-san?”\n“Hm, any recommendations, waiter?”\n“If you like coffee, I recommend set A. If you like tea, set C might be more appropriate.”\nAmane’s father was not one to tease like Shihoko, but the bemused smile was something Amane found unacceptable. It was one thing to serve his classmates, but exceptionally awkward when it came to his family.\nShihoko continued to snicker away, and Amane was increasingly frustratred.\n“Can we bring the maid back?”\n“This shop doesn’t provide such service.”\n“Even though you want to.”\n“Don’t make it sound so bad. That’s just going home.”\nAmane accidentally blurted his usual drawl, but Shihoko did not mind as she was obviously discussing personal matters. There was nothing more to say.\n“…Well, you’re going to bring her back home anyway, Amane.”\n“We’re going home anyway, and besides, she’s bringing me home.”\n“Woah!”\nYou’re spending the night together?\nShihoko gave an excited look, and Amane immediately regretted his slip of the tongue.\n“…I’ll explain the rest later. Let’s not talk now, seriously.”\n“You’re at that age after all.”\n“I’m talking common sense. Don’t talk about that in the shop.”\nAmane scowled, and Shuuto finally coaxed Shihoko.\n“Alright, we’ll talk about that later.”\n“Of course. We’ll ask about the details later.”\n“Just don’t. Anyway, your orders?”\n“One set A and one set C. Is it fine with you, Shihoko-san?”\n“Yes, I’ll be fine with both.”\nShihoko was delighted, and Shuuto knew what Shihoko wanted without having to say anything.\n“Certainly. Please wait a moment.”\nAmane took their orders, and hurriedly left, since he knew they would start flirting.\nAs expected, there was an amicable conversation behind him. He sighed, informed the counter of the order, and his classmate there stared at him.\n“One set A and one set C…what?”\n“That’s your parents, Fujimiya?”\n“…Unfortunately, yes.”\n“What do you mean, unfortunately…but well, I feel that you’re very different from your mom.”\nThis classmate saw how cheerful Shihoko was, and obviously, the contrast was stark.\nAfter looking back at the chatting duo for a while, the classmate looked at Amane.\n“…Ah.”\n“What do you mean, ah?”\n“You resemble your dad.”\n“Really? Well, I guess I got more resemblance to him…”\n“Yep yep that’s it.”\nAmane narrowed his eyes at this obliging answer, but before he could answer,\nI got something to do,\nthe classmate hurried off, stating so. Amane did not know what was going on, and was suspicious as he returned to his position.",

      "content": "Due to the strange concern shown by his classmate, Amane personally served the food to his parents, but for some reason, Kadowaki was there, talking with his parents.\nThey appeared to be chatting genially, but Amane started to wonder if they were messing around again.\nWith Shuuto around, there probably would not be anything major revealed that would affect his future. Nevertheless, Shuuto was prone to faults too, and he too might be an offender.\nAmane calmly balanced the tray with the food, and quickly went towards them,\nyour food’s here\n, he said flatly as he put it on the table.\nWhat are you guys doing\n, so he glared at them, and his parents smiled back, clearly unfazed by that.\nKadowaki blinked away once he saw Amane, and showed a gentle smile.\n“Fujimiya.”\n“What are you doing…”\n“Just serving some water, and greeting.”\nHe had a bottle of ice water in his hand, and clearly was not lying.\n“Anyway, your mom’s really pretty, Fujmiya.”\n“Oh my, you have quite the sweet mouth. You aren’t as good as Shuuto-san, Yuuta-kun, but you’re rather dashing yourself.”\n“Ahaha, honored to hear that.”\nShihoko casually called Kadowaki by name, and one had to wonder when they were on such familiar terms, which was terrifying. They probably did not notice his anxiety however, for the scene was so genial.\n“Thank you for being willing to be friends with our son. He’s rude and blunt, isn’t him?”\n“Of course not. He doesn’t really smile much, but he does convey his emotions. He’s a little sarcastic, but he’s never going to badmouth anymore. I think he has a good heart. Also, he’s been looking friendlier recently, and I think it’s because of Shiina-san’s influence.”\n“Wow…”\n“Oy, please don’t say anymore. It’s embarrassing.”\n“Eh, but it’s all true…”\n“True or not, you shouldn’t be saying that in front of the actual person.”\nKadowaki was not one to joke, and he probably would say what was on his mind, but Amane was unbearably ashamed to hear others say that to his parents.\nItsuki and Shuuto had a similar conversation before. Amane truly experienced embarrassment on this day, thanks to his friends.\n“But if I don’t give you a positive review, they aren’t going to accept it. Isn’t it fine to say such things once in a while?”\n“Nope. You shouldn’t be telling my parents. You should be telling me that.”\n“Really? Why, thanks for everything till now. I’m really grateful to have a friend like you.”\n“…Thank you.”\nA single sentence was accompanied with an innocent smile that was irresistible. Amane softly answered, and his observing parents chirped.\n“It’s really great that you two are like this.”\n“Shut up. Anyway, get back to work, Kadowaki.”\n“Yes, sorry to take up your time. I’ll see you next time.”\nSee you next time,\nthe words left Amane terrified, but Kadowaki continued to smile as he returned back with the bottle.\nBurdened with the most fatigue he had for the day, Amane was completely worn out and unmotivated.\n“You’ve made some good friends.”\n“Well, yeah…”\nHe was so tired that he could not put up any resistance, and casually answered Shuuto’s delighted words.\nHe did make some good friends, but a spade was a spade, and he really could not bring himself to be happy after being so humiliated.\nAmane showed a pouty look, and with a wry smile, Shuuto picked up the coffee from the table.\n“We might seem like busybodies to you, but we’re still worried. We’re wondering if you’re doing well after having left home for a year and half.”\nHe seemed to be worried about Amane in his own way, and was checking on his surroundings. However, Amane did not wish for Shuuto to cause too much trouble for his friends. He was fine however that it was his friend who approached them.\n“I see that you’re getting along with your class, and getting smiles along with Shiina-san.”\n“I think it’s definitely because of you two.”\n“Apologies for that, but it’s a little too late for that.”\n“Shut up.”\nRecently, Amane would receive warm smiles from afar whenever he was with Mahiru, and it was too late to comment so at this point. It did not mean that he wanted these looks in the first place.\nAmane gave Shuuto a harsh look, and was met with a kind smile. He had enough, and turned his head aside.",

      "content": "“I’m so tired…”\nAmane heard the school broadcast announcing the end of the cultural festival, and let out a long sigh.\nAfter his parents left, his classmates teased him lots. He was already tense from doing service work, which he was suited for, and with his classmates piling on, the mental stress extended to his body.\nBut those too came to an end. Once he heard the repeated broadcast, Amane stretched out his shoulders in relief.\n“Oy, good work everyone! We sure were busy!”\nOnce they were sure the customers left and the broadcast was aired, Itsuki laughed away and gathered all the students.\nThe seemingly short yet long cultural festival came to an end, and everyone’s face was brimming with accomplishment, and also fatigued, for they were so busy.\n“Let’s not be so hasty to count the money. We need to clean up, and that’s the toughest part. It’s going to be harder than the setup. The school informed us that they’ll handle the trash, so please sort them out ASAP.”\n“Ehh.”\n“Don’t wanna, it’s too troublesome.”\nThe class lost all motivation once cleaning up was mentioned, and there was a lingering laziness. Amane gave a wry smile as he understood them while getting ready to clean up, stuffing the trash from their business into a bag as he heard Itsuki’s voice.\n“Alright alright, we can celebrate once we’re done. We get a day off tomorrow, so let’s get down to work.”\n“Same to you.”\n“I’m working and giving instructions…ow, I know, stop messing around.”\nItsuki proudly puffed his chest as he stood before the blackboard, and some sniped back at him. He started laughing and joined in on the cleaning, probably because he was used to it.\n“We’ll be required to pay a certain sum after the celebration, so don’t spend all the earnings.”\n“Uh oh, do I have money down?”\n“You wrote your name on the book, saying that you’ll be joining, right? If you don’t have enough, go borrow, or you can borrow from me. 100$ interest rate per day, by the way.”\n“What’s with the high rates?”\n“Don’t like it, get to work, and I’ll charge you less interest.”\n“You got to work though.”\nWith his classmate slapping his shoulder, Itsuki raised his fists, yelling that they would hurry with work before they would go celebrate, and cheered them up. Amane gave a wry smile as he saw this, and dumped the remaining cutlery into the bag. Mahiru too watched Itsuki.\n“He really is energetic.”\n“That’s how he is.”\n“Where is the celebration held?”\n“He said he booked a karaoke room, and we’re free to join a second party (family restaurant).”\nThey needed to state their attendance for the celebration party beforehand. Amane did not participate in the previous year, but Itsuki would not be the only friend there. There were Mahiru and Chitose, and he was on better terms with his classmates. Though a little embarrassed, he was going to participate.\nTruth be told, he really did not want to sing in front of others, and hoped to just listen, but Itsuki probably would shove the microphone into his hands, and he started to wonder what he should do.\n“I told mom and dad since they’ll be staying over, and it’s okay for me to be a little late. I don’t really like crowded places though. Will be going home after karaoke.”\n“I do intend so too. Dinner is prepared.”\n“You’re capable.”\n“I do have to do this, so that I can spare less effort once we return.”\nAmane was impressed that Mahiru had plans for dinner, and quietly grinned to himself at the word ‘return’. Mahiru blinked away a few times in confusion.\nShe gave a quizzical look, wondering if there was anything, but Amane did not answer her silent question, and merely shrugged as he focused on cleaning.",

      "content": "Once they were done cleaning, Amane and the others went to the venue, feeling somewhat fatigued.\nThere were three rooms booked, and the participants had to split into three teams, each into their own room. Itsuki kindly put those who were on better terms together.\nAmane’s group consisted of the ones he had been talking to, Mahiru, then Itsuki, Chitose, Kadowaki, Hiiragi, Kuju, and Kido, whom he had been talking to more recently.\nThe girls found it a pity that Kadowaki was in this group, but the girls in this room had boyfriends, and would not care about him, so thus, they were all relieved while finding it a pity.On a side note, the girls assigned to the other rooms narrowed their eyes in glee, and said,\ngo flirt all you want with Shiina-san\n, and Amane frowned back at them.\n“Anyway, good work⸺”\nItsuki led everyone in the toast, his cup contained cider from the drinks bar,and everyone in the room did likewise.\nThey merely gestured so, for it was too far to do so. Once done, Amanae drank his cup of melon soda.\nThe taste and fragrance of this drink was something unique to junk food, which he liked. Mahiru said that she wanted to try, so he gave her a sip, and she frowned. It seemed this did not suit her tastes, probably because she could not handle the carbonic acid.\nThe teary Mahiru sipped at her oolong tea and leaned on Amane. She was tired, and felt restless as so many people were at this karaoke session.\n“Good work everyone. A lot of it is thanks to Kido.”\nItsuki finished his cider, sat down, and nodded happily.\nThe aforementioned Kido sipped some water and gave a wry smile.\n“No no, it’s thanks to the owner being kind enough to lend us clothes…I didn’t expect them to prepare this many.”\n“We’ll offer a box of sweets next time as thanks.”\n“It’s amazing, Ikkun’s being serious~”\n“How rude, Chii. I’m serious from time to time.”\n“How often is that?”\n“…Once every half year?”\n“That won’t do!”\nEveryone burst out laughing, and Amane sigh as he looked at them.\nHe did interact with everyone involved, but it was hard for him to say something when there were so many people. Amane was not as naturally cheerful as Itsuki, did not have the sociability, and he never intended to join in the conversation unless someone actually talked to him.\nMahiru watched the joyous scene with a smile. She did not like the ruckus, but neither did she dislike it, and perhaps she was happiest just watching.\n“…Amane, why are you watching like it has nothing to do with you? Stop flirting and come here.”\n“Alright alright, I get it. Don’t stand up. It’s squeezy here.”\nThe room was relatively wide, but it was inconvenient for eight to move, packed even. Truth be told, he found it a hassle to wriggle here and there, and hoped everyone could remain still.\n“Come here Mahirun~ let’s tease Ikkun.”\n“Come on, don’t do that…wait, are you bad at karaoke, Shiina-san?”\n“N-no, I cannot really say that…”\nMahiru fidgeted about, and Chitose seemed to understand as she lifted her head,\noohhh,\nand continued on.\n“…Uuuu, Mahirun just doesn’t have a song to sing, and doesn’t really want to. Basically, she usually plays piano tunes, or some foreign songs with lyrics to study English.”\n“That kind of upbringing…as to be expected of Shiina-san.”\n“You don’t listen to anything with Amane?”\n“I don’t play any songs at home.”\nAmane’s room had an audio component, but it was more akin got a decoration. After all, he was either sleeping or studying alone in his room, or reading. He would spend most of his time chatting with Mahiru in the living room, and studying with her.\n“What about you guys, Makochin?”\n“I just listen to some trendy pop songs…”\n“I don’t really listen to any, just the piano pieces my grandma plays though.”\n“That’s not normal…ah, speaking of music, Yuuta.”\nItsuki suddenly changed the topic, and clearly looked displeased as he looked at the gleeful Kadowaki.\n“Why didn’t you tell us that you were performing a live show? I would have changed my shift if you told me.”\nIt seemed Itsuki had issues about Kadowaki performing a live show during the festival without them knowing, and was slapping away at the table while not spilling the drink.\nKuju was worried as the table was shaking, and it seemed he was present back then,\nwe didn’t call you because we didn’t want you to cause a ruckus,\nfor he muttered.\nKadowaki merely gave a wry smile at Itsuki, who seemed to have lots to say, but he looked unapologetic.\n“I didn’t tell you because I knew you’ll do this. There’s no reason for you to see.”\n“Amane and the others saw it. It’s so unfair⸺”\n“It’s nothing. And anyway, don’t I always go to karaoke with you?”\n“Well, I just want to see you perform. Whatever, I’ll let you off if you start a solo performance here.”\n“Eh…”\nThe ridiculous request had Kadowaki lowering his eyes, and he met Amane in the eyes.\nAmane quickly looked aside as he had a bad premonition, and he could sense Kadowaki sneering away.\n“Let’s drag Fujimiya down too.”\n“Why me!?”\n“It’s karaoke. Everyone has to sing, right? Not like it changes things.”\n“Woah, more live performers? Very good, more.”\nItsuki started adding fuel to the fire, for he sensed that Kadowaki would sing if Amane just in. Chitose and Kido might be getting high too, for they started cheering and teasing along.\nAmane did not want to be a partner to a good singer, and turned to Mahiru for help⸺\n“I do not believe I have heard you sing before, Amane-kun. It is a rare chance…”\nShe clearly was on Itsuki’s side.\nItsuki, Kadowaki, you two remember this,\nand gave up as he reached for the microphone on the table.",

      "content": "Perhaps it was due to the high they experienced, but everyone got Amane to sing various songs, and Amane was dead tired once he was done.\nKadowaki, who also sang, remained calm, and it was probably due to the difference in physical ability.\n“Good work. You sang well.”\nMahiru welcomed Amane back with a calm smile. She was more excited than usual, and probably was being high as well.\n“…You’re rather into this too, Mahiru.”\n“A-after all…you look cool singing, Amane-kun.”\n“Thanks for the compliments. Your turn next.”\n“Hm?”\n“Chitose, I’ll leave Mahiru to you. You’ll sing with her.”\nAmane called out to Chitose, and offered his elated girlfriend as a sacrifice.\nChitose showed a suspicious look once she heard so,\nalrighty, leave it to me,\nbut she grinned away, and answered so.\n“No, wait.”\n“Mahirun’s happy. I want to hear Mahirun sing too.”\n“E-erm…”\n“I think you’ll be able to sing whatever Chitose chooses, Mahiru. It’s fine, it’s fine.”\n“Th-there is a problem…C-Chitose-saaaannnnn”\n“Come one come on Mahirun. Everyone’s going to sing anyway, and we’re all excited.”\nAmane waved as the excited Chitose led Mahiru by the hand. Mahiru gave Amane a begrudging look, but he was in her position moments ago, and hoped she would gave up.\nIt is what it is.\nSo Amane nodded away as he watched the flustered Mahiru staring at the microphone in her hand, narrowing his eyes happily. Kadowaki watched on with a wry smile, eating fries.\n“Will Shiina-san retaliate later?”\n“A few hits at most.”\nEven if she did, it was a cute revenge, so cute that he wanted to take the charge and watch her reaction.\nKadowaki shrugged at Amane’s nonchalant response, and with somewhat dazzling eyes, looked towards Mahiru, who started singing frantically.\nMahiru could do everything except swimming, and singing was no exception. The good thing was that a peaceful Japanese song was chosen, and an elegant melody came from the clear voice, which got everyone to stop their chatter and be mesmerized. One could possibly fall asleep quickly if she was asked to sing a lullaby. Amane’s face was a lot more relaxed.\nChitose too sang well, her voice meshing well with Mahiru’s soft voice. She was familiar with the tune, and had better sense of the rhythm and lyrics. In short, Chitose was technically better.\nShe was overjoyed, and it seemed she would not let Mahiru off once this song ended.\nAh whatever, Mahiru looks happy anyway.\nShe remained bashful, but the displeased look she showed after being abandoned had eased up, and she seemed happy enough. She did not have the karaoke session experience many had. Amane was glad that she enjoyed herself.\n“…Anyway, you two are heading back, right?”\nWhile Amane calmly watched Mahiru hold the microphone, Kadowaki leaned over and asked with a voice only he could hear.\n“Yeah. My parents are here. Mahiru basically prepared dinner before going to school.”\n“Eh, well, it’s like you two are already living together. Seriously.”\n“Shut up.”\nMahiru would only return home when she had to sleep, dress up and get changed. She spent most of her time at Amane’s place, and it was taken for granted, nothing wrong with that. One could say taht she had completely integrated herself into his life.\n“That means you two will head home right after this, right? The others might find it a pity, but not like we can blame you.”\n“I guess people will find it a pity that Mahiru isn’t going to be there, right?”\n“Ahaha, you never thought about yourself, huh?”\nKadowaki patted Amane’s shoulder with a wry smile, and the latter jabbed by at the belly, implying that he was unlike Mahiru and Kadowaki.\nHe had started to integrate with the class, but he did not have their popularity. Even if others found it a pity, it’s because he’s already an item with Mahiru. For some reason, his classmates would watch over him, so perhaps that was the reason.\n“Well, your parents are here. They’re sufficiently worried about you to come all the way here.”\n“…Yeah, they’re worried about me alright.”\n“It’s great that you have these parents, and that they’re really getting along with Shiina-san.”\n“Yeah. They treasure her more than their own son.”\n“Ahaha, but I think it’s because they treasure you.”\nKadowaki said with a smile, and Amane widened his eyes, gave a slightly awkward look,\nI know that,\nand muttered so.\nYou have great parents,\nKadowaki chuckled again at Amane’s bashful look, and gently tapped at him.",

      "content": "After karaoke, Amane left Itsuki and the others, and dragged his somewhat tired body home.\nShuuto and Shihoko were already at his place as he had agreed beforehand, and they welcomed Amane and Mahiru with smiles.\n“Welcome back. You’re not going to continue celebrating with your friends?”\n“I’m worried that we’re stay too late. I don’t want Mahiru to be out there so late at night even though I’m with her, and she did prepare dinner.”\nIt was a little unnatural that his mother welcomed him home even though he lived alone. The same scenario happened back at his hometown however, and it felt nostalgic.\nMahiru was seemingly accustomed to this for some reason, and accepted this situation. Perhaps it was because she was grateful for what happened over summer vacation, but she seemed elated to see Shihoko, and that was enough to justify his parent’s trip here.\nShe spoke with Shihoko with a calm expression, and Amane passed her by, headed to his room to get changed. Mahiru had gotten changed in her own house beforehand, and returned to Amane’s place. After he passed through the entrance, Mahiru removed her shoes as usual, and went to the living room with Shihoko.\nAmane randomly chose a shirt from the closet, got changed, and went to the living room. He could not see Mahiru there, and the flax-colored hair dangled at the living room.\n“Anyway, how about your dinner, mom?”\n“We had dinner outside. It was a sudden visit, and I did inform Mahiru-chan ealier.”\n“We wanted to stay at a hotel and not disturb you two.”\n“Thanks for the concern. I’ll be staying over at Mahiru’s place though.”\nThere was one more activity for him, to stay over at Mahiru’s place. This might be more important to him than the cultural festival. It was normal for them to not be disturbed, since they were usually alone together.\nShihoko seemed enthused once she heard that he was staying over.\n“Oh yes, you did mention that in the day. Staying over tonight?”\n“…That’s right. You can sleep around at home.”\n“Oh my oh my, heheheh.”\n“…What’s with this laugh?”\n“Nothing. I’m just guessing that Mahiru-chan will be looking forward to it.”\n“Nope, impossible. And don’t poke your nose into your son’s relationship.”\nEven if they were going to spend the night together, Mahiru might be all the more anxious if he did anything. Amane did not show it, but he was being more tense than her. He never entered a girl’s room before, let alone his girlfriend’s.\nOf course, he could not be saying such things before his parents. He ignored Shihoko’s question, and turned to Shuuto, who smiled back at Amane, clearly showing no intent to advise nor ask.\nYou have quite the good relationship,\nhe stated such a neutral thought.\n“Young man, it is fine not to let loose, but I never thought you would make so many friends. It is impressive.”\n“Who do you think I am?”\n“Haha, well, you wouldn’t blend in if you didn’t actually trust them. I’m relieved to see you on good terms with quite a few of them.”\nAmane did inform his parents that he got some acquaintances, but it seemed they were worried until they actually saw it.\n“I never heard much about Yuuta-kun from you. Didn’t know you have such a handsome and kind friend.”\n“I’m wondering about that too. He’s really a great guy.”\n“I think birds of the same feather flock together. It is because you are a good person, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru might have heard the conversation from the living room, and her voice was heard while she chopped the vegetables.\nAmane never thought much about being called a good person, but it was true that they got along well. Kadowaki was a boy who garnered the attention of many, but he did not stand out, personality-wise. He was poised, kind, and might have gotten along with Amane, who preferred quiet.\n“You’re making it sound like I’m like Itsuki.”\n“You two really care for your friends. You’re worried about the Akazawas, and you’re trying to help him, right?”\n“Of course. It’s never a bad thing to try and improve relationships.”\nAmane had seen his parents love for each other, to the point where they were dubbed the lovebirds. It was from them that he understood their love for their son, and they were probably more amicable than many others.\nHe had taken his experiences for granted, and though he did not want to impose upon others, he could not help but how that Itsuki’s family could resolve this in some way.\nItsuki’s family situation was not as dire to the point of no return as Mahiru’s. As long as they were allowed, a resolution remained possible.\n“Akazawa-san said that you sound dishonest, but he can tell that you are worried about him.”\n“I’ll tell him to shut up next time.”\n“This is what he is referring to.”\nAmane frowned once he heard the giggle. His parents too smile, either because of Amane’s expression or Mahiru’s words. Amane awkward evaded their stares, and sat down on the sofa.\nHe played dumb, and was met with more laughter.\nYou had enough?\nHe grumbled, and focused his thoughts on the TV airing the variety show.",

      "content": "“…Pardon my intrusion.”\nAmane entered Mahiru’s house for the first time, and marveled as he saw the living room that was cleaned and devoid of unnecessary items.\nThe decors of the room were a white and light green base, nary any unnecessary items, and was decorated just as she liked it.\nIt was the first time he was entering a girl’s house, and though he was initially nervous, his anxiety appeared to be eased somewhat once he saw how neat it was.\n“Please enter. It may be a little messy though.”\n“You sure you can say that if we compare to my house a year ago?”\nMahiru led Amane into the house, and the latter gave a wry smile at those remarks. Mahiru recalled the devastation that was his house back then, and shrugged in exaggeration.\n“Well, that does not count. Do reflect back on how messy it was.”\n“Ugh, I can’t deny that.”\n“You are the one who mentioned that first. Given that you are working hard to maintain the current situation, I would say that if there is anything to mention…hmm, you do casually toss your dirty clothes into the basket, and sometimes drop it on the floor. It is best of you to change this.”\n“Yep, better take note.”\n“That is good.”\nAmane usually would not allow Mahiru to wash his clothes, but she did see how he handled his laundry. Amane would flip his socks and clothes appropriately before dropping it into the laundry basket, but it seemed there were other aspects he had to pay attention to.\nAmane quietly noted to himself these issues he had to take note of, and as he continued chatting with Mahiru, he was no longer as tense. Once again, he looked towards her house.\nHer furniture was arranged neatly, as expected, and that was what he felt on first glance. It seemed so orderly, and so balanced, like a magazine.\nAnd thus, he felt something was amiss.\n“Well, your house looks pretty, but…”\n“It feels devoid of life?”\n“…Sorry?”\nMahiru asked with a wry smile before Amane could say so, and he awkwardly averted his eyes.\nYes, the house was neat, and cleaned thoroughly…but it did not feel as though someone lived there.\nTypically put, a house would show a person’s interests and living habits, but there was nary of that. A simple word, cleanliness, would suffice.\n“It is fine. I too feel the same. And I have been spending more time at your place, excluding sleeping time.”\n“Ahh…”\n“I really have been spending time at your place. Nothing much changed ever since that major cleaning.”\nSpeaking of which, Mahiru hardly spent time at her own place. She had been at Amane’s place before they dated, and moreso after.\nSince she spent so much time at his place, her presence at this place would seem diluted. She really liked cleanliness, and thus all presence of life would be all the more nonexistent.\nAmane felt warm and fuzzy within once he realized once again that Mahiru was next to him. Mahiru then took a step closer, and looked at his face.\n“…So, your house is my house too. You have to keep things clean, no?”\n“…O-okay.”\nAmane was flustered to see Mahiru’s bubbly smile, and stammered.\nShe nodded happily, for his reaction seemed to be within expectations, and invited him into her room. It was the toughest test of the day, and would test his endurance.\nHe passed the living room, but it was to be expected that he would be nervous about entering the room she usually slept in.\nHe entered, and found it to be the same as the living room, white and light green, and yet a little more glamorous.\nJust like Mahiru, the bookshelf was filled with textbooks and culinary books.\nThere was a doll placed on a glass desk, the doll Amane won at the game center. The bear doll he gave her for her birthday was on the bed, along with a few other prizes won from the game center.\nThey had no notable names, but the dolls were certainly cute enough.\nAmane remembered seeing a glimpse of Mahiru’s room when Chitose did a live video call at Mahiru’s place. However, seeing it for himself was a completely different experience.\nHis breathing was a little frantic due to his anxiety.\nThe indescribable feminine sweet scent got stronger. It was a little different from the one on Mahiru, but smelled good all the same.\n“Please wait here. You can read any book you wish.”\n“O-okay.”\nOne had to wonder if Mahiru was nervous, for she did not express so, and let Amane wait while acting normally. On a side note, Amane had taken a bath beforehand, so he was going to wait for her.\nThey had no plans thereafter, but he was really restless at the prospect of waiting for his girlfriend at her house while she was bathing.\nFor the time being, he knelt on the carpet, and straightened his back. She gently chuckled, took out two sets of clothes, and dangled them before Amane.\n“…Just to ask, which of these do you prefer?”\nGenerally speaking, the two sets of clothes were nightwear, but they were so different.\nThe first was made of white and pink fabrics, for indoor usual. The top was a long-sleeved hoodie, accompanied with shorts. The cute design certainly had a girlish feel to it.\nThe other was a white baby doll dress with laces and ribbons.\nIt was not transparent, but it certainly exposed more than the other clothes. There was hardly a gap at the chest, and it covered half her thighs or so.\nNevertheless, part of the décolletage and the upper arms were exposed. Surely it would expose more compared to the clothing she wore at Amane’s place.\nAmane was stunned to see the two clothes, and Mahiru smiled. One had to wonder what her intent was.\n“I thought I should let you choose since you are here. You would be happier.”\n“I-I think you can wear anything you want.”\n“Well, I want to wear something you like. I shall wear whatever you prefer.”\nIt seemed Mahiru really wanted Amane to choose.\nHe had a look.\nThere was no doubt both really suited her well. Truth be told, he could not imagine any clothes that would not suit her.\nHowever, his thought was that the loose indoor clothing might be more appropriate for Chitose than Mahiru.\nHe felt that the feminine, mature look baby doll dress would suit her better.\nBut he had a feeling it would be a bad thing to choose that.\nShe should understand that I don’t mean anything, but my sanity will\nsuffer.\nThey would snuggle together for an entire night, and those clothes would give rise to many problems. Mahiru would feel awkward to cling together, and he would be bothered if he imposed his frustrations on her.\nHe had a little desire to see her in the baby doll dress, but he pointed towards the warm, comfy indoor clothes.\n…th-the loose one\n, so he said, and Mahiru giggled.\n“I shall wear this then.”\nMahiru then lifted the matured looking baby doll dress, and kept the loose indoor clothing in the closet.\n“So what’s the point of me choosing?”\n“I had a feeling that you probably would choose that since it reveals little, but will prefer this instead, and only eschewed so out of embarrassment. It is obvious from your attitude and averting eyes.”\nShe was so correct, and Amane was speechless, his lips quivered.\n“…You didn’t have to ask if you know that.”\n“Fufu, I wish to know what you like, Amane-kun. I was just checking.”\n“…I see.”\nThis affirmation truly was bad for his heart. His heart and stomach were wincing away.\nShe chose it out of consideration for Amane however, and he was delighted. His lips were merely quivering, neither smiling nor cringing.\n“I shall take a bath then.”\nShe ignored the conflicting emotions in his heart, and simply left the room. Amane knelt in the room, humming away, and heard footsteps through the door, panicking even.\nMahiru might have been acting calm, and was really conscientious inside. Amane felt a lot relieved, but he had second thoughts since it was so awkward, and his body was searing.\nAmane purged away the imagination of Mahiru in swimwear as he knelt on the floor, waiting for her to be done bathing.",

      "content": "“…Say, you are not going to keep kneeling on the floor, no?”\nAmane kept kneeling until Mahiru returned from the bathroom, and the latter looked confused at his posture.\nHe did not look at her directly, as he did not know the consequences of looking over. She took the initiative to enter his sights however, and stood before him.\nShe was wearing the white nightwear, as she had said beforehand, and Amane’s eyes were restless.\nAs expected, her fine figure left him wondering where to look. Her chest was not that wide open, but there were distinguishable layers beneath the chest of the dress, emphasizing the contents.\nThe white lumpy colors further accentuated them.\nThe nightwear fabrics were not transparent, and the body lines could not be seen. Amane however knew some things, and his male instincts caused him to have unsavory thoughts.\nMahiru had a thin cardigan draped upon her, probably as a last shred of conscience, and he did not have to turn his face aside…though it was too stimulating for him to look at.\nThe swimsuit that once clung onto him exposed more, but the sight of her in her nightwear, fresh out of the bath, looked so innocent and tempting, attacking at his conscience and sanity.\n“…Erm, uu.”\n“You can wait on the bed.”\n“Are you trying to kill me?”\n“Why do you think so…?”\nIt would be too much for him to wait for a girl on the bed. He did not dislike it, and would really enjoy it, but it was better to keep his sanity intact considering what would happen next.\nMahiru sounded conflicted and reluctant, and then looked at his face.\n“…Do I look good?”\n“Of course of course.”\n“And you say so without looking at me. Do you mind?”\nAmane cautiously looked towards Mahiru once she said so, and widened his eyes.\nShe too lifted her head bashfully towards him. Her white skin had a tinge of red, and her embarrassment was seeping out.\nTheir eyes met, and she lowered her eyes, her eyebrows shivered, and she buried her face into his shoulder.\n“…It is not that I am not flustered. I am working hard to tease you, Amane-kun.”\n“N-no, you don’t have to do that.”\n“I have to. I want to get one back at you since you have been tough to deal with recently.”\n“G-get what back?”\n“…The advantage?”\nI am the only one getting all flustered recently,\nshe murmured somewhat unhappily, squealed, and pressed her entire body onto Amane.\nAmane could not take this hit from Mahiru as his legs were numb, and fell backwards.\nHe did not suffer a hard impact thanks to the soft carpet and cushion, but his back still ached. He frowned, lifted his head towards Mahiru, and immediately regretted it.\nHer clothes and posture were truly bad.\nHe saw a marvelous scene, and it was obviously not one to be marveled at. He averted his eyes, and she got onto him, staring at him intently.\nTruth be told, he did not care that she was on him, but he hoped she would get away from him, considering where they were at.\nShe then clung onto his chest, and showed no signs of getting away.\n“…M-Mahiru-san, would you mind?”\n“No.”\n“Say…”\n“…I-I am doing this on purpose. It is fine.”\n“All the more reason why it’s not!”\nWhat’s with this little devil?\nHe shuddered, and wriggled upright. Mahiru was clinging onto his chest, looking at him, displeased.\n“…Erm, I think Chitose and the others taught you something…well, you don’t have to force yourself.”\n“…Do you think I am forcing myself, that I am unwilling?”\n“No that.”\n“Uuu…actually…I hope that you can be happy, and that I can give my all to you, for you to be enchanted by me.”\n“Why do you want me to be more enchanted?”\nIt’s like you’re a different person in front of Shiina-san, so Itsuki once said.\nHis infatuation for her was obvious. He wanted to treasure her, to dote on her.\nThere was no way he could love her even more, and even if there was, it would end up with him being obsessive over her. He did not want to bind her, and her living freely was just as he wanted. He also wanted to avoid losing control of his sanity.\nHe believed that if he was too tempted, he could love her to a point where they could not get off the bed for quite a while. He hoped Mahiru would control herself⸺but she remained on him, showing no intent to back off.\n“…You have become so adept at this, Amane-kun. It is unfair. I am the one who have been teased by you all this time. Even when your heart beats faster, my heart beats faster than that.”\n“Erm…”\n“Sometimes, I want you to know my pain…the unbearable, anxious, yet comforting pain (happiness) that fills my heart.”\nMahiru murmured, and brought her lips close. Her feelings were so intense, and Amane felt blessed as he accepted her kiss.",

      "content": "It was rare for Mahiru to kiss him, and Amane let her be.\nTruth be told, he might fall over if he did not hold up his body with his hands, and if he moved, something terrible would occur. Thus, he could not move. His waist was unstable, and he was filled with shame and anxiety once Mahiru expressed her love for him.\nHer movements were a little stiff as she hardly took the initiative. She kissed away, happily staring at Amane’s anxious and embarrassed face.\nShe too was so embarrassed that her cheeks were red, and her eyes were moist. Even then, her expression looked so alluring. Beauties really could do anything.\nMahiru saw Amane’s expression, grinned, got down onto his chest, and he had enough.\n“…E-erm, Mahiru-san?”\n“What is it?”\n“Actually…my butt’s aching from sitting on the floor. Maybe that’s enough?”\nAmane just wanted to break away, and get himself to calm down, but she might not listen if he said so, so he tried to plead using a plausible reason.\nShe blinked away,\nI apologize for that,\nand got up from Amane. She was unexpectedly obedient, and probably knew that Amane had a different intent.\nAmane thought of retreating for the time being while Mahiru was away from him, but the latter, quite the observant one, clung onto his arm, and prevented him from escaping.\nHe tensed up due to the heat, the touch, and the fact that he was seen through,\nI say,\nand heard her murmur.\n“Who was the one who said that I would have it when we return home.”\n“Ugh.”\n“Such boisterous words you said.”\nAmane had intended for something else when he said that, but she did not mind.\n“…But well, I did plan for this, and I am glad. It is just that you always try to escape.”\nAmane hoped that she would understand that he was trying to escape, for biological reasons, but it seemed she was fine with whatever situation he was in, and did not mind…actually, she probably meant something.\nTruth be told, Amane never expected Mahiru, who was so flustered when the stayover was suggested, to be so enthusiastic. At the same time, he knew that he was being so useless because he was rattled by her clothes.\nHe felt it was reasonable for him.\nHe did not intend to do anything when he suggested to stay at Mahiru’s place, and naturally was disturbed by Mahiru’s bold temptation.\nMahiru herself might disagree with the sentiment, that she just wanted Amane to understand her feelings. Amane however felt that it was a cruel yet captivating temptation.\n“Erm, I understand your feelings, so, can you please spare me?”\n“In detail?”\n“Like, another piece of clothing or two…?”\n“Nope. I shall not promise so, since I finally seized the initiative.”\nIt seemed Mahiru wanted to drive a stake through Amane’s heart.\n“…It is a little embarrassing, but I shall continue as long as your heart jumps, as written in the guidebook.”\n“I say, what is that guidebook about? Mind giving your big brother one?”\n“We are the same age, just a month apart.”\n“That’s not the problem. I’m very curious to know what’s inside there.”\n“…A secret.”\nMahiru clearly averted her eyes, and latched firmly onto Amane’s body, as though brushing this matter aside.\n“…I can change my clothes if you dislike so.”\nMahiru muttered so as she looked up at him, and he murmured as he wrapped his arm behind her back.\nHe could feel beyond the fabric that there was something missing. The fabric was thin, the soft body, the sweet fragrance; churning in the chest were the various thoughts and feelings, along with the looming desire.\nHe understood that, and at the same time, he knew that he did not have to reject Mahiru.\n“…You know I won’t exactly dislike it, right?”\n“Yes. I am asking just in case.”\nAmane groaned, knowing that Mahiru was being forceful on this day. A voice rang from her throat, and she smiled happily. He dared not say that she was blushing, for his was moreso.\n“…You little devil.”\n“I did say before that girls can become angels and devils in front of those they like.”\nAmane was peeved that the smiling Mahiru looked so smug, made up his mind, and lifted her chin with his fingers.\nHe stared into her caramel-colored eyes, as though looking into her. Her eyes started to waver again.\n…She’s completely hopeless when she’s the one being pushed around. Same old, same old.\nMahiru was being very aggressive on this day, but like before, she was never one to stand up to others. This was probably the reason why she wanted to seize the initiative.\nAmane too might fit that description well. It seemed there would be quite the tug-of-war.\nAmane hesitantly kissed her once he saw her eyes waver.\nThe sudden kiss left Mahiru frozen, but she liked this, and did not refuse.\nAnd so, he gave her a deep kiss, as she wanted. Halfway through, she started hammering at his chest.\nA voice was eked from her throat, either out of protest, or something else.\nShe shoved his chest before he could get the answer, prying the lips away with the body, and stumbled back, sitting on the bed.\nShe blushed, glared at Amane with teary eyes. He licked his lips that were moist from kissing, and went over to Mahiru, who retreated.\n“…You laugh at me for always running away. Aren’t you doing the same too?”\n“Uuu…n-no, it is bed time. I am just getting onto the bed.”\n“I see. I’ll get on too.”\nAmane got onto the bed, and Mahiru had nowhere to escape to. Her body quivered, but she looked up at Amane defiantly, and stopped looking for some reason.\n“…I-it is despicable of you. I had you bath earlier because of this…”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You are still so alluring even after this while.”\nMahiru exclaimed her inscrutable thoughts, and murmured as she snuggled under the blanket.\nWell, I have to get in\nanyway…so he thought, but it would be inappropriate for him to say so at this point.\nHis eyes were at ease once she did so, and he was quietly relieved as he got next to her, embracing her little back.\nShe shivered, he chuckled. She probably realized that he was chuckling from his breathing, and turned towards him. Her eyes were so filled with shame, seemingly displeased, seemingly pouting. She was adorable.\n“…I wanted to tease you today, Amane-kun.”\n“You haven’t had enough?”\n“What are you saying? Have you not turned the tables on me…baka.”\nAmane took a punch in his abdomen, but it did not hurt or itch. Mahiru pursed her lips slightly, probably due to the reaction when she hammered onto him, impressed and yet unhappy.\n“…And you trained. It is no good as well.”\n“What do you mean, no good.”\n“…It is despicable of you.”\nMahiru slid her hand down Amane’s shirt, towards his abs. He could tell it was due to Kido’s influence, but he let her back.\nHe did not have any particularly visible abs, but he felt that his body was firmer. Mahiru would surely feel something if she continued to fiddled around.\nSo she fondled away, and sighed. Amane felt ticklish, and started to observe her.\nShe might be reinvigorated again, for she blushed and checked his body. He did not expect her to reach beneath his clothes, but since she liked it, he let her be.\n“…I’m fine with you touching, but I’ll act if you overdo it, okay?”\nMahiru tensed up the moment he whispered so, and looked up at him with teary eyes.\nHe said that as a reminder to her, but it contained some desire. However much she touched, he would touch. That should be fine.\nHe had felt ticklish right from the beginning, and was at his limit in various ways. He was terrified that Mahiru would touch places she should not have, and when that happened, his endurance would crumble.\nHe said so, hoping that she would stop, but she pursed her lips and buried her face into Amane’s chest.\n“…Erm…I too, have care for my skin today.”\nThe voice seemed stifled through the chest, but it was unambiguous. This time, it was Amane who tensed up.\nHe met Mahiru in the eyes, right when she looked up at him.\nThe caramel colored eyes remained moist, as though a sweet droplet would fall at any given moment, timidly observing every action.\nAmane inadvertently gulped.\nShe probably, no, surely, she would accept everything he would do, and enjoy the one most important thing in her life.\nShe trusted Amane, and loved him. He too was confident of that.\nCould he reciprocate her trust and love?\nVarious feelings churned within him.\nHis body desires throbbed within, conflicting against his wish to cherish her, wrecking his sanity.\nHe exhaled, and she trembled.\nShe had entrusted her future to Amane, and might have been feeling expectant and uneasy.\nThe females were usually the passive ones, and if anything happened, they would be the ones who would have their futures affected.\nUpon that, Amane got his answer,\n“Say.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Personally, I want to cherish you.”\n“…Yes.”\n“…But, well, I’m not at the age where I can take responsibility for you. If anything happens, you’ll be the one with the most trouble. Ah no, I’ll take responsibility, of course, but with the law present, I can’t guarantee my relationship with you.”\nThere was no other way to bear responsibility, but the law dictated that they could only marry at 18. If any mishap happened thereafter, she would have to bear a child as a student. It was best to be avoided.\n“I love you, and want to respect you. I won’t stop you if there’s anything you want to do in the future, anything you want to learn. I don’t want to affect your life just because of a spur of a moment, or my own desires.”\n“…Yes.”\n“I’m prepared to spend my entire life with you, but…”\n“You do not have to say anymore.”\nHe was cut off before he could finish. He assumed Mahiru would berate him for being timid, but she showed an innocent smile, somewhat conflicted, and yet somewhat delighted, as though it was expected.\n“…I know that you have been trying your best to respect and love me, Amane-kun. I…truly am blessed that you cherish me so.”\nShe earnestly smiled, kissed him, and smiled once again when their eyes were so close.\n“…I too love you so, from the bottom of my heart.”\nBefore him was the lady he loved, giving a smile more blissful that anyone else. Amane rewarded her with a kiss, and wrapped her petite body once again.\n“…Can I wait until your birthday next year?”\nThe ideal suggestion would be to wait till graduation, but Amane gave this vague compromise as he was afraid he might not last.\nMahiru could identify Amane’s inner turmoil. She looked down, nodded bashfully, and buried her face into his chest.\nCertainly, what welcomed her was throbbing heartbeat.\nAmane did not regret his decision. His desire to cherish Mahiru was without pretense.\nHowever, he hoped she would forgive him, for his body was about to creak.\n“…Erm.”\n“Yes?”\n“May I say something useless?”\n“Please do. I shall accept everything of my beloved, whether it is the dashing parts, the useless parts, or the pleas to me.”\nHe panicked a little when faced with her magnanimity, and kissed her neck, made up his mind, and said,\n“…Erm, well…can I touch you a little?”\nHe did not intend to waste the determination he showed, and his oath was not to be defied.\nHowever, his desire caused his head to overheat, and it was best if he could relax a little.\nMahiru probably never expected him to say so, for she blinked abruptly, and her face clearly turned red.\nIt did not mean that she would refuse, on the contrary even. She smiled, and looked up at him.\n“However much I touched you though.”\n“…What if it’s not enough?”\n“I shall touch you some more then.”\nShe giggled, and started touching Amane’s belly. He lamented that he could never beat her, and snuggled into the bed, no longer embracing her.",

      "content": "Amane woke up to find Mahiru, whom he had cuddled to sleep last night, gone. For some reason, she was replaced with the teddy bear he gave her for her birthday.\nIt was probably Mahiru’s doing. She was no longer present, and movements could be heard outside.\nHe intended to ask her later about the matter of the teddy bear in his clutches, and looked down at it.\nThe round eyes had stayed by the bedside, watching the two flirt, and was showing a contented face at this point. Amane then recalled what happened the previous night as he looked on, felt embarrassed, and buried his face into the soft belly.\nThe bear had a sweet fragrance as it had stayed at Mahiru’s place for a long time, along with a refreshing scent of vanilla.\nBut that refreshing scent could not cast away the aftertaste.\nA shrill voice by his ear, the sweat sliding down the reddening skin, the tenderness he did not have, the moist eyes filled with trust and expectations. They lingered within him, becoming a sweet torture.\nHe was restless on the mere thought of it, so he did his best to empty his mind, and sat up. The door could be heard open.\n“…Are you awake?”\nShowing her face suddenly was Mahiru. He could see an apron through the gap, and she probably was making breakfast.\nShe blushed the moment she saw him, just a moment, but she did not run away.\n“Breakfast is ready. Do get changed and wash your face.”\n“…Yes.”\nIt sounded as though they were living together, and he felt ticklish. Truth be told, they were somewhat living together.\n“What’s for breakfast?”\n“Rice, dashimaki and miso soup. Kinpira Gobo, hiyayakko and shishamo. I apologize that these are all I have.”\n“No biggies, it’s more than enough…it’s like I’m in a dream.”\n“That is a hyperbole. I can wake you up if you are still in a dream.”\nMahiru returned into her room, went towards Amane, and pinched his cheek.\nIt did not hurt, and it seemed she was flirting, rather than waking him up.\nShe had her fun, and Amane felt fuzzy, as though basked in sunlight. He gently put his hand on her neck.\nThere was a red mark at the base of the neck where he touched, like a camellia leaf fallen onto snown. Both of them were the only ones who knew that the mark extended far beneath the clothes.\n“…Looks like you have to wear a high collar together.”\n“I-it is your fault.”\n“I’m really sorry…erm, I couldn’t control myself…”\nHe knew, or at least his sanity, knew that Mahiru would be troubled if that was exposed, but his head overheated, wanting to trample over the fresh snow, and he instinctively brought his lips over.\nMahiru quickly sorted out the clothes, and remained silent, her face redder than the kiss. It seemed she might ignore him for quite a while, after having recalled what happened the previous night.\nShe might have shown more first time expressions than Amane, but it was best for him to pursue matters further and end up losing his breakfast.\nAfter all, Amane too was the same. He might not be able to rid himself of his memories just by washing his face.\n“Al-alright, do hurry and get changed and wash up. Cool your head a little.”\n“…You should cool off your head too.”\n“You said something?”\n“No-nothing.”\nMahiru glared back, clearly looking more heated than him. He shut up, and put his hand on his shirt.\nShe then let out a pitiful shriek, and hastily left the room. Amane could not help but laugh.\nYou saw so much yesterday.\nThe escaped Mahiru was so embarrassed, it was unlike the her yesterday. Even when she was so hesitant, she saw and fondled his body. He laughed and heaved his shoulders, and got ready to get changed into plainclothes.",

      "content": "After breakfast, Amane intended to return home,\nare you leaving just like that?\nBut Mahiru’s eyes seemed to imply this as she looked up to him. He could not bring himself to, and decided to stay until noon.\nShe really did not intend to make him stay, but she might have unwittingly given that expression. It seemed that if similar instances were to happen again, and she were to actually show such a face instinctively, Amane’s conscience would be heavily reproached.\nShe smiled, for he would stay a little longer, and her face was a little red once she saw him a little restless in the room.\nShe continued to cling onto him however, and that was terrible for his heart. He should have been used to it, but the memories of the previous night’s incidents flashed through his mind, and he was unable to calm down.\n“…Erm, can you, forget about what happened?”\n“That is impossible.”\nThey were seated on both ends of the bed, clearly feeling bothered.\nThere was no way they could not think about that. The alluring sights were etched in Amane’s memory, and so was the various expressions and changes in voices she showed.\nShe started hammering at his chest, probably because she was feeling embarrassed, but it did not hurt at all. Clearly she was not angry, but just hiding her embarrassment.\nEven that gesture was so adorable, and he felt his sense of comfort surpassed his shame.\nIt seemed Mahiru had noticed him smiling at her, and she pushed her fist onto him.\nOwwiee,\nso he called out, and fell onto the bed.\nHe fell onto the mattress, and the bear next to him tumbled off. He immediately grabbed it, and then recalled about what happened in the morning.\n“You swapped in the bear, didn’t you?”\n“…I woke up and got off the bed, and you were looking for me on the bed…so I accidentally…”\n“Accidentally, huh? Say, that aside Mahiru.”\n“Hm?”\n“Can I check your phone later?”\nHe tried to bait her, and as expected, her face cringed.\n“……I do not understand what do you mean.”\n“I think you can show me if you didn’t do anything guilty.”\n“E-erm…can you show me yours then?”\n“Sure? Have a look if you want.”\nAmane’s phone did not contain anything unspeakable, or rather, there was the photo of her in her nightwear Chitose sent over. They saw some things spicier than that however, and this photo was nothing.\nHe nodded boldly, and her eyes started to waver.\n“I-it is unfair…you have nothing to be taken advantage of since you are so honest, Amane-kun.”\n“…Speaking of which, what kind of BGR books do you have?”\n“Th-that is another matter altogether!?”\n“So you mean there’s another secret?”\n“Uuuu.”\nHe lifted his head towards the caramel-colored eyes, indicating that he was either going to find photos, or the books she had. She grumbled a few moments, and unwillingly handed her phone over to him.\nShe then collapsed onto his chest, causing him to squeal while unlocking her phone.\nAmane usually would not peek at her phone, since it was a matter of privacy, but since she agreed, it was fine. On a side note, the password was Amane’s birthday, which he found endearing and fuzzy. He unwittingly reached a hand out to pat Mahiru on the head.\n“…Are you angry?”\nShe asked timidly, her face half buried in his chest. Amane gave a wry smile, and patted her head again.\n“I’m not. I’ll probably do the same if I cuddle you to sleep. I just want to be sure if I’m drooling.”\n“Rest assured, it is adorable.”\n“That doesn’t sound assuring…found it.”\nHe hurriedly searched through the album, not wanting to see more out of embarrassment. The most he found were a few of his sleeping faces.\nHe looked so comforted when Mahiru stuffed the teddy bear into his clutches, sleeping soundly. He was so contented, for part of his desires were released the previous night.\nHe felt awkward that his immature side still showed in his sleeping face. He returned Mahiru her phone, and told her it was fine.\n“Don’t show this to anyone else, not even Chitose. She’ll laugh at me.”\n“I-I shall not. I shall keep this cute side of you to myself, Amane-kun.”\n“I feel happy and yet unhappy about this possessiveness…”\nHe was glad that she was possessive over not wanting others to see her lover being so careless, but he found it gaudy that he was deemed cute despite that possessiveness. It was one thing for a girl to be called cute, a boy being called cute was not exactly a compliment.\nAmane pursed his lips hard, and Mahiru beamed as she rubbed her face onto his chest.\n“I do find you cute though.”\n“Can’t you call me suave, dear?”\n“You really are not in such situations.”\nAmane was very peeved that she insisted so.\nIt was a loss of his pride as a man, and as retaliation, he rolled over Mahiru, and got onto her.\nHer eyes sparkled, and she froze. Amane smiled.\n“You’re adorable too though.”\n“…It feels like you are skilled at this when you put your thoughts into it, Amane-kun. That is not cute.”\n“I’m really not skilled at this. You’re my first, and I don’t want anything to do with anyone else.”\n“That is what I mean. You are always like this.”\nMahiru immediately got louder, like a can being crushed, and wrapped her arms around Amane’s neck while he was atop her, biting his lips.\nShe did not stop, for it might be due to her experiences the previous night.\nShe took the initiative, and Amane was so happy, the back of his head got numb.\nOne had to wonder if she was getting used to it, or that she wanted him to be shocked, but she started to plead with him with her clumsy gestures, eradicating the space between him and Mahiru beneath him.\nOnce again, he experienced the warmth he felt the previous day, and whispered,\n“…Mahiru.”\n“I shall continue to trouble you.”\n“You little devil…”\nShe deliberately taunted his sanity, and he grumbled. He was no longer holding back, and she looked elated, her face increasingly delighted with the bubbly smile on her face.\nYou’re too much for doing this to your boyfriend who’s been holding it in.\nSo he whispered, and kissed her, robbing her from her joyous thoughts.\nAfter a while, she recovered, her body melted away.\nAmane brought his lips to her ears, and gently took a nibble. She shivered, and he kept this posture, smiling next to her.\n“…Be troubled then.”\nMahiru’s body would shiver on a mere breath. Amane smiled again, and she pouted as she hammered at him, looked away at his face, and resulted in him having to apologize.",

      "content": "“Welcome back.”\nAmane had lunch at Mahiru’s place, returned to his place, and welcoming him back was his beaming mother.\nHer face looked glossy for some reason, probably because of her delusion. It so happened that half the reason was her overimagining it, and Amane could only give her a cold look.\nMahiru blushed, worried if Shihoko had seen through everything. Surely there were intense acts Shihoko’s delusions.\n“You two are back? Ah, we used some stuff in the fridge. That fine?”\n“It’s fine. I said you can use them.”\nForming a contrast with Shihoko was the serene Shuuto. He was wiping his hands as he poked his head out, probably because he was washing up.\n“I’ll buy anything that’s lacking. Just use them as you please.”\n“Oh yes. There is insufficient food if you wish to stay for a few more days. I will have to shop for some. Since you are here…”\n“Ehhh, we’ll just go buy them later. We got a car anyway.”\nShihoko really doted on her adorable daughter-in-law (tentative), and gave an excited smile the moment Mahiru mentioned that she wanted to go shopping.\n“Alright. Shihoko-san and Shiina-san will be out shopping, right? Amane and I will clean up here.”\n“Eh, you’re not going, Shuuto-san?”\n“We’ll be staying for a little longer. We can talk later. You two ladies have something you wish to talk alone about, right…?”\n“Well you two men have something you want to talk about alone?”\n“Hmm, hard to say, but I do have some things to say to Amane.”\nAmane could imagine what his mother would say, but not his father. He looked towards Shuuto, only to be responded with a peaceful smile.\nIt seemed Shuuto was not going to ask Amane about what happened the previous night, which was befitting of his personality. Amane was really grateful for the respect shown, but sometimes, Shuuto’s inscrutable thoughts left him awkward.\nShuuto’s grinning eyes left Amane flustered, and he averted his eyes. Shihoko seized the opportunity to grab Mahiru’s hand, intending to drag her out.\nShe said she was going out for her own interest, but it seemed she had some place she wanted to talk to Mahiru with.\n“Let’s hurry on then. Now that we have a chance, tell me if there’s a good cafe around here~”\n“E-erm, Shihoko-san.”\n“Mahiru-chan, I have something good to tell you. We’ll talk later.”\n“S-something good…?”\n“I’ll tell you later.”\nShihoko’s beaming face was unlike Shuuto. Amane felt a shiver up his spine, but the duo left before he could stop them. Mahiru was concerned about Amane, but she followed Shihoko out. She probably was being considerate to Amane, and also curious as to what this good thing was about.\nThe house immediately got quiet, and Shuuto returned to the kitchen with a wry smile.\nAmane peered over, indicating that he wanted to help out,\nit was just an excuse,\nso Shuuto smiled, and prepared two glasses of ice coffee. His actions were so smooth, it seemed like he had expected so.\nAmane gently gulped, obediently took two persons’ worth of drinks to the living room, and sat on the living room sofa.\nShuuto sat next to him, his face still looking serene, which left Amane comfortable, scratching his cheek.\n“…You want to tell me something, dad?”\n“Well, I’m happy for you, since you’re on such good terms with Shiina-san.”\n“Thanks.”\nShuuto did not sound like he was teasing Amane, but rather, was impressed and relieved. Amane thus did not retort bluntly.\nHe knew that Shuuto was not one to question thoroughly, but he got tense thinking that it would be about his relationship with Mahiru.\nThe question he assumed did not come however,\nit’s good to have a good relationship,\nfor Shuuto merely smiled happily. Amane no longer sounded as harsh, and gone was his vigor.\n“…You’re really not saying anything?”\n“You’re going to pout out of embarrassment if I do.”\n“Shut up.”\nAmane turned his eyes aside bashfully, as though he was completely seen through, and he heard a giggle.\n“And from the looks of it, it seems nothing happened.”\nThe voice was filled with conviction, more harsh than his mother’s in a certain sense. Amane groaned as he turned towards Shuuto, and was met with a smile.\n“Well, I don’t have to say anything more, right? It is your choice, and you definitely put in thought. That’s the good thing about you, and also a detriment.”\n“…I have to do this for the sake of our futures.”\n“You’re so rational for a high school boy. My boy sure has grown. I know how smitten you are over her however.”\n“…I can’t help it.”\n“Yes, I know.”\nI’m the same after all,\nso Shuuto chuckled, and poised himself as he stared at AMane.\n“Ahh, Amane.”\n“Hm?”\n“You don’t have to worry about money though?”\nAmane froze up the moment he said so.\nBoth Amane and Mahiru had a common agreement that they would get married in the future, and thus he chose to treasure her body and future, that nothing physical would occur. The events that occurred the previous night were established based on that.\nAmane however had been thinking of practical issues, the expenses, the agreement of Mahiru’s parents, and everything else. He did not mention them to Mahiru.\nHe had the money to get married. He did think of the wedding, the residence, his income, and their married life. He could not simply get married based on a mere daydream.\nAnd thus he froze up, for he did not expect Shuuto to mention this. Shuuto gave a wry smile, as though he had expected so.\n“As your parents, and Shiina-san’s, I wish to bless you two. I hope that girl will have her joy without worries, and that my son can be happy. We can help with that much at least.”\n“…Shouldn’t we rely on ourselves for that?”\n“How long will that take?”\n“Ugh.”\nIt was a little awkward for him.\nIf he relied completely on himself, he could only prepare everything within the first two to three years of entering the workforce. He did not want to let her down over a wedding any woman would yearn for, and he wanted to see her dress and shiromuku.\nHowever, he had been struggling over this, as he knew he would have to keep her waiting.\n“Are you just going to let Shiina-san wait? Time is especially precious to a girl.”\n“Ugh…but.”\n“To me, a wedding’s the start of your journey, the last major gift we can give to you as parents. Our adorable son and daughter will be leaving our hands, living on as a couple. It is best that we chip in here.”\nShuuto finished with a smile, had some coffee to clear his throat, and continued.\n“Of course, if you two insist on doing everything, I too shall support you two. if not, we shall bless you along with Shiina-san’s parents’ share.”\nAmane knew that Shuuto and Shihoko knew about Mahiru’s family situation, and was willing to care for her instead. It was obvious that they really cared for her like their own daughter, a daughter-in-law.\nAs Shuuto said, he wanted to offer some familial warmth to Mahiru, which her own parents lacked. Amane knew that Shuuto had no intention to back off, even though he said he was willing to compromise.\nCan I really accept this though?\nShuuto seemed to have understood Amane’s thoughts, and smiled as he gently ruffled Amane’s hair.\n“You never liked to fawn and ask others to begin with. It’s not a bad thing to ask though. Let us do what us parents should do.”\n“…I think I’ve been fawning lots.”\n“Nope, you’re try to be independent even though I haven’t seen you in a rebellious phase. Your parents are feeling lonely, you know?”\nShuuto’s hand continued to ruffle Amane’s hair, and showed no intent to stop. Amane did not stop him.\nHe felt embarrassed and ticklish, but he did not dislike it. The trust and relief he had about his parents allowed him to accept these feelings earnestly.\n“You just have to be a father and show us our grandchildren. Once you have settled down, you can then worry about being filial. Shihoko-san and I are still healthy, always taking care of our bodies, and our families are usually long lived. You can continue to be filial until our deaths then.”\nShuuto chuckled as he took Amane as a child.\nThank goodness I’m their son,\nso Amane thought as he lowered his eyebrows, allowing himself to be treated as a child.",

      "content": "Once Mahiru and Shihoko returned, Shuuto’s eyes and gestures reverted to normal, and he no longer petted Amane like before.\nThat was a good thing, for it would be bad if he treated Amane like a child in front of Mahiru, though Amane himself was a little reluctant.\nHe remained silent as he wanted to appear somewhat reliable to Mahiru, and tried his best to act calm as he welcomed the duo back.\n“Welcome back. Done shopping and chatting?”\n“Of course. isn’t that so, Mahiru-chan?”\n“…Y-yes.”\nShihoko smiled earnestly, while Mahiru appeared fidgety. It was extremely likely that Shihoko said something unnecessary.\nHowever, that was not the issue at hand, so Amane acted as though nothing happened as he received what was bought.\nHe turned his eyes towards Mahiru, and she blushed, which turned his doubt into conviction, that Shihoko definitely said something unnecessary.\nHe gave Shihoko a dumbfounded look, and she calmly smiled, looking accomplished, giving him the urge to immediately ask what they talked about.\n“…Please don’t teach her anything weird.”\n“What, of course not. I merely gave Mahiru-chan some suggestions on some important things to learn about in your cohabiting life together.”\n“You’re not talking about the stuff we’ll slowly learn about?”\n“It’s not something a boy can teach. Alright, you should learn from the wisdom of your ancestors, no?”\n“…Can I ask Mahiru what this is about?”\n“Of course, you’ll understand a while later. It will be embarrassing if a man presses on too much.”\nAmane could only remain quiet at this.\nSince Mahiru was unwilling to talk, he understood that it was something complicated between the ladies, and he should not force the issue.\nHowever, he could not completely trust Shihoko, given her prior actions till this point. He had to keep this in mind, even though he might not be able to ask.\nHe gave the beaming Shihoko a cold look, and took the bag of fresh ingredients to the kitchen, into the fridge.\nThere was enough for four, double the usual portions, and he felt ticklish for some reasons.\n“…Are you curious, Amane-kun?”\nMahiru washed her hands, and poked her head out, so he gently shrugged.\n“Can’t say I”m not, but I chatted quite a lot with dad, and I don’t intend to say anything about that. We’re even.”\n“Eh, wh-what did you talk about?”\n“It’s a secret.”\nAmane smiled mischievously as Mahiru usually did, and put the vegetables into its section. Mahiru panicked and hammered at his back, resulting in him bursting out laughing.\n“…But I am not going to interfere with whatever you wish to give Mahiru-chan though.”\nShuuto said so after he ruffled Amane’s hair sufficiently.\nOf course, Amane did not intend to rely on his parents that much, and wanted to work to earn money. At the same time, he could not let his grades slip, and he had to work harder to maintain them.\n…Looks like I have to ask Kido.\nKido did invite him to do part-time work, and though there was a likelihood of it being a joke, it might a decent choice. Amane was not one used to serving customers, but this meant that he could gain more social experience.\nLooks like I have lots to work on\n, he nodded away. Mahiru looked at him uneasily.\nIt’s a secret,\nso he emphasized with a smile, and happily shut the vegetables section.",

      "content": "“Eh, I’ll ask the owner. They said they’re lacking manpower, so I think it should be fine.”\nAmane hurriedly contacted Kido, whose number he exchanged with during the preparation of the cultural festival. She in turn gave an intrigued voice.\nAmane did not intend for Mahiru to hear, for he wanted to give her a surprise, so he said this at the apartments entrance. He had assumed she would be troubled as this was too sudden a request, but he instead was troubled as it went unexpectedly smoothly.\n“No, but is there an interview or something?”\n“Probably, since some vetting’s needed. My recommendation means that you’re fine, personality-wise, but is Shiina-san fine with that? We do serve our staff well, but will Shiina-san get jealous?”\n“Erm, well…”\nA few female customers approached Amane during the cultural festival, asking for his contact, and Mahiru got jealous. Amane did not wish that Mahiru would be worried about his actions. Of course, he was not one to cast his eyes aside, and she probably trusted him, but her feelings were different matter.\n“And anyway, why did you suddenly want to work?”\nAmane clammed up the moment this simple question was asked.\nIf he shared his secret with Kido, she would not mention it to Mahiru, but it was still embarrassing of him to mention that he was saving money to buy her a ring.\nEveryone he knew already understood how much he doted on Mahiru, and he knew that, but it was not easy to profess that he was going to buy a ring.\nBut Kido might not accept his reason if he did not say so. As the one recommending work for him, it would not be good to hide the reason.\n“…Erm, it’s like this. Mind if you don’t tell anyone else? Especially Mahiru.”\n“Ah, I understand. You want to give her a gift, right? A Christmas present or something.”\n“N-not that…it’s about next year. I-I want to give her a ring…”\nAmane’s voice got softer, and by the time he was done, silence beckoned.\nYou’re still a student, aren’t you being too impatient?\nAmane anxiously awaited Kido’s response, but after a long silence of ten seconds or so,\nit’s blinding over the phone\n, she muttered so.\n“I see. Better not work at my place then. You’re working hard for Shiina-san, but if a boyfriend’s going to work at a place where he’s constantly harassed by the women, she’s not going to be happy.”\nIt was reasonable,\nof course,\nso he replied so, and started thinking of other plans, like searching for a recruitment site once he got home.\nHow about this,\nhowever, the voice came,\n“I can recommend another cafe to you. There’s one opened by my aunt. It’s quieter, and might suit your personality better.”\n“Sounds good…but you never worked there?”\n“Ah, actually, I can’t really handle her…”\n“And you’re recommending me to her? I’m sorry to trouble you.”\n“No no no, I don’t mean that. My aunt doesn’t have kids, so she really dotes on me. I’m just worried that she spoils me too much that I can’t be independent.”\nKido sounded conflicted rather than annoyed. The way her aunt treated her might be similar to how Shihoko treated Mahiru, but Shihoko clearly saw how reliable Mahiru was, and wanted to dote, which made things a little different.\n“I’ll check with my aunt. How about you make a visit there once I’m done? You’ll feel more at ease working there then.”\n“Thanks for that…but won’t I trouble you too much?”\n“It’s fine. I know you love Shiina-san, so I’ll give you a hand. You can discuss the matter of the ring with me, you know?”\n“…Well, I might have to ask you and Chitose then.”\n“Hehe, leave it to me.”\nIt would be best to inquire girls on the matter of the ring. After all, Chitose had been concerned about Amane and Chitose, and it was appropriate to ask her. He hoped that they would be present to help, if possible.\nIt would be a long time later however, so he made a vague promise,\nI’ll contact you later. Maybe we’ll talk in school\n, once Kido was done, she hung up.\n“…Work, is it?”\nMahiru was resting in the living room when he returned. He greeted her, and she seemed surprised by this as she looked over at him.\nOn a side note, his parents were cooking in the kitchen, for Mahiru said that she wanted their cooking for dinner.\n“Why are you thinking of working at this moment? We will be in our third year, and we should be preparing for our exams soon.”\nHe could not hide the matter of him working in any case, so after he mentioned so, Mahiru gave a very logical rebuttal.\nHe wanted to keep it a secret as much as possible, until he handed the ring to her, but he knew it was unnatural to start working part-time midway through his second year.\n“Ah, erm, I got something I want. Something I really, really want.”\n“Want?”\n“And also, to gain social experience. Of course, the shift won’t affect my studies. Some guys will retire from their clubs next year, and I should have saved up some money by then. I should be able to get back to focus on my studies before the mock exams. I think a condition is that I’ll do as well as those in the clubs. I worked hard for my grades, and I’m not going to let them slide, and even if I do, I’m not going to use my work as an excuse.”\nAmane had never worked, nor did he partake in any clubs, so he had more time than those who did join the clubs, and could focus on his studies. He would need to work harder if he started working.\nHe intended to improve on his studies, to pay attention in class, and immediately grasp the knowledge he was taught.\nHe looked at her sternly, and she awkwardly lowered her eyebrows.\n“I should not say more about this. I shall respect your decision since you have put your mind to it. It is just that I will feel lonely, for our time together will decrease…”\nThe somewhat forlorn smile nearly shook Amane’s resolve, but he was never going to compromise, and smiled,\n“Sorry, but I’ll tell you when I’ll be on leave then.”\n“…It sounds like that will be a problem too.”\n“Why?”\n“We-well, whenever you say so…it seems that you will really dote on me.”\n“Aren’t you lonely…?”\n“Th-there has to be a limit, or I will find it unbearable.”\nMahiru bashfully lowered her eyes, and leaned onto his arm. He grabbed her hand, as a practice, and pulled her closer.",

      "content": "The rest day after the cultural festival ended, but the intensity of the cultural festival in school had yet to dissipate, and the students still seemed flippant.\nThe class was a little more rowdier than usual, and from time to time, the classmates started talking about how certain so and sos from a certain class started dating, and one had to figure that the cultural festival truly was influential in inducing BGR.\nThere were occasional stares upon them, towards Mahiru especially. Some might be discussing about her looks during the cultural festival.\n“Morns~”\nItsuki entered the classroom, completely lethargic, and went to Amane, who casually waved back,\nmorning,\nobserving the former’s expression.\nItsuki probably would be in a bad mood if Daiki said anything, but he seemed normal, and Amane was relieved.\n“Morning too, Shiina-san. Today…hm?”\n“Good morning. Is something the matter?”\nItsuki naturally went over to Mahiru with a gleeful smile, but he narrowed his eyes in shock once he saw Mahiru’s face.\n“…Say Amane, come here.”\n“Eh?”\n“Just come here.”\nItsuki summoned Amane over for some reason, so Amane frowned, and was dragged to a corner of the classroom.\nItsuki then went over, and whispered, as though he did not want to be overheard.\n“Say, did you cross the line with Shiina-san?”\n“Huh!?”\n“Huh your head. Why else would I call you here? I think she’s changed somewhat…the distance between you feels different. It’s like you’re married…”\nOnce Itsuki noted that the mood seemed different, Amane glanced towards Mahiru.\nShe was seated quietly at Amane’s place, looking at him intriguingly, and once their eyes met, she got shy.\n“Hm, she’s a little more charming…it’s like she’s already married to you.”\n“…Just to note, we didn’t touch home plate.”\n“Heh, home plate huh?”\nAmane noted ambiguously, and Itsuki leered away as though he had seen through everything. Amane then jabbed at Itsuki’s flank to rid the latter of that annoying face.\nAmane did exert some strength into it,\ndon’t be shy,\nbut Itsuki teased, and it seemed it was not very effective.\nAmane then kicked him instead, and sighed.\nHe was terrified that Itsuki could detect that change, but either way, he did intend to inform Itsuki and Chitose of his future plans. He did not intend to tell them how much he and Mahiru knew of each other’s bodies, but he would at least mention that there was an order to his plans.\n“…I don’t have plans for that. I made a promise with Mahiru.”\n“Promise?”\n“Yeah, until she’s 18. I swore that I’ll take responsibility for her life, and asked her to wait until then.”\nOnce again, he found it embarrassing to mention this promise to someone else. Once he was done, Itsuki widened his eyes, and looked at Amane with two conflicting emotions, speechless and yet impressed.\n“Man, I’m rather impressed by your endurance and seriousness, but are you fine with that? In more ways than one.”\n“…I think there may be issues, but there aren’t any yet. I want to cherish her, and I’m serious.”\nSince he found someone he wanted to accompany for the rest of his life, he should respect and cherish her.\nTo be honest, he was a little worried that he might not last until then, but it would be shameful of him to break that promise, which he could not allow himself to. That was why he intended to hang on.\n“I intend to live together with Mahiru after graduation, so I’m planning for that now.”\n“Planning, as in?”\n“Ah, Fujimiya-kun, morning. What are you loitering here for?”\nKido so happened to enter the classroom. Amane waved at her, and she gave the boys a skeptical look.\n“You two boys are acting weird. Something unspeakable? I think Akazawa-kun’s asking Fujimiya-kun something weird again.”\n“Am I that untrustworthy!?”\n“Ahaha.”\nKido brushed off the matter with a laugh. It seemed that once she saw Amane, she wondered if she could inform him. She glanced aside at Itsuki, probably hinting at the latter’s presence, inquiring if she could mention it at this point, or later.\nAmane had no intention of hiding the fact that he would be working part-time, and he wanted to inform Itsuki of the reason. He took the initiative,\neverything okay about what I asked you?\nKido seemed relieved, and smiled.\n“My aunt said the part-time work is fine, so she hoped that you’ll inform her when you’re free.”\n“Yep, got it. We’ll talk later.”\n“Alright.”\n“Sorry to trouble you.”\n“It’s fine. Aunt said she’s happy that I’m asking her for something.”\nKido gave a gaudy smile, and Amane too gave a wry smile.\nKido, who was so loved by her aunt, looked flustered, and Amane was grateful that she could introduce work to him.\nWe’ll talk\nlater, Kido waved, and went to her seat. After that, Amane looked towards Itsuki, and found the latter nodding understandingly.\n“I get it. You have it tough.”\n“Dad’s willing to pay for the marriage and stuff, but I should at least settle the ring. It’s my choice, and I should suffer this much now for my wish.”\n“You really put your mind to it. It’s amazing, but…”\n“But what?”\n“…Shouldn’t you have discussed this with me?”\nItsuki pouted, and Amane widened his eyes, before ruffling Itsuki’s head,\nI’ll ask you next time.\nItsuki seemed a little conflicted as he waved Amane’s hand aside, and slapped the latter’s shoulder. Amane knew that Itsuki was being embarrassed, and grinned away just as Itsuki just did.",

      "content": "“Ahaha, no wonder Ikkun’s pouting.”\nIt was after lunch, and Chitose was wondering why Itsuki was pouting a little this morning, so she called out Amane to ask.\nAmane obliged, and she burst out laughing, slapping his back. He frowned, but her attacks were relentless, becoming more intense, and even looking dumbfounded.\n“Say, Ikkun has so many friends who can help, but you asked someone else. It’s no wonder that he’s pouting. The closest to you other than Mahirun is Ikkun.”\n“Ugh, I’m a little sorry about that too.”\nAmane asked Kido as the latter had once invited him to work part time, and Itsuki was unhappy about that. Itsuki was the closest male friend Amane had, and Amane had always looked to him for help. Truth be told, he was a little sorry to not look for Itsuki this time.\n“Ikkun hopes that you’ll ask him for help. He always thought you two are buddies.”\n“…I’m really sorry.”\n“Hm, if you’re really sorry, how about you discuss something with him? You can ask him too.”\nChitose grinned away, and lifted her head towards Amane, who froze up.\n“…You’re not angry too, are you?”\n“Fufu.”\nChitose’s smile was strangely glowing, seemingly sincere, but her eyes were devoid of a smile. She usually gave an innocent smile, but it was hard to describe so this time.\n“Think about it. You spent a year and a half with him, and you’re not asking him for help? It’s no wonder he’s sad.”\n“Ugh, I-I’m really sorry. I’ll take note of that next time.”\n“Goodness me. You’re overthinking it. Anyway, you can’t keep it a secret from Mahirun if you don’t tell us, you know? You want to give her a surprise, right?”\n“…Yeah.”\n“Then you should have told us.”\nAmane’s flank was being hammered away, but he deserved it, and he did not reach his hand out to stop it.\nAfter punching Amane for quite a while, Chitose let out a long sigh, and changed topics.\n“Well, you’re thinking about your future with Mahirun, and I can tell how much you love her. I can’t imagine you being heads over heels for her when looking at your past self though.”\n“Shut up.”\nAmane too knew that he doted on Mahiru far more than he did before. He sensed that he was getting closer to others. It was not just thanks to Mahiru, he also had to thank Itsuki, Chitose and the others.\nHe was a little unhappy to be said that he was heads over heels, but the undeniable fact was that he truly loved her.\nEven so, he inadvertently frowned, for he was told this straight to the face.\n“Anyway, I made up my mind. So well, please help me out.”\nAmane wanted assistance from a feminine perspective, and also from a friend. He bowed solemnly to formally request, only to be met by a reluctant sigh.\n“You don’t have to say it~ it’s for the happiness of my good friend after all~”\n“Chitose…?”\n“I mean Mahirun, you know? You’re overthinking it. Hold up~”\n“Ugh…alright.”\n“Fufu, just joking. You two are important friends to me. The most important thing is that this ends well, and I’ll chip in with whatever I can.”\nAmane lifted his head, and saw Chitose giving her usual hearty smile, puffing her chest. He too was relieved, and chuckled as he slapped Chitose on the shoulder.",

      "content": "“Hm, you got something with Chitose today?”\nIt was after school, and Amane intended to return home with Mahiru, only for her to reject him apologetically. He smiled, and easily accepted so.\nHe never intended to bind her, and it was not that they had to be together. He was however unsure as to why Mahiru was concerned about his thoughts.\n“Erm, I may be returning home late, but it should be fine with Shihoko-san alround.”\n“Why mention mom?”\nHis parents had yet to return home. They planned to do so the next day, and said that they would be touring around.\n“Hm, Shihoko-san said she wants to chat with Chitose-san…”\n“I think she’s just say something unnecessary.”\n“Haha. I do not think so…”\n“Mom might. You’ll have to stop her.”\nThough he said so, Amane knew that there was a possibility that Mahiru would not stop them, as she too might want to hear, or that if Shihoko was too forceful for her to stop. He did not pin much hope into it.\nStop her from revealing my black history at least,\nso Amane earnestly wished as he stared at Mahiru. He had no intention of showing such a passionate look, but she blushed and averted her eyes.\nChitose, who was preparing to head back, saw that, and laughed away.\n“Yes yes, husband and wife, what are you doing?”\n“Just worried that mom will say anything weird to you.”\n“You’re finally not refuting that you’re husband and wife…but anyway, I thought something happened from the way you two looked at each other. You don’t have to worry.”\n“My mom’s a blabbermouth. She’s able to say anything with a grin.”\n“Ohhh? So you mean there’s something embarrassing about you?”\n“Not really. It’s just that I don’t want her talking about my childhood. Let’s put it this way, you won’t like it if people started talking about your middle school days, right?”\n“Ugh, yeah…”\nItsuki only became friends with Chitose in middle school, and according to Itsuki and Kadowaki, the Chitose back then was a complete opposite.\nShe was unwilling to mention them, and deemed them a black history.\nYou know what I’m going to do if you ask too much, right?\nSo Amane hinted with his eyes, and she shrugged,\ngot it, got\nit, she nodded away.\n“But another thing, I want a proper chat with Shihoko-san. It’s not about you.”\n“What’s that about then?”\n“A girl’s secret~ anyway, I’ll borrow your wife then.”\nChitose grinned away as she latched onto Mahiru’s arm, and the latter lowered her eyes bashfully, yet walked alongside elatedly.\nIt should be fine if Mahiru was fine, but Amane was still a little worried about what they would chat about.\n“Eh, you two aren’t going home together?”\nDon’t talk about anything weird though,\nso Amane sent his thoughts towards his mother elsewhere as he watched the duo being on such good terms, clinging to each other. Then, a girl suddenly appeared.\n“Kido? Ah, those two got something on.”\n“I see. Shiina-san, can I borrow your husband?”\n“Heh?”\n“If Fujimiya-kun has nothing going on, I’ll like to borrow him for a while. Ah, don’t worry, it’s not like that.”\n“E-erm, I am not worried about that…”\nKido was asking Amane out, and it probably was about the part-time work.\nThis might be the perfect opportunity for him to get everything sorted, with his parents around, the assumption he would be hired on the spot, a contract, and his guardians’ consent.\n“Are you free today, Fujimiya-kun?”\n“Yeah. No plans today.”\n“That’s good. The shop’s open. I can’t really interrupt when you two are always together.”\n“Has it really been? We don’t always stick together even at home.”\n“You say that, but you two are at the same place, right? it’s like you’ve taken your home for granted. You two are really flirty~”\nAmane could not refute when Kido pointed out that couples would not usually spend that much time together, and went quiet. Kido giggled, clearly enjoying herself.\n“Well, that’s because you two are on such good terms, and you treasure her, right, Fujimiya-kun?”\n“…Yeah. Can’t I?”\n“It’s a good thing actually. I feel warm and fuzzy just by looking. Shiina-san’s really doted on.”\nThe mention of Mahiru being doted on left her really bashful, and everyone else became a victim, which she somehow did not realize. It seemed Kido was being intentional, but as Amane owed her a huge favor, he could not begrudge her.\nJust don’t mention why I’m working.\nHowever, Amane hinted so with his eyes, and Kido laughed, and gave a thumbs up. He sighed, and did not press on.",

      "content": "Amane left Chitose and Mahiru, and went along with Kido.\nIt seemed he would have to take a train to the workplace, but it was a lot closer than Itsuki and Chitose’s place, and he should have no problems commuting there.\nThe problem was whether he would be hired…so he asked Kido,\ndon’t worry,\nwho smiled back.\n“Aunt’s shop doesn’t have a lot of people there. There has been more customers there recently, and they’re lacking manpower. They’re hiring polite people, and they’ll be more than happy to have your request. You don’t have to worry about that.”\n“I don’t know if I can be considered polite though.”\nAmane would never intentionally offend anyone, but his courtesy remained in doubt. He felt he knew some basic etiquette, but he dared not say that it would suffice.\n“You’re able to show the appropriate attitudes to different people though. You’re very polite to the teachers, and you act like an honor student.”\n“Well, they’re our elders…I rather receive care from them than have their eyes on me. It’s better to leave a good impression on the teachers.”\nOf course, Amane would treat the elderly or his superiors with respect, but he had some indecent motives too, that a good impression from the teachers would grant him benefits in his grades and his future graduation. It did not encompass everything, but it was part of his thought process. He was not exactly a model student.\nEven he found himself a little indecent to actually think about these things. He shrugged, and Kido giggled.\n“But that’s good, isn’t it? The important thing is to be polite and courteous, act according to time, place and occasion, and respect others. Whether you have the motives, the only thing that can be seen is the outcome.”\n“…You’re that kind of person, Kido?”\n“Didn’t think so? I’m actually capable of acting based on the situation. I’m not going to seek the benefits in everything, but I’ll do so in certain areas, but that’s to be expected. I can’t just always act on goodwill.”\nKido made it sound easy, but the thought process was serious by itself. Amane’s eyes widened, partly not out of malice or disdain, but more of a kindred spirit.\n“It’s the same this time. I’m suggesting this because it benefits me too. It’s not completely out of goodwill.”\nOne could see how kind Kido was from how she could easily say this. With a slightly wry smile,\nwhat’s the benefit this time,\nAmane asked,\n“Uuu…I want Socchan to have more friends.”\n“Kayano?”\n“Yeah. Actually, he’s very honest, always spacing out, and doesn’t have much interest in anything else, but he does have a good impression on you, and he probably gets along well with a calm person like you. That’s what I thought, and since you’re looking for part-time work, I introduced my aunt’s shop to you to solve the manpower issues, and also because Socchan’s working there.”\nSorry, but it really helps me out a lot here,\nKido apologized, sounding rather despondent. Amane shook his head, and smiled.\n“Don’t worry. I’m a little shocked to know now that Kayano’s working there, but you’re introducing work for me. I’m more relieved that a schoolmate’s there.”\n“Really? Thank goodness.”\nKido’s tension was immediately gone, and Amane firmly believed then that Kido was still a good person.\n“That aside, your boyfriend’s working at your aunt’s, but you’re not working there?”\n“Ugh, well, my aunt likes me, and she loves it when Socchan and I are together…she’s giving us happy looks whenever we’re together, and we can’t get work done. She really doted on us since young. Also, whenever Socchan’s next to me, I’ll look at him, and he’ll go all, stop, your drool’s coming out.”\n“…Pfft.”\n“Yo-you’re laughing? I know the time and place. I’m not going to drool in front of anyone else.”\nKido raised her eyebrows, her face somewhat blushing, but all the vigor was gone from her words, and Amane wanted to burst out laughing. He decided not to play pretense, and deliberately let it out.",

      "content": "Amane coaxed Kido, and they finally arrived at a tranquil cafe. It was elegant, seemingly directed at an older demographic, and gave a posh vibe.\n“…It’s really here?”\n“What are you wondering about? It’s quiet. Isn’t it good?”\n“Looks good, but isn’t it inappropriate for students to work here?”\n“That’s why I’m getting a reliable one like you here. Alright, go greet aunt first.”\nThough I don’t really want to go\nin… so Kido quipped while giving an enthusiastic facade. Amane followed Kido with a wry smile, curious as to what kind of person this aunt was.\nHe opened the heavy doors, and there was a light doorbell chime, nostalgic even.\nKido led Amane into the cafe, and the interior was no inferior to the exterior, simplistic, elegant, white and ark oak as base colors, the shop thoroughly swept and cleaned, brimming with sophistry.\nThere was a bookshelf filling an entire wall, crammed full with books.\nThere were only a few seats on first glance, incomparable to those chain cafes, and it was obvious that it was a cafe manned by a sole proprietor.\nThis was the one difference from a chain cafe, it was very quiet, and a small space ideal for relaxation.\nIt so happened that there was no customer, and Amane scanned the shop. Entering from the inside door was a lady of vague age, dressed in a navy blue apron.\nShe was a calm lady, and appeared to be a dozen years older than him.\nShe was a long, black haired beauty, who appeared to be suitable for a cafe, or an antiquarian bookshop. She was so serene, it was hard to believe she was Kido’s aunt.\n“Oh…Ayaka-san, welcome.”\n“It has been a while, aunt Fumika.”\nKido bowed politely, and the lady called Fumika gave Kido a serene look, smiling.\n“Glad to see you here. You aren’t here whenever Souji-kun is around. I’m a little lonely.”\n“Uu, sorry…I’m worried about disturbing you, aunt.”\n“What’s there to worry about…I’m happy just to see you two. I’m more motivated to work.”\nThat’s a problem too,\nit seemed Kido’s little murmur did not reach the lady’s ears.\nAmane watched the duo from behind, and looked confused.\nThe lady appeared elegant in appearance and gestures, and there was nothing he could infer to suggest that Kido had trouble dealing with her. He could only feel troubled, and it seemed the lady was a normal one, just from observing their conversation.\nTruth be told, her eyes were simply emitting familial love towards Kido. He did not understand why Kido said that she could not handle her aunt.\nPeople had aspects they could not deal with, and though there was nothing more to it, the situation left him unable to accept.\nThe lady suddenly looked towards Amane, while Kido looked a little timid.\nHer dark black eyes appeared to be probing something for a single moment, only to become tender.\n“So this is the part-timer you’re introducing, Ayaka-san?”\n“Ah, yes. He wants to work. Fujimiya-kun, this is the owner of the shop, Fumika Itomaki-san. My paternal aunt.”\n“I’m Amane Fujimiya. I’m grateful to have your precious time.”\n“Well…it’s fine. It’s something Ayaka-san requested. Her recommendations are great, and I think it should be fine.”\nItomaki showed a tender smile, scanned Amane up and down, and smiled.\n“Anyway, what’s your relationship with Ayaka-san?”\n“Just classmates, she’s a friend of my lover.”\nA strange chill struck Amane for some reason, so he insisted. Itomaki’s smile grew radiant, and the intimidating chill vanished. It seemed this was the correct answer.\n“That’s good. Ayaka-san and Souji-kun are always so lovey-dovey. It’ll be troublesome if she has an affair.”\n“That’s impossible. I made a promise to spend my eternity with my lover.”\n“Wow, that’s amazing…!”\nHer dark black eyes immediately sparkled, glowing even. Amane inadvertently retreated, but Itomaki did not mind as she blushed, looking like a maiden in love. Amane then started to understand, little by little, what Kido was bad at dealing with.\n“You made up your mind at this age? That’s great. Is this also the reason why you want to work?”\n“Erm, well, I want to give her a ring…!”\n“Wonderful! Yes, yes, if you’re willing, please work here…!”\n“It’s decided!? Well, I already knew that…!”\nAmane was stunned to be hired without a proper interview. Kido looked dumbfounded and perturbed, and sighed, while Itomaki grinned away, clearly elated.\n“Aunt, please don’t ask too much.”\n“Oh my, I won’t ask about anything he won’t talk about. But do you mind telling, how did you two get together…”\n“Please hold back a little. Fujimiya-kun will be pitiful if he ends up as part of your hobby an work.”\n“I’ll ask for consent. Just a little background, maybe?”\n“Hobby and work,,,?”\n“Aunt Fumika’s actual job isn’t the cafe. She’s actually an author, and working on a few other stuff, but for some reason, she runs a cafe…”\nAnd amazingly, she’s earning money,\nKido muttered. Amane turned towards Itomaki, who was giving a really meaningful smile.\n“Of course, I’ll run the cafe properly and ensure that it won’t close. I’ll pay you sufficiently.”\n“Aunt, do pay their salaries on time. Don’t give them money straight out of your pockets.”\n“You don’t have to worry about that…”\nKido started to lecture the frowning Itomaki. Amane did not know if he could work here, and started to worry.",

      "content": "For good or bad, Amane was hired on the spot, and after receiving the contract form, he returned home.\nIt was said to be an interview, but it was merely a meetup. It seemed Itomaki was really fond of him, and he was relieved.\nHe did not know if it would be a problem if he agreed so readily, but it was a good thing to have a job.\nAll he needed was a signature and a stamp from himself, and his parents, and send the contract over.\nKido apologized to Amane on the way back, but Amane already heard from Kido that Itomaki had a strong personality, and it was no wonder then that Kido was terrified. Itomaki was someone who would impose herself, though in a different way from Shihoko.\n“I’m back…eh, where Mahiru and mom?”\n“They said they’ll be out for dinner, two of them, ah no, three. It’s too sudden, so I’m staying home to watch the house. I’ll be making dinner tonight.”\n“Oh.”\nShuuto welcomed Amane home, said so, and Amane responded.\nAmane did hear that the ladies were going out, but did not expect them to eat out for dinner. It certainly showed that they really got along well, which was a good thing. Too bad though that Mahiru was not around to cook, for it was what Amane looked forward to for the whole day.\nOf course, he had nothing to complain about Shuuto’s food. His father liked to cook, and was good at it, exceptionally good. Amane was familiar with the tastes.\nBut to him, the matter was simply that Mahiru’s cooking was special.\n“Don’t show your disappointment that much.”\n“I-I don’t mean that.”\n“Alright alright, who knows how many times you’ll get to eat your parents’ cooking. Just be patient with me. You’ll get to eat her cooking starting tomorrow.”\nShuuto sounded as though he did not have long to live, but he probably meant that once Amane graduated from high school, he would get married, start a family, and this would be one of the few times he would get to eat Shuuto’s cooking.\nHis parents would go on regular hospital visits, and were still relatively healthy. Their families were rather long-lived, and Amane did not have to worry about that.\nIn any case, Shuuto was teasing Amane.\nAmane frowned, and Shuuto merely chuckled. He turned his head aside, and went to his room to get changed.\nAfter having his father’s meat sauce pasta, Amane took a little break, and then heard the door unlocked. Mahiru and his mother should be back.\nHe went to the door, since it was not often that he got to welcome Mahiru back. They were there, holding a bunch of bags.\n“…Why so much stuff?”\n“Ah don’t worry, we got yours.”\n“I don’t care about that. I’m just wondering why you have so many. What did you buy anyway?”\n“I wanted to buy clothes for Mahiru-chan, cute little things. I also bought some clothes she chose for you. She really wants you to wear them, you know?”\n“Well, if you’re saying really, I know that means they aren’t clothes I’ll usually wear.”\nAmane was conflicted that his mother bought clothes for him. Since Mahiru chose them however, it probably was not too outlandish.\nHe would ask Mahiru about it later on. In any case, there were too many bags.\nAnd before he could point that out, Shihoko gave a hearty smile, and passed Amane by. Amane then looked at Mahiru, who stayed behind.\n“…There’s nothing weird, right?”\n“Th-there is nothing weird…?”\n“Sure, let’s go with it.”\nAmane was relieved while Mahiru looked skeptical for some reason, and received the bags from her. He did not know if they were hers, but he could not let her hold them.\n“Anyway, how is the visit to the workplace?”\n“Hm, well, liked me enough, said I’m hired.”\n“How is the owner like?”\n“Actually, she’s a big sister with quite the personality, I guess…?”\n“Big sister?”\n“Don’t worry, she loves to see couples and watch them closely. She wants to hear how we got together too.”\nAmane prefaced this before Mahiru was about to be jealous, and she blushed, shriveling in embarrassment.\n“…I, I am not doubting anything, you know? I am just thinking, what will happen if she falls for you?”\n“No way no way.”\n“She will.”\nMahiru emphasized so for some reason, and Amane responded with a wry smile, gently patted her head, feeling sorry for worrying her.\nThe somewhat displeased look she had initially started to ease up, and so Amane gently slid his hand through her hair, enjoying that softness.\n“Even if that’s the case, I won’t agree. I’ll quit my job if it affects business.”\n“Y-you do not have to do so…I am just a little frustrated.”\n“Hm, well, if my girlfriend’s unhappy, I might as well not work there. I’m not aiming to work there, I’m aiming to get enough money.”\nIt seemed nobody would actually hit on Amane, and if there was a really unlikely instance happening, he would have to look elsewhere, even if he was sorry to Kido.\nThe job was for the sake of granting Mahiru happiness, and if he ended up causing her sadness, he could actually leave. There were other means.\nSo don’t worry,\nso Amane added on, and Mahiru buried her face into his chest.\n“What is it?”\n“…This is what I like about you?”\n“This is?”\n“This too, fool.”\nAmane teased Mahiru, who seemed to pout as she headbutted his chest. He took it on with a smile, and gently patted her back.",

      "content": "“So you made up your mind.”\nUpon hearing Itsuki’s question the next day, Amane nodded earnestly, and Itsuki shrugged.\n“I don’t have to worry about anything if it’s Kido’s recommendation, and anyway, it’s a good thing that you settled on one. I”m just wondering what you have to say.”\n“Hm, well, she’s quite the personality.”\n“If you say so, then she probably is.”\nNow I’m curious,\nItsuki leaned his entire body onto the chair, and Amane showed a wry smile, but he did not intend to say so. If he did, Itsuki would probably visit him soon.\nAt the very least, given that he would be starting work, he did not intend for any of his acquaintances to visit him until he got used to it, or even Mahiru.\nMahiru kicked quite the fuss when Amane told her so in the morning, and 10 minutes or so was spent coaxing and doting on her.\nSpeaking of Mahiru, she was chatting with Chitose, and it seemed the latter was leering at him. Amane decided to ignore her, for any reaction he showed would make Chitose gleeful.\n“Well, I think she does have her quirks, but I should be able to work there. Kido said that if there’s anything, I can look for Kayano.”\n“Ah, her boyfriend, right? The guy with the hidden muscles.”\n“He’ll probably feel weird about it if you say that to him…and he’ll give Kido a condescending look.”\nKayano would most probably direct his ire towards Kido, who pointed this out, rather than the person saying so.\nKido herself probably showed no remorse, and Kayano really had it tough.\n“Well, I’m quite relieved that there’s someone I know there. According to the owner, the regulars are usually of the older demographic, easygoing folk, so it shouldn’t be too difficult.”\n“Oh, that’s good. Anyway, congrats on confirming your part-time job. If there’s anything, don’t forget to discuss with me next time.”\n“Alright alright. I’ll rely on you, buddy.”\nIt seemed Itsuki still had a grudge over it. Amane slapped Itsuki hard in the back, and the latter appeared to be hiding his embarrassment as he turned his lips into a scowl, slapping back at Amane’s back with more strength.\nIt was his show of friendship,\nyou bastard,\nand Amane coughed as he laughed, gently nudging his fist onto Itsuki’s cheek.\nWhile giving the tense cheek a strange attack, Amane glanced aside at Mahiru. She was looking at them with her cheeks puffed, seemingly displeased.\nShe probably was unhappy that she could not visit him at his workplace.\nHowever, it seemed she could understand the rationale. She agreed to compromise during their sweet time in the morning, so it should be fine.\nItsuki looked over at where Amane was looking,\nyou really are loved,\nso he suddenly teased. Amane frowned, and Itsuki gently shook off the fist, laughing,\n“Anyway, what did Shiina-san, Chii and your mom buy yesterday? Chii said that she had fun choosing your clothes. What did Shiina-san buy?”\n“…Do I have to say it?”\n“Yeah, the buddy who abandoned me.”\n“You still have a grudge over that…erm, what’s that actually…cat pajamas.”\nAmane recalled what Mahiru took out from the bag the previous night, and unwillingly said so. Itsuki immediately burst out laughing.\n“Y-you, wearing cat pajamas…!?”\n“Shut up. Mahiru will be wearing bunny pajamas. It’s fine.”\nIt was obviously shameful for someone of this age and physique to wear cute pajamas to sleep, but since Mahiru gave him expectant looks, he had no choice but to wear it.\nAnd thus, Mahiru bought for herself pink bunny themed pajamas, and he wanted her to wear it during the next stayover.\nIt was a lot healthier than the baby doll dress she wore the last time, and he could last longer, his heart would be more at ease.\n“I’ll get Shiina-san to send over a photo of you in your pajamas.”\n“Oy stop it.”\n“It’s fine. It should be cute, yeah.”\n“Hide your wincing lips when you say that, you idio.”\nThe ends of Itsuki’s lips were twitching, and he made a strange resolve. Amane slapped at his shoulder, and he did not retaliate, instead shivering and reining in his laughter.\nThey really get along well~. Of course.\nAnd a little further away, Chitose and Mahiru nodded away as they chimed in. Amane grimaced, and launched gentle attacks on Itsuki.",

      "content": "Usually, Amane would be eating lunch together with Mahiru, but on this day, he ended up eating with Kido and Kayano, on Kido’s invitation.\nKido did not mention so, but she probably intended for it to be an icebreaker between Amane and the soon-to-be colleague Kayano.\nAmane was summoned to the rooftop, and it seemed Kayano was already there with a leisure sheet laid out. He did not move, and might have known that Amane would be here.\n“So anyway, Fujimiya-kun and Socchan will be working together.”\nAmane took a corner of the sheet, and sat down. Kido looked at him, and gave a genial smile.\n“Oh…so Ayaka dragged you down?”\n“H-how rude! I just chose someone appropriate for an appropriate workplace~!”\nKido’s angry side seemed a little more immature than her usual self, and she probably only showed this side to Kayano. Anyone watching would feel warm and fuzzy.\n“Actually no, I suggested this. Kido helped me out.”\n“Really? But isn’t Fumika-san troubled?”\n“Well…”\nAmane was a little stumped, for he did not expect Itomaki to be such a person. Nevertheless, she did not seem to be a bad person, just that she might be a little more honest if sufficient fuel was provided, and he should be fine if he provided a story that did not involve him much.\nHe could mentally prepare himself however if he was sufficiently reminded beforehand. He really wanted to protest to Kido pertaining to this.\nHe glanced aside at Kido, who tensed up the moment she opened her bento box.\n“Well, how do I put it? People like Fumika-san have quite the personality.”\n“Well actually, I just want to work. She doesn’t seem like a bad person.”\n“She’s a nice person, but well, if she really likes you, she’ll dote on you. Sometimes, her delusions might be a little more serious.”\n“I’ll sacrifice myself then. There’s no bodily harm, right?”\n“…Probably not. Hm, well, sorta.”\nCan you please don’t lack confidence here?\nAmane hesitated over whether he should retort, but he decided not to as it was not because of Kido. He then opened the bento Mahiru made.\nShuuto made pasta for dinner the previous night, so it contained the leftovers, along with the side dishes both Mahiru and Shuuto made.\nHe really felt apologetic to have them cook these side dishes for him so early in the morning, but he could not bring himself to stop them since they seemed really happy about this.\nOn a side note, Amane’s parents would be leaving before his return, so they bade farewell that morning. It was a short time, probably because he agreed to return home during the winter break.\nMahiru however looked reluctant as she sent them off with a smile, since they would still meet again.\n“Ah, Shiina-san made it?”\nAmane opened the lid, found the dashimaki Mahiru made, and was content. Kido observed Amane, showed a smile brimming with curiosity, and asked,\n“Mahiru and dad made it, actually. My dad’s still around.”\n“Your dad can cook? Mine too. Mom can’t cook, and can’t do housework. Dad does everything.”\n“I think Kaori-san’s a special case though.”\nIt seemed Kaori was the name of Kido’s mother. It seemed she was completely incapable of housework.\n“That’s why my parents hope that I can do housework. Ah, I can though.”\n“They want to raise you as a good girl, and they really did, but you somehow end up with a muscle fetish. I’m about to cry.”\n“It’s your fault, Socchan.”\n“Don’t push the blame.”\nKayano pinched at Kido’s cheeks, and the latter protested while making vague noises. Amane burst out laughing.\nSuch was the distance between childhood friends, though it was probably because they were still dating. It was a refreshing feeling to see another couple different from Itsuki and Chitose.\n“…Wh-what are you laughing at?”\n“Nothing, just that you two are on good terms.”\n“You don’t have the right to say that. You’re being so flirty with Shiina-san.”\n“It’s not exactly what you say.”\n“In any case, you’re flirting so much, it’s blinding me.”\nKido pointed her index finger at Amane,\nstop pointing fingers,\nand Kayano grabbed her hand.\nNice chemistry,\nAmane thought, and sighed silently.\n“…I don’t mean that.”\n“So that’s just you being all lovey-dovey every day? That’s amazing.”\n“Shut up.”\n“But Shiina-san’s the reason why you can make up your mind to work. I think it’s great to act for the future.”\n“…Oh, so you’re suddenly starting with part-time work because of Shiina-san?”\nKayano did not know of this, not because Kido did not mention so, but because Amane told Kido not to go around talking about it. Kayano nodded understandingly, and Kido looked a little distraught.\nShe might be worried, thinking that she did not abide by her promise, and blurted out that he was working for Mahiru’s sake.\nWell, since Amane would be colleagues with Kayano, it was pointless to conceal the fact, and it was a matter of time until he would be questioned. It was fine as long as nobody mentioned so to Amane.\n“Keep it a secret from Mahiru. I want to surprise her.”\n“You hear that Socchan? You can’t say that.”\n“You’re the blabbermouth Ayaka.”\n“Owie.”\nKido got a flick on the forehead, and covered it while looking teary. Kayano gave her a reluctant glance, and saw a speechless Amane, only to smile awkwardly.\n“Anyway, I understand. I’ll help you out however I can.”\n“…Thanks.”\n“Thank you too for being able to be friends with Ayaka.”\n“…Eh, no way, I’m not at the point where I need you to worry about me, Socchan.”\n“But you always blurt things out.”\n“I do not!”\nKido pouted upon hearing Kayano’s criticism, slapping at the abs that were said to be healthy if he stripped (according to Kido). Amane watched on, feeling all warm and fuzzy.",

      "content": "“Ah, about work, you’ll have to wait a while. Probably for a week or two, since they’ll have to arrange your shift and prepare your uniform.”\nThe duo stopped their couple bicker, and started eating again when Kido suddenly remembered and muttered so.\n“Well, it’s not like I’m hoping to start immediately. What uniform?”\n“Ahhh, it’s not as fancy as the festival. It’ll be simpler, don’t worry. Same goes for the female ones, it’s not all frilly like that.”\n“And I’ve been wondering what would I do if it’s as impressive as that cafe.\nThe other staff were at the back counter when he met Itomaki, and he did not know what they were wearing, but they were not clothes he had to worry about. He was relieved.\nThe clothes worn during the cultural festival was a little more formal, and somewhat glamorous. It would be unbearable to wear such clothes, even though it was for work.\n“Ah, I told them about your sizes, Fujimiya-kun. Is that fine?”\n“I’m fine with that, but how did you know?”\n“I saw them during the festival. And it’s obvious anyway.”\nA guy’s sizes is mostly the same through the clothes,\nshe smiled. Perhaps it was the skill she obtained from her muscle fetish. Next to her, Kayano clearly looked dumbfounded,\njust call her for what she is, a pervert,\nand said these words that were a little rude to her.\n“I can only get a rough idea of course, and I can’t really tell the muscle mass without touching…ah, it’s not sexual harassment. I’ll ask for permission before checking.”\n“O-okay…yep, saves the effort of telling her the sizes…I guess.”\n“Look Ayaka, he’s scared of you. You don’t have to praise this person, Fujimiya.”\n“Don’t speak of me like a complete stranger.”\nKido pouted, and looked really adorable as she fumed away. Once her eyes met Amane’s, she lowered her eyes apologetically.\n“Sorry for showing you such an embarrassing side.”\n“Hm? It’s fine. It’s not the first time.”\n“Ugh, that hurts. But you’re not wrong…I basically showed it during the festival…”\n“Hm, well, I understand that you have different interests from others, and I don’t really think any different about it…as long as it doesn’t hurt everyone. Everyone has their own interests, and I don’t really feel uncomfortable, or that I’ll badmouth anyone.”\nEveryone had their own good points, and should be respected as long as they did not harm others. Amane never thought of excluding anyone just because of some differences; that was not what he was taught at home.\nAnd also, he really could not assume it had nothing to do with him, since recently, he had a feeling that Mahiru was starting to have a muscle fetish.\nHe did not intend to reject or deny anyone, but he was a little terrified, so he remained tentative.\nAnyway, I don’t really have the right to grumble about anyone.\nAmane muttered so as he picked up the dashimaki Mahiru made. Kido then shivered, seemingly impressed, and then she smiled as she slapped at Amane’s shoulder.\n“You’re really well taught, or a good person, Fujimiya-kun! No wonder Shiina-san likes you!”\n“…Ayaka.”\n“What is it Socchan? You jealous? Relax, I’m focused on you…”\n“Ah, I know that, but you just hit Fujimiya…”\nAmane lost his grip on the chopsticks when he got slapped, and the dashimaki rolled onto the black vinegar sauce coasted on the meat dumplings made by her.\nLuckily, it did not fall onto the sheet or his clothes, but he liked the delicate taste of the dashimaki. He was stunned, stupefied, that the taste had changed. Kayano assumed that Kido had knocked him out.\nAmane stared at the dashimaki covered in dark brown sauce, which caused Kido to panic.\n“So-sorry! I didn’t mean it!”\n“I-it’s fine, it’s still edible. I’ll just eat off the skin first…”\n“Woah you look so sad! I’m really sorry! I’ll kowtow to Shiina-san to make you another one!”\n“I’m fine…”\nAmane was not that unhappy, but Kido frantically apologized. He smiled, and for some reason, Kido was really sorry as she lowered her head once again.",

      "content": "“You really love dashimaki, Amane-kun.”\nIt seemed Mahiru had heard the explanation from Kido, and she seemed to recall this matter on the way back from school, for she said so with a smile.\nShe was giggling away, for she might have found it interesting, but it was so graceful, and there were surrounding gazes upon them.\nStop laughing,\nAmane pinched the hand he was holding, but her smile did not abate. He really wanted to pinch her face, but he was holding her bag in one hand, and her hand in the other, so he could not do so.\n“But there is dashimaki in the bento every once in a while. There were some leftovers in the morning, and I do make them at night, sometimes.”\n“That’s that. I wanted it for lunch.”\n“Goodness, Kido-san apologized to me so seriously, and even begged me.”\nIt seemed Kido had felt responsible for it, and obediently bowed to Mahiru.\nAmane himself had no intention of reproaching Kido, for he was the one who dropped it due to his own miscue, the dashimaki did not drop onto the floor, and the taste was the only thing that changed slightly.\n“Well, I think I need to apologize to Kido. I’m just lamenting to myself after all.”\n“She said your face was terrible.”\n“Eh…but that’s your dashimaki.”\n“I can make it for you anytime.”\n“…Even for dinner?”\n“You wish to swap out tonight’s menu? You really are hopeless.”\nGoodness,\nMahiru sounded as though she was begrudging, but her voice seemed a little elated, and she probably was not unwilling.\nAmane felt a little ticklish upon seeing her give a serene smile, but he had a feeling she was treating him like a child, and he nearly pouted, barely.\n“I shall add it to the menu tonight then. Do dote on me lots tonight in return.”\n“This request? Sure, I’m hoping you would ask.”\nMahiru was usually sturdy, and Amane would oblige if she wanted him to pamper her, or even do so without her asking. One might say his interest was in pampering her.\nHe agreed without a second thought, and Mahiru, the one who mentioned this, started to reel back.\n“…That will trouble me too.”\n“Why?”\n“Because you do not know moderation, Amane-kun.”\n“Eh, am I that violent?”\n“I do not mean that…it is just that, you will pamper me without stopping the moment you decidee on it…”\n“Since I decided on it, of course I’ll do it.”\n“…I will feel unbearable if I am pampered too much.”\nMy waist will weaken, and I will not stand upright,\nso she muttered so, and Amane burst out laughing.\nThis doting was merely just skinship, kissing, and embrace, but Mahiru found it unbearable. If he devoted himself to pampering her completely, she would crumble completely, and he had seen this situation far too often, It seemed she did not want that to happen.\n“Anyway, excessiveness is a no go. Please do so normally.”\n“I can’t do normal, you know. That’s my normal.”\n“…This is the skill of those with the Fujimiyas’ bloodline…”\n“I’m not as good as dad though.”\nAmane did not have the pampering skills of his father, and he would not do so naturally.\nTo him, his father was really kind to his family, and would grant his deep love. Amane hoped that his father was a little more poised, but his father was an ideal, and he wanted to become such a person. He did not think he had attained this ideal, for he felt that he lacked some emotional awareness.\n“…I really wish Shihoko-san can hear this. It is a pity she is not here.”\n“Why mention mom…she went back already.”\nAmane’s parents had left, and obviously, it was because they had to work the next day.\nTheir weekends were never this lively, and once they returned home, the contrast seemed so unnerving.\n“It is quiet now.”\n“You’re really happy when you’re with mom.”\n“Of course. I got to hear stories about you, Amane-kun.”\n“…How about a super size portion of doting?”\n“No, th-this is a little…”\nAmane decided to pamper her lots to coerce her into telling what his parents said. She panicked, but it was her fault for letting her tongue slip. Amane had intended to control himself if he did not notice so, but there was no if this time.\nNow how do I give her lots,\nAmane’s lips curled, and Mahiru showed a frozen look, headbutted into his arm, and maintained this pose until they reached the supermarket.",

      "content": "“…E-erm, I feel you need to control yourself a little, Amane-kun.”\nAfter dinner, Amane punished Mahiru with a huge dosage of pampering, and Mahiru blushed as she looked up at him.\nThey were merely together on the sofa, and he was just touching her, but she was rather embarrassed.\nThere was no actual sexual contact per se, and he did not touch her at anywhere inappropriate. The reason Mahiru’s face was so red might be because Amane had been patting her head while looking at her face, or because he had her sit on his thighs.\n“You got to tell me what you know if you want me to stop.”\n“I-I said that it was not anything you would be worried about.”\n“In detail?”\n“…There was the time when you swung on the swing, hit your head, and cried out loud. And also, you wanted to kiss Shihoko-san on the cheek, and bumped your head too hard or something.”\n“Guilty. No reason to spare you.”\n“Why…!”\nIn his younger days, Amane was too influenced by his mother’s passion that he overdid things, and often messed up. He however wondered to himself why he deserved such karma for Mahiru to know. The matter of kissing his mother was not something that should be mentioned to any man. If this was not a black history, one had to wonder what was.\nSurely it was Amane who was more embarrassed than Mahiru, who was being pampered.\nIt did not count as he failed to do so, but he nearly brought his face onto Shihoko’s and kissed her. He had a migraine just from the mere mention.\nI told you not to listen,\nAmane implied through his gestures, slid his fingers down her waist, and caressed her along with her body warmth. She shivered, and her tense face looked up at him.\nNaturally, she was begging for him to stop, but unfortunately for her, it was a punishment, and he had no intention to stop. Shihoko was probably the one who first mentioned this, but there was no doubt Mahiru enjoyed hearing so.\nMahiru was afraid of tickles, and Amane did not go all out when tickling her. She squealed with a voice shriller than usual, and firmly latched onto him. She did not run away, for she probably feared losing her balance.\n“Hiiiii…haa, so-sorry.”\n“…Anything else you heard?”\n“No-not this time.”\n“This time?”\n“I-it is a matter of context…”\n“…Even if she did mention everything, you’re going to keep listening, aren’t you, Missy? Isn’t it unfair that my black history is the only thing dug up?”\n“B-but, if we are talking about mine, there is a prior issue…”\nAnd there is nothing worth talking about,\nonce Mahiru quipped, Amane stopped tickling.\nIt might bring back bad memories to her, for she did not receive the care and love of her parents, and she surely did not wish to recall them.\nSorry for mentioning this stuff,\nAmane lowered his eyebrows, and observed Mahiru, who seemed to have understood what he was thinking, gently giggling.\n“You do not have to worry. It is nothing significant to me now. I am very content now. This is enough.”\n“Mahiru…”\n“And I used to be very obedient, unlike you, Amane-kun.”\n“Sorry for being playful…but yeah, I can’t imagine you being lively, Mahiru.”\nOnce he was teased at, Amane pinched Mahiru’s cheeks as retaliation, and tried to imagine a Mahiru in her childhood.\nTruly, he could not imagine her being lively. She had always demanded of herself to be an obedient child, and she certainly would be a lot docile back then. He could imagine her being all obedient, and wanted to see how it would be like seeing Mahiru all lively.\n…I wonder if there’ll be a kid like Mahiru.\nHe had a feeling that no matter which side they resembled more of, their children would be obedient, but that would only matter once they were born.\nCute is cute, no matter whether they were obedient, lively or stubborn. It would be best if they resembled Mahiru, and not as unadorable as Amane.\nSo Amane quietly imagined these scenes, and felt all warm and fuzzy. Mahiru then buried her face into his chest, rubbing onto it.\n“…I was not actually cute back then, you know? I behaved well simply because I wished to be praised. I could do a lot of things when I was young, but I was quietly told that I was a useless one.”\n“Who said that?”\n“Probably the mothers of the children who played with me…Amane-kun, your face, please take note.”\n“I can’t help it.”\nThe people who would badmouth children just loud enough for them to hear were unreliable. Amane frowned hard, and pulled away from Mahiru.\nChildren were often easily hurt, and yet those women with children clearly conveyed their negative emotions. Amane really wanted to reproach the women he did not know, but it was all in the past, and nothing to do with.\nLuckily, Mahiru was pulled out of the mire, and did not seem emotional about it. Amane was really anxious however, and wondered what he would have done if Mahiru was hurt to the point where she could not be healed.\n“Do not worry, for Koyuki-san doted on me, and praised me lots.”\n“Good job Koyuki-san.”\nAmane quietly gave a thumbs up to the woman whose face he did not know, the woman who raised Mahiru in her parents’ stead. He ruffled Mahiru’s head, and embraced her while she was still recollecting her memories.\n“I am calmer than you think I am, Amane-kun. The things my own parents said about me hurt me more than those I do not know of.”\n“…Mahiru.”\n“I do not wish to say about any unhappy things. We shall stop for now. All I can say is, I felt unbearable back then, but it was that past that I get to know you and form this relationship. I will not acknowledge that past, so please do not show such a face.”\nYou really worry too much,\nso Mahiru smiled. Amane brought his lips to her forehead, and embraced her once again. She wriggled in his clutches, looking relieved, and then kissed him.\n“…And now, you love me, Amane-kun. I am fine.”\nSuch an adorable one,\nAmane murmured as he saw the bashful Mahiru up close. He decided to pamper her more on this day, and kissed her once again.",

      "content": "“Better say this before I forgot. I’ll be returning home late once I start work, so you can eat first. I’ll be fine.”\nAmane had forgotten to mention so, and stopped his hand from caressing her more as he said so. Mahiru remained in his clutches, blinking her large eyes.\n“We’re discussing the shift schedules, but usually, I’ll have to stay until the shop clothes, and I’ll probably reach home at about 9pm. I can’t let you wait until that late.”\n“I shall wait.”\nAmane felt apologetic about letting Mahiru wait for him with an empty stomach, and wanted her to have dinner first, but she answered so in a matter-of-fact.\nWhat are you saying?\nSuch was the look she gave him, and he could only lower his eyes awkwardly.\n“No, but, you’ll be hungry, right?”\n“I wish for my heart to be filled more than my stomach. I shall wait for you, Amane-kun. Eating alone feels tasteless, and I do not hate the idea of waiting for you.”\n“I’ll be very late though?”\n“Not really…or do you hate having me wait for you?”\n“No way. I just hate that I’ll have to make you wait.”\n“I will not be simply waiting though? There are a lot of things I can do while waiting, just a change of order.”\nMahiru told Amane without looking displeased in the slightest,\nyou really like to worry,\nand said so with a smile, poking at his face.\n“How can I not support you when you are working hard for what you dream of? I can only prepare some hot dinner and bath water though.”\n“That’s more than enough for me…actually, the most important thing is you welcoming me when I return home. It’ll perk me up immediately.”\n“I suppose it is a small favor if the mere sight of me can perk you up.”\n“…You don’t have to force yourself though. Think about yourself first.”\nMahiru probably would prioritize Amane more than anything else, even if she had anything going on. She however smiled, and remained silent.\nAmane had no intention of binding Mahiru, but it seemed she really hated to be split from him, and did not intend to defy her own will. She loved her him so, she put him in his thoughts, and he was glad about it, but he did not want her to force herself.\n“Amane-kun, you should not force yourself to work either, you know? I do not know what you want, but I am worried. since you will do everything once you make up your mind.”\n“No way. How can I make you worry?”\n“I was a little worried when you said you wanted to work…I cannot say that you are very sociable.”\n“It’s true, but it just sounds a little rude.”\nIt was a fact everyone acknowledged, but if Mahiru mentioned so, Amane really did not know how he should react.\nIt’s not like I can’t socialize completely,\nAmane grumbled, though it was not much of a refute, and Mahiru made a little sigh.\n“I say you are not exactly sociable, but you usually would not expand your social circle, Amane-kun. You should be able to do so.”\n“Hm, I don’t really want to make friends with lots of people. Just a small circle is fine.”\n“…But you will if you put your mind to it. You can change modes after all. Haa.”\n“Why are you sighing?”\n“…I have been wondering, what shall I do if you are popular, Amane-kun…”\nAmane burst out laughing once he heard this rather adorable worry. Mahiru puffed her cheeks angrily in return.\n“Relax, I won’t be popular, not at all.”\n“You have not understood the opinions people have of you recently, Amane-kun.”\n“Say, looking at the mood and prices of that cafe, I think the target demographic’s those old uncles with refined tastes. I won’t be popular, and even if I do, so what?”\nThe younger folk would prefer a chain outlet rather than a personal cafe. Amane had a look at the menu, and the prices were a little expensive, unsuitable for high school students or college students to simply have taste.\nBefittingly, the taste there was great, and the slow atmosphere appeared to be very popular with the older ones. One reason might be that the owner was quite the babe.\nAccording to Kayano, hardly any young female customers would visit. Amane was thus sufficiently relieved to work there.\n“Anyway, do relax. The owner looks like a nice person too.”\n“…Sure.”\nFor the time being, Mahiru accepted Amane’s explanation, and he rubbed her head, consoling her. She seemed a little unhappy, or maybe happy, for her lips curled into a smile as she let Amane continue to rub.",

      "content": "A week after Amane decided where he would work, he received news from the owner Itomaki. She prepared his uniform and his future shift. He would work four days a week, three work days and a Saturday.\nAs Amane was in his second year of high school, he had to prepare for his exams. This arrangment was also similar to those with club activities, and would not affect his studies.\nThe exams would be held the following year, and Amane had no intention to slack on his studies. The work arrangements should be fine for him.\n“I’m starting work today. Go back for now.”\nAmane said to Mahiru on the first day of work, right after school.\nHis heart ached a little once he saw her clearly forlorn face, but he could only keep it to himself. After all, it was to be expected, since he was working for Mahiru’s smile.\n“Ahh~ you’re starting work today, Amane? Do your best~”\n“Don’t tail me.”\n“…I won’t.”\n“How can I trust you when you paused like that.”\nChitose, listening intently next to them, was a little suspicious, but Amane took his precautions. She probably would not follow him.\n“…I don’t mind once I get used to this, but don’t come over until here. It’s embarrassing if I don’t serve the customers well.”\n“You didn’t do well during the cultural festival? I thought you were rather skilled.”\n“That’s so-so, and thanks to Kido’s training.”\n“…I suppose I should be able to visit you there soon, Amane-kun. You have quite the impressive learning ability.”\nI am looking forward to it,\nMahiru earnestly prepared to send Amane off. He scratched his cheek, and then patted her soft flax-colored hair.\nShe was shocked, and widened her eyes. He looked at her face, his face too smiling.\n“Yep, I’ll try my best to get used to it as soon as possible, and hurry home soon.”\n“…Please do. I will wait for you no matter how late you will be though.”\n“Of course, I’ll work hard while looking forward to dinner.”\nThey whispered these words as their classmates had yet to know that they were living next to each other. Chitose and Itsuki overheard this conversation, the former smiling away, the latter catcalling away, so Amane gave the latter a gentle backhand.\nIt did not hurt, but Itsuki exaggerated the contact as he tumbled back onto Chitose. Chitose observed the bashful Mahiru,\nyou’re heavy Ikkun,\nsaying so as she shoved Itsuki aside. It seemed Itsuki was still sad about it.\nAmane laughed once he saw them, and Mahiru too giggled. Itsuki was a little awkward, and jabbed at Amane’s flank as retaliation.\nAfter they ended the conversation reluctantly, Amane left school for his workplace.\nHe was assigned to work on the same day as his schoolmate and workplace senior Kayano, as this was his first day at work.\nHe waited to meet up with Kayano at the school entrance, and they went together. Kayano might not be a talker himself, for he remained silent until they reached the train station.\nThey needed to take a train ride to the workplace, but it was two stations away, near the school. In fact, it was not too far away from his own house, no further than Itsuki’s and Chitose’s place. Mahiru probably would not be tired waiting for him at home once he got off work.\nThe workplace was not too far from the station, and there should not be much inconvenience.\n“Your house is within walking distance from school, Fujimiya?”\nAmane did not have a seasonal ticket, and needed to top up the value of his IC card, so Kayano asked.\n“Yeah. I live in an apartment close to school.”\n“That’s good. It’s close, and you get to sleep a little more.”\n“I’m rather comfortable if I’m waking up to go to school, but Mahiru wakes me up…”\nAmane usually would have some time before going to school, other than the weekends, and that time had only increased ever since Mahiru started making breakfast for him.\nHe could wake up on his own even without her calling him, but he had her do so, so that he could open his eyes to her voice every day, enjoying the blissful moments. Such selfish thoughts would remain at the bottom of his heart.\nThat’s surprising,\nso Kayano noted softly.\n“I thought you would be somewhat reliable.”\n“I guess I’m looking decent recently if you’re saying that. I’m actually a good-for-nothing.”\nHis private life was no longer erratic as compared to the past, but he often relied on Mahiru. He really could not consider himself reliable.\nOf course, Amane would not leave everything to Mahiru, and he would do anything he could. He would profess however that he was a little tardy.\nHe was introduced to Kayano during the cultural festival. Since Kayano found Amane reliable, it seemed Amane’s efforts were decent.\n“I think your standards of good-for-nothing is different. Well, Ayake herself might be worse…”\n“Kido?”\n“Look at her. You see that she’s reliable? She’s a complete lazybum of a slob at home. I don’t have the right to say her though.”\n“I can’t really imagine that.”\n“She’s reliable outdoors, but if I don’t pay attention, she’s lazier than me. She’s taking care of me outdoors, but indoors, I’m the one doing that.”\n“…I think she’s just flirting with you.”\nKido did have her moments, but she should be a strong, considerate, reliable girl. She worked hard to not show her tardiness outdoors, and only showed it to her boyfriend. She probably was just fawning around.\nKayano blinked away, and awkwardly looked diagonally down.\n“…Wait, am I being lovey-dovey now? Sorry.”\n“I-it’s fine. I don’t mind…”\nAmane too awkward averted his eyes once he saw how embarrassed Kayano was.\nI might be the same too, being all lovey-dovey without knowing,\nso he thought, and pursed his nearly quivering lips out of shame.",

      "content": "While chatting with Kayano, Amane soon arrived at his workplace, the cafe.\nHe was somewhat tense as it was his first time working part-time. He did not know if Kayano knew of his feelings, for Kayano entered the shop alongside him without hesitation.\nOnce he entered, he heard the chime behind him, a nostalgic one at that. A male staff welcomed them, one he did not see the last time. The staff appeared to be a college student.\n“Welcome Kayano-kun. Is the one behind you our newcomer?”\n“Yep. Right in the same shift.”\nIt seemed Kayano had introduced Amane beforehand. The male staff showed a genial smile towards Amane, and Kayano nodded back, slapped Amane on the back, and went to the corridor linking to the back counter.\nHe turned to look back, and so did Amane, who saw a male customer prepare to enter.\n“A customer’s here, so let’s get changed. Sorry Miyamoto-san, looks like I’ll only get to introduce you two later on.”\n“Sure. I’ll later you later then, newcomer-kun.”\nThe staff was called Miyamoto, gave a mischievous wink to the nervous and stiff Amane, and turned towards the entering customer.\nAmane nodded slightly, but he never got the chance to greet Miyamoto, who turned to wave at them once he saw Amane’s situation. The duo then entered the staff changing room.\n“This is your locker. Here’s your key, your uniform’s inside. Get changed.”\nIt seemed the owner Itomaki had Kayano guide Amane, and handed over the locker key. Amane received it, and got changed into his work clothes, following the lead of Kayano who had taken off his blazer.\nThe prepared uniform so happened to fit Amane, given that the sizes were measured beforehand.\nAmane was dressed in the same uniform as Miyamoto, white shirt, black cummerbund, black garson apron and slacks.\nThe outfit was a little less formal compared to what he wore during the cultural festival, but a little more posh, befitting of a waiter.\nAmane looked at himself in the full-sized mirror of the changing room, and found a completely different person. He looked towards Kayano, who had quickly gotten changed, looking prim and proper.\n“…Doesn’t look weird, right?”\n“I think it’s fine. Shiina-san should be happy to see this.”\n“I-I don’t intend to show this to Mahiru yet…”\n“She’ll find it a pity, I guess.”\n“She did, and I got her understanding.”\nAmane intended to get used to this work quickly, not cause her trouble, and get her to wait until then.\nHe showed a wry smile, and so did Kayano.\n“Anyway, was Kido happy to see you in that?”\n“That Ayaka? She prefers if I strip instead of wearing that much.”\n“Oh yeah…”\nAmane looked enlightened, and Kayano’s grimace intensified. Kayano said, and said,\n“…It’s not that she doesn’t have interest in my outfit, but she’s more of a troublemaker.”\n“Yeah. Your muscles are rather amazing. Any secret?”\nThey got changed together, Kayano did show skin, and there were masses of muscles beyond the shirt, which was unimaginable. They were not fats, they were muscles that were trained accordingly, the excesses discard, giving a sense of tautness that left Amane impressed.\n“You can ask Ayaka, and she’ll tell you all the details, both the things that should and shouldn’t be said.”\n“Ahh…yeah…”\nAmane could imagine the sight of a smiling Kido being relentless while going through the details, and showed a stiff smile.\n“…You want to train too?”\n“Hm, I guess a suitable amount of training is fine too, and Mahiru probably will be happy…since your Missy taught Mahiru this and that.”\n“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.”\n“I-it’s fine, it’s enough reason for me to train.”\nKayano apologized with a conflicted look, for his own girlfriend was overzealous in preaching the charms of muscles. Amane too shrugged, waved his hand, and indicated to Kayano not to worry.",

      "content": "“Sorry that I can’t welcome you.”\nAmane was led by Kayano towards the snacks making area, the kitchen, learned where the utensils were, and heard various explanations. Itomaki showed up later, and apologized to Amane, looking sorry.\n“I remember it was today…and was too relaxed because Souji-kun’s with you. Once again, Amane-kun, welcome here. Thank goodness the uniform fits you well. It is exactly as Ayaka-san determined.”\n“Well, Ayaka got it right, but it’s ridiculously right.”\nKayano’s little murmur had Amane nearly burst out a laugh, but he reined it it, and gently bowed towards Itomaki.\n“I’ll be in your care, starting today.”\n“Same for me…erm, you met the others, haven’t you?”\n“He just met Miyamoto-san once, and hasn’t met Oohashi-san. He’s brewing coffee at the counter, so I don’t think they bumped into each other.”\n“Well then, just have a look around for now. No customer placed an order yet. Everyone will be working together in the future.”\nItomaki smiled magnanimously,\nSouji-kun, please swap out with Miyamoto-san and the others outside,\nand indicated so to Kayano, before she drifted to the entrance to call for them.\nKayano gave Amane an encouraging pat in the back, and went out.\nAs Kayano went out, a male and a female entered. The male was called Miyamoto, the one who spoke with them. The girl was in her early twenties, with wavy, fluffy hair. Her distinguishing feature was that she was a fist taller than Chitose, and it was rare to see such a tall girl.\nConsidering what Kayano had just said, it seemed her name was Oohashi.\n“Ah, the kid Kayano-chan just brought over. I heard we got an extra part-timer. Welcome, nice to meet you~”\nThe woman gave a hearty smile, and passed Amane by, circling him and observing so.\nMiyamoto clearly looked bewildered, and sighed away. He grabbed the girl by the neck, and pulled her away from him.\nAmane was stunned by the sudden approach, and Miyamoto showed a relaxed smile.\n“Ah sorry about that. I’m Daichi Miyamoto, and this fellow here is Rino Oohashi. You can look for us if you got any trouble.”\n“Don’t dismiss me as a fellow. Rino-chan’s in a pinch here~Rino-chan’s caught and troubled~”\n“Then greet him properly before saying anything else.”\nMiyamoto reproached the displeased Oohashi, and let go of her reluctantly. She sorted out her crooked collar, turned towards Amane once again, and showed an amicable smile.\n“Sorry to scare you like that. I’m Rino Oohashi. You can rely on me, kouhai-kun.”\n“Ermm, Miyamoto-san and Oohashi-san, right? I’m Amane Fujimiya.”\n“Homu homu, Fujimiya-chan, huh? Got it, got it.”\n“…She likes to add the chan-suffix. Don’t mind too much, Fujimiya-kun.”\n“We-well, I’m fine with however you call me…”\nAmane was not one to bear grudges over a single suffix, and though he did not mind, it just felt amiss to be called with a chan.\nMiyamoto sighed, seemingly hinting that he too was suffering. He then turned towards Itomaki, who had been watching them silently.\n“So what is Fujimiya-kun doing today?”\n“First off, we’ll teach him everything n the backend. He probably won’t be able to do well if he doesn’t understand how that works, even if he’s just welcoming customers. Souji-kun will be teaching, and I’ll let Fujimiya-kun learn all those.”\n“Sorry to trouble everyone.”\n“It’s fine. Nobody actually gets down to work immediately after joining, let alone a first timer. Don’t mind, we got enough people here.”\n“Owner, I’m a little skeptical if we really have enough people. The shop’s not ridiculously big, but we really are getting a little busy, especially with our numbers…well, you are helping us out here, Fujimiya-kun.”\nMiyamoto gave a relieving smile, and patted Amane on the shoulder. Amane too smiled, and Itomaki watched on, looking relieved.",

      "content": "After the guidance of this and thats from the seniors, Amane returned home, and it was past bath time.\nHe took the elevator to his house, and let out a long sigh.\nThe shift was merely four hours or so, but Amane felt so lethargic, probably because he was unfamiliar with the environment and work. He did not commit any serious error (or rather, he was not set up in a situation where he could have), but the first time was always filled with tension.\nLuckily for him, though his seniors had quite the personalities, they got along well, and earnestly treated Amane, who remained unfamiliar with work.\nAmane felt it was really a good place to work at.\nBut, it did not change the fact that he was tired.\nHe exited the elevator, went to his door, and his footsteps were heavier than usual. He opened the door as usual―and saw Mahiru scampering down the corridor from the living room.\nHe blinked away once he saw her panicking, and she showed a relieved smile.\n“Welcome back, Amane-kun.”\n“Yep, I’m back. You don’t have to run over here. Sorry to keep you waiting.”\nIt was just a guess, but she probably had been waiting for Amane the entire time.\nHe did tell her when he would be back, but she probably felt helpless, being all alone and such.\nMahiru had always been at Amane’s place ever since they started, other than bathing and sleeping. She had been completely used to the place. Surely she would feel lonely to be left alone.\n“N-not at all. I had lots to do when you were alone.”\n“Lots to do, so you’re not lonely?”\n“Th-that is another matter…”\nShe averted her eyes, her cheeks blushing slightly, and Amane laughed. She noticed so, puffed her cheeks slightly, looking a little displeased, and yet had some intent to fawn.\nHmph,\nshe pouted, and turned her head aside. Amane did not sheath his smile as he removed his shoes before entering, and went straight to the washroom.\nThe lights inside were switched on.\nHe turned back to look at Mahiru, who stood there, giving a matter-of-fact expression, seemingly elated.\n“A bath, or dinner first?”\nA change in these words, and it would be a newlywed invitation. Amane could not help but smile after Mahiru said so, and barely held it in.\nMahiru herself might not have noticed that it was an adorable part.\n“You’re hungry too, right? Let’s have dinner then.”\n“I shall serve it then. I made dashimaki as a reward for your hard work, since it is your first day working.”\n“Woah, that’s quite the reward.”\n“Fufu, you are easily contented then.”\n“It’s something I like, and delicious, and also made by you. Adding them all up, it’s the best quality I can get. Thank you for everything.”\nAfter all, it was taxing on her to personally make it. It was not something easily made. It was made for Amane, and that was enough.\nMoreover, the really scrumptious flavor was a fabulous, lavish reward.\nMahiru had been cooking for Amane every day, and considered his likes, which he was really grateful for. Once again, he felt that she really was a priceless partner.\nI have to repay her for all she has done.\nSo he thought as he washed his hands, and went to the living room. Mahiru then clung onto his back\nHe turned behind, wanting to check her expression, but her face clung onto his back, unseen. The only thing he knew was that she was embarrassed.\nShe wrapped her arms on his belly while rubbing her forehead onto him, as though she was strangling him.\nGood thing I’m training my abs now,\nso Amane quietly thought to himself as he laughed. Mahiru could tell that he was laughing given his breathing and tummy, and started hammering at his flank.\n“…I am glad that you are grateful to me, but do not attack me suddenly.”\n“So I can praise you as much as I want if I mention beforehand?”\n“T-that will not do either…I shall torture you one day.”\nMahiru said, and let go. For some reason, she had a determined look on her face, and hurried towards the kitchen.\nThat’s quite an energetic manner to escape,\nso Amane thought as he quietly laughed to himself, and went to change in his room.\n“Anyway, how is work?”\nDinner was Japanese-styled. Mahiru seemed to be curious about Amane’s work, and asked him somewhat uneasily while they were eating.\n“Hm, no problems. I didn’t do anything much for my first day, and my seniors are all good. I think it’s a good place to work part-time.”\n“I see…that is good. It is fine if you are comfortable. I was worried if it is a black company…”\n“It’s Kido’s recommendation, and Kayano isn’t unhappy about the work there. Don’t worry.”\nAfter all, the shop was run by Kido’s relative, Itomaki, and Kido would have noticed any problems otherwise, and prevented Kayano from working there. It was a reason why Amane could be at ease there.\nHe had not known or spoken to Kido for a long time, and felt that though she would push her weird knowledge and unnecessary fetishes onto Mahiru, she was a kind woman.\nThe owner Itomaki too was a kind, poised woman as long as he did not stimulate her delusions (according to Kayano). He should be fine working there.\n“Don’t worry. I think I can work well there. The shift arrangements take my time into consideration,:\n“…That is good, as long as you can continue to work hard. I can only cheer you on and watch silently.”\n“That’s enough for me. I get to return home and eat delicious food with you around, get a hot bath, and this is happiness for me.”\nSuch support was a rarity by itself, and Amane felt he was blessed. He was really grateful.\n“…I shall chip in with what little strength I have, even if it is to see you at work sooner, Amane-kun.”\n“…You really want to look?”\nAmane replied dumbfoundedly once he learned of this personal motive, and she nodded firmly.\n“I want to see my lover at work. Kido-san did show me photos of Kayano-san at work, so I think they should suit you very well…”\n“Really?”\n“I am looking forward to seeing them.”\n“I find it embarrassing though. Don’t really want anyone else to see it…”\nHe did not exactly hated the idea, but that he might find it somewhat indescribably embarrassing to show Mahiru a side he usually would not show.\nMahiru however might have felt this contrast was worth it. She wanted to see the side Amane usually would not show, and she clearly was preparing for the situation.\n“…I think I can leave it be if you are unwilling.”\n“Not that I’m unwilling…but is it really interesting to see my business smile?”\n“You usually would not show it, and I wish to see it.”\n“I can show that kind of smile if you want…”\n“…But that is a smile directed to me, it is different.”\nShe was right. Amane could not determine if his smile towards Mahiru was biased. He believed he would show a smile only for Mahiru.\n“And I wish to see you work hard.”\n“…I’ll try my best to get used to it.”\nSince she said so, he had no choice but to buck up. He had to spare no effort given that his dear girlfriend wanted to see his other self at the workplace.\nGetting familiar with work would grant more benefits to the shop, and gain him more self-confidence.\nMahiru’s words motivated him lots, and he felt like a simpleton. However, that little thought he had of himself vanished the moment he saw her smile and the expectations in the sparkling eyes.",

The cafe placed a high emphasis on coffee, and would not allow any compromise of taste.\nAny variations in the beans and the granules meant that the extraction temperature and time would change. Amane had to keep practicing as this was the flavor to be provided to the customers, until he could replicate it.\nIn any case, he should be able to brew a decent coffee as long as he remembered the timing, and how to use the equipment. After serious coaching and continual practice, Amane managed to do it.\n“Hmm, it’s nice.”\nThere were few customers, and thus a certain frequency of orders. Kayano and Oohashi handled the outside, and Amane was assigned to train under Miyamoto.\nIt was a siphon brewed coffee, as to be expected of a cafe, and it seemed fine.\n“You can shorten the extraction time, I guess.”\n“I used the timer though…”\n“You aren’t familiar with it and delayed it, I guess. Also, you got nervous since you’ll be serving it to the customers, right?”\n“Sorry, I’ll deal with it.”\nMiyamoto was not being strict and nitpicky; on the contrary, he was kindly explaining things, detailed and patient. Amane was not confident enough to brew coffee for the customers however, and it probably was a reason why he spent too much time. Also, the siphon was made of glass, and he was worried if he broke it.\nIt seemed Miyamoto too understood what Amane was thinking,\nI didn’t dare touch it either when I started out. It looks fragile after all,\nhe chuckled.\n“Just don’t break it, and don’t be too violent, and you’ll be fine. You’re rather delicate at handling things.”\n“That’s good…”\n“I think you’re being so attentive about this because Rino broke it on her first day, Fujimiya-kun. Don’t worry, it’s a human error, it’s not like you’ll be scolded that badly if you break one. If you break a few of them however, the owner’s probably going to scold you with a troubled look.”\n“It sounds like you experienced that yourself.”\n“Rino did that.”\nThe owner’s face froze back then,\nMiyamoto gave a nostalgic look as he whispered so. Amane responded with an ambiguous smile, quietly swore to pay attention, and took a sip of Miyamoto’s coffee, followed by his.\nThe rich bitterness spread on his tongue. The bitterness would not last too long on the tongue, and instead would give a warmth aftertaste with depth.\nHe did not like coffee that was extremely acidic, and this coffee was a fine blend of acrid and acidic, and the slight sweetness of the beans. It was delectable.\n“Ah, it’s so good. Looks fragrant~”\nAmane took a quick break while nobody placed an order, and Oohashi suddenly entered, with saucers and used plates in hand. The customers must have left, and clean up was needed.\n“Fujimiya-chan, give me a sip.”\nOohashi put the plates into the trough, and asked for Amane’s coffee. Amane wondered what to do, and the next moment, Miyamoto tugged her by the neck, pulling her away.\n“Oy, Fujimiya has a girlfriend. Don’t do anything that’ll cause a misunderstanding.”\n“Ah, sorry, looks like he has. I got a lot of brothers though, so I don’t really care.”\nAmane had explained the reason why he was working, which was why Miyamoto stopped Oohashi, who obediently backed off.\nOn one hand, Miyamoto was clearly looking dumbfounded, and on the other, Oohashi was giving a dumb smile. They appeared to be really close, unlike normal colleagues, or so Amane seriously thought over the past week, but he had been wondering if he should ask them about this.\n“You two really are on good terms.”\n“We’ve childhood friends. Together for twenty years or so.”\n“Well, I can say we’re platonic at least.”\n“How rude!?”\nThe displeased Oohashi swung a karate chop at Miyamoto’s flank, and was pinched on her own, squealing away.\nThis bond was not something that could occur over a single day. Amane immediately understood the reason for their intimacy.\nEven then, they seemed to be a little too close as childhood friends. He had no childhood friends, and so he tilted his head, not knowing if this was normal.",

      "content": "“What happened to your hand?”\nAmane was sitting on the sofa when Mahiru saw his bandaged hand, and she frowned.\n“Ah, accidentally twisted it during gym class. I had a checkup at the infirmary. Told to rest for a few days.”\nAmane accidentally lost his balance while playing basketball in gym class, and he managed to break his fall with his hand, twisting it. The bandage was thus the result of this folly.\nThe twisted wrist did not seem to hurt much, and it was said he could recover fully in a matter of days, so he did not mind…but Mahiru frowned.\n“…What do you intend to do?”\n“What else? I’ll just live as normal, try my best not to move it. It’s not like it’s my leg that’s injured.”\n“Amane-kun, are you insulting people like me who have injured their legs before?”\n“Don’t misunderstand. Anyway, it’s not going to affect me that much to a point of being a hindrance. It’s fine, don’t worry.”\nAmane never wanted Mahiru to worry this much for him. After all, it was a little suffering caused by his own carelessness. He could use his left hand, and was not too bothered by it.\nMahiru thought otherwise however. She looked at Amane’s wrist, and gently sighed.\n“…I shall assist you until your hand recovers.”\n“Eh, you don’t have to. I can use my left hand. I won’t have any issues in my daily life.”\n“You are incapable of housework with both hands, and you say you are fine with one?”\n“Ugh, now that you say so…but you really don’t need to worry. I have my left hand.”\n“Please accept my kindness.”\nIt seemed she was still mindful of the moment when she injured her ankle. He felt that she repaid the favor with her meals, but it seemed Mahiru thought differently.\nShe sounded so calm and adamant, and would not allow for him to refuse. He felt a little perturbed, but he could only accept her graciousness obediently.\nEver since she found out about Amane’s wrist injury, Mahiru studiously took care of his daily life.\nShe made onigiri, and ensured that Amane could eat with one hand. She even took over the housework Amane should have done, and even shopping. Such thorough care left Amane flabbergasted.\nThe toughest ordeal however was when he had to eat the side dishes.\n“I really can eat with my left hand.”\nMahiru fed every single dish to his mouth, like a mother bird to her fledglings, which left him very awkward.\nMahiru’s viewpoint was that she was simply taking care of the sick, and she probably was not embarrassed in the slightest. The one being fed however could not maintain a calm look. He did not dislike this, but he was very, very, very embarrassed.\nMahiru probably assumed that Amane was right handed, and could not use his left hand deftly.\nAhhh\n, but even so, her feeding him was really a grueling test of will.\nIf Mahiru was actually embarrassed by this, Amane might actually die from embarrassment. Luckily for him, his sanity points merely dropped by half, given how she did so dutifully.\nHe watched her silently as she fed him, and sighed hard.\n“…Erm, can I be honest here?”\nHe actually intended to state so, but Mahiru’s stubborn insistence would not allow so. Perhaps he would not be in this embarrassing situation if he had said so right from the beginning.\n“What is it?”\n“…I’m ambidextrous.”\n“Eh?”\n“I usually use my right, but I actually use both hands when I was younger, so I can eat on my own.”\nAmane wanted to say that he could use his left hand, but it seemed Mahiru never realized he was ambidextrous, so she basically forced him to eat.\nShe was stunned to hear his words, and her face turned increasingly red.\n“Wh-why did you not say so earlier?”\n“I wanted to, but I couldn’t when you’re so pumped up. I tried to stop you.”\n“Th-that may be so…”\n“But since you’re so enthusiastic this time, please continue until my bandage’s removed.”\nSince he had blushed for so long, it was time for Mahiru to suffer. He thought this little payback should be fine.\nSo he thought as he deliberately laughed at Mahiru, strongly restraining the shame that was about to explode in him, but it seemed this shame had reached her, for she blushed, and quickly stuffed lots of dishes into his mouth, clearly as a retaliation.\n“Oy, that too fast.”\n“I do not care.”\nShe turned her head aside, saying so with a shriller voice than usual. Amane chuckled at this sight of her, and restrained the shame in his heart as he chewed down on the delicious dishes she picked for him.",

      "content": "Recently, Amane got used to returning home after sunset due to his part-time work, so he jogged back home as exercise.\nDue to the timing, he might be sent for counseling if he loitered around in his uniform, so he even put on a jumper with reflective straps on his shoulders after work. It might not be an appropriate attire, but he had to do so, for safety concerns.\nHe jogged home while paying attention to the nearby cars and pedestrians, and by the time he arrived home, it would be another three hours until the day ended..\nHe felt intrigued by how busy he was, for he used to be part of the going-home club, but it was not a bad feeling.\nHe had been too relaxed until now. Until he met Mahiru, he never attended club activities, was lazy, and even after then, he studied with her, lived as freely as he wanted, and never crammed his schedule too much.\nAnd at this point, he acted as per a fixed schedule. It was restrictive, but yet fulfilling.\n“I’m back.”\nHe was a little lethargic as he opened the door and called out. The lights were on, but he could not see anyone.\nPerhaps Mahiru had made dinner, and was waiting for him. He removed his shoes, looked at the living room, but Mahiru was not in.\nHe looked into the kitchen, and there was a nice smell coming from the stove, the food inside was probably done.\nGiven how there was cooked food inside, it seemed she had prepared dinner for him before she left.\nHe did not think she had to stay at his place, and it was not a bad thing for her to treasure her own time, but it was a rare sight.\nHe sent her a message beforehand, stating that he would return home.\nShall I send another message?\nThe moment he thought so, there was a sound of the door hastily unlocked.\n“A-Amane-kun. You are early…”\n“Someone else’s doing the cleanup today, and I ran a little faster…sorry, seems like you’re doing something, Mahiru. Should I be a little slower?”\n“Not at all! I wanted to see your face sooner, Amane-kun!”\nMahiru shook her head frantically.\nThat’s good.\nHe chuckled back at her as he saw her hair sway aside.\nHe beamed due to these cute words from her, and Mahiru did not mind, but she awkwardly looked down, muttering something.\n“Mahiru?”\n“Ahh, I just had a thought. Please do not worry. I shall prepare dinner since you are back. I will heat the rice while you are bathing. The bath is ready.”\n“Thank you for everything…hm?”\nMahiru acted a little gingerly, and Amane felt suspicious. The moment she passed him by, he sensed a sweet, soft fragrance from her.\nShe usually had a sweet fragrance, but the scent this time was different. It was not of the shampoo, not from herself, but more of something else external.\nTo be precise, it was the smell of baked sweets.\n“Wh-what is it?”\n“…Well, your scent is different from usual, Mahiru. It’s the sweet smell of sweets.”\n“Eh…actually, I had…oyatsu.”\n“Is that so? I don’t really eat a lot, but you don’t eat as much as me. You sure you can eat dinner if you eat too much?”\nShe usually would control her food intake to maintain her body shape, so this was a surprise.\nMahiru’s food intake was not exactly meagre, but it was not much either. She probably could not finish dinner after having the oyatsu.\n“I-I can finish the food, no worries. Please go into the bath. You are hungry after work, are you not, Amane-kun?”\n“Well, I’m famished.”\n“So have a nice bath and a good meal, okay?”\nIt seemed Mahiru wanted to hide something as she shoved Amane’s back. He sensed there was a catch, but he did as she wanted, and got his change of clothes in the bedroom.",

      "content": "It seemed Mahiru was hiding something from Amane.\nHis suspicion would increase whenever he returned home from his part-time work. Rather, it’s more of conviction than doubt. She was acting sheepish.\nShe would always do so whenever Amane left home, and clearly, she had something she did not want Amane to see.\nIf he were to ask, Mahiru would surely divert the topic. He did not want to force the issue, she had her own reservations, and perhaps it was a matter of genders after all.\nHaving thought so, it would be rude of him to pursue the matter. He was a little suspicious, but he did not intend to probe further.\nOn a side note, he asked Chitose, but she insisted she knew nothing either.\nGiven how she was acting, it was obvious both of them knew what was going on.\nAmane was a little uneasy about how he was left in the lurch, but he knew it would be inappropriate to talk to someone of the same gender, so he did not say anything.\n“…Mahiru seems to be hiding something.”\nHis frustrations and anxieties would compound if he did not ask, so while he was on his way to work, he grumbled to his colleague Kayano.\nKayano did not react to the sudden remark, and blinked away as he sat next to Amane on the train, wondering how he should reply.\n“Had an argument?”\n“Not at all. But Mahiru looks like she’s hiding something, being all suspicious…doesn’t look like I messed up or anything though.”\nAmane too wondered if he had inadvertently did anything bad, so he asked her in a discreet manner, but she tilted her head in confusion, which showed it was not.\n“Hm, if she’s hiding something from her boyfriend, it’s usually because she’s cheating, but I don’t think Shiina-san’s the type to do that. I’m not familiar with her, but looking at her personality, and your relationship, that’s impossible.”\n“I too think Mahiru’s not being insincere towards me. She hates it when people cheat on her.”\nKayano casually suggested so, but this would not happen with Mahiru around.\nShe grew up in a complicated environment, and never was one to allow for infidelity. She had seen her mother looking for lovers. Her disdain for infidelity was such that she would certainly say she would never end up like that.\nAmane could not think of any other reason to hide however.\nMahiru was never one adept at hiding things, and she never would. Whenever she did stuff behind his back, she would feel guilty, and whenever he sensed something and probed her, she would confess.\nShe was never one to hide anything. She clearly wanted to this time, and did not want Amane to realize, which was why she did not say anything.\n“My guess is that Mahiru’s hiding something from me, but not because she’s guilty. I get the feeling that she doesn’t want me to see or know something, but it’s not a bad thing. I know the only thing that embarrasses her is me. If she broke something, she’ll tell me honestly, and apologize or something. I don’t think it’s anything harmful.”\n“What do you intend to do?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Eh?”\nThe sudden words were unexpected to Kayano, who asked again.\nThe train continued to race on, letting out dull creaks. Amane sighed, and the voice too blended with the surrounding noises.\n“If Mahiru doesn’t want to tell me anything, I shouldn’t be asking. I too have a secret or too. If she doesn’t want me to probe into it, I shouldn’t.”\n“You’re rather chill about that.”\n“I believe Mahiru’s definitely not doing this to harm me. Instead of butting in everywhere, we should all have our secrets and not probe into it. We trust each other, and should respect each other’s privacy. I heard this is the trick to remain amicable with others.”\nSuch were the words his lovey-dovey parents said for many years, and it was convincing.\nThey were on such fine terms, but they did not have to interfere in everything. One should always treasure alone time, and while they dabbled in their interests, they were separate from each other.\nEven when together, they did their own things, and the warm, gentle atmosphere was comforting even to Amane, the son.\nThanks to his parents’ teachings, he learned how to respect his own time, and others’.\n“But speaking of which, what if she really did something guilty?”\n“It means it’s not anything worth discussing with me. If she actually abandoned me, it means I’m uncharismatic and useless. It’s my fault.\nMahiru was likely a devoted girl who treasured her relationships a lot. If she abandoned Amane without discussing this, it would most probably be Amane’s fault.\nMahiru would probably explain her feelings truthfully before disengaging the relationship.\n“Well, it’s Mahiru, so it should be fine. I’m just restless out of curiosity.”\n“…Seriously, you’re rather calm when you make up you mind, Fujimiya.”\n“Really?”\nHis stance was simply due to his complete trust in Mahiru. He would not get the answer no matter how restless he was, so he should simply wait until the answer was revealed.\nMahiru’s issue definitely was not a bad one, and he believed so, so he would not ask. He was a little anxiety, but that could be forgiven.\n“Like, you didn’t look confident when I used to see you on the corridor…you really look better now as the boyfriend of the amazing Angel.”\n“I really didn’t have confidence. I only get to stand upright because I got friends kicking me in the back, and Mahiru supporting me.”\nAmane really was kicked in the back and beaten physically, and metaphorically. Thanks to them, he could stand next to Mahiru, and have her support him.\nHe was sustained with proper food and living habits, and also mental support. Amane did not think this effort was suffering, and he really enjoyed so.\nI’m really grateful,\nAmane summized, and Kayano nodded understandingly.\n“…It’s all thanks to Shiina-san’s support as the wife…or rather, the more you treasure her, the more she glows for you, Fujimiya.”\n“I don’t know about glow or anything, but I can’t be weak when I stand next to Mahiru, and I have to be someone I can be proud of. I want to be impressive as a guy…it’s all thanks to Mahiru than I have such thoughts. She really supported me.”\n“…I think it’s also because of your morals that she’s willing to support you, you know?”\n“Thanks for the compliments, but I think that I can straighten my back thanks to her. I’ll do so for her sake…or not. I’m working hard to be a match for Mahiru, all because of her”\nMahiru’s the impressive one,\nso Amane muttered. “So I’m the one getting the humblebrag now?” Kayano retorted, and Amane felt a little apologetic, awkward until they reached the station.",

      "content": "The part-time work was three to four days per week, fluctuating depending on the shift, but usually within this period.\nHe could earn money over the weekend, but he chose to spend time with Mahiru. A student’s duty was to study, and he could not slack, which the owner Itomaki agreed. She had been cheering for him in many ways, along with the true reason for his work.\nIt was a rest day, and Amane had nothing to do since morning.\nLazy he might be, he did do some muscle training and jogging, quickly finished his assignments, and finally got some rest.\nIt was a lifestyle much improved from the past. He noted wryly that he was actually living a healthy lifestyle.\nAfter doing all his tasks in the morning, there remained something he was curious about.\nYes, the thing Mahiru had been hiding recently.\nSeems like she’s being jittery about something today too.\nMahiru visited Amane in the afternoon, and looked a little tense. She was a little calm after she had eaten oyatsu, but she looked a little nervous when he looked over at her. Clearly she was hiding something.\nAmane did not point it out, and so she reverted to her usual calm till this point.\nHe sat on the sofa, and she sat next to him. She was calm, but she looked a little listless, or rather, she had something on her mind.\nHe finally had a break, and wanted to enjoy Mahiru…but it would be inappropriate when she was so spaced out. He hoped to hug her, at least, and replenish the lack of Mahiruism caused by his part-time work life.\n“Mahiru.”\n“Yes?”\n“…Can I hug you?”\nHe was relieved to see a reaction, but he asked cautiously, and Mahiru blinked away, showed a faint smile, and nodded.\nShe spread her arms wide, so he went along with her goodwill as he gently embraced her.\nOn this day, it was the smell of chocolate.\n…There’s a sweet smell everyday, huh?\nMahiru really liked sweets, but even she would not snack on them too often. She would manage her own body size seriously, and never would indulge.\nRecently however, there was often a sweet smell around her.\nAmane was not too fond of such foods, but he liked the sweet scents. He did not dislike the sweet fragrant scents from her whenever they touched.\nHowever, he did not think anything more than,\nnice smell.\nHe cautiously brought her slender body to his side, and when he tried to close in on her and gently touch her waist, she jolted.\n“Ya!”\nIt seemed she instinctively blurted this refusal, and Amane sensed that his head started to cool rapidly.\nThey usually leaned upon each other, and direct contact might not be appropriate, even though she was his girlfriend. Perhaps it was a matter of mood, or perhaps it might be that she did not want to be touched, just like now.\nI messed up,\nAmane gave such a look as he moved away from Mahiru. Mahiru looked up at his face, confused.\n“…Sorry. I got too greedy.”\n“Eh, I-I do not hate it! You are mistaken! Th-this is a misunderstanding! I do not dislike to be hugged by you, Amane-kun!?”\nIt seemed she realized Amane thought she rejected him, and she hastily flailed her hands, voicing her opinion.\n“But you don’t want to, right?”\n“I d-do not want…I am concerned about my belly now.”\n“Belly?”\n“…I-I may have gotten a little fatter. If you wrap my waist, that is a little.”\nMahiru said, put her hands on her belly, and Amane was perplexed.\nMahiru had perfect management over her body size, and appearance and touch-wise, he could not feel that she got any fatter.\nJust moments ago, he was worried that she was so skinny, it affected her health. Perhaps it would be healthier for her to grow a little more flesh.\n“Where? You still look rather thin, probably because of your dietary habits.”\nHe knew that Mahiru would do some stretches and simple exercises at home, sometimes go out for a jog, or even play the fitness games of the game console at his place.\nEven as part of the going home club, Mahiru would never scrimp on exercise to keep herself beautiful. It was impossible to imagine her getting fat.\nHe did not think so, but for some reason, Mahiru was unwilling to look at him in the eyes.\n“…Did you?”\n“N-not at all. I have not slacked on my exercise, and I am more hardworking than before. I have balance in all my meals…but…other than those meals…”\n“You’ve been snacking?”\n“Snacking, you say…yes, I have been. That is the reason.”\n“That’s surprising.”\nMahiru was particular about her body, and thus her food intake. It was surprising that she could eat so much to the point that she was worried.\n“Well, there is what they call fall’s appetite, and the food’s delicious. We got more delicious food that’s different from summer’s, no wonder you would snack on oyatsu.”\n“…It is because I have been indecisive.”\n“Eh?”\n“Noting…in any case, if you touch my belly, the fat will…”\n“I don’t think you have any extra fat…you’re skinny, and there isn’t much flesh. If there is, it’s within the margin of error. Your muscles are sturdy, it’s fine for it to be a little softer.”\nTo Amane, it was the world who was so insistent on being skinny. But even by that baseline, Mahiru was appropriately slender.\nHe was fine even if she was a little more rounded. He did not like her because she was skinny, pretty or cute. He liked Mahiru as a person, not because of her body shape. Her body shape was fine as long as her health was not compromised.\nDon’t worry too much about it.\nSo he said as he gave her eyes a serious look. “Uuu.” She whimpered, and looked up at him.\nShe might think it was a huge issue, but to Amane, a little extra fat was not something to be concerned with. He did not feel any excess fat when he touched her, and if she did not allow him to, that would be a matter of life and death.\n“…I want you to heal me a little, can’t I?”\n“N-not that I cannot…I am fine with that.”\nAmane smiled towards a somewhat reluctant Mahiru, wrapped her in his clutches, and to be precise, he lifted her out.\nHe hugged the frozen Mahiru, put her between his legs, had her sit on the sofa, and she ended up like a doll.\nThis was the most comfortable position to carry her on the sofa. Mahiru looked a little uneasy, probably because she was embarrassed.\nHowever, she obediently leaned onto him, and one could see that she was not completely against this.\nHe wrapped his arms around her waist, and touched the belly she said she was particular about. She was still slender however, and he wondered as to why she assumed, mistakenly, that she had grown fat.\n“…I don’t feel a change.”\n“I am working hard. But I do care.”\n“You’re so slim though…well, if you really mind, Mahiru, I can’t say anything. I like you for however you are, Mahiru.”\n“…Yes.”\nAmane would cheer on Mahiru if she wanted to slim down to an appropriate level, but it did not mean he wanted her to be skinny. He flatly denied the misunderstanding she had, that she had gotten fat, and he did not want to deny the hard work and determination to slim down\nJust don’t force yourself,\nso he thought, and he gently embraced her to feel her body that as soft as it usually was.\nHow much effort was needed to be so slender and soft? Truly, the bodies of girls were a mystery. While experiencing so, Amane buried his face into her shoulder, and another sweet scent entered his nostrils along with the conditioner and her milky scent.\nIt’s the smell of chocolate today,\nso he thought as he gently slid his lips towards her neck.\nHe did not intend to do anything, and the feeling of Mahiru’s skin was enough to make him happy. He could practically savor the delicious white skin. It was a male instinct, to be expected.\nHe put his lips over, kissed the silky skin, and rubbed his cheeks onto Mahiru, who made a ticklish sound.\n“…You really like to fawn when you are tired, Amane-kun.\n“Right back at you…but well, I want some human warmth .”\nIt was as Mahiru said, that whenever they felt tired, they would try to cling onto each other to be revitalized. The experience of body warmth and scents was a relieving sense of bliss.\nUsually, it was Mahiru who was more prone to fawning around, but recently, Amane had been tired, so he too ended up fawning more often.\n“You can do whatever you like, but please do not leave a mark. Others could see it…Chitose-san spotted the one you left the last time you stayed over, and teased me.”\n“Sorry about that…I should make sure it’s not so easy to spot.”\nAmane was so excited back then, half his sanity went on strike. Of course, he did not cross that line, but he obediently obeyed his desire to dye the white skin.\nAnd so he left it on a place that could be seen. He reflected on his actions.\nHe was so embarrassed to recall what happened that night, and he even embraced her too hard. Mahiru in his clutches started slapping hard at his thigh.\n“That is not the problem either!? Will you become like this once you get used to it?”\n“No-not that I’m used to it…I-I think that as a guy, I’m happy to leave my mark.”\nObviously, he would not get used to it simply by seeing skin once. The shame rose up to his face once he remembered so, and his desire perked, but his sanity kept it in check.\nThe fact remained that his desire was aroused. If there was a next time, the white skin would once again have another mark left by Amane’s lips.\nThere’s no way I can get used to this. It’s a girl’s body.\nSo Amane muttered to a displeased Mahiru in his clutches, and wrapped his hand on the hand slapping his thigh. Finally, Mahiru acted docile.\nHer ears were red, and clearly she was embarrassed.\n“…Next time, please do so at a place that cannot be seen.”\n“You’re thinking of the next time already?”\n“Th-that is because…I am happy with whatever you do, Amane-kun…I really like to be petted by you.”\nThe sight of Mahiru fidgeting while muttering so was so adorable, and he intertwined his fingers with hers.\nShe said she would accept anything Amane did, and she loved to be petted, which nearly caused his sanity to go amok. He barely managed to contain himself, and only kissed her on the neck.\nThe still-sensitive Mahiru shivered, but she let him do what he liked.\n“…Anyway, no marks to be left for now. If you want to, that will be for bir”\n“Bir?”\n“…Nothing at all. Please do not mind.”\n“Now I’m really curious.”\n“It is fine!”\nThe hesitant Mahiru caused him to tilt his head, and she raised her voice shrilly, trying to befuddle him or something. She forcibly pressed her weight onto him,\nshe’s so light\n, and Amane accepted with a chuckle.",

      "content": "Ever since Amane began his part-timer life, the question would be if he spent the rest of his time with Mahiru; the answer would be, no\nMahiru had her own life, and sometimes, she would want to be alone, or go out with others. Mahiru had been planning something behind Amane’s back recently, so on days when he did not have to work, he could rest at home until dinner time after school, or hang out with Itsuki and the others.\n“You sure you’ll be fine hanging out with us, newlywed? Your wife won’t get jealous?”\nItsuki invited Amane out with Kadowaki, and they went to a coffee chain to try out a new product. They ordered a takeaway, and ate at a park near the station when Itsuki suddenly said so.\n“Who’s the newly? Anyway, I can hang out during my own free time. I’m hanging out with guy friends, not girls. Just hanging out.”\n“Ow, you say you’re just hanging out with me…!?”\n“What, you’re the one who invited me out…if we’re really talking about that definition of hanging out, that’s impossible for me.”\nItsuki sounded like Amane was a serial cheater, and wriggled his body about. The latter rolled his eyes back at Itsuki, who quickly reverted back, and nodded away, giving the look of one who knew everything.\n“Of course. You two are so hot for each other, there’s no way for us to interrupt.”\n“First of all, you got Chitose. Secondly, I don’t need you.”\n“How cruel.”\n“Well, you’re the interfering one, Itsuki.”\n“That’s harsh of you, Yuuta?”\nKadowaki coldly noted as he drank the new limited edition frozen shake, ignoring Itsuki’s words completely with a stoic look.\nIt’s November, it’s cold out there, it’s amazing that he could think of having a cold drink outdoors.\nSo Amane thought as he sipped a hot match latte he ordered.\nItsuki realized that nobody took his side, made a fake cry that lasted for ten seconds or so, and acted as though nothing happened as he heartily drank the limited edition sweet potato latte.\n“Well, that aside, you can hang out with us, but you’re not tired?”\n“If I’m already tired, Kadowaki would already be worn out every day.”\n“Hmm, I do get enough rest even at the club, and it’s not as mentally taxing as serving customers. After all, I like to run. You sure you don’t get stressed at work, Fujimiya?”\n“Still hanging on. I don’t really like to deal with customers, but they’re usually older, and rather matured. The seniors at the workplace treat me well, and they do teach me carefully. The only stress I have is that I’m not doing well enough, not because of the environment.\nIt had not been a month since he started work, yet he felt it was the right choice to have Kido recommend him to work here.\nHis service skills would be of use in the future, and he was grateful that the colleagues were all kind,\nTruth be told, half of a successful job was the colleagues. Amane was thus grateful to Kido for recommending a workplace where everyone was kind.\nBetter thank her again next time,\nAmane swore, shook the round paper cup, and shrugged.\n“I think it’s a pity to give me such a good workplace.”\n“That’s a good thing. A work environment’s very important. A workplace where everyone is disposable doesn’t sound good.”\n“Nobody would ever work at such a place. Even part-timers have a choice to choose. The body and soul is more important, and Mahiru would most likely hate such a workplace.”\n“She really loves you.”\n“…I don’t think that has anything to do with what we said, right?”\nHe just wanted to say that, right?\nAmane glanced aside at Kadowaki, who grinned away. Feeling ticklish, Amane turned his head aside.\n“Say, your workplace is a cafe right, Amane?”\n“Yeah, the target group’s mainly the rich. Decent food and drinks, feels like it’s worth the money.”\n“Anyone tried to woo you there, Amane? It’s common.”\n“What’s your idea of a cafe…anyway, no. Some calm married women call me cute, most probably in the clumsy sense. They look at me like I’m a grandson or something.”\nThere were quite a few ladies and gentlemen who would give the unacquainted new staff some warm, gentle smiles. The young would not usually visit, so he never was wooed before.\nAlso, there were other well-tempered and good looking staff. If anyone really wanted to woo, they would be the first targets.\nThe most Amane experienced was a really old grandmother who said slowly, “I really want to introduce my granddaughter to you”. Of course, Amane cautiously refused due to his girlfriend\n“Looks like you’re very popular with the elderly, Fujimiya. You’re usually poised and polite after all.\n“I’m serving customers. I can’t be careless…well, given the customer base, I guess a quiet, unimpressive person like me might be easier to talk to. It often happened.”\n“Aren’t you the popular one then?”\n“Just to chit chat. Age and gender didn’t matter. It’s common for staff to chat with the customers in the cozy atmosphere when we have the time.”\nLuckily, it was not the atmosphere of a usual coffee chain. It was a space for calm and peace, one suited for chatting. It was established by the many poised old customers.”\n“It’s interesting to imagine you being popular with the housewives who got nothing to do.”\n“Say…that has nothing to do with this. That’s rude to them. Don’t get any funny ideas.”\n“Feels like there’s really a possibility. It’s a little scary.”\n“You too, Kadowaki…?”\nEt tu?\nSo Amane gave a dumbfounded look, but he saw a more serious look than he imagined,\nthat’s impossible\n, and he hastily insisted.\nIn any case, he had a girlfriend he liked, and pledged his future to her. He could no longer promise any other woman, and believed that he had no interest in them. Surely they would hope Amane would not misunderstand so.\nGoodness…\nAmane sighed, Itsuki shrugged, and looked at the watch on his wrist.\n“Hm, time’s up.”\n“What?”\n“The time to borrow you, you know?”\n“Say, you…”\nIt was true that Amane belonged to Mahiru, but Mahiru was not the possessive kind, and she probably would not be jealous about him hanging out with his male friends. So he thought, “Ahh, yes.” but Kadowaki too noted so,, which left Amane perturbed.\n“It’s past 5, but it gets dark early, and colder. How about we split for now? You got other stuff to do once you get back after all.”\n“Well, yeah…”\n“Alright, dismissed. It’s freezing.”\nItsuki suddenly dismissed them, turned towards the entrance of the park, wanting to leave immediately. However, he then turned back towards Amane.\n“Say Amane.”\n“What?”\n“I got lots of stuff to ask you tomorrow. Prepare yourself.”\nItsuki said something ridiculous out of a sudden, and hurriedly left. While Amane looked dumbfounded, “Same here. See you tomorrow.” Kadowaki too showed a wry look before heading off.\nAmane felt a little conflicted at how he was left behind, and remained confused as he proceeded on his way back.",

      "content": "Amane returned home, and Mahiru welcomed him, as usual.\nThe difference was that she was smiling, her eyes excited, and her smile a lot calmer and gentler. Her slightly blushing cheeks showed her joy.\n“Welcome back, Amane-kun.”\n“I’m back. You’re in a good mood.”\nMahiru’s good mood was really worth celebrating, but Amane had no idea as to why she was so happy. Usually, she would welcome him with a beaming smile, but he had never\nHe did not know the reason, and naturally, was troubled. One had to wonder if she noticed his troubled thoughts, for her smile intensified.\n“…Looks like you never noticed anything the entire day, Amane-kun.”\n“Notice what?”\n“I am speechless that you never noticed what day it is today…it is your birthday today, Amane-kun?”\nMahiru said, looking a little flabbergasted,\nah\n, and Amane blurted out.\n“Goodness, Amane-kun…happy birthday, Amane-kun.”\n“…I forgot about it. I didn’t really pay attention to myself.”\nIt would be weird to say that he recalled once Mahiru said so, but he had completely forgotten about it, and never realized so.\nMahiru did not know his birthday the previous year, and over the past few weeks, Amane had used a lot of brainpower getting used to this unfamiliar workplace, sparing the rest of his efforts on daily muscle training, jogging, and revision. He had completely forgotten about his birthday.\nIn any case, to Amane, his birthday was a milestone, but he was oblivious to it, and did not have any plans to celebrate it. It might be a reason why he forgot.\nHis parents would celebrate this for him back home, but ever since he lived alone, he never thought about it, until this point.\n“It is not insignificant, you know? I am grateful for the day you are born. Without you, I can never really trust and love a single person.”\nMahiru grimaced at Amane’s forgetfulness, and she gently raised his hand.\n“Because of you, I know that love truly exists, Amane-kun, and this is why I am so happy. Your birth is something I am really grateful for.”\nHer eyes were radiating a warm light unlike their initial encounter, and they stared at him.\nThe intertwined hand was warm. It felt as though Mahiru’s passion towards him was contained in this hand, a peaceful, cozy warmth.\n“Thank you very much, for being born. for meeting me.”\nShe was really delighted, her voice and clearly expressed so, and Amane felt his cheeks searing.\nHe learned it was possible for the body to feel hot after being thanked and blessed. It was until his encounter with Mahiru that it was not an annoying feeling, but a different one, a fluffy one.\nAmane was the blessed one to be thought so highly.\n“…I’m the one to be grateful that you think of me so much, and even celebrate this with me.”\nHe did not know how to convey this warmth and the emotions, so he stammered to convey his thanks. Mahiru then said bashfully.\n“I prepared a little feast for you today. Please look forward to it. And, before we eat…there are two things I want to apologize for.”\n“Hm?”\nThings to apologize for? Amane tilted his head, and Mahiru lowered her eyes awkwardly.\n“Erm, you noticed that I have been fidgeting around. I am sorry for causing you unrest.”\n“Ah, that…well, looking at it, it’s obvious. I don’t think you’ll do anything cruel about me. I”m just worried if I did anything bad.”\n“I do not think you would do anything to me. However, I caused you worry because I cannot really hide things…I am sorry for hiding something from you, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru probably wanted to surprise Amane, to prepare for his birthday, which was why she had that attitude. She really could not hide it from him, and felt guilty as a result.\nIt was cute that she was hiding something, and for Amane’s sake. He had no intention to blame her.\n“I don’t mind that…and what’s the other?”\n“Erm…I-I was preparing for your birthday secretly, and everyone seemed to have understood me, so they never said to you all to create this surprise. Actually, I wanted to celebrate this with everyone at school, but because of me, it affected the blessing you should have received on this day, Amane-kun…”\n“Ah so that’s how it is…”\nBoth Itsuki and Chitose knew of his birthday, and they were the type to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Thus, since they never spoke up, it became a big reason as to why Amane forgot about his own birthday.”\nThey did not say anything so as to go along with Mahiru’s plans, and Itsuki’s invite after school was probably to delay Amane.\nThose guys,\nso he muttered, but he knew how gentle his voice sounded at this point.\nHe was at a loss on how to deal with the apologetic Mahiru, so he gently tapped her head while she looked down.\n“Hm, to be honest, I don’t really mind about date, location, or whether I was though. I already forgot everything about it. It’s not that we have to celebrate, today, right? Those guys are being caring for our sake.”\n“But.”\n“I’m not really sure, but they probably think that you planning this birthday celebration will be the biggest happiness I can get, so they teamed up to hide this from me.”\nThe assistance to Mahiru this time was their way of celebrating Amane’s birthday.\nEven if he did not receive their blessings on that day, he did not mind. He already understood that they sent their best wishes towards him.\n“I know I’m really fortunate to have such caring friends around me, and it’s really a blessing. We don’t have to celebrate immediately. I don’t gauge our friendship based on whether they looked for me.”\nThe manner of celebration differed per person. If this was how they would celebrate, Amane felt that was fine.\nHe felt there were no words or things to reliably gauge a person, and the relationships formed were not that shallow. Their goodwill was more than enough\nMahiru looked a little devastated however. Amane showed a wry smile as he gently patted her head, and peered at her face.\n“And it looks like I’ll be surrounded tomorrow…you have me to yourself today, so when they ask tomorrow, I got something to brag, okay?”\n“…Yes.”\nAmane joked with a chuckle, and it seemed Mahiru did not expect so, for she too smiled, and put her face into Amane’s chest.",

      "content": "“…Quite the fancy feast.”\nAmane looked at the dining table, and blurted out his true thoughts.\nIt was a birthday feast, with many dishes on the table, all of of which were foods Amane liked.\nMahiru usually would emphasize on nutritional balance, but this day was different. There were egg dishes laid next to each other, probably due to Amane’s open proclamation of his fondness of eggs. He loved them, and they were nutritious, but it would be bad too indulge excessively. Thus, he would usually be restricted to a day’s worth of serving, but this limit was removed just for this day.\nThe most eye-catching on the dinner table was a beef stew with hard baked omelette rice, which she hardly made, as it was to be prepared since the previous day.\nAlso, there was chawanmushi, potato salad with lots of steamed eggs, boiled pork with eggs. There was sufficient food for an ordinary high school boy, and also various things Amane liked. There were hardly any vegetables, not because he hated them, but that he loved to eat them.\n“I made the dishes you like, Amane-kun, and did not think of the type or nutritional balance. It is fine to indulge once in a while.”\nI shall add more vegetables the next day.\nSo Mahiru said with an elegant giggle. She might have sensed how delighted Amane was, for her face was a little red.\n“Also, we have the dashimaki for tomorrow’s breakfast. I made too much this time, and I feel that it will be more fragrant if I leave it to tomorrow. I shall also prepare the salmon saikyo yaki . Will miso soup with tofu and daikon work?”\n“That’s quite a feast early in the morning…well, it’s already a feast in front of me.”\n“Fufu. Please hurry and eat before it gets go. The meat in the meat stew is still very tender.”\n“Great. The omelette rice of the beef stew is justice.”\nThis favorite dish of Amane was hardly served as it would take too much effort. He wanted to squeal in joy, and contained these emotions in his heart as he clapped his hands together.\nItadakimasu\n, he did not forget to say his thanks, and immediately stuffed the omelette rice of the beef stew into his mouth. He naturally showed a smile.\nThe beef was sufficiently tender to be cut with a spoon, and it did not feel dry when he ate it. It felt very delicious, and on first bite, he knew the meat was of top quality.\nIt had completely absorbed the flavor, and was of perfect harmony with the omelette rice. Amane nodded away conscientiously as he quickly savored the other dishes, not forgetting his etiquette. Mahiru too ate elegantly as she giggled at Amane.\n“…What’s the matter?”\n“Nothing. I feel a sense of accomplishment when you are enjoying the food so much, Amane-kun.”\n“It’s really delicious after all. Of course it’s appropriate for me to say it’s the best thing.”\n“I am content if you think it is the best. Of course, I shall not rest on my laurels.”\nThis stoic Mahiru had Amane smiling wryly, and he continued to dig in, the plates were cleared in an instant.\nThere was quite the variety, but each serving was well controlled, and he was prone to hunger especially after work, so he managed to finish them easily.\nAmane cleaned off the plates nicely, and Mahiru showed a satisfied smile, slowly got up, and put the utensils in the basin.\nAmane wanted to get up and assist her, but “the star of the show should relax”, but Mahiru intimidated him with much gentleness, and so he sat back at his chair dejectedly.\nOnce all the utensils were cleared from the table, Mahiru showed another smile at Amane.\n“There is dessert after dinner. I hope you will enjoy this.”\n“…Is that what you had been practicing?”\n“Yes. I am a little displeased with my efforts, and am still hesitant on presenting so…so I modified the recipe heavily so that you should be able to like it, Amane-kun.”\nSo that would explain why she was worried about getting fat.\nIt seemed Mahiru had been making and tasting. It would depend on the type of sweets, but they typically were high calories, and it would be no wonder that she was worried about high calorie intake.\n“Actually, you can do everything well, Mahiru…though it’s rude for me to say this. I’m glad that you’re giving so much effort for me, but don’t force yourself, you know?”\n“I am not…I just need to exercise a little more after this.”\n“That hard work is the reason why your body hasn’t changed. Really, that self-discipline is amazing.”\n“It is all within the margin of error, and my waistline has not changed significantly. I shall bring it out then..”\nSo she said, and took out a plate from the fridge, probably containing the chocolate cake she personally made.\nAnd with a clank, the plates were served on the table.\nThe cake was already cut into bite slices, and she silently placed them on the other plates.\nHe looked at the object before him, and it probably was gateau chocolate, or more akin to raw chocolate. Appearance-wise, it had a firm and solid impression.\nAfter that, Mahiru added some cream and mint, but it appeared to be a really simple one.\n“I chose to make gateau chocolate. You are not particularly fond of sweets, Amane-kun, so I feel it will be more palatable if you have it with a beverage. I chose milk for this, given the richness of the flavor. It is better if both are eaten together.”\n“If the maker says this is the best way to eat it, I’ll eat it gratefully.”\nMahiru put in so much effort in making this, and surely she would not be wrong. Amane showed no worry as he stabbed the fork into the gateau chocolate while Mahiru watched on.\nAs per its appearance, the cake was taut when he tried to poke at it it.\nNevertheless, it was easy to cut. He took a bite, gently put it into his mouth…and the first thing he tasted was the rich flavor of chocolate.\nThe gateau chocolate was a little more similar to raw chocolate. Put it, it was sticky and gooey.\nYet at the same time, it was different from raw chocolate. He could feel a silky skin in his mouth, and the hardness of the coating was exquisite.\nThe sweetness was controlled, and one could certainly feel the depth and sweetness of the chocolate. One could sense that the chocolate was adjusted to its maximum possible level.\n“…Delicious.”\nHe blurted out what he really thought, and Mahiru heaved a sigh of relief, smiling,\n“It is great that it suits your tastes. I wanted a taste and feeling that is just right.”\n“It’s really great. It’s amazing how you managed to do it this well.”\n“Fufu, I really feel accomplished to have such a reaction. It seemed my efforts were not for naught.”\nShe made a bell-like giggle, and beamed giddily as she saw Amane click his tongue while eating the gateau chocolate.\n“Also, did you notice any other flavor in this?”\nOnce asked, Amane closed his eyes, and focused on his taste buds.\nThere was certainly a rich sweetness, and also a fragrance and bitterness distinct from chocolate.\nIt was a fragrance Amane often scented upon at work recently.\n“Hm…coffee…hmmm? Wait…our shop?”\nThe delicate flavor and rich fragrance heavily resembled the coffee provided at his workplace.\nIt was half a guess, “You are completely correct.” and Mahiru said so with a grin, her hands clapped together.\n“Ah, I have not been there to have a look though? I had Kido-san buy some coffee beans from your workplace, Amane-kun. The owner even helped to blend and ensure the chocolate taste is richer. I really had to thank them lots.”\n“Even Itomaki-san’s an accomplice…well, she’s been grinning a lot recently, now that I think about it…”\nHe did not expect the owner Itomaki-san to get involved. He sensed cold sweat trickling down his heart, and probably would have a hard time during his next shift.\nIt was true however that the coffee was good. Amane heard that freshly grounded coffee was delicious, and he too wanted to buy a coffee machine, but he did not expect to taste it in this manner.\n“Fufu, I merely asked of Kido-san, but news spread before I knew it…and they heartily helped out. Good thing it did not reach your ears, Amane-kun.”\n“Seriously, Mahiru…”\nAmane felt bashful because of how Mahiru toiled relentlessly for his sake.\nHe thought of cutting the gateau chocolate to hide his embarrassment from Mahiru, but she gently stopped him, and snatched the fork from his hand.\nHe lifted his face, and their eyes met as Mahiru gave an alluring smile.\n“We finally have a chance. Shall I feed you? I feel I should be feeding you on your birthday.”\n“Eh, n-no, that’s.”\n“Do not worry about it.”\nMahiru seemed to imply that whatever Amane was tentative about, she would shoo it aside, and she took the gateau chocolate to his mouth. Amane stammered, and obediently ate the cake.\nMahiru knew that he definitely was not unwilling, which was why she did so. The embarrassment stung at him lightly, but he sank in the bliss rising within his body.",

      "content": "Amane was fed by Mahiru, was embarrassed to the point of near-death, and Mahiru continued to beam away as she saw how embarrassed he was.\n“Is it delicious?”\n“…It is, but you don’t have to feed me, right?”\n“It is a must. You are the protagonist after all, Amane-kun.”\n“If anyone else is around, this is a public execution…let’s just keep it to the both of us.”\nIf Itsuki and the others were present, there was no doubt they would tease him like no tomorrow. Otherwise, they might give him warm looks and smiles.\nMahiru was more excited than Amane himself. The outsiders might not mind too much, but he was so embarrassed by the fact that he got fed, he was about to roll on the floor.\nI’ll pay back the favor for Mahiru’s birthday next time,\nAmane resolved himself, and used the milk to wash the mouth that was sweetened by Mahiru in two ways. And then, Mahiru smiled while she took something from the bag next to her.\nIt was a white box, a little larger than her palm, with a navy blue ribbon.\nNo matter how slow he was, he knew what it was at this point of time. He looked at Mahiru, and her smiling face was a little flushed.\n“This is your birthday present. I wonder if it is to your liking.”\nMahiru said with a little lack of confidence, put the box in his hand, and looked up at him, somewhat uneasy.\nIt seemed she was fine with him opening it there and then, and just wanted to see his reaction.\nIt was rare for him to receive a present, so he should open it. He cautiously undid the ribbon, and found a velvet box inside it.\nHe had assumed there would be a present placed inside it, but there was another box inside. He was momentarily taken aback, and surely, inside it would contain the feelings Mahiru wanted to startle Amane with.\nWhat’s inside it? Why so many layers?\nSo Amane wondered as he gently opened the inner box. It seemed to be something―it was something with a mild white gloss, like a clip or something.\nThere seemed to be some flower engraved on it, and for a moment, he did not realize what it was. He remembered it was something he wore at the school festival.\n“……A necktie pin?”\n“That is correct…to be honest, I really wondered what I should give to a boy. I thought of giving a watch, which is more common, but I could not simply give an expensive one, and I was worried you would be too embarrassed to accept it. Everyone has their own likes, and to be honest, I see that you have a watch, which you seem to be rather fond of.”\nThey usually had phones, and Amane did not really wear his watch. The only one he would wear outdoors was the one his parents bought to celebrate his enrollment in high school.\nIt seemed that was a little pricey, and a little unsuited for school. Amane hardly spent time outdoors, so he hardly wore a watch outdoors.\nHe did wear that watch when he went out with Mahiru, and it seemed she remembered.\n“So I thought of an item you will use but usually will not buy. Our school allows us to wear a necktie pin as long as it does not stand out too much, you know? You will also use it when you go out to work.”\nAmane had to wear a necktie pin during a ceremony, but there were no other special restrictions. Most of the boys too did not wear one, for they found it a hassle.\nAmane too hardly wore it, and usually forgot about it. Since Mahiru gave it to him, he might have to wear it everyday.\nIt seemed she chose this for him, hoping that he would wear this every day.\n“I can give you a tie, and you will need quite a few when you go out to work…but for us students, the choice of necktie is fixed, as per the school rules. I shall choose one for you when you get a chance to wear a suit.”\n“…Hmm, thanks. I’ll make sure to wear it well.”\nObviously, the implication without her saying was that they would be together forever. The heat of the joy naturally filled his chest.\nOf course, he already intended so right from the beginning. He felt embarrassed to sense the same feelings from Mahiru, and yet elated.\nI shall treasure this necktie pin along with you forever, Mahiru.\nHe engraved this feeling along with the thought, and smiled at Mahiru, who looked relieved, smiling.\n“That is good. I was worried you would not like it. After all, I know this is not usually a gift to a high school boy.”\n“I’ll be glad to receive whatever you give, Mahiru.”\n“Fufu, I know that, but I feel that I should give you something you need, Amane-kun. You do not have any interest in material items, and you do not lack in anything, so I was really troubled.”\nAmane typically did not have anything he really wanted, which actually bothered her, which caused him to smile wryly.\nHe would not say that he did not have any material desire, and if there was anything, it would be the budget for the thing he swore to buy for Mahiru. He had to struggle for this, and he could not ask her for such an embarrassing thing. He never told Mahiru exactly why he was working, and naturally, he should not inform her of what he wanted.\nIn this sense, Amane truly had nothing he wanted. He hardly had any desire, which troubled her greatly.\n“For me, I’ll like everything you give me.”\n“…Will you be happy if I give you a sweet wrapper too? That is a little scary.”\n“I’ll think you’re planning something, or that the patterns are interesting or cute, and I’ll keep it.”\n“I will not give it for real though!? If that is to happen, I will give you the sweets too!”\n“Alright, I know you’re joking…I’ll be glad with anything as long as it comes with your feelings, Mahiru.”\n“…Goodness.”\nMahiru sounded a little displeased, but her expression was gentle, so she was probably hiding her embarrassment.\nAmane happily looked at Mahiru, gently kept the pin, and swore to wear it starting from the next day. Then, Mahiru timidly tugged at his sleeve.\n“Well, there is another, little present.”\nThe somewhat hesitant tone had Amane tilt his head in confusion.\n“Today, I shall agree to whatever you ask for, from now until the end of the day.”\nOnce Mahiru said this, Amane nearly choked.\nLuckily, he was not drinking the milk. He would have spat it out if there was.\nHe coughed gently a few times, and she turned around, seemingly having resolved herself. It seemed she was serious.\n“…That’s dangerous…”\n“We are dating after all.”\n“Even, so.”\nHe sensed that he had said the same thing before. Either way, it was a dangerous situation when a girl said she would agree to whatever a boy wanted.\nEven as lovers, dangerous things were dangerous.\n“…Should I say you are being considerate, or that you have no desire, Amane-kun?”\n“That’s not it…I can’t. You’re a girl though.”\n“I do not think you will do anything overboard, Amane-kun.”\n“…What if I do?”\n“I shall have you bear responsibility.”\nMahiru shot him an innocent and trustful expression, and he instinctively sensed that he lost. He gently tickled his face, and silently reached his hand towards her.\n“I’ll bear responsibility even if I don’t do anything…you idiot.”\nTruly, Mahiru doted on Amane, and it was a little scary how she would let him do whatever he wanted. Amane was a fine, healthy young man, but his sanity might not last forever.\nBut it shows how much she likes me, I guess?\nHe felt that this level of trust was way too much, and gently hugged her soft body to his side, burying his face into her shoulder.\nHe took a deep breath, and it seemed she had taken a bath beforehand, for he sensed a bath fragrance richer than usual.\nIf I say I want Mahiru, she probably will nod in\nagreement.\nAmane did not intend to disobey his own oath, but he could imagine her nodding in embarrassment. An overly doting girlfriend was terrifying after all, and he might even wreck his self-control.\nA male’s sanity was thinner than paper grass, and would rip upon impact.\nOnce again, he tensed up, and warned himself to be wary. He moved his lips to her cheek, and breathed onto it.\nMahiru then shivered; everyone could tell that she was ticklish and sensitive.\nHowever, he did not intend to show her to anyone. The fact that she was sensitive all over was something only he should know.\nMahiru continued to wriggle in his clutches, but did not resist. Amane smiled, and put his lips by her ear.\n“…Oh yeah, it’s been a while, so how about you be my dakimakura?”\nSince Mahiru wanted Amane to request, he chose one which would allow him to fawn to his heart’s content, without snapping his sanity, and Mahiru in his clutches went beetroot.\nAmane just wanted her to be a dakimakura, nothing more, as the term implied. She however seemed to have some strange delusion.\nAmane did not intend to do what he did the last time he stayed over. He managed to slam the brakes at the last minute, and if anything more, he did not know what would have happened.\n“…That’s what I mean, a dakimakura. What are you thinking?”\n“N-not at all! I am not thinking of anything indecent,”\n“I haven’t said what you’re thinking though.”\nHe did not mention anything more, and she was more flushed than she was before.\nThe completely red-faced Mahiru practically had steam rising out from her, and she looked up at him with teary eyes, before she escaped from his clutches.\n“B-baka, Amane-kun no baka.”\n“I didn’t do anything, right?”\n“Uu…but…this is bullying.”\n“Alright, I admit, I was mischievous, sorry, you’re so cute that I,”\nAmane had the urge to tease Mahiru, for she was fine with being touched, but if he said too much, she definitely would pout.\nThus, he apologized first, and Mahiru stopped showing her displeasure. She ended up hammering lightly at his chest instead.\nShe looked so cute without hiding her blushing face as she vented on him. He smiled as he patted her head, but she did not seem to have recovered, for there were two little balloons on her cheeks.\n“…I-I shall get a change of clothes. Please have a bath first, Amane-kun.”\nThe warm smile on Amane’s face did not change, and Mahiru scampered out of the room. She would be back soon, however.\nAmane was stunned to see Mahiru escape like a bunny, but he then felt a rising urge to dote on her, and he chuckled.",

      "content": "Amane was done with his bath, returned to the living room, and Mahiru, who was not in, had returned.\nShe had changed into her pajamas, the faint pink bunny pajamas she bought the last time. Amane had the kitty version, not a matching type, but he did not expect her to actually wear it on this day and had his usual nightwear on instead.\nThe heart that was usually dangling behind her hair was hung loose behind her ears, hoodie on, unadorned, and she looked really adorable.\nThe last two stayovers, she deliberately chose a negligee and a babydoll dress that were rather skimpy to test Amane’s sanity. This time, it appeared Amane could at ease.\n“…It really suits you. It’s just like you, Mahiru.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\n“Like, you’re little, fluffy, and cute, and it shows how you’re scared of loneliness…”\nIn fact, rabbits were not exactly such creatures, but the impression they had was that they were petite, soft, fluffy, cute, and scared of loneliness. They were basically an embodiment for Mahiru.\nTo be honest, he was praising her, but she appeared to be unhappy.\nMmm,\nshe puffed her cheeks and looked up at Amane, and once she saw that his hair was wet, she frowned harder.\n“I know how you look at me, Amane-kun…but more importantly, did you choose to deliberately not dry your hair because I am around?”\nWhy did you not use the dryer on your hair?\nMahiru pinched at Amane’s hair, reproaching so.\nSo you figured out,\nso Amane showed a wry smile.\nHe would dry his hair properly whenever Mahiru was around, and would occasionally wipe with a towel whenever Mahiru was not too busy, letting Mahiru dry the rest.\nHe knew this would cause her trouble, so this little bit of fawning was truly once in a while. The joy of Mahiru touching him and caring for him prompted him to do so, however.\nChildish it might be, Amane could not change this habit.\n“You’re thinking too much…alright, it’s not. I did it on purpose. I want you to do it for me, Mahiru.”\n“Goodness…but it is fine. I enjoy this, and this is your way of fawning around.”\nMahiru had seen through Amane completely, and Amane felt conflicted, but he was then relieved once she saw how impishly she giggled.\nCome here,\nshe prodded, and so Amane sat on the sofa. Mahiru gave him a bewildered look that betrayed her delighted smile, so he too smiled as he plugged in the dryer.\nThe dryer at home was silent, and the wind warmer than Mahiru’s hair buzzed at him quietly.\nMost of the water was dried off messily with a towel, and Mahiru only had to finish the job and dry off the rest. She continued to warm his hair carefully and even checked on the hair texture, “Good, looks like you did not slack in caring for your hair.” so she muttered.\nWhen Amane last touched Mahiru’s skin, Mahiru said that it would be better for her skin to be a little smoother, so she did care for it well. At the same time, Amane thought she would be happier if his skin was a little smoother when she touched him, so he did care of it somewhat.\nThanks to that, he had smooth hair recently, and it was easier for him to comb through.\n“…But Amane-kun, you had fine hair, to begin with.”\n“Thanks to my parents. They’re thinner and softer though, and get entangled easily.”\n“But it is easier to make them smoother, so that is good now? I think a hair care product as a present might be fine.”\nYou should have made it a little more moist\n, so she said as she dried his hair. She pulled out a comb out of nowhere, and deftly combed the hair that was fluffy due to the air flowing through.\nAnd thus, the hairstyle was just as Mahiru liked it. According to her, she also liked the men’s style which she was used to seeing at school, but at this point, she was calmed.\n“If you want it a little more glossy, I’ll just improve on it then”\n“I-it is not that I like it…I just find it nicer to touch, and more enjoyable to comb through.”\n“I’ll ask Kadowaki and the others if they got any suggestions. If you’re happy, I’m happy.”\nAnd just like that, she ended up touching more often than before. That would be the main objective, but he decided not to mention it for the time being.\nIf Mahiru liked it, it was worth Amane’s effort to care of it, and this probably would improve his confidence, which was a good thing…while he thought about it, Mahiru put the comb onto the table, her forehead onto his arm, and she rolled about.\nThe familiar manner of hiding her embarrassment had Amane chuckling to himself quietly. Whenever she rolled her head about, the ears on her hood would twitch, and Amane was all the more bemused.\n“That bunny there has four pink ears now.”\n“Quiet…I should have you wear one too, Amane-kun. I am a bunny now after all.”\n“So it’ll be a bunny taking care of a cat’s fur.”\n“That is cute, no?”\n“…I’m fine with you being the only cute thing, Mahiru.”\nIf he were careless, the predator and the prey, the cat and rabbit, would end up getting so friendly, and he would have the urge to laugh at that. However, he did not think he would be cute, even if he became a cat.\nCompared to the past, Amane was a little fitter, and the childish vibe on his face was gradually fading away. He lost his cuteness a long time again, and was mystified as to why Mahiru called him cute, but it was merely a sense of personal taste, which he could not do anything about.\nThe redness on her cheeks gradually faded away, and she looked up at Amane. He did not know of this cuteness Mahiru said about him, so he kissed her on the lips, deliberately rattling her.\nShe immediately blinked, and her face turned red. She did not resist, probably because she was so elated. Amane embraced her, and she lost all strength in her body, practically telling Amane to do as he pleased.\nHe gently ate up the alluring lips, and slowly pried apart the peach clams. Mahiru accepted him honestly, and did not resist.\nThere had been a little change to Mahiru recently, that she would invite Amane in, and also do the same things to him. To be honest, she was adorable.\nHe heard this weak sound all to himself, and was delighted that the adorable bunny welcomed the wolf, while shivering.\nHe did not like such a deep kiss, for the brimming passion would have gone overboard. One time he stayed over however, he overdid it and terrified her, so he tried to ensure the kiss was gentle and yet deep.\n“…I should have bought a wolf pajamas instead of a cat.”\nBoth sides silently pulled their lips away from each other, and after a short moment, Mahiru paced her erratic breathing as she murmured begrudgingly. Amane smiled, trying his best not to let the embarrassment from the kiss run amok.\n“In that case, the only cute thing is the little bunny Mahiru.”\n“You bully.”\nMm,\nMahiru pursed her lips that were wetter than before, and this time, she headbutted his arm, expressing her displeasure.\n“…And this is where you’re not cute.”\n“I am not.”\n“You lie. You are so new at this.”\n“Shut up.”\nIt was to be expected, since it was his first time dating.\nAt this point, Amane could barely conceal the embarrassment and nervousness that came with being a couple, but it was to be expected that he was initially not used to it.\nIf that innocence was cute, then he would rather Mahiru have that instead. he did not want the one he liked to see him lose composure.\n“…I shall find a chance to shock you next time. I cannot be losing every time.”\nMahiru pouted unnecessarily, and Amane stuffed her lips again to prevent her ploy from leaking out, savoring the sweet lips.",

      "content": "After a short kiss, Amane accompanied Mahiru into the bedroom.\nMahiru had visited the bedroom a few times already, but she was still a little tense, and her hand holding Amane’s was a little tighter.\nIn turn, Amane smiled as he gently stroked his fingers over her palm to get her to relax, and held it as he led her onto the bed.\nSo Mahiru sat on the bed, shivering away, looking embarrassed, resembling a rabbit who was to be eaten by a wolf.\nOnce he saw how adorable she was, he sheathed back the fangs that were about to be exposed at his prey, sat next to her, and patted her head to coax her.\nHe said he would not do anything, but she was still nervous, probably because it was the bedroom.\n“I’m not going to eat you. Didn’t I say that I’ll have you as a dakimakura today?”\n“I-is that so?”\n“…Are you looking forward to it?”\n“No-not at all! It-it is just that, Amane-kun, you…”\n“Me?”\n“…You look so composed, and so manly. I-it feels embarrassing. Y-you meanie.”\nSo Mahiru fidgeted and shriveled as she looked up at Amane, looking awkward. Amane thought to himself that he did well on the surface, and smiled.\nTruly, he might look composed, but inside, he was not. Rather, he could not be composed simply because he understood her somewhat.\nHe only remained composed, for he knew that if he was too anxious, he would terrify Mahiru. Also, he felt that if he panicked, he would not be manly at all.\n“I told you before that I’m not exactly the most composed. I just want to show you my cool so, so I didn’t look that way.”\n“So will you show it to me if I say I want to have a look?”\n“No.”\n“Meanie.”\n“It’s embarrassing to be blushing and stammering.”\nIt was five months since they started dating, and if he was to blush whenever thy kissed or petted each other, that would be too embarrassing.\nAmane felt that a female would rather he was a reliable person, and that it would be better if Mahiru could be calmed down like this. However, she cautiously pinched the hem of his shirt.\n“…I want to see you as you are Amane-kun. Please take it as my willfulness, please?”\nShe asked softly and uneasily. Amane put his hands on his face, and sighed.\nIt seemed his bravado was unnecessary.\n“…Look, I’m acting cool in front of you because I like you. Please understand.”\nSo Amane embraced Mahiru and pulled her to his side, his forehead on her shoulder. She froze for a moment, and one could hear a soft giggle.\n“You are always cute and cool.”\n“No need for the cute part.”\n“Fufu…I have gained lots then, since I saw both sides to you.”\nHer joyous words left Amane unable to speak. He turned her onto the bed, trying to hide his embarrassment, it seemed.\nHe did it carefully to minimize the impact, and the most he did was to shake her. He did not consider however the shock to Mahiru’s heart, and his action had her blinking furiously in shock.\nShame finally won after Mahiru kept staring at him, so he embraced her tightly, and buried his face into her large lumps.\nThe feeling of the lumps were warm, fluffy and very soft, probably because of the bunny pajamas. The sweet refreshing fragrance of hers was wonderful beyond words.\nAmane might be excited if the vibe Mahiru had was the imagination she was worried yet expectant for, but as she was completely relaxed, he had no real desire to do anything more, and merely sank his body and mind into the comfort and bliss.\nMahiru tensed up, but once she saw that Amane did not do anything, she started patting his head. It felt good.\n“You really like to fawn today too.”\n“…Can’t I do that?”\n“Yes yes.”\nMahiru probably saw that he was embarrassed, and gently let out a delighted giggle\n“You really are bold today, Amane-kun.”\n“I just want to touch you more today.”\n“That is fine, but well…it feels normal. Actually, well…I thought you would be more direct.”\n“No well, I like to touch, and want to know you more, but then again, I feel fulfilled just experiencing your body warmth when I’m next to you.”\nHe lifted his face from the valley, and then embraced her slender body in his clutches.\nAmane never really intended to do what Mahiru imagined, and if that happened every time they stayed over, his sanity would reach his limits. She would accept whatever he did with such overbearing cuteness, and he was scared that he would slowly inch towards the endless desire.\nHowever, he really did not intend to do anything on this day.\nEven boys would not be thinking of doing such things all the time, for living together peacefully with their beloved women would be enough happiness.\nThe satisfaction of the flesh might be quite lacking compared to the direct contact the last time, but the mental satisfaction far surpassed that.\nThe woman he loved to the point of swearing his future with was leaning next to him, her eyes filled with trust and love.\nWhat else could bring about more solace, bliss and satisfaction?\nMahiru showed a fluffy smile, as though agreeing that she was happy to simply be touched by Amane, and clung onto his chest.\n“…I too feel happy to have you by my side, Amane-kun.”\n“That’s good. It’ll be unfair if I’m the only one. This happiness comes far too easy.”\n“I too get happy easily when I am next to you, Amane-kun? Your presence next to me is all I need, but…”\n“But?”\n“I feel happier to touch you.”\nOnce she made such a cute statement, Mahiru looked up at Amane, pleading with her expression.\n“You want to touch? Not to say that you can’t, but I don’t think a guy’s body feels good.”\n“Really? I do like those who do not have much muscle…the belly feels taut when I touch it.”\nOnce she was allowed to, she gingerly stroked her fingers across Amane’s chest and abdomen.\nHe wondered that Kido’s influence was definitely at work, and the ticklish feeling had him wriggling. She was so happy though, so he decided to dote on her and laugh it off\n“I think the muscle training paid off. Can’t say I’m a beansprout now.”\n“I think it is fine. A little firm, not too much excess flesh. You seem sturdier compared to before.”\n“…Don’t mention about the past. I was so weak back then.”\nMahiru’s recollection of the past had Amane embarrassed.\nHis muscles were sturdy at this point, but back then, he had quite the unreliable looking back.\nHe did not have much excess flesh, but that was because he was skinny to begin with, a complete weakling. It was a complete difference from being called healthy. Thinking back about it, Amane really wanted to punch his old self and rally himself together.\nMahiru seemed to prefer Amane’s current body, and he felt that his hard work had paid off. After some training, the trendy clothes would suit him. It seemed his decision to be a worthy match for Mahiru was not for naught.\n“Fufu, but you were really boyish back then. When you carried me, I thought you were a different, starting from the bones.”\n“Well, yeah…you’re small and really bony, Mahiru.”\nHis hard work had allowed him to carry Mahiru’s taut yet soft body. That aside, she was smaller, or in other words, she was just small all over.\n“…Small I may be, but I am sturdier than you imagine, no, Amane-kun?”\n“That’s small too. I think it’s fine if I can just touch you gently. Otherwise I’ll break you.”\n“You never used that much strength before. How can I snap?”\n“But even then…I should treasure the ones important to me, and pay more attention to her.”\nAmane wanted to be a fine gentleman to Mahiru, as much as he could. He wanted to treasure, accompany and protect her for the rest of his life, and this would mean he needed to be more careful than usual, for fear of hurting her.\nHe knew he was overly protective, but Mahiru was still a feeble female, whose strength and tautness was inferior to that of a male’s, and Amane should pay more attention in this regard.\nHe knew that Mahiru did not wish to be coddled, and wanted to respect her free will, while giving her the gentleness she wanted. Also, he would never do anything to make her cry.\nHe made it his life goal to ensure her happiness, and muttered so at her ear. Once she heard that, her face turned redder than Amane’s “Th-thank you very much…” so she whispered.\n“…It is your birthday, Amane-kun, but I feel that my desires are being satisfied.”\n“No, I’m satisfied too, you know? The day just passed.”\nMahiru had satisfied Amane greatly, especially his feelings, and she really did not worry.\nAlso, before she knew it, the day was over. The birthday had just passed.\nIt probably was due to them forgetting the time, cuddling and kiss on the sofa and the bed, for the birthday passed, yet he felt unbridled joy.\n“Really…I-I wanted to fulfill more of our wishes, Amane-kun.”\n“Time really passed quickly. Don’t think whatever I say now can be fulfilled.”\n“Anyway, what do you want to say?”\n“…I want a kiss from you before we sleep, Mahiru.”\nThey kissed back then, but that was Amane kissing Mahiru. The latter, the more flustered of the duo, would hardly take the initiative to do so. She preferred to do so on the lips, but her shame so prevented her from taking that step.\nAnd so, since it was his birthday, he suggested to Mahiru that he wanted her to kiss him, an embarrassing preposition to be heard by anyone else.\nOf course, he knew it was out of character of him, and she looked troubled and dumbfounded for some reason.\n“…You really have no desire, Amane-kun. I thought you would have asked for something more important.”\n“I’m satisfied enough. What more do I want? I have my lover celebrating my birthday next to me, giving me warmth. This is enough. Not that I don’t have desires, just that they are already fulfilled.”\n“…Then I am very greedy.”\n“Mahiru?”\nGreedy was not a word Amane would particularly associate with Mahiru, but she nodded with a serious look, and her eyebrows drooped.\n“I feel lonely whenever you go to work, Amane-kun, and I always yearn for you to return sooner. I was also worried if you will attract other women, Amane-kun. I always think that you are dashing, so what will happen if you are popular with the women. I do not want to disturb your decision, and I am not worried that you will cheat on me, but I do feel uneasy. I do wonder if you will leave me.”\nEven though I do not wish to disturb you, Amane-kun,\nMahiru pinned her face onto Amane’s chest, and muttered so.\n“I do not want you to leave me. I want you to touch me more. I want you to always, always, be by my side…I think I may be too greedy after all.”\nOnce Mahiru expressed her true thoughts, Amane had the urge to smile.\nEvery single sentence showed how much she loved and treasured him. She wished to be by his side forward, and that was how much she was fond of him.\nThat was truly a lovers’ providence.\nMahiru described her possessiveness as greedy. Amane smiled, and embraced her somewhat firmly.\n“…Maybe my love is more than yours, Mahiru. More than you imagine.”\nMahiru said that her love was heavy, but in that case, Amane’s might be heavier. In no way was he intending to let go.\nHe might let her go with bloody tears if that could ensure Mahiru’s happiness, but he would never leave her otherwise. He always toiled to personally present her with happiness.\nHe did not intend to escape his responsibilities by dismissing it as being for Mahiru’s sake. He truly wanted to toil for her sake, to live through every day with such brimming emotions.\n“My family’s always single-minded, and deeply in love. I guess I’m no exception. Maybe you haven’t felt it, Mahiru, but the heaviness isn’t the kind of wanting to bind someone, but to pour emotions into you. I won’t let you go no matter what. I don’t want you to care for anyone else other than me…so sometimes, I worry if you hate me.”\nAmane knew those were some heavy emotions.\nIt would be too rude towards Mahiru if he was to be frivolous, and that was why he dated her seriously, and intended to confess to her with the intention to be together forward. To others, this surely would seem very heavy.\nDespite that, Mahiru smiled happily. Her smile was brimming with happiness and joy.\n“I really am blessed to be loved so greatly. Is it not ideal to have someone unwilling to let go of me, and always look at me?”\n“Huh, really?”\n“Really…I will not let you leave too, Amane-kun, so we are the same. You will not pay attention to others, no?”\nThere was no way, Amane would do what Mahiru said. Once he nodded, Mahiru smiled happily, and inched her body close.\nThe pretty face up close had a bubbly smile.\n“Shall I leave myself to you, and yourself to me, Amane-kun?”\nShe muttered passionately, and they closed the distance.\nFirst, their breaths were intertwined, and then, the gap between them was gone, for they stuck close to each other.\nTheir lips touched, but this mere kiss brought about a fiery heat. The relief and joy formed a sense of comfort, and their hearts naturally seared.\nThe mere seconds of contact brought about a satisfaction different from a deep kiss. Amane exchanged looks with Mahiru, and they smiled.\nSo they continued to look at each other, and there was nothing to worry about.\n“Good night Amane-kun. Have a good dream.”\n“Good night, Mahiru.”\nYou belong to me\n, so she seemed to imply as she leaned on him , smiling sweetly. Amane too answered with a calm smile, and gently closed his eyes.",

When did you wake up?”\n“About ten minutes or so ago. I wanted to lie and relax and see you sleeping soundly, before going to make breakfast.”\n“…Is it fun to look at me?”\n“Of course. It gives me energy.”\nThanks to that, I am energetic in the morning.\nSo Mahiru said with a lively expression, looking completely satisfied. Amane had an unspeakable itch, so he cuddled her to hide this feeling.\nThis sudden embrace took Mahiru by surprise,\ngive me some\nenergy,\nbut Amane muttered so, and she became obedient, wrapping her arms around his back, and embraced him\nThe manner in which Mahiru slowly acted showed that there was still much time, so Amane seized the chance to enjoy her scent, a gentle, warm, refreshing sweet scent.\nYou really do like to fawn about,\nso Mahiru said.\nWhose fault do you think it is?\nAmane wanted to retort, but there was no way Mahiru did not know the answer. He said nothing, and continued to cling onto her.\nSuch a blissful morning caused his eyelids to naturally sink.\nMahiru gently tapped at his back, probably having noticed that his breathing indicated that he was about to sleep.\n“Amane-kun, please do not sleep.”\n“…I want to skip classes like this and keep sleeping.”\n“Is this what the honor student Amane-kun should be saying? Do you really not want to leave the futon? Is this the magic of the futon?”\n“More like the magic of Mahiru.”\nMahiru’s existence was a bigger temptation than the futon, and if he remained unchecked, he might skip school entirely while dragging Mahiru down.\nAnd Mahiru, who had that temptation herself, gently sighed, only to snuggle from Amane’s clutches.\n“I shall leave then, and you will be free from the spell. Now then, get up and clean up.”\n“…I know.”\n“I cannot pamper you in all aspects. Now, please get up and wash your face.”\nThere were times when she should pamper, and times when she should not. Once she saw Amane about to snuggle back into the futon, she pulled the blanket off him.\nAmane intended to get up even if she did not do so, but he could only give a wry smile once he saw how delighted Mahiru looked when she woke up him.\n(I guess it’ll be nice to have her wake me up like this in the future.)\nAmane could wake up punctually if he wanted to, but he felt that since Mahiru would take care of him, it was fine to play around if it was early. He just needed to ensure that he did not cause Mahiru trouble.\nHe did not want to cause her trouble, but it seemed she liked to care for him, so it should be fine for him to fawn around with her.\nHe discreetly thought so to himself, and felt a little cold. He got up from the bed and got a change of clothes.\n“So what about changing clothes? Do I go to the bathroom first?”\n“…Please do. No peeking though?”\n“Who’s peeking? I need approval before I will do that anyway, right?”\nEven as lovers, they had a relationship of innocence, and did not live together. Amane did not intend to see Mahiru get changed. This was a matter of privacy, and more importantly, his sense of shame at this point overwhelmed him.\nIf Amane got changed in Mahiru’s presence, Mahiru might end up shriveling, but the reverse would not be the case. Both sides might be murdered.\n“D-do you want to look?”\n“…I’d be lying if I say I don’t want to look, but I don’t want to ruin your mood, and it’s not good for our sanities early in the morning.\n“Th-that is true…”\n“You don’t have to show me. It’s not like we have to show everything to each other.”\nAs a boy, Amane naturally had an inclination to know, but this was not something he should do at this point. He had to gain approval, and more importantly, they should not be doing so early in the morning, since they would be going to school.\nI know that,\nso Amane shrugged. He was about to leave the room, only to hear Mahiru mutter from behind, “This is a virtue of yours, Amane-kun, and yet a frustrating point…”\nAfter they got changed, they enjoyed the breakfast that was mentioned yesterday, dashimaki, grilled salmon with saikyo sauce, various side dishes, miso soup, and white rice. Amane was done, brushed his teeth, and got ready to go to school.\nHe prepared the textbooks the previous days, and he simply had to put on a tie and a blazer, but his hands stopped as he had a little thought.\n“What is it?”\nMahiru quizzed with intrigue once she saw him remain still, as though brooding. Amane then hesitantly handed over the tie in his hand and pin in his hands to Mahiru.\nThe necktie pin was the birthday present he received the previous day.\nSince he had a chance, Amane hoped to entrust her, who gifted him so, with the first moment of putting it on.\n“Can you put on my tie?”\nHe asked hesitantly, and Mahiru blinked a few times, only to then understand his intent, for she beamed,\nyes,\nand nodded.\nWith a polite gesture, she received the tie and pin, knelt down before Amane who was seated on the sofa, and put the tie on his neck.\nThe method to tie someone else’s tie was different than doing so for oneself, but Mahiru’s process went smoothly. She then picked up the pretty pin with the flower carving, and cautiously, solemnly, put the pin on.\nAmane never wore a pin except during the school ceremonies, but this might be why Mahiru chose this for him, and he did not think anything was amiss.\n“…Does it suit me?”\n“Of course, since I chose it for you, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru smiled with unshakeable belief, and Amane too naturally smiled.\n“You have keen eyes after all. It works out well for you.”\n“Of course. It is important to notice the details in dressing up.”\n“I don’t really need to dress up though, I just want to know if the thing you gave me suits me, Mahiru.”\n“It does, please do not worry.”\nSometimes Mahiru would lavish excessive praise on Amane, but she would usually opinionate on appearances in a subjective manner, so it seemed that was fine.\nThe pin appeared somewhat between the gap of the blazer, but a detail of this level might affect a person’s disposition completely.\nHe was delighted to wear anything Mahiru chose for him, and naturally, his back straightened. Everything might be due to wanting his thoughts, his deeds, to be befitting of standing next to Mahiru.\n“…You really will be dashing once you have some self-confidence, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru giggled as she gently put the blazer onto Amane.\n“And what if I don’t?”\n“Moreso on the cute side. Some coolness though.”\n“Alright, I got lots of things to say, but I’m suave enough now, right?”\n“Yes, very.”\n“…Enough to stand by your side, Mahiru?”\nHe never hesitated about standing next to her.\nHowever, there were times when he doubted, worried if others would think he was unfit for that position. He did not think he would back down just because others thought so, but such a notion would still bother him.\nHe continued to train himself, but he did not know if he could see the effects yet.\nMahiru’s answer was obvious, but Amane had to ask.\nGoodness,\nso Mahiru said with bewilderment and patted his cheek.\n“It is fine. You are dashing both inside and outside, Amane-kun. I will not allow anyone to badmouth you, but my feelings aside, you are a great person.”\n“I see. That’s good…let’s go to school together.”\n“Yes.”\nAmane stood up, reached his hand out, and Mahiru grabbed it without hesitation.\nShe always conveyed her earnest feelings towards him, and because of this, he could stand next to her with his back upright, and hold her hand, moving forward.\nThe changes he had till this point were all thanks to Mahiru.\n（I’m not letting go）\nI’ll make you happy, and never let you go,\nso he swore once again, smiled gently towards Mahiru, and they left the house together.",

      "content": "https://privatter.net/p/7289953\nThe girl Amane worked for, Mahiru, was a perfect young lady.\nShe was the eldest daughter of a family that ran a conglomerate, and was capable of anything. She was an intelligent girl who knew thousands of things, was perspective, and leveraged her comprehension ability and quick wit to expand her knowledge into learning about many different fields,\nBesides academics, she also dabbled in martial arts, and was a top-class athlete in all sports. She was a perfect student with both brains and brawn, her beauty was unparalleled, and it would be appropriate to call her perfect.\nShe was also a warm, gentle and kind-hearted woman, the ideal lady to anyone.\nOr so she appeared,\n“Milady, you can’t. I’m working.”\nAmane and a few servants knew that when she was off the spotlight, she would discard the persona of a perfect lady and act like a spoiled brat.\nThe Master headbutted Amane while he checked her schedule in the notebook, and Amane turned around to tell her off.\nAmane served her ever since she was a child. His parents were indebted to her family, and the arrangement was that he was to serve them as a butler and chamberlain, but he never expected them to be so fond of him.\nIt seemed Amane’s parents sent him to relieve Mahiru’s loneliness, who was always alone due to family reasons, but this was beyond their expectations.\n“…So it is fine when you finish work?”\n“As long as there’s an appropriate distance.”\n“That is fine then.”\n“That is a huge problem.”\nThis interaction and closeness was permitted as they were in the house, but not when others could see them.\nAmane was tempted to sigh and wonder how this happened, but it was probably because he had been taking care of the lonely Mahiru in her parents’ stead while they had been too busy to appear at all, and he resembled an older brother to her.\nThanks to that, or maybe because of the circumstances, Mahiru was extremely close towards Amane. Whenever the two of them were together, she would snuggle up to him and fawn around.\nMahiru was old enough to get married at this point, so he tried to pull his distance from her since this distance would be inappropriate, but he could not bring himself to do so as Mahiru showed him a teary face, so the closeness remained.\nAmane immediately rejected the idea, and Mahiru hammered him on the back, but it did not matter as he looked down at his notebook, as usual.\n“Starting at 4pm today, you’ll be having Ikebana lessons, and once that’s over, gym as usual, and once we return home, you’ll have a bath, and then dinner. There won’t be any plans after that, so you’ll have free time.”\n“…Does this free time mean that your work ends, Amane-kun?”\n“Well.”\n“Then, shall we have tea together?”\nA sloppy-looking Mahiru clung onto his back, and he felt nostalgic for some reason. “Well, about that,” he answered tentatively, and she continued to do so, happily.\nAmane wanted to say that a fine lady should not touch the opposite sex without permission, but she looked so happy behind him, that he bit his lips, acted calm, and rolled the notebook to hide his emotions.",

      "content": "“…By the looks of it, you had a good time yesterday.”\nIt was the day after Amane’s birthday, and he got teased by Itsuki at school.\nIt appeared Mahiru had some matter to deal with at the staff room, so Amane entered the classroom alone, only to be welcomed by a smirking Itsuki. Incidentally, Chitose hadn’t arrived at school yet.\n“Don’t make it sound like there’s something else to that. It’s just a normal celebration.”\n“Again with that?”\n“Seriously, you.”\n“Just joking. Well, glad to hear that Shiina-san’s preparations went well.”\nItsuki patted Amane on the shoulder to calm him down, and nodded as though he had seen through everything. Amane couldn’t reproach him for anything, so he grumbled a little, and sighed.\n“…Thanks for helping out Mahiru.”\n“Well, I didn’t do anything at all. If anything, Chii and Kido-san were the ones who chipped in more, like advice or help and such.”\n“And you helped cover up for them. Thanks for that.”\n“Well, it’s a rare chance for a surprise anyway. Looks like you really enjoyed your birthday, and that’s great. Anyway, happy birthday.”\nItsuki, the most caring person, smiled and patted him on the shoulder again as if it was nothing. Amane bit his lips that were losing control due to joy and embarrassment, “…Yeah.” and replied softly.\nLater, he would have to thank Chitose who had yet to arrive. It was likely Mahiru had consulted with her quite a bit.\nHe was really overjoyed in many ways that he had a friend willing to celebrate his birthday, but a classmate, upon hearing that, suddenly came over,\n“Eh, it’s Fujimiya-kun’s birthday?”\n“Actually, it’s yesterday.”\nOnce Itsuki affirmed, “Eh~!?” the classmate squealed loudly and stared at Amane.\n“Why didn’t you say so? Shiina-san and the others didn’t say anything. I didn’t know at all!”\n“Well, it was a surprise or something.…”\n“I see. But it’s just weird that they didn’t tell us…I don’t have anything with me today…is juice fine?”\n“I’ll give you this candy then. It’s limited edition.”\n“Don’t do it. That’s a bad idea.”\n“What’s wrong with you!? This wonderful taste is addictive!”\n“Your taste buds are wonky.”\nAmane was very perturbed by the classmates who seemed to have overheard, and Itsuki just smiled and whispered, “They’re all friendly, just accept them.”\nEver since he decided to change himself before everyone, Amane felt that he had become a little closer to his classmates…but it was the first time they openly went up to congratulate him, and his heart felt warm and fuzzy.\nIf he had remained clammed up and avoided getting involved with people, he wouldn’t be surrounded by people like this now.\n“…Erm, thanks everyone. I’m really glad.”\nThe classmates around Amane smiled brightly as he thanked them in a voice that couldn’t hide his embarrassment, and once again, he muttered a small “thank you”.",

      "content": "“…You have become popular before I even realized, Amane-kun.”\nMahiru returned to the classroom after she was done with her task, and was shocked and delighted to see their classmates celebrate Amane’s birthday.\nIt was to be expected however, since Amane usually would not be surrounded by so many. Their classmates were simply celebrating his birthday, and it was not actually a matter of him being popular.\n“Ah, good morning Shiina-san. Don’t worry, I won’t be stealing Fujimiya-kun.”\n“I-I am not worried about that. I am just shocked to see him surrounded by everyone.”\n“Well, I guess if Amane’s surrounded, that shows that it’s only possible when he’s dating Mahirun. That shocked me too.”\nChitose, who arrived at the classroom alongside Mahiru, widened her eyes as well. Once she met Amane in the eyes, she showed a mischievous leer.\n“The old Amane would be completely flabbergasted.”\n“Yeah, I’d be speechless.”\nAmane admitted to the past gloomy vibe he used to have that was completely different from this point. The old Amane might not be able to handle this present him.\nBut Amane did not hate his present self.\nHe put in the proper effortso that he could stand next to his beloved. Though his sense of inferiority did not disappear, it was somewhat mitigated. The most accurate description of him would be that he was more accepting of himself.\nHaving experienced firsthand the undeniable fact that love changes people, Amane felt embarrassed, bitter and nostalgic as he thought of his past self.\nHe gulped, showed a faint smile “You’re more relaxed now, huh.” and Chitose giggled.\n“I guess this is a positive example of how loving someone changes a person.”\n“Shut up. Is that bad?”\n“Unya, I think it’s good though? It’s not like your old self is bad or something, but aren’t you happier now, Amane?”\nChitose grinned away as she put her index fingers at her cheeks, indicating that Amane often smiled nowadays, and the latter could not help but facepalm. He glanced aside at Mahiru, who nodded with a gentle smile, the shock from before nary to be seen.\n“You are gentler compared to before, no?”\n“Yeah. That stare is different. It wasn’t as obvious as when he saw you, Shiina-san.”\n“He’s so head over heels for that Shiina-san. Doting on her even.”\n“I think the Angel has become more dere nowadays.”\n“…I get it, stop looking at me. I’m aware that I’m too doting on Mahiru.”\nAmane’s expression would relax whenever he faced Mahiru, and while he did try to keep his guard up, his classmates clearly had paid attention. he could hear boys and girls chiming in agreement.\nAmane started to feel awkward again when this was pointed out, and when the ends of his lips started to tickle, “Okay, this is enough. Otherwise, Amane will start to pout.” Chitose clapped and changed the mood.\nYou should have said so from the beginning,\nAmane thought so, but Chitose was probably celebrating Amane’s birthday in her own way. She giggled, and took out a wrapped box from her bag.\n“So, here’s a present from Ikkun and me that’s a day late.!”\n“…Seriously, thank you for setting this up together with Mahiru for my sake.”\n“Ufufu, I’m Mahirun’s one true friend after all~ Of course I’ll help with whatever my adorable friend is planning. For~ you~”\nChitose sounded more elated than usual as she handed over the box, which was heavier than Amane had assumed.\nSince it was a present chosen by Itsuki and Chitose, there should not be any problems. Of course, Amane would be delighted unless the present was too tasteless. They had fine taste, so the present chosen should not cause worry, but the plain weight had him looking mystified.\n“…Let me ask first. What’s inside this?”\n“Yaa, you’re asking now? I can say what it is though?”\nAmane glanced aside at Mahiru, and found himself suddenly uneasy.\n“Oy, what’s with the meaning in those words?”\n“Ahaha, just kidding. It’s not anything dangerous, just some bath powder and salts. One of them is what Mahiru likes, and the other is said to be good for metabolism. I thought the two of you can use it.”\n“…Why for the two of us? Isn’t it usually for one?”\nThe item itself was good, but the unnecessary line itself had Amane frowning.\nThere was some skinship, but their current relationship remained pure. It would be real troublesome if everyone assumed the two of them bathed together. While that did happen before, they would wear a swimsuit or have towels draped over them, and it did not happen during every stayover.\nWon’t this cause misunderstanding?\nAmane glared back, “Ehh~” and Chitose unhappily pouted back. Amane had the urge to pinch her cheeks, but he held back.\n“Say, won’t this cause misunderstandings?”\n“We have a real coward here.”\n“Shut up Itsuki.”\n“Hey hey…well, even if I do keep quiet about this, everyone knows about your feelings…oowww, I get it..”\nAmane rubbed his fist at the flank of the approaching Itsuki, but it felt hard, and he felt like he lost out. Since he got Itsuki to shut up, Amane let out a deep sigh.\n“I’m really grateful for the present, and your feelings, but just don’t say anything unnecessary.”\nSo he said as he tried to preserve his cheeks that were overheating with shame as he earnestly brought the present to his seat. And then, Itsuki pretentiously put his hands on his own hips, and retorted,\n“Say Amane.”\nOnce they left the crowd, Itsuki put his mouth gently near Amane’s ear.\n“What?”\n“I never mentioned that you two are going to bathe together. The idea is that you two would bathe individually.”\n“…Shut up.”\n“I already kept my voice down though!?”\nAmane realized that he dug himself a hole, so he pursed his lips and looked elsewhere. Itsuki in turn gave a hearty laugh, and giddily slapped Amane on the back.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!",
